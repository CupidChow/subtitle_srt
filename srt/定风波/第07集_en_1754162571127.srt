1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
God of We Christmas

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,680
Princess Fook, Greenкоat, scream

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,260
uuuurrr

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,480
tight

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,760
tight

6
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,240
There are soldiers

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,800
She doesn't seem to be helping her brother at all.

8
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:54,640
Remove the

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,760
No, I didn't mean it

10
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,480
If you want ό

11
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
I'll take you

12
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
Still have

13
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
I just brought her

14
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Those are all

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
I want it too.

16
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,300
Wait for the necklace to fall off.

17
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,680
Give it to me.

18
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,920
Si Huai trying to make

19
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,880
it.

20
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,980
Flying.

21
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
Episode 16

22
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,220
After this cup of tea,

23
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,980
I'll leave with you.

24
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,820
Sit down.

25
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,980
Green tea from Nan Yue.

26
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,460
Good taste.

27
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,620
I brought this from Nan Yue.

28
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,660
Did you commit so many murders

29
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,980
to avenge me?

30
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,460
If it wasn't for me,

31
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,740
I wouldn't use the Wind Sand Tree.

32
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,060
You would never have seen through me.

33
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,900
And you, Xiao Bei Ming,

34
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,900
would always be

35
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,620
the evil Night Slaughter.

36
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,420
Xiao Fu is your wife?

37
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,660
Xiao Fu is from Nan Yue.

38
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,980
He only knows that I'm a thug.

39
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,980
The first time I saw him

40
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,220
was when I was handling a case in Nan Ren Xiang.

41
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,660
After that,

42
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,940
I couldn't forget him for a long time.

43
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,060
Then,

44
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,660
I went to Nan Ren Xiang to look for him.

45
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,820
He told me

46
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,580
that the first time he saw me,

47
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,860
he thought I was a good person.

48
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
Then we became a couple.

49
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
We have no relatives or enemies in this world.

50
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,140
Only Heaven and Earth

51
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,980
are the ones who are the best for us.

52
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,180
That was the happiest day of my life.

53
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,580
From that moment on,

54
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,660
I didn't want to kill anyone.

55
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,820
I just wanted to be

56
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,060
a simple and happy man.

57
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,140
I wanted to be Xiao Fu's husband.

58
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,820
I wanted to be the father of the child.

59
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,380
The days I spent with him,

60
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,340
I seemed to forget all the pain.

61
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,140
I even forgot my hands.

62
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,820
I used to be full of blood.

63
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,020
But two months ago,

64
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,380
when I was handling a case,

65
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,580
it was all done by that A Ji Ya.

66
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,300
Take her back!

67
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,960
Mix She 1970

68
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,940
Ai Jia, Hu Shi San,

69
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,900
The four scoundrels and the King of Qin

70
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,860
killed my wife and my child.

71
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,180
I must make them pay.

72
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,820
So,

73
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,380
I'm going to kill

74
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,820
the one who killed the King of Qin.

75
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
What's lucky is

76
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,780
that three years have passed

77
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,500
and I'm not as good as my uncle.

78
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,100
You have a thousand ways

79
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
to kill them.

80
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,660
Why did you choose Feng Shui...

81
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,740
Because Feng Sha is the most painful death.

82
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,820
I must make them

83
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,380
get the most cruel punishment.

84
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,820
I don't care about my own life.

85
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,340
It's because of Xiao Fu

86
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,980
and my unborn child

87
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,100
that I have a desire to live.

88
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,660
I know you two

89
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,260
must have a lot of problems.

90
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Three years ago,

91
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,460
you lost everything overnight.

92
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,860
I didn't know what it felt like before.

93
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,580
Now I finally feel the pain.

94
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,460
Now you can ask.

95
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,060
I'll tell you everything I know.

96
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,020
The Feng Bo Lake case three years ago,

97
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,500
was it you who killed him?

98
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,020
Yes.

99
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,420
You killed my father too.

100
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,700
I killed Zhong Yun Zhi myself.

101
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,740
Such a good tea

102
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,500
is a pity if I don't finish it.

103
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,660
Why did you do that?

104
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,380
It's my order.

105
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,820
You were the one who killed him.

106
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,060
You ambushed them in advance.

107
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,620
After they were unconscious,

108
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,220
you killed them.

109
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

110
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,620
I ambushed them under the deck for a long time.

111
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,380
I came out

112
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,700
until there was no movement on the boat.

113
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,020
When I got on the boat,

114
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,300
I found that five people were poisoned and fainted.

115
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,020
They couldn't move at all.

116
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,900
So I used all my energy

117
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,660
to kill them one by one.

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,820
Why didn't you kill me?

119
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,980
I mean,

120
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
I'll spare your life.

121
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,180
There's one more thing you should remember.

122
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,140
Not everyone is killed.

123
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,700
Liu Xiao Bei is alive.

124
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,300
Who is Ye Sha?

125
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
If I tell you,

126
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,580
I've never seen him, will you believe me?

127
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,900
How did he give you the order?

128
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,740
How did he contact you?

129
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,660
He has a million ways to find me.

130
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,740
He is a rare talent.

131
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,060
But he always has a dark side.

132
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,460
The bloodshed case three years ago

133
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,060
was carried out by me.

134
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,300
But the process of killing was designed by him.

135
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,420
Such a clever way of making a case

136
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,660
is not comparable to ordinary people.

137
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,660
Then he is a man, a woman, a teacher, a young man.

138
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,580
There must be a difference.

139
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,460
Judging from the body shape, voice and body shape,

140
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,540
he should be a middle-aged man.

141
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,620
Middle-aged man?

142
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,020
But he may be dead.

143
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,500
What do you mean?

144
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,460
That day when I was under the cover of the cover,

145
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,980
I heard his voice on the boat.

146
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,980
Although everyone here is suspicious,

147
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,540
Ye Sha is the only one.

148
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,660
What I saw today

149
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,260
is a proof of Miao's speculation.

150
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,260
Miao Tianguan, what do you want to say?

151
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,980
Mr. Miao, don't make things

152
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,460
so messy.

153
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,300
But I can't tell who it is.

154
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,380
If he was really on that boat,

155
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,020
he may have been killed by me.

156
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,660
How is that possible?

157
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,860
Why would Ye Sha send someone to kill himself?

158
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,980
He never follows the rules.

159
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,660
So I don't think it's strange what he does.

160
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,260
After the storm,

161
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,660
you never saw him again?

162
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,140
Ye Sha gave me two orders that day.

163
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,500
One, to kill him.

164
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,020
Two,

165
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,300
after the matter was done,

166
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,060
you said you would sneak into the God's Camp

167
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,860
to find out where Shen Bi is.

168
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,340
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

169
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,700
As long as I find him,

170
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,260
I won't let him live.

171
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,940
Then I tried to sneak into the God's Camp,

172
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,700
but I never found where Shen Bi is.

173
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,540
I heard he was the one who ordered

174
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,380
the departure of the capital after the storm.

175
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,660
I think he was protected by the Dark camp.

176
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,540
I never saw him again since then.

177
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,580
And I never received Ye Sha's order.

178
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,460
Has Ye Sha really died?

179
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,100
I've said everything I should.

180
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,580
Let's go.

181
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,500
God's Insertion

182
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,980
By the way,

183
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,540
there's another thing I forgot to tell you.

184
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,580
Do you know the meaning of the word night kill?

185
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,580
You mean, the ocean?

186
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
The ocean?

187
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
Zhong Yun Chi,

188
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
how long are you going to disguise yourself?

189
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,580
The King of Zhong Bu has always been particular about the law and the law.

190
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
He never does anything illegal.

191
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
But today, without any evidence,

192
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
he led us to the ship and set a trap.

193
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:22,100
Is this the law of the King of Zhong Bu's

194
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,580
I'm right.

195
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
King of Zhong Bu, Zhong Yun Chi,

196
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,580
I should call you Night Kill.

197
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Don't talk nonsense.

198
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,580
My master asked all the ministers to board the ship

199
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,580
just to investigate the true identity of Night Kill.

200
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Never thought of framing and framing.

201
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
It won't harm anyone.

202
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,580
Mr. Miao,

203
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
don't make things

204
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,580
so that there is no way to clean up.

205
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,580
What do you know?

206
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,580
It seems that you have found some things in the past three years.

207
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
I am a person from the ocean.

208
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
I am an orphan of the ocean,

209
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
a survivor of the ocean.

210
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,580
Where is the ocean?

211
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
What happened in the past?

212
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,580
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

213
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,580
Then I'll tell you another story.

214
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
What story?

215
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,580
What do you want to say?

216
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Just wait and see.

217
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
You'll know when you're done.

218
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,580
You'll know when you're done.

219
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,580
A long time ago,

220
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
on the border of my country,

221
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,580
there was a small town called Haiya.

222
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,580
There were few people in the area of Haiya City.

223
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Only a few thousand people.

224
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,580
But they lived peacefully and freely.

225
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
Suddenly, one day,

226
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,580
a strange thing happened in Haiya City.

227
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,580
A group of monsters broke into Haiya City.

228
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,580
These monsters were extremely fierce and cruel.

229
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,580
They were able to cut through the fire.

230
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
In one night,

231
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
thousands of people were killed.

232
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
From then on,

233
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Haiya City disappeared into the middle of the earth.

234
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,580
It became a folk legend.

235
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
What do you want to say

236
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
in this East and West?

237
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
The real meaning of the word wild kill

238
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,580
is the name of the monster and demon

239
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
who broke into Haiya City.

240
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
A small town

241
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,580
was killed in one night.

242
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Sometimes, people are more terrible

243
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
than ghosts.

244
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
You mean someone broke into Haiya City?

245
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,580
In fact, there are no ghosts in this world.

246
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Everything is human.

247
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Not only did they break into the city,

248
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,580
they even maliciously accused

249
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,580
that the wild kill was a ghost who broke into Haiya City.

250
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
But I can tell you

251
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
that in fact, every survivor of Haiya City

252
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
is a wild kill.

253
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
As long as there is a survivor

254
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
and a breath of air,

255
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
the wild kill will appear without any sign.

256
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
Including you,

257
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Xiao Beining.

258
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Zhong Bu,

259
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
I think the Ministry of Vastity doesn't know

260
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
that you actually know the real meaning

261
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
of the word wild kill.

262
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
You didn't tell him

263
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
because you were afraid that

264
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
he would know what you did back then.

265
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Yes.

266
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Wild kill,

267
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
you still don't admit your crime.

268
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,580
You still want me to continue talking?

269
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
What do you mean?

270
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
You think you can get rid of your injustice

271
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,580
by catching me?

272
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
As Xiao Fu's husband,

273
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
my wish has been fulfilled.

274
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
But as a Haiya person,

275
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
I can do one last thing.

276
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Where is Haiya?

277
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,580
What happened back then?

278
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,580
As long as I die,

279
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,580
you are still a wild kill.

280
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
You have to keep going down this road.

281
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,580
The more you go down, the darker it gets.

282
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
Until you reach the end of the road,

283
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
you will be like a wild kill.

284
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,580
You will never be able to survive.

285
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Yes.

286
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Zhu Yitian.

287
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Zhu Yitian.

288
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,580
Zhu Yitian.

289
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,580
No.

290
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,580
How could you bury Zhu Bukai and Xiao Fu together?

291
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Zhu Bukai was the murderer of the interview.

292
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
You should have brought his body back to the Shen Bu Camp

293
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
so that you can prove his innocence.

294
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,580
Zhu Yitian is dead.

295
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
There is no evidence.

296
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
Who will believe that

297
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,580
we are just talking nonsense?

298
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
The wounds on Zhu Yitian's body

299
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
can't prove it.

300
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Everyone will only think

301
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
that I was the one who went to Feng Sha to get his wounds.

302
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
But the injustice on you

303
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
still can't be cleared.

304
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
At least,

305
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
you believe me, right?

306
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Believe?

307
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
I believed it a long time ago.

308
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
It's not his fault.

309
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
Dad.

310
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
What is this?

311
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
This is your dowry.

312
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
I have all the land

313
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
and land assets of the land shops in the house.

314
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,580
They all exist in the money house.

315
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
This paper is my surname.

316
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Dad.

317
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Why are you giving me this now?

318
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
After we get married,

319
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
we will still live with you.

320
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,580
You can take it. I can take it.

321
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
It's all the same.

322
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Silly child.

323
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Just take it.

324
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,580
A girl

325
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
will have the land

326
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
when she has money.

327
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
But

328
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
you're still my wife.

329
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Yicheng.

330
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Are you worried about dad?

331
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,580
I always feel something wrong.

332
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
What's wrong?

333
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
I've been working with Master for many years.

334
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,580
No matter how cruel the opponent is,

335
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
or how dangerous the situation is,

336
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
Master is calm and easygoing.

337
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
But I've never seen

338
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
him so serious yesterday.

339
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
He seems to be

340
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,180
I think something is wrong with my father.

341
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,500
He handed me this ring yesterday.

342
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,020
He said it was a dowry.

343
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,580
But it looks more like a entrustment.

344
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,780
Do you think my father

345
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,420
is Yesha?

346
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,460
Zhu Yitie said Yesha was on the boat.

347
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,460
And the order he gave him

348
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,620
was to keep you alive.

349
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,660
I remember very clearly

350
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,380
that my father was trying hard to stop you from getting on the boat.

351
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,500
And after getting on the boat,

352
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,260
he could have been kind and spared your life.

353
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,140
Who else could it be except my father?

354
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,300
I've been looking into this for three years.

355
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,220
I fainted on the boat of Fengbo Lake.

356
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,180
Yesha.

357
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,380
You still don't admit your crime?

358
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,260
At that moment, I saw my master's eyes.

359
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,620
I've never seen a master like that.

360
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,060
He was so angry, so crazy, so out of control.

361
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,380
I just wanted to stop him.

362
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,980
But I passed out.

363
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,220
You've been suspicious of my father, haven't you?

364
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,020
I've always wanted to prove that my master wasn't Yesha.

365
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,380
I ran away three years ago.

366
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,180
The only clue I had to find out about Yesha

367
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,260
was the shore.

368
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,900
There is indeed a place called the shore.

369
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,300
I'm not sure where exactly it is.

370
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,060
I'm afraid no one knows.

371
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,340
I only heard that the shore

372
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,700
is somewhere on the border.

373
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,460
Miao Jie mentioned the shore.

374
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,820
Judging from my master's reaction,

375
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,460
he must know the shore.

376
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
If Yesha really has something to do with the shore,

377
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,700
then if we find the shore,

378
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,580
we can find the clue to Yesha.

379
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,460
Naturally, we can verify

380
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,220
whether my master is Yesha.

381
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,780
But I advise you not to go looking for him.

382
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,580
Why?

383
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,300
Because even if you find it,

384
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,340
it's useless.

385
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,020
Master, what do you mean?

386
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,580
The people there have long been dead.

387
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
These three years,

388
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,980
I've looked through all the documents and maps I could find.

389
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,380
But there is no record of any shore.

390
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,020
Miao Jie said that the shore is a small town.

391
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,700
So for the past three years,

392
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,820
I've searched the borders of the Qi State.

393
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,420
It's said that there was a demon in the city of the shore.

394
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,700
I've seen the demon.

395
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,500
The people in the city of the shore

396
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,660
were killed by the demon overnight.

397
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,340
It even shocked the soldiers.

398
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,700
They said that the demon was going to cause trouble

399
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,660
and asked us to hide for a few days at home.

400
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,620
But it's okay.

401
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,500
After so many years,

402
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,020
no one dared to go to the city of the shore.

403
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,980
Master,

404
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,660
do you know when this happened?

405
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,940
It's been 36 years.

406
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,700
Although I know the direction of the city of the shore,

407
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
there are mountains all over the city.

408
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,700
I haven't found the exact location.

409
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,060
From the testimony of Zhu Yitie,

410
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,580
it's said that the people killed by the demon

411
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,300
were revenge for the shore.

412
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,460
But we don't know

413
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,820
what those people who were assassinated

414
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,420
did back then.

415
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,940
Don't worry.

416
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,140
Although there are many mysteries that haven't been solved,

417
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,340
I don't believe that

418
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,460
the master who spent his whole life with us

419
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,940
and lived a good life

420
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,780
is...

421
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,460
If it's hard to solve,

422
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,380
there's no need to say more.

423
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,820
I'll burn the sword and be passionate for half a lifetime

424
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,100
without asking about tomorrow.

425
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,980
A promise made in the past,

426
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,980
don't look back, don't regret it.

427
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,940
It's raining.

428
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,580
Let's go back.

429
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,780
I'll burn the sword and be passionate for half a lifetime

430
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,260
without regretting it.

431
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,380
I know what you're thinking.

432
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,580
You're blaming yourself for what you did to me before,

433
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,820
right?

434
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,980
Why didn't I believe you earlier?

435
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,700
If I had believed you earlier, I would...

436
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,100
I never blamed you.

437
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,340
Instead, I want to thank you

438
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,940
for saving my life

439
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,580
and giving me the last chance.

440
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,380
I know

441
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,020
you'll pull me out

442
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,580
on the yellow rattan on the Yellow River that day.

443
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,500
And,

444
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,220
if it wasn't for you,

445
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,380
I wouldn't have been able to find Zhu Yiting

446
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,180
and wouldn't have been able to get to where I am today.

447
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,700
But you have a lot of hands on you.

448
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,620
It's not your fault.

449
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,140
It's not Feng Qin Zhuo's fault.

450
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,220
You just did what you should have done.

451
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,740
If it were me,

452
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,500
I would have done the same.

453
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,460
But...

454
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,140
Junior,

455
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,180
I'm not the one who did it.

456
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,460
Zirui,

457
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,300
you did it.

458
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,900
Isn't thatüşary not doing it?

459
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,220
That's tiring.

460
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,260
rotating

461
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,860
Hitting and motivate

462
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,340
and incentives

463
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,300
That's really tiring.

464
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,060
Just do it,

465
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,900
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm sorry.

467
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,700
I'm sorry.

468
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I'm sorry.

469
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
I'm sorry.

470
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm sorry.

471
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
I'm sorry.

472
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
I'm sorry.

473
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
I'm sorry.

474
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm sorry.

476
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
I'm sorry.

477
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm sorry.

479
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
I'm sorry.

482
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I'm sorry.

484
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
I'm sorry.

485
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm sorry.

486
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
I'm sorry.

487
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
I'm sorry.

488
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
I'm sorry.

489
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
I'm sorry.

490
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
I'm sorry.

491
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
I'm sorry.

492
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
I'm sorry.

493
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm sorry.

494
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
I'm sorry.

495
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
I'm sorry.

496
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
I'm sorry.

497
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
I'm sorry.

499
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
I'm sorry.

500
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
I'm sorry.

502
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
I'm sorry.

503
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
I'm sorry.

504
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
I'm sorry.

505
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm sorry.

509
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
I'm sorry.

510
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
I'm sorry.

511
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
I'm sorry.

512
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

513
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
I'm sorry.

515
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm sorry.

516
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
I'm sorry.

517
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,580
WASTE

518
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,660
Keep looking for well

519
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,700
Do you want to see dead people, improve and improvements

520
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:18,940
We can almost find them

521
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,940
A secret descending from the hell

522
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:40,980
While we still have the chance to see semen

523
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
I don't agree.

524
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,860
Although Feng's case didn't prove you innocent,

525
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,820
Shen Buying and the Dark Battalion all thought you were dead.

526
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,260
So you're safe for now.

527
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,780
But you...

528
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,140
My safety is not important.

529
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,420
If the tragedy of the bloodshed case three years ago

530
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,580
was the revenge of Ye Sha against some senior officials,

531
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,020
then the living Shen Daren

532
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,940
must know what happened at the sea.

533
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,620
Shen Daren went home at the time of the incident

534
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,260
and never heard from him again.

535
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
The Dark Battalion?

536
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,260
But it's too dangerous.

537
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,820
They all know you're Ye Sha.

538
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,900
If they find you,

539
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,700
there will be endless danger coming for you.

540
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,980
Yes.

541
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,860
You still have the cold poison.

542
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,780
I have the cold poison,

543
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,820
so I have to do this.

544
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,220
Shen,

545
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,100
you don't have much time left.

546
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,740
You can't live or die.

547
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,340
Father,

548
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,420
based on my understanding of Xia Beiming,

549
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,980
I still can't believe

550
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,340
Ye Sha's case

551
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,060
will end in this way.

552
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,540
The key is how to report to His Majesty.

553
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,220
Chief.

554
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,020
Master.

555
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,900
Ye...

556
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,740
Ye Sha has appeared again.

557
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,180
It was the housekeeper of Shen Bu who found it.

558
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,780
He reported it to An Zhen Yi immediately.

559
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,980
But what's the clue?

560
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,340
There's no hidden weapon.

561
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,580
There's no clue.

562
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,140
Shen Bu, do you have a net?

563
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,420
No net.

564
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,540
I knew skills are everywhere.

565
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,740
I knew that even the shell

566
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,540
on Shen Bu'srepając could take 스뫠uyuan out.

567
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,580
Yes.

568
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,380
Li Long.

569
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,500
Take your partner and go to Chunyu Town immediately.

570
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,340
Yes.

571
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,580
Wait.

572
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,540
Father,

573
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,820
Yibang has the.

574
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,820
I'm afraid he's not worth anything to us.

575
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,220
I'm afraid he said something before he died.

576
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,420
Just say it.

577
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,620
Let him say everything he knows.

578
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,820
He insisted on seeing the truth.

579
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,620
Then we'll just let him see the truth.

580
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,620
I'm afraid he's not worth anything to us.

581
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,620
I'm afraid he's not worth anything to us.

582
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,620
I'm afraid he's not worth anything to us.

583
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,420
If he insists on seeing the truth,

584
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,820
then we'll just let him see the truth.

585
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,620
Let the whole Qi see the truth.

586
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Success or failure, it's up to fate.

587
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,420
The ancient and modern way.

588
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,620
Then, the knowledge of the cake must be direct.

589
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,420
The light and weak must be self-sufficient.

590
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,420
The weak must be self-sufficient.

591
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,420
This is the art of the military man.

592
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I, Shen Bi, greet Your Majesty.

593
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
Lord Shen.

594
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,620
Lord Shen, are you all right?

595
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Thank you, Your Majesty. I'm fine.

596
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
Sir, sir.

597
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,620
There's a horse rider outside looking for you.

598
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,620
Li Long, the secret agent, greets you, Sir.

599
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Sir, I have something important to tell you.

600
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
I've long been a minister.

601
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,620
I've lost my official post.

602
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Now I'm just an ordinary teacher.

603
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Sir, please stay here for a few more days.

604
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Right here?

605
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,620
You haven't caught a night shark for so many years.

606
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,620
I've been hiding in the middle of the countryside.

607
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,620
Now I'm being locked up here like a prisoner.

608
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
How dare you!

609
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,620
You guys stay here.

610
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
You must protect Lord Shen.

611
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,620
The one who killed Xiao Bei is really cunning.

612
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Don't worry, Father.

613
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,620
As long as he's alive, I'll catch him myself.

614
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,620
But there's one thing I still don't understand.

615
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,620
What's the purpose of his appearance this time?

616
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,620
What's wrong?

617
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Oh no, I have to go to the Chuyue Town myself.

618
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
I'm all right, Sir.

619
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Sir, how's Lord Shen?

620
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,620
Everything is fine under the lock.

621
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,620
Lord Shen.

622
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:08,940
Is that�

623
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,660
give me

624
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:25,060
breathe

625
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,540
you

626
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,740
This

627
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,220
In a place with many children

628
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,180
Found Lord Shen

629
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,940
That's the school

630
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,620
Yes, yes, yes, it's the school

631
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,060
Then they took Lord Shen

632
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,620
Brought to a small house

633
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,900
There are mountains around that house

634
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,380
That's the house

635
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,860
Big brother, I was going to come back and report to you

636
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,100
But who knows that Brother Zhu Kongyun went in

637
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,020
I think this is not right

638
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,940
You guess what happened later

639
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,180
Don't sell the case

640
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,860
Hurry up

641
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,540
What happened to Lord Shen later

642
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,420
Dead

643
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,380
I'm sorry

644
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,620
Who promised me that year

645
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
Said that as long as Lord Shen orders

646
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,900
Hide in the wild

647
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,740
Can keep him safe

648
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,300
Is this how you protect me?

649
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,420
Your Majesty is a minstrel

650
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,140
I deserve to die

651
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,060
Your Majesty

652
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,100
I know the news of Yesha's appearance

653
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,940
Already sent people to the fire

654
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,060
Transfer Lord Shen to the defense

655
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,420
Defense is heavily guarded

656
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,860
I didn't expect Yesha to do it again

657
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,500
How did Lord Shen die

658
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,020
Big brother, I listen to you

659
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,540
I didn't come close or come out

660
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,380
After they left

661
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,580
I said I bought a guard

662
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,620
This guard told me

663
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,380
Lord Shen was poisoned

664
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,820
In the pastries

665
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,860
Poisoned

666
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,700
You are really a camp

667
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,380
Make such a big mistake

668
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,500
Let me feel the pain of love

669
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,020
Zhu Kongyun

670
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,220
When are you going to fool me?

671
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,940
I dare not

672
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,820
I carefully investigated the defense of each room

673
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,100
Finally I found

674
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,300
It was in Lord Shen's pastries

675
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,500
Poisoned

676
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,740
Blood heart fire

677
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,780
Kill Lord Shen

678
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,740
Is the fake news we released

679
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,620
Now Zhu Yitie is dead

680
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,940
Before he died, he was told to kill Yesha in Fengbo Lake

681
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,100
Who killed Lord Shen?

682
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,500
Zhu Yitie lied

683
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,380
Yesha is not dead at all

684
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,780
I am still Yesha's other friend

685
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,900
I am a person of the sea

686
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,980
The number of survivors in the sea

687
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,420
The orphan of the sea

688
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,860
In fact, there are no ghosts in this world

689
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,340
Everything is human

690
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,500
Sometimes people do evil

691
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,060
More terrible than ghosts

692
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,420
Zhu Yitie once said

693
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,900
As long as there is one survivor in the sea

694
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,220
Yesha will appear without rest

695
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,420
Tong Shuang was able to follow the secret camp

696
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,860
Find Lord Shen

697
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,780
Others can also

698
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,540
The wolf is not a dust, the yellow is behind

699
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,620
Brother, is Lord Shen dead because of me?

700
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,220
This has nothing to do with you

701
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,780
I'm not thinking carefully enough

702
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,060
We were planning to steal the food and ask the way

703
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,340
Take the hand of the secret camp to protect Lord Shen

704
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,780
Then borrow the mechanical sword

705
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,060
I didn't expect Yesha to be so angry

706
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,740
But the defense has a thief

707
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,340
Or someone was bribed

708
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:26,260
At first, Chen Yan was also so

709
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,700
And the defense is closely watching the food

710
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,820
The number of people want to buy it all

711
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,860
Almost impossible

712
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,180
Chen Yan interrogated all the members of the food

713
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,660
It's possible to poison

714
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,740
You don't have to tell me so secretly

715
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,460
I ask you how the cakes are poisoned

716
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,180
wrong

717
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,340
You saw Lord Shen being escorted into the house

718
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,620
He was fine at that time, right?

719
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,860
Yes, nothing happened

720
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
People are fine

721
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,220
According to the rules

722
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,700
As long as you enter the house, there will be no security problems

723
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,420
How did the poison go down?

724
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,860
Will it be like the sad bloodshed three years ago?

725
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,900
The murderer bought through the person inside the poison

726
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,980
All the food in the house will be strange

727
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,740
Each one has silver needles to test the poison

728
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,820
If you want to sneak into the house to poison

729
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,900
You have to buy through every person who tests the poison

730
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,140
Almost impossible

731
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,340
I'll go out and check

732
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,660
See if there are any other clues

733
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,460
Your Majesty

734
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,260
What I said is true

735
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,260
It was indeed in the cakes that Lord Shen took

736
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,100
Poisoned

737
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,420
But that poison was poisoned by Lord Shen

738
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,220
You mean Lord Shen poisoned himself

739
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
ridiculous

740
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,780
delicious

741
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,540
Can you be gentle

742
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,380
You eat slowly and you will die

743
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,300
You eat so fast

744
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,980
Wait a minute

745
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,060
Eat the oil paper in your stomach

746
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,540
You are the one who makes trouble in your stomach

747
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,180
The poison that Lord Shen was poisoned was not in the cakes

748
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,620
Not in the cakes

749
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,340
Where is that?

750
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,940
Yes, isn't this a tear on the eyebrows?

751
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,700
It's unreasonable

752
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,740
How did it get poisoned?

753
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,100
Tong Shuang

754
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
Did Lord Shen bring luggage when he entered the house?

755
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,900
I brought a luggage

756
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,100
It should be a change of clothes

757
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,660
That poison is in the luggage

758
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,380
That poison is in the luggage

759
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,780
Three years ago, Ye Sha killed the ministers

760
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,260
It's from their living habits

761
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,820
Your Majesty

762
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,820
Lord Shen is not poisoning himself

763
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,340
But Ye Sha used one

764
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,020
He is not easy to be noticed

765
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,900
What habit

766
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,780
When I was protecting Lord Shen three years ago

767
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,820
I secretly observed him outside his study

768
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,780
Lord Shen has a small habit

769
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,540
I need to explore Lord Shen's lecture

770
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,540
Found that when Lord Shen reads

771
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,820
There is such a habit

772
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,980
Lord Shen loves to read

773
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,140
He can't keep his hands off the books

774
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
When he reads

775
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,140
He likes to use his hands to read at night

776
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,380
Ye Sha only needs to poison his books

777
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,020
I asked Lord Shen's students to verify this

778
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,740
Lord Shen is used to reading at night

779
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,260
If I'm not wrong

780
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,060
There is a relic in his luggage

781
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,580
There should be books

782
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
In the books that Lord Shen carried with him

783
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,420
Poisoned

784
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,820
The poison on the cake

785
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,820
It's just that Lord Shen is not used to reading

786
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,060
He is not used to reading

787
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,300
He is not used to reading

788
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,860
The poison on the cake

789
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,940
It's just that Lord Shen picked up the cake

790
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,980
After the sweet potato was picked up

791
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,540
It's on top of the cake

792
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,740
So it is

793
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,740
Ye Sha, this thief

794
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,460
So cunning

795
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,940
Although Ye Sha is cunning

796
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,260
But it is indeed my habit

797
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,500
Those books were brought by Lord Shen

798
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,380
The guard thought it was just some books

799
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,700
So there was no check

800
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,700
So let Ye Sha have a chance

801
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,540
I'm not doing my job well

802
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
OK, stop talking

803
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,340
Three years

804
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,820
Zhen Tong lost many ministers

805
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,380
The case is handed over to your Anzhen Camp

806
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,380
Three years have passed

807
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,380
No progress

808
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,060
Take you two

809
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,660
Dismissed and sent to prison

810
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,940
All are innocent

811
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,780
It was my teacher

812
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,580
Lord Shen died

813
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,140
Also my national envoy

814
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,420
Involved in Anzhen Camp

815
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,860
Big brother

816
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,180
That pair of father and son always treat you as Ye Sha

817
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,500
Chasing after you everywhere

818
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,100
It's good to let them suffer

819
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,860
The purpose of Anzhen Camp is the same as ours

820
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,860
Just take me as Ye Sha

821
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
father

822
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,380
Yu'er

823
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,780
Leave time for our father and son

824
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,340
Not much

825
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,300
I'm giving you the last chance

826
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,100
To make a mistake and make a contribution

827
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,300
But this time

828
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,860
To make a seven-line

829
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,980
What are you looking at

830
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,540
Dare not speak

831
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,380
Three months

832
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,540
Within three months

833
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,300
Three months

834
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,780
Ye Sha has been killed in the palace for three months

835
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,860
One month

836
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,660
Your Majesty

837
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,460
Within a month

838
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,740
Anzhen Camp will definitely be able to punish Ye Sha

839
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,820
If it can't be done

840
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,220
I am willing to die

841
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,980
One month

842
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,500
Can't do it for a day

843
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Relying on these books

844
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,540
And the hope of finding Ye Sha

845
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,540
Lord Shen's books

846
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,180
Defend the Anzhen Camp

847
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,020
Too many people can get in touch

848
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,300
Moreover, the camp is a empty place

849
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,980
Even if someone sneaks into the poison

850
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,340
No sign of it

851
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,220
There is no clue at all

852
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
father

853
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,460
I want to check the bloodshed

854
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,220
The four ministers' resume

855
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,580
What are you doing

856
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,260
I always thought

857
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,700
Ye Sha's case three years ago

858
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,860
Just to play the ghost

859
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,740
Caused panic in the court

860
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,220
So I chose Langhua Pavilion

861
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,860
The four ministers of the north

862
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,660
But I didn't expect so many years to go by

863
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,060
Ye Sha still hurt Lord Shen

864
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,980
Make me have to doubt

865
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,060
Ye Sha has to kill these four ministers

866
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,180
Register

867
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,260
Between these four ministers

868
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,460
Must be related

869
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,420
The official documents of the Qi State

870
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,380
All exist in the Tianshu Pavilion

871
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,580
You hold this token

872
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,460
Can be entered into the investigation

873
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,980
The official documents of the Qi State

874
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,580
All exist in the Tianshu Pavilion

875
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,380
Can be entered into the investigation

876
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,380
Can be entered into the investigation

877
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,380
Can be entered into the investigation

878
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,380
Can be entered into the investigation

879
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,380
Can be entered into the investigation

880
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,380
Can be entered into the investigation

881
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,380
Can be entered into the investigation

882
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,380
Can be entered into the investigation

883
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,380
Can be entered into the investigation

884
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,380
Can be entered into the investigation

885
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,380
Can be entered into the investigation

886
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,380
Can be entered into the investigation

887
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Can be entered into the investigation

888
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Look at the beautiful scenery

889
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
The bright corner

890
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
And the light of the sky

891
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
It also

892
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh...

893
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
The beauty

894
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
The beauty

895
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
The beauty

896
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
The beauty

897
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
The beauty

898
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
The beauty

899
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
The beauty

900
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700
The beauty

901
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,700
The beauty

902
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Oh...

903
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
The beauty

904
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,700
The beauty

905
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
The beauty
