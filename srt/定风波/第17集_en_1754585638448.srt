1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Oh So about you

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:24,400
For you, too, Mr. edge

3
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
This is the old Pingyuan Escort, my home.

4
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,360
Since the fire was burned down,

5
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
there's no one in the house.

6
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
But I think we can live there.

7
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
Of course we can.

8
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
It's safer than the inn.

9
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Let's go in and have a look.

10
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

11
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Are you okay?

12
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm fine.

13
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
I didn't have a good rest on the way.

14
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
What are you doing?

15
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Are you done yet?

16
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
He's been dead for a long time.

17
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,800
Why are you torturing him?

18
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Get out!

19
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
No.

20
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Uncle Hai.

21
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you here?

22
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,000
You...

23
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are...

24
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm Tong Shuang, Uncle Hai.

25
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't you remember me?

26
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Young Master San.

27
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
Yes, I'm Young Master San.

28
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm Tong Shuang.

29
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm back.

30
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,000
You...

31
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600
You're Young Master San?

32
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
Young Master San, you're still alive?

33
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
That's great.

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
How did you survive all these years?

35
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,600
Tell me.

36
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Uncle Hai, it's a long story.

37
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
These are all my friends.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
They'll stay at home for a few days.

39
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Come on.

40
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Come on.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Follow me.

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,200
This way, please.

43
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
Come on.

44
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Uncle Hai, you go first.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Okay.

46
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Young Master San.

47
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,400
Where have you been all these years?

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
You must have suffered a lot.

49
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,800
If Master knows you're still alive,

50
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,000
he'll be happy even in the netherworld.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
Uncle Hai, don't worry.

52
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm back.

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,200
The Tong family is still the Tong family.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Dad.

55
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Son.

56
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Master Zou Biao is back.

57
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
When Biao Ju was in trouble,

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
I came back to my hometown.

59
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,800
I didn't expect that when I came back,

60
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Biao Ju went up and down,

61
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
and went to all the places.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
He was gone in a day.

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,800
The Tong family treated me well.

64
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,800
The Tong family's leader

65
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
treated me like a son.

66
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
I was so happy.

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
I didn't know what to do.

68
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
I was so happy.

69
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
I was so happy.

70
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
I was so happy.

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
I was so happy.

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
I was so happy.

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I was so happy.

74
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,400
They treated me like my own family.

75
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
But I...

76
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
I wasn't there.

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I've been feeling bad for all these years.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
I wish I could

79
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
burn to death with everyone that day

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,800
to feel better.

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600
Uncle Hai.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
It's all in the past.

83
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Now we still have Tong Shuang.

84
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes. Yes.

85
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a blessing in disguise.

86
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
The Tong family is so lucky.

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Uncle Hai.

88
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
When did you come back?

89
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I was looking for money.

90
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
I buried my father, my wife

91
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
and everyone else.

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
Then I went back to my hometown to serve my parents.

93
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,200
My parents were gone a few years ago.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
I was so worried about the Tong family.

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
So I came back.

96
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
I've been dreaming recently.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
I dreamt of my father every time.

98
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
I dreamt of the scene

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
when you guys were playing in the yard.

100
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,200
It was so good.

101
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Uncle Hai.

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm glad you're here.

103
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
You must be hungry.

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll cook for you.

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,400
Let me help you.

106
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Okay.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,600
I...

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know how to cook.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
I'll clean the house.

110
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Let's do it together.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,400
I'll clean the yard.

112
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,400
You're crazy.

113
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,000
Leave it there.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,600
I'll do it.

115
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,400
It's nothing.

116
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't touch it.

117
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Everyone is busy now.

118
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,400
I can't be idle.

119
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
You haven't cured your poison.

120
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
You can't be tired.

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
The yard is so nice.

122
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,000
I feel so comfortable here.

123
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
Don't stare at me.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Go back to your work.

125
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Uncle Hai.

126
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm here.

127
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Young Master San.

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
Let me do it.

129
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
No.

130
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Do your job.

131
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
You're dirty.

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,400
I'll do it.

133
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
Let's go to the Eastern Courtyard.

135
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Okay.

136
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
No one died there.

137
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,400
Good luck.

138
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Okay, Young Master.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Go.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Tomorrow, me and my sister

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
will go to Weizhou Camp.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
We'll ask about the food.

143
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Okay.

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
We're here to investigate Ma Wen.

145
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Tomorrow, Miss Huo and I

146
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
will go to the horse farm.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Okay.

148
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,400
What about me?

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
You haven't been back for a long time.

150
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Tomorrow, you'll go to the grave

151
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
to pay respects to your parents.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Okay.

153
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, right.

154
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
There's one more thing.

155
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
When we arrived today,

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Uncle Hai was very hostile to us.

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,400
He kept asking if we were done.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,800
He obviously took us

159
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
as a stranger.

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
Has anything happened

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to the Escort recently?

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,200
Yes.

163
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I found out, too.

164
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
He was very nervous.

165
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll ask him.

166
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
It's late.

167
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Uncle Hai is probably asleep.

168
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
It won't be too late to ask again tomorrow.

169
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
Okay.

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Maybe I'm overthinking.

171
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
You're still awake?

172
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Just say what you want to say.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
I won't tell anyone.

174
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Miss Huo,

175
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
do you think

176
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
you must be with someone

177
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
you like?

178
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I know.

179
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Now that Brother Xiao is out of the loop,

180
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,000
you also think he's not Ye Sha.

181
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
So you're starting to think about it again.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
What do you mean?

183
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
We're engaged.

184
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,600
Do you want to hear my opinion?

185
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,400
If I can hide you from someone's eyes,

186
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,400
he is an inescapable person.

187
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Brother Xiao is still

188
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
guilty and wronged.

189
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
As his person,

190
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
he definitely doesn't want to drag you down.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,800
I know.

192
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
But don't be discouraged.

193
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
When he's washed away his wrongdoings,

194
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
everything will be fine.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
But before that,

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
you have two choices.

197
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,400
First,

198
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
ask him.

199
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Ask him what he thinks.

200
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Second,

201
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
wait for Brother Xiao to say it first.

202
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
He's so smart.

203
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
He's so clear-headed.

204
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
He'll tell you his thoughts

205
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,000
at the right time.

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll wait for him.

207
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
I knew you'd smile.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
Go to sleep.

209
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
No worries.

210
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,200
Let's enjoy the spring and autumn with me.

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
How is it?

212
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Is there anything else except cold?

213
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,400
No.

214
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Have some ginger soup.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,600
Thank you.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,400
Nuannuan,

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
you shouldn't go there.

218
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,800
Let Zhong Buhui go there alone.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Then I can't hide anymore.

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
What are you doing?

221
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,800
What are you doing?

222
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Your Escort is a bunch of devils!

223
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,000
Catch him!

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,600
Say it again!

225
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,200
What's wrong?

226
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,000
What's wrong?

227
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
What are you talking about?

228
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Who's the devil?

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Calm down.

230
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Calm down.

231
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Say it.

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Come on.

233
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,200
Calm down.

234
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,200
The God of War is here.

235
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
Say it slowly.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Say it slowly.

237
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Come on.

238
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
So what?

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Can you catch the devils?

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,000
We're going to go in and do something.

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,400
Go in and do something.

242
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Go in and do something.

243
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,800
Go.

244
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You're reasonable.

245
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
Let's see who can beat me.

246
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,800
Say it.

247
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,400
Come on.

248
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Let's see who can beat me.

249
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,000
What's wrong?

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
You're a official, but you still want to beat us?

251
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Stop it!

252
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
I didn't mean that.

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,800
Go after him.

254
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Calm down.

255
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,600
Stop it!

256
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,200
What's going on in the early morning?

257
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
The people from the camp.

258
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,200
Be careful.

259
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
You want to start a fire?

260
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Back off!

261
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,800
Back off!

262
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,600
Back off!

263
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Back off!

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,600
Back off!

265
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,200
Back off!

266
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,800
Hurry up!

267
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,800
Back off!

268
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,400
Back off!

269
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,000
Back off!

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Back off!

271
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Back off!

272
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,800
Back off!

273
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,400
Back off!

274
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
Back off!

275
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,800
Back off!

276
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,000
Hurry up!

277
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Back off!

278
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't know how many officers are here.

279
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm Wang Fei Hu from Weizhou Camp.

280
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,800
You don't have to be so polite.

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
We're here on orders.

283
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,200
On orders?

284
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,000
You're here to fight?

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,600
Yes.

286
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
May I ask your names?

287
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm Zhong Xue Man.

288
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,200
This is Mo Chong.

289
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Nice to meet you.

290
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
Zhong Xue Man?

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,200
The daughter of Lord Zhong Bu?

292
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I didn't expect you to be so funny.

293
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,400
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Officer Wang.

295
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
Don't say anything more.

296
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,200
Let's settle the matter now.

297
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,600
You bastard!

298
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,800
You're the one who led the army!

299
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,600
You're the one who led the army!

300
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
You're the one who led the army!

301
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
It's not me.

302
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Come here!

303
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,400
You called so many people here this morning.

304
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,800
And you're making trouble in the court.

305
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
What are you going to do?

306
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,400
Say it!

307
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,600
We're not making trouble.

308
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
The Security Escort Bureau is the one making trouble.

309
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Who?

310
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Say it again. Who?

311
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,800
Calm down.

312
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,000
What else can happen to the Security Escort Bureau?

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm not talking nonsense.

314
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,400
It's about the soul escort car.

315
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,800
Officer Wang, you know it.

316
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Officer Wang.

317
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,400
What's going on with the soul escort car?

318
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
The soul escort car is a strange thing.

319
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
It can't be confirmed.

320
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,000
So we can't control it.

321
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
It's not a rumor.

322
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
I saw it with my own eyes.

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
When I arrived with the people,

324
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
all the cars were gone.

325
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
At first, everyone thought I was wrong.

326
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,600
But this happened several times.

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,800
So I think

328
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
it's because the Security Escort Bureau was destroyed

329
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
and the soul is still here.

330
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Some time ago, my uncle just died.

331
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
Someone saw the soul escort car

332
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,000
and then the next day,

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,400
my uncle's grave was cut off.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He was gone.

335
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
The soul must have been

336
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
taken away by the Security Escort Bureau.

337
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Nonsense.

338
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
You saw the escort car and took you away?

339
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I didn't see it.

340
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,600
But not only my family,

341
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,400
but many of them have been in this kind of situation.

342
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Am I right?

343
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes.

344
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
If the Security Escort Bureau doesn't give us an explanation,

345
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
it's not over.

346
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,400
Yes.

347
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,200
It's over.

348
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,800
It's over.

349
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
It's over.

350
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,800
Shut up.

351
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
All of you, shut up.

352
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Chief Wang.

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
No matter if it's true or not,

354
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
the situation is like this.

355
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
If the Wei Zhou Camp doesn't act now,

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
it's not going to be over.

357
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I understand.

358
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,200
This matter is over.

359
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,200
It's over.

360
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
I'll tell you.

361
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Our Wei Zhou Camp

362
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
will definitely find out the truth.

363
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,200
I'll give an explanation to the villagers.

364
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
If you have any complaints,

365
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,200
come to the Wei Zhou Camp to find me.

366
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
But from today on,

367
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,600
if you make any more trouble,

368
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
I'll arrest you.

369
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I won't forgive you.

370
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Leave.

371
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,200
Leave.

372
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Leave.

373
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm leaving.

374
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Leave.

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Leave.

376
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Leave.

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Leave.

378
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Leave.

379
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Leave.

380
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Leave.

381
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
Don't be angry, Young Master.

382
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
It's all stupid things that fish people do.

383
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Just ignore them.

384
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
When my father was still alive,

385
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
Wei Zhou Camp has done so many good things.

386
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,800
Now it's not even a few dangerous things.

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
There is no wind without waves.

388
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
The matter started because of the escort car of Pingyuan Escort.

389
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Uncle Hai.

390
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
I want to ask.

391
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Shouldn't this escort car and escort car

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
belong to the escort bureau?

393
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
After the escort bureau's accident,

394
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
the escort's family items

395
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,400
were stolen.

396
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,200
Who knows who got them?

397
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
It's all a past.

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That means

399
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,200
everyone can use this escort car

400
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
to make up stories.

401
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
Wei Zhou Camp did something wrong

402
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,000
and made you laugh.

403
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,800
Don't be angry.

404
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,400
Thank you for your help today.

405
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,200
You're welcome.

406
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
You're too kind.

407
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Mr. Wang.

408
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Can we handle the escort car case?

409
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Of course.

410
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,400
I can cooperate with you.

411
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
In that case,

412
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I have a private matter to ask.

413
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,200
The horses look so poor.

414
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,200
It seems that they are really sick.

415
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
Is there anything wrong with the grass?

416
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
I don't see any problem.

417
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
These horses just now

418
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,200
are very happy.

419
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't move.

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
Why is this horse like this again?

421
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Be careful.

422
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Hurry up.

423
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Chase them.

424
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
What's going on?

425
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
The horse is not dead.

426
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
What's going on?

427
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm so sorry.

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,800
I didn't scare you two just now.

429
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
When I was eating grass,

430
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
I was fine.

431
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
When I rode the horse,

432
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
the horse was only scared twice.

433
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
But after being scared every time,

434
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,800
they were all out of energy.

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The people of the Yayi Hall

436
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
also prescribed medicine.

437
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,400
But the condition of the horse

438
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
is not getting better.

439
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,800
Instead,

440
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,400
it has a more serious trend.

441
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
The horse is not only eating grass but drinking water.

442
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
Since the grass is fine,

443
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
drinking water is also a problem.

444
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,200
Where do you usually

445
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
go to feed the horse?

446
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Today, this bucket of water

447
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
is what I hit in a river

448
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
on the west side of the horse farm.

449
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,200
Today?

450
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,000
Will it be different from usual?

451
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,000
Sometimes,

452
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
we want to sneak in,

453
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
so we don't go to the river to get water.

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,200
We just hit in the well in the horse farm.

455
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
Why is it so far-fetched?

456
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,800
This

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
is also just specified above.

458
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
That river is called the salty water river.

459
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
It's the water that flows from the mountain over there.

460
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
Because the river water is slightly salty,

461
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,000
so the people

462
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
are not willing to drink the water in this river.

463
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,400
Instead,

464
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
it's just right to feed these animals.

465
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
And the water in the horse farm

466
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,200
is pure.

467
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
So it's specified

468
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
to be used for people to drink.

469
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,600
I see.

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
This also shows

471
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
why these horses

472
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,400
don't get scared every time they drink water.

473
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
The problem is already in that river.

474
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,800
It's a keystone.

475
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,600
Zhong Bu Kui likes this stone.

476
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What a pity.

477
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,800
If I had known you liked it,

478
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,600
I would have found some for you.

479
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,600
But now,

480
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
we can't find this stone in Weizhou.

481
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
Is this keystone so rare and precious?

482
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
Rare is rare.

483
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It's not precious.

484
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You don't know that

485
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
this keystone

486
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,400
was found on the Chixia Mountain.

487
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
This kind of red stone

488
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,000
can't be used as jewelry.

489
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,600
And it can't be made into iron.

490
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,000
It's low in production.

491
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
So no one cares about it.

492
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
And no one is buying it.

493
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,200
If so,

494
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
why do you say

495
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
you can't find this stone?

496
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,400
A rich businessman came to Weizhou a year ago.

497
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
He bought all the stone markets in Chixia Mountain.

498
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
He didn't say he bought all.

499
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
And he also bought

500
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
the keystone in the hands of the people.

501
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
If someone is willing to spend money to buy it,

502
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
he will buy it.

503
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Who is the rich businessman?

504
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Is he still in Weizhou?

505
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
I don't know.

506
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,400
If you want to find him,

507
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,400
I can send someone to check for you.

508
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

509
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,000
If you have any news about this person,

510
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,600
please tell me as soon as possible.

511
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,400
Okay.

512
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
The mysterious rich businessman who bought the keystone.

513
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
This rich businessman is so weird.

514
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,000
He is Ye Sha, right?

515
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,200
It's hard to say.

516
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
About the case of the sick horse,

517
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
Feng Wuzuo and Sister Huo went to investigate.

518
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
It's still a problem to solve the Escort first.

519
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Find out what's going on with the soul escort.

520
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,800
Yes.

521
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Brother, you say it.

522
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
How to investigate next?

523
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
The person who made trouble said

524
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
that many people have been buried recently.

525
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
They disappeared with the soul escort.

526
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200
But those bastards can believe it.

527
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
We have to investigate whether they believe it or not.

528
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
First, investigate the recent cases.

529
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,400
When did it happen?

530
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
Where did the body fall?

531
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Did you see the witness?

532
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,600
In short, the more detailed, the better.

533
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,400
Come on.

534
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Be careful.

535
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,600
The bicycle was left there angry.

536
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Don't worry.

537
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
This is the bus.

538
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,400
Police guy most likely came right away.

539
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,800
There are a lot of bodies in the village.

540
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,280
It was also since last year.

541
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,840
Someone saw the Soul Token every month.

542
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,520
The Soul Token and the Taoist priest

543
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
started almost at the same time.

544
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,640
That means

545
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,720
the Soul Token

546
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,920
might have appeared for the Taoist priest.

547
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
I wonder what the Taoist priest

548
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,920
used for.

549
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,240
I'm back.

550
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,080
Where's Miss Huo?

551
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
She's not feeling well.

552
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
She went to rest.

553
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,840
She's not feeling well?

554
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
I'm afraid you're about to feel unwell.

555
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,840
I'm afraid you're about to feel unwell.

556
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm afraid you're about to feel unwell.

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
I'm afraid you're about to feel unwell.

558
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm afraid you're about to feel unwell.

559
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
I'm afraid you're about to feel unwell.

560
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,800
This is a finger of a human.

561
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,560
Yeah.

562
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,680
It's just a wound.

563
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,880
Where did you find it?

564
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,160
On the top of the Pond.

565
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
And

566
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,880
I found something else.

567
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,040
Someone's burning corpses by the river.

568
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,560
It's the Lion's World.

569
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,880
The rocks are built by the river.

570
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,000
The rocks were thrown into the river.

571
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
These things polluted the water source.

572
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,240
The horses in the horse farm

573
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
drank the water there.

574
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,040
They got the horse's temperature.

575
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,840
Fortunately,

576
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
the villagers nearby

577
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,480
never drank the river water.

578
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,440
Otherwise, it would have been worse.

579
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
It's a pity that

580
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,560
the Lion's World is a place

581
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
where people can't go.

582
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
It's a pity that

583
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
the Lion's World is a place

584
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
where people can't go.

585
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
It's a pity that

586
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
the Lion's World is a place

587
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
where people can't go.

588
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
The people who were practicing

589
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,600
noticed the movements of us and the villagers.

590
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,200
So they ran away in advance.

591
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,600
These corpses

592
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,320
might be the corpses

593
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,400
stolen by the Soul Token.

594
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,000
Did they burn the corpses?

595
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,800
Yes.

596
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
The old priest said

597
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,800
they used the corpse oil to train the body.

598
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,600
So the Soul Token

599
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,800
is related to the Night Fiend.

600
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
They ran away in a hurry.

601
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,600
The corpses haven't been burned yet.

602
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
They should be using the Soul Token

603
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,800
to burn the corpses.

604
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,800
Has anyone just been buried recently?

605
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,600
Yes.

606
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,400
But

607
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
there are two people.

608
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
The first one is

609
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,800
the business owner in the city.

610
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,200
He just died of illness.

611
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
The second one is a farmer nearby.

612
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
He fell into the ditch.

613
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,800
His head was carved on the stone.

614
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,600
He was carved to death.

615
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
It's not good to be the body of a big man.

616
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
They should be the first to choose the body of a farmer.

617
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Master Feng.

618
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,000
Stay here and take care of Miss Huo.

619
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
What about you?

620
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,200
Let's go meet the Soul Token.

621
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,300
Where is your soul?

622
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,600
It's not here.

623
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,200
Where are the people in the Shadow of the Weizhou?

624
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
There are many people with big goals.

625
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
It's easy to alert them.

626
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,400
They are all ambushed nearby.

627
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,800
Tong Shuang,

628
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,000
where is the heart grave?

629
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
Do you see the tomb over there?

630
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I asked for two pieces of paper under the grave.

631
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I can't find it.

632
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I'll go find it.

633
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I'll go find it.

634
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
I'll go find it.

635
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
I'll go find it.

636
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I'll go find it.

637
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I'll go find it.

638
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I'll go find it.

639
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll go find it.

640
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
I'll go find it.

641
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I'll catch all who made Zhuang Shen angry tonight.

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yu'er is injured.

643
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Lord Tong,

644
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,400
let me go talk to Master Rock.

645
00:27:48,600 --> 00:28:15,000
Alright,

646
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,320
Yes

647
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,960
Stop

648
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,060
Our

649
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,720
Are you all right It's all right

650
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,200
go

651
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
Help me get the light.

652
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,400
Who? Who's there?

653
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,160
Take him away.

654
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Please forgive me, my lord.

655
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,000
Please forgive me.

656
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,280
You were too reckless just now.

657
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,280
Brother.

658
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,240
Please forgive me, my lord.

659
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,920
Please forgive me, my lord.

660
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,240
Please forgive me, my lord.

661
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,360
Please forgive me.

662
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,920
They are the souls of the escort car.

663
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,960
The so-called escort car

664
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,240
is just a cover.

665
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
It's a meteor bamboo.

666
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,800
Meteor bamboo?

667
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,800
What's that?

668
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,200
It's a copper powder mixed with a lamp.

669
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,800
It will generate a green flame.

670
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,360
It's like a fire.

671
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,040
With this green lamp,

672
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,440
the bamboo will light a stove.

673
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,480
The smoke will burn the dry wood and the wood.

674
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,000
It will generate white smoke

675
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
and cover our sight.

676
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,560
I see.

677
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,920
But why would the car move by itself?

678
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,640
They hide in the dark.

679
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,120
They use the black wire

680
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,880
to pull the escort car to control the direction

681
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,200
and cause the escort car to move forward.

682
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,640
With this lamp and the smoke,

683
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,600
the common people will think they saw a ghost.

684
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,000
But as long as the lamp and the bamboo are extinguished,

685
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,440
they won't find the mark of the escort car in the smoke.

686
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,640
Right or wrong?

687
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,880
Yes, yes, yes.

688
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,840
My lord, please forgive me.

689
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,760
You bastards!

690
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,680
Tong Shuang, don't go back.

691
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,200
I said,

692
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
don't go to the escort car.

693
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,920
Tong Shuang.

694
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,200
Please forgive me, my lord.

695
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,720
My lord, don't be angry.

696
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,000
My lord.

697
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,600
Get up!

698
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,640
My lord, we know ourphonies.

699
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,760
We've always wollted

700
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,800
to be wild hoe hunters.

701
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,920
Everybody in the Commandery 센城

702
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,520
has heard about the goodbye ofasги.

703
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,800
We wanted use these materials

704
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,560
to get some old escort cars

705
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,600
and re-build them a little after.

706
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,000
What did he use to do?

707
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
Don't you know?

708
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Sir, sir, sir.

709
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Don't lie to him.

710
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Sir, we're just poor people.

711
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
We're just poor people.

712
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,000
We really don't know what he used to do.

713
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
Who bought the corpse from you?

714
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,600
We don't know who bought the corpse.

715
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,600
It seems that they are just small characters.

716
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,800
Those who bought the corpse,

717
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,400
the gentleman and the merchant

718
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,600
should be the same group.

719
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
They are the people we are looking for.

720
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,800
What about these people?

721
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Do you want me to fight again?

722
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,000
Enough.

723
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
They are just thieves.

724
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Wang Budou and the junior are discussing.

725
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Leave it to them.

726
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,400
Okay.

727
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The plan is a good plan.

728
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,400
And only the two of us

729
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,800
are the most suitable.

730
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,200
But I'm still a little worried.

731
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,400
This plan is indeed a bit risky.

732
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
I'm not worried about danger.

733
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,000
The main thing is that Tong Shuang is busy now.

734
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,800
I'm afraid that

735
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,200
the fire in his heart will come out soon.

736
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
This matter is related to the Pingyuan Escort.

737
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
If it were someone else,

738
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm afraid it would be difficult to keep calm.

739
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,200
Not to mention his hasty temper.

740
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,000
Brother Xiao, Tong Shuang listens to you the most.

741
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,400
If you have a chance, please persuade him.

742
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I'll talk to him.

743
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,400
How is the discussion going?

744
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,800
Now the bait is already in the water.

745
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,200
Just wait for the big fish to come out.

746
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,400
Don't let the people of Weizhou

747
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
get in this time.

748
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Just the few of us.

749
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,200
This plan is too dangerous.

750
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,600
Everyone must be careful.

751
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,200
Tong Shuang,

752
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
you go to the street and

753
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,400
observe the street signs

754
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,600
of the little beggars who pretend to be the night fox.

755
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,800
Remember not to act rashly.

756
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
We don't know

757
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
what they are.

758
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,600
It's just that we have a deal.

759
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
Every time we have a goods in our hands,

760
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,400
we will put a grass mark in the market

761
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
and sell the night fox.

762
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
There are a few shops

763
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,000
and a few night foxes.

764
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That night,

765
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,200
we will transport the body

766
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,800
to the small earthen ditch outside the city.

767
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,000
The people who buy the body

768
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
will definitely make a deal.

769
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
Everyone will pay the money

770
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,000
and the goods.

771
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,800
Feng Jinzhu,

772
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
you pretend to be the marketer and deliver the goods.

773
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,600
At that time,

774
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
Tong Shuang hid in the coffin

775
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
and moved around.

776
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Give him the goods.

777
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Meng Fu,

778
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
I'll look at the three coffin boards later.

779
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
When they open the coffin board,

780
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,200
we will make a mistake.

781
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
I know.

782
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Do as planned.

783
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
I know.

784
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
Who are you?

785
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,400
Why haven't I seen you before?

786
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
We are delivering goods in turn.

787
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,800
Who do you think I am?

788
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,000
Just give me the money and you will have the goods.

789
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,200
Okay.

790
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
As long as you have the goods.

791
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Why are you coming out now?

792
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,000
Don't come over.

793
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Or I'll kill your friend.

794
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Let him go.

795
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Or I'll kill him now.

796
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,600
Kill me if you have the guts.

797
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,800
We have already prepared

798
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
to sacrifice our lives for the holy body.

799
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,000
That's right.

800
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,400
Kill him.

801
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Are you okay, crazy?

802
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,500
繼續 먹어도 disrespectful

don't

841
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
I saw you killing him.

842
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,700
Crazy.

843
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,220
I'm sorry.

844
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,660
I'm really afraid they'll run away.

845
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,420
Brother.

846
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,060
Miss Gu.

847
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,100
Thank you for your help.

848
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,740
Crazy.

849
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,700
I'm really sorry.

850
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,220
I'll go help them.

851
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,940
I'll be right back.

852
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,820
Wait for me.

853
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,900
Hold on.

854
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,620
I'm fine.

855
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,900
Who are you?

856
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,220
Speak up.

857
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,460
Who are you?

858
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,980
Heaven is coming.

859
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,820
No one is alive.

860
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,660
If you want to live,

861
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,140
you must kill the people.

862
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,380
Heaven is coming.

863
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,940
Stop.

864
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,660
No one is alive.

865
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,460
Stop.

866
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
If you want to live,

867
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,380
you must kill the people.

868
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,700
Heaven is coming.

869
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,340
No one is alive.

870
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,900
Stop.

871
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,660
Stop.

872
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,180
Stop.

873
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,100
Stop.

874
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,460
Are you going to kill them?

875
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,940
You're a pawn now.

876
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,180
Get out.

877
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,340
Brother.

878
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,020
Get out.

879
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,740
Go outside and calm down.

880
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,140
What is Heaven?

881
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,220
Of course it's the gods.

882
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,100
If you poison the gods,

883
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,140
you'll be punished.

884
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,700
What are you talking about?

885
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,460
Sister.

886
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,140
What is this?

887
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,740
This is a deadly chicken, duck, goose, pig, dog, and cat,

888
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:11,740
and a

889
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,740
You...

890
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,460
You scared us.

891
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,540
Isn't this poison?

892
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,620
It's not poison.

893
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,380
Try it.

894
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,540
It won't kill you anyway.

895
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,660
It's not poison.

896
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,380
Try it.

897
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,500
It won't kill you anyway.

898
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,140
I'm telling you.

899
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,180
Even if you kill me,

900
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,500
I won't say it.

901
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,580
I don't know this.

902
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,500
I don't know this.

903
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
I don't know this.

904
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,460
I want to say it.

905
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,380
I want to know.

906
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,300
I want to say it.

907
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,460
What is Heaven?

908
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,500
Did you do the water and oil

909
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,780
for the holy water?

910
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,580
This...

911
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,700
I don't know.

912
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,220
He doesn't know?

913
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,300
Holy water.

914
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,700
I didn't do it.

915
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,780
What are you burning the oil for?

916
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,620
For the holy oil.

917
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,900
What are you burning the oil for?

918
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,460
For the elixir.

919
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,540
Holy water.

920
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,740
Let's help with the elixir together.

921
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,780
What holy water?

922
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,940
What elixir?

923
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,900
Tell us everything you know.

924
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,220
Well.

925
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,500
We know a lot.

926
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,660
God is our leader.

927
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,980
He asked us to find the corpse and train the oil.

928
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,780
He said that

929
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,660
we could train the elixir that's not old.

930
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,340
Then

931
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,220
we can take it

932
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,500
and get the elixir.

933
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,460
I really don't know anything else.

934
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,380
You're still not honest.

935
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,900
Think about it.

936
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,420
Wait.

937
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,740
What he said is true.

938
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,580
The elixir is divided into

939
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,100
the heavenly filial piety and the heavenly silver.

940
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,420
We are

941
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,820
using the corpse to train the heavenly silver.

942
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,380
Right.

943
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,020
What are heavenly filial piety and heavenly silver?

944
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,340
Xiaoyao.

945
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,660
Heavenly silver is the oil of the lotus.

946
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,340
Right.

947
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,700
Heavenly filial piety is to find the blood of the living.

948
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,220
Have you seen the holy corpse?

949
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,700
No.

950
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,220
I've seen it once.

951
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,020
Mr. Tang.

952
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,140
Mr. Tang.

953
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,780
He's covered with his face.

954
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,540
I don't see anything.

955
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,580
Even if he's covered with his face,

956
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
there's still the naked skin.

957
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,100
Is there anything special?

958
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,700
Is there anything special?

959
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,700
There seems to be a black mole on his eyes.

960
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,100
There's a black mole on the right side of his eyes.

961
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,500
Where did the heavenly filial piety find the blood of the living?

962
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,420
We really don't know.

963
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,340
The heavenly level is three years.

964
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,220
Our heavenly silver

965
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,780
is the lowest level.

966
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,500
We don't even know

967
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,420
what the heavenly filial piety's disciples look like.

968
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,460
We know everything.

969
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,100
I've told you everything.

970
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,180
The sells can't be fraud raised in ma Почему

971
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,300
Five apostles won't go back home together

972
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,660
Five fod Australia

973
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:34,440
Five

974
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,320
and all the ups and downs

975
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,100
The mountains and the moon are covered in clouds

976
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,100
The shadow is like a shadow

977
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,100
The night is silent but I want to

978
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,100
The blood is like a flower, the heart is like a song

979
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,100
The ground is like a flower, the forest is like a wind

980
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,100
The world is like a big city, the building is like a desert

981
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Where can I go back to my home?

982
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,100
If I can't go back to my hometown

983
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,100
I will go to the end of the world

984
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,100
I will go back to my hometown

985
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,100
Who can stop me from going back to my hometown?

986
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,100
If I can go back to my hometown

987
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,100
I will go back to my hometown

988
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,100
I will go back to my hometown

989
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Look at the night sky

990
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,100
Looking for the truth

991
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:00,100
I heard the sound of the flute in the boat

992
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:07,100
Why do you laugh and laugh?

993
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,100
If I can't go back to my hometown

994
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,100
I will go back to my hometown

995
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,100
I will go back to my hometown

996
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,100
Who can stop me from going back to my hometown?

997
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,100
If I can go back to my hometown

998
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,100
I will go back to my hometown

999
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,100
The bright world is like the light of the sky

1000
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:40,100
It lights up my life
