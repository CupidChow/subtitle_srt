00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
You go to see me

11
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
OK, I'll run around first

12
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Don't worry, don't be nervous

13
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Crazy

14
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
How about I go

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
what happened

16
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Tears in your hand

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Hand hate

18
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Don't worry, I'm ready

19
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
There are still yours, right?

20
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Don't worry

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Will there be a fork?

22
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
No

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
There will be nothing

24
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Name

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Feng Qianzhuo

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Don't throw it

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Why are you sweating all over

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Next one

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Are you sick

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Come, write your name

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
No, no, no disease

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
It's too hot today

33
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
I wear too much

34
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Are you sure it's okay

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm sure it's okay

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
I remember it very well

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Write it

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Write it

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Write it

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Write it in

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
What are you looking at?

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Go inside

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Go over there

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
it is good

47
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
That side

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Hurry up

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Hurry up

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Give it to you

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Go, go

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Wait a minute, I haven't eaten yet

53
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Let me try again

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Let me try again

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
next

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I'll give it another chance

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
next

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Passed

62
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Passed

63
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Who said

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Big brother

65
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Give yourself another chance

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Give yourself another chance

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Next

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Give yourself another chance

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Pass

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Go ahead

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
next

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Okay, passed

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
next

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,120
Take off your clothes.

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,000
Hurry up.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
There are many people waiting in line.

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,120
Okay.

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Hurry up.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Come on.

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
My clothes.

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Class 24,

82
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Class 24.

83
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Fatty, you recite it.

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
The...

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
The school is the heaven and the earth.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
The...

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
The parents of the lower classes.

88
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
And the...

89
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
The uncles and the uncles.

90
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Yes.

91
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Bro,

92
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Class 24 is wrong.

93
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
It's not how to recite it.

94
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
This...

95
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
You passed.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Thank you, sir.

97
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Are you ready?

98
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Yes.

99
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Recite it.

100
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Class 24,

101
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Next.

102
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
Class 24,

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Spring Valley is rare.

104
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
The school is the heaven and the earth.

105
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
The teacher and the teacher are sincere.

106
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
The school is the heaven and the earth.

107
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
What's so great?

108
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Listen to me.

109
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Today's class ends here.

110
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Really?

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
The chosen ones

112
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
stay in the club

113
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
to have a good rest.

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
You

115
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
are dismissed.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Dismiss.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Dismiss.

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Give them another chance.

119
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Dismiss.

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Why didn't you go in?

121
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
It's okay.

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
It seems that Feng Wu is chosen.

123
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Look at these chosen ones.

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
They are still in a bad mood.

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
They should be lucky

126
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
to save a life.

127
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Stay safe.

128
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Stay safe.

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Xue Man,

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
you go back first.

131
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Tong Shuang and I are watching here.

132
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:12,480
But you are not a

133
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
good person.

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
We can rest assured

135
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
that you will take care of Brother.

136
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Leave it to us.

137
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
One has a brain,

138
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
the other has a brain

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
and strength.

140
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
So you don't have to worry about him.

141
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
I know you want to

142
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
fulfill his wish.

143
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
We are the same.

144
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
But now,

145
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
he needs you

146
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
to be by his side

147
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
more than anyone else.

148
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Go back.

149
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Go back.

150
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Dismiss.

151
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
What's wrong?

152
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Are you worried about the food?

153
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
No.

154
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
I haven't eaten for days.

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
I haven't eaten

156
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
such a delicious meal for a long time.

157
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Eat more if it's delicious.

158
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I suspect you.

159
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Drink slowly.

160
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
It's hot.

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
It's good for your health.

162
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
It can warm you up.

163
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
By the way,

164
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Feng Wu...

165
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
It's all arranged.

166
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Tong Shuang and Sister Huo will be here.

167
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Feng Wu will be fine.

168
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Just rest.

169
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Luckily, you are here.

170
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Thank you.

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
When I was lying on the bed today,

172
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
I remembered

173
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
many things that happened in the camp.

174
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
What things?

175
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Do you remember

176
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
you made a small mistake

177
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
and made them laugh at you?

178
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
In the end,

179
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
you threw a gunpowder into the room

180
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
while everyone was asleep.

181
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
They ran out

182
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
with their asses down.

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Of course I remember.

184
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Mo Chong and Liu Feng

185
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
ran out with their asses down.

186
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
My father punished me

187
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
for doing this

188
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
for a month.

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
You said you would catch snakes

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
while sweeping the floor.

191
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
You asked them to

192
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
grab your broom.

193
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Shan Buying

194
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
has never been so clean.

195
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
You didn't even

196
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
sweat a drop in that month.

197
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
One more time.

198
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
During the New Year,

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
we made dumplings.

200
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
You had to add vegetables

201
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
and a whole box of spices.

202
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
You said

203
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
whoever ate it

204
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
would be very happy.

205
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
But...

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
My father ate it.

207
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
You are usually timid.

208
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
You even

209
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
had a sore face for days.

210
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
You didn't even go to the morning court.

211
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
You said you were afraid of being laughed at.

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
You were a rich man.

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
You were poisoned by a bitch.

214
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
You... You're talking about me?

215
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
You were also tricked.

216
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I remember

217
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
the defense team thought

218
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
you were too young

219
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
and that you weren't convinced.

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Let's investigate

221
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
the missing Yu Bo.

222
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
But I've committed sins!

223
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
How dare you?

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
You're all wrong.

225
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:17,640
The

226
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
big tips

227
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
are to

228
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,480
…"get exhausted when you aren't satisfied."

229
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
What if

230
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm not satisfied.

231
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,760
I can't go back.

232
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,520
Xu Man.

233
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,920
Since you can't go back,

234
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,560
let it go.

235
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,960
When you move forward,

236
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,520
you can look back occasionally.

237
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,280
But you can't stop at the steps.

238
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,200
Xu Man.

239
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
You've grown up a lot.

240
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,720
You're braver than I thought.

241
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,760
You're stronger.

242
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,400
Even if you're alone,

243
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
you'll live a good life.

244
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I will.

245
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,120
If you want to see me,

246
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,080
you don't have to say anything.

247
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,480
You'll be fine.

248
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,600
I hope you can be warm and warm.

249
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,240
Don't ask about tomorrow.

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,640
A long journey.

251
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,680
Don't look back.

252
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,840
Don't feel guilty.

253
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,080
Break through the sky.

254
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,240
It's been so long.

255
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,680
Why is there no movement?

256
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,520
It shouldn't be.

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,520
I've made a deal with the crazy man.

258
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,880
Before dawn,

259
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,240
I'll send a message here.

260
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,320
It's almost dawn.

261
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,760
Will the crazy man be okay?

262
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,200
The situation is unclear now.

263
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,760
It's not a way to wait.

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,440
I have to figure out how to get in.

265
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,160
But the club is heavily guarded.

266
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,880
People guard every door.

267
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,360
There are patrols in the west yard.

268
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,640
Dogs guard the east yard.

269
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,240
Which door should I enter?

270
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,240
If there's a storm,

271
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,680
we can't hide people or dogs.

272
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,240
Then bring the people from the west yard

273
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,800
to the east yard.

274
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Spanter domestically knows poco a poco.

275
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,360
Don't forget it.

276
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,720
He's playing dagdug in front of the alert.

277
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,980
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

278
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,180
Meanwhile,

279
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,200
Time's black.

280
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,360
This is

281
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,840
it

282
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:11,920
It's over

283
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Yes

284
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,140
time

285
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,100
What do you want?

286
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,940
She's awake.

287
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,860
She was asleep so long.

288
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
What are you doing here?

289
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Come here.

290
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Rong'er, where are you?

291
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,140
It's so hard to find you.

292
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Rong'er, you know that?

293
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Rong'er, actually, I like you.

294
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,140
Open your mouth.

295
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Ah.

296
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Why am I here?

297
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,140
I was already lying down and asleep.

298
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,140
You guys brought me here, right?

299
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,140
Why did you bring me here?

300
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,140
What are you talking about?

301
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,140
My mom said that I had a childhood depression.

302
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,140
But I already took the medicine and slept.

303
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,140
But don't worry, my depression won't hurt anyone.

304
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
I'm very strong. I finally got in.

305
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Don't send me out.

306
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140
I already took the medicine today. How can I still have a depression?

307
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
You said it's impossible. You have to believe me.

308
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
I can't go out. I really want to stay.

309
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Enough. Stop talking.

310
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Go back and sleep, okay?

311
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Do you know where your room is?

312
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
I know.

313
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,140
Go back and sleep.

314
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,140
Ah.

315
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Can this work?

316
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,140
How can I know if I don't try?

317
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
I think it can.

318
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
You look so weak.

319
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
But you're willing to catch a crab with me.

320
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,140
Aren't you afraid?

321
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,140
Of course I'm afraid.

322
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,140
But I'm more afraid that something will happen to her.

323
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,140
Hurry up.

324
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,140
Let's go.

325
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
What's wrong with you today?

326
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,140
The dog is barking. It's not over yet.

327
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
Call everyone here.

328
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Go to the east and check it out.

329
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,140
You really have a way.

330
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
Let's go to the theater.

331
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,140
The dog is barking.

332
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,140
Crazy.

333
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Crazy.

334
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,140
Why are you here?

335
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,140
I'm worried about you.

336
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,140
I told you to come in and report it to the police.

337
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
What's wrong with you?

338
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
No.

339
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
I want to report to you, too.

340
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
But the people of Kena and their people are too tight.

341
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Someone is watching us eat.

342
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
They also put the drug in our food.

343
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,140
I had to pretend not to know and eat it first.

344
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
When they relax their alert,

345
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
I came out to watch this yard.

346
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,140
Is there anything suspicious?

347
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
There are many suspicious places.

348
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,140
They value physical strength.

349
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,140
People with strong bodies stay.

350
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,140
The cultural world is a net.

351
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
You can come in even if you get the wrong 24 hours.

352
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,140
And after coming in,

353
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,140
the food is very good.

354
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Those things are arranged for us.

355
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
The most important thing is that

356
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
they don't let us walk around in this yard.

357
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,140
That is a whole family.

358
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,140
I said they wanted me to be a strong man.

359
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,140
It doesn't matter if there is no news.

360
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
Remember, in their yard,

361
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,140
there is a hidden room behind.

362
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,140
I smelled a strong smell of blood there.

363
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,140
I suspect that's where they test people.

364
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,140
The ground line of this hall is very complicated.

365
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
Their personnel are highly compatible.

366
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,140
There must be a ghost here.

367
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,140
But it's not easy to alert them.

368
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
You go back first.

369
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
Tomorrow morning,

370
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
ask the people of Weizhou to come here together.

371
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Only go to the hall and catch the first-class.

372
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Okay.

373
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,140
Wait.

374
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
The dog won't bark.

375
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
I have to go.

376
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
Miss Huo is waiting outside.

377
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
Miss Huo?

378
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
How can you let a weak girl wait for you there?

379
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
She has been talking about you for a long time.

380
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I have no way to persuade her.

381
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
And she's not a weak girl.

382
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be able to come in.

383
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,140
But...

384
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Don't be so timid.

385
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Don't be so cold.

386
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,140
Take care of yourself.

387
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,140
I'm leaving.

388
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Promise me.

389
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Take care of her.

390
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
I know.

391
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
I know.

392
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

393
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,140
You two go back by yourself.

394
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,140
How is Feng Wu?

395
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Don't worry.

396
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
She's fine.

397
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Feng Zi has found the clue.

398
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,140
We have to go to Weizhou to call someone.

399
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Okay.

400
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Okay.

401
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
By the way,

402
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
Feng Zi mentioned you just now.

403
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Me?

404
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
What did she mention?

405
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
Guess.

406
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
What did she mention about you?

407
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Afraid?

408
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,140
Afraid of death?

409
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,140
Afraid of death?

410
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,140
Or afraid that you can't catch her before she dies?

411
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
All afraid.

412
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
Afraid that they can't accept me leaving.

413
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Especially Xue Man.

414
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,140
People's death is a long-term thing.

415
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
Afraid is also a human's life.

416
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Do you remember the first time you went out with me to handle a case?

417
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
That serial killer case.

418
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,140
That killer claimed that I was not guilty.

419
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
He came with a knife in his chest.

420
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,140
At that time, you were scared and shivering.

421
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,140
You stood still at the bottom of the abyss.

422
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,140
You ran to me right away.

423
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
You blocked that knife with your arm.

424
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,140
You didn't back down.

425
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
You stared at him with blood all over you.

426
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,140
That bastard was scared and lost his mind.

427
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
That moment of time,

428
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,140
we cured him together.

429
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
You were also very self-contradictory at that time.

430
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Do you remember what I said to you?

431
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,140
You said that no matter how evil a person is,

432
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
as long as you are not afraid of him,

433
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,140
he will be afraid of you.

434
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
That's right.

435
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
No matter how dark you are,

436
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,140
as long as you dare to open your eyes and face it,

437
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,140
your eyes will be bright.

438
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
Don't be afraid of things that haven't happened yet.

439
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
Before the knife hits you,

440
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,140
you still have something to do.

441
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
Don't forget that

442
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,140
you are not the only one who faces the knife.

443
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Don't think too much.

444
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,140
There are still a lot of things waiting for you to do.

445
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,140
The End

446
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
Catch it.

447
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,380
Brother Ta Provincial Governor,

448
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,300
that is...

449
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,580
Senior Brother?

450
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,340
You're...

451
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,780
I also want to go to Registrar's Museum.

452
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,180
Didn't you say it was all right?

453
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,980
I will stay here.

454
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,860
I can't leave everything to you.

455
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,420
And I will be lying in bed all alone.

456
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,500
Then you have to wait till I die?

457
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,180
relax

458
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,820
Minister Wang

459
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,140
Master Wang

460
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:52,660
I caught you

461
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,100
Oh

462
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,820
Minister Wang

463
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,100
The young men are engaged in business.

464
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,820
Then they are killed in secret.

465
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,940
To achieve your unspeakable purpose.

466
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,580
It's a big wrong, sir.

467
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,660
Our club is just responsible for

468
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
the bridge between the two sides.

469
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,780
It's purely a good deed of the common people.

470
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,660
There's no unspeakable purpose.

471
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,060
Do we have a copy of the paper?

472
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,820
That's good.

473
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,460
Then please go inside and have a look.

474
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,940
You can check it out.

475
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,060
It's good to clear up

476
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,260
our Yan Shang Club.

477
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,340
Open the door.

478
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,540
Please come in, sirs.

479
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,220
Don't let go of every corner.

480
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,140
Yes, sir.

481
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,900
Hurry up.

482
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,380
Hurry up.

483
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,020
Retreat.

484
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,460
Hurry up.

485
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,100
I'll say it again.

486
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,180
Open the door.

487
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,980
Sir, please don't.

488
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,540
There's nothing to see.

489
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,580
It's a mess inside.

490
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,340
I'm afraid of collision.

491
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,460
Sir.

492
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,420
Sir.

493
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,060
What's wrong with you?

494
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,340
There's blood on the ground.

495
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,140
And there's a lot.

496
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,140
What's going on?

497
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,500
Why is there blood on the ground?

498
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,540
I...

499
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,020
I...

500
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,700
I'll tell you.

501
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,900
I'll tell you.

502
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,420
This place used to be the kitchen of our club.

503
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,540
There were so many people in our club.

504
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,340
They had so many mouths to eat.

505
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,700
They would kill many creatures here every day.

506
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,420
It took a long time to get the blood.

507
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,780
Then a master said

508
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,300
this place was in the middle of the yard.

509
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,940
How is it?

510
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,860
Is it the blood?

511
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,660
The blood and the blood are of the same age.

512
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,500
It's hard to tell.

513
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,540
He suddenly checked the room in front of us.

514
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,060
The elite team is ready.

515
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:31,940
No.

516
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,700
Something bad is going to happen to the Phoenix Clan.

517
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,860
Where are the Yids?

518
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,420
They're all eating well.

519
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,140
Where are they?

520
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,860
Take us to see.

521
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,140
This...

522
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,740
Dai Luo.

523
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,740
Okay.

524
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,940
Sirs, this way, please.

525
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,100
What does he mean by calling us?

526
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,780
Yes.

527
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,140
What does he mean by calling us?

528
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,420
He's asking us again.

529
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,780
He's even asking for more information.

530
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,340
Yes.

531
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,580
He even said we're going to pass.

532
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,260
Okay.

533
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,980
Be quiet.

534
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,620
Sirs.

535
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,180
All the Yids are here.

536
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,500
If you don't believe me,

537
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,020
you can ask them yourself.

538
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,780
Are they eating well, drinking well and sleeping well

539
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,140
every day here?

540
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,540
Yes.

541
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,420
They said I was going to kill you.

542
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,020
What's wrong with that?

543
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,940
That's right.

544
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,180
We're here to eat well,

545
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,260
drink well and eat well.

546
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,100
That's something I've never seen before.

547
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,820
We're even wearing spiritual clothes.

548
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,100
It's so soft and good.

549
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,820
No.

550
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,100
There's no one left.

551
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,980
I have a friend.

552
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,300
He made it yesterday.

553
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,180
I saw him come in personally.

554
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,580
Now he's not here.

555
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580
Where did you hide him?

556
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,460
He's not here.

557
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,380
He left.

558
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,460
So,

559
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,980
the fat guy next to me,

560
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,380
he seems to have disappeared.

561
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,580
He seems to have disappeared.

562
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,180
Yes.

563
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,380
I think I saw him.

564
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,180
Sir,

565
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,100
I don't know what your friend's name is.

566
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,980
His name is Fang Qingzhuo.

567
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,780
Where is he?

568
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,180
Mr. Feng, right?

569
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,380
He's wronged me.

570
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,580
He's regretted it.

571
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,380
He's gone.

572
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,180
Gone?

573
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,780
You're lying.

574
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
He's not here.

575
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,780
He's not here.

576
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,780
He's not here.

577
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
He's not here.

578
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
You're lying.

579
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,380
I saw him last night.

580
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,580
I'm not lying.

581
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,380
He just left before you came.

582
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Besides,

583
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,980
he's the one who's got the legs.

584
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
I can't stop him from leaving.

585
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,980
Excuse me.

586
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,180
I need to make a careful judgment.

587
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,980
Brother, why are you here?

588
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Mr. Feng.

589
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,980
He's been investigated.

590
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,180
He's been searched.

591
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,180
Is there something wrong with Mr. Feng?

592
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,580
Even if they do it,

593
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,180
they won't do it here.

594
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,580
Before the people of Weizhou Camp came,

595
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,380
Tong Shuang was at the back door,

596
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
I was at the front door.

597
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,980
I didn't see Mr. Feng go out.

598
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
After they came,

599
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,180
all the doors were locked.

600
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,580
It's impossible for anyone to go out.

601
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,380
Mr. Wang,

602
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,180
we're all businessmen.

603
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,380
We can't make so much money.

604
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Tong Shuang,

605
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,980
before the people of Weizhou Camp came,

606
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
did you see a truck?

607
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,380
Truck?

608
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,180
But because it was pulling firewood,

609
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,980
I didn't pay attention.

610
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,380
In theory,

611
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,380
the truck should have been sent to the mall from outside.

612
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
How could there be a full truck

613
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
going out of the mall?

614
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,380
That truck is Mr. Feng's?

615
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Junior,

616
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,780
this is a special time and special method.

617
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
Let's go.

618
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,780
What a coincidence.

619
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,780
They're out again.

620
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
What's wrong?

621
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
I'm fine.

622
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,980
I'm fine.

623
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
I'm fine.

624
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
I'm fine.

625
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
I'm fine.

626
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
I'm fine.

627
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
I'm fine.

628
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
I'm fine.

629
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I'm fine.

630
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
I'm fine.

631
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm fine.

632
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
I'm fine.

633
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
I'm fine.

634
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
I'm fine.

635
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,980
I'm fine.

636
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
I'm fine.

637
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
I'm fine.

638
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
I'm fine.

639
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm fine.

640
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
I'm fine.

641
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
I'm fine.

642
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
I'm fine.

643
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,980
I'm fine.

644
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,980
I'm fine.

645
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,980
I'm fine.

646
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,980
I'm fine.

647
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
I'm fine.

648
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,980
I'm fine.

649
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Where's the ticket?

650
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,180
That's all yours today.

651
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,180
I have something on my dress.

652
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Fill it up.

653
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,380
And paint the dress funny with a drug used in film.

654
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,180
So these are red boiling anime characters

655
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:36,180
to suggest the right girl to be the kiss of a voorw DID zhu.

656
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,240
Xiao Wu is still living, we can't scal the poison

657
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,440
But can kill him

658
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,300
Our Feng Wu Ge Shui is still alive

659
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,440
We have time

660
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,640
We

661
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,780
We

662
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,940
What happened

663
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,860
Why we are locked up

664
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,960
We can't monitoring

665
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,780
Why is your hand bleeding?

666
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,860
I'm not worried.

667
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,140
As long as it's done,

668
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,140
maybe it can save us.

669
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,780
What's going on?

670
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,500
Do you want to live?

671
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,780
Yes.

672
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,260
We're on the same boat now.

673
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
If I die,

674
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,300
you can't live.

675
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
If I live,

676
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
I'll get out of here.

677
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,060
God wants to take our blood,

678
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,980
the elixir,

679
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,460
and catch it.

680
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,820
It's a great merit.

681
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,300
I can rest assured.

682
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,420
If I get caught,

683
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,900
my friends will find out.

684
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,820
Don't say anything.

685
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Keep quiet.

686
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,300
Okay.

687
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,420
Brother,

688
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,660
there are so many people.

689
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,660
How can we find them?

690
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,660
Let's split up.

691
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,420
I don't know how lucky I am.

692
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,620
My blood is not enough.

693
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,420
I owe you one.

694
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,820
I... I...

695
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,220
How can you talk nonsense?

696
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,020
Shut up.

697
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,300
If I don't release it now,

698
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,620
they'll kill me when I let them release it.

699
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,060
Release it.

700
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,580
Release it.

701
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
There's blood here.

702
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
It's not a big deal.

703
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
It's not a big deal.

704
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
It's not a big deal.

705
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
It's not a big deal.

706
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,420
It's not a big deal.

707
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
It's not a big deal.

708
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
It's not a big deal.

709
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
There's blood.

710
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
Where?

711
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Here.

712
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,020
The mark Feng Jingzhuo left us.

713
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,220
Is he okay?

714
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,420
We need to hurry.

715
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,620
He can't stand it anymore.

716
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,420
Get up.

717
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,020
Get up.

718
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
Go.

719
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,620
You usually send blood here, right?

720
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,820
Why didn't you send two people here today?

721
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
They're not honest.

722
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,020
It's almost a bad thing.

723
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,220
How did he get hurt?

724
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,220
There's so much blood.

725
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,020
He was hurt by a flower just now.

726
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,620
He wasted so much blood.

727
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,420
Enough.

728
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,220
Let's drag them in.

729
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,020
Go.

730
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
I'm so dizzy.

731
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,220
I can't sleep.

732
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,220
I can't sleep.

733
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
Brother.

734
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,220
What are you going to do?

735
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,220
You've already bled so much blood.

736
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,420
Let's drain it completely.

737
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,220
Come on.

738
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Don't struggle.

739
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,820
The more you struggle, the more it hurts.

740
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,220
When your blood is drained completely,

741
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
you'll be fine.

742
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
I'm fine.

743
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,220
I'm fine.

744
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
I'm fine.

745
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
I'm fine.

746
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
I'm fine.

747
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,220
I'm fine.

748
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
I'm fine.

749
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,220
When your blood is drained completely,

750
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,220
it won't hurt anymore.

751
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
Brother.

752
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,020
Is this dagger clean?

753
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,620
I'm a coroner.

754
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Let me tell you.

755
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,820
If the dagger is not clean,

756
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,220
my blood will easily be damaged.

757
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,420
After being damaged,

758
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,420
I can't use any medicine.

759
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,820
Is it okay now?

760
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,620
My clothes are so dirty.

761
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,820
I need to soak this dagger in water for a while.

762
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,820
Or you can use it to roast it.

763
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,020
Why are you so nosy?

764
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
If you keep talking nonsense,

765
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,820
I'll stab you to death.

766
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,220
No.

767
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,820
Do you know why your brother

768
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,020
asked you to let go of my blood?

769
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,220
He didn't kill me.

770
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,620
Because the living's blood is clean,

771
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,220
the dead's blood is dirty.

772
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,020
The living's blood is different from the dead's blood.

773
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,820
Shut up.

774
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,820
I can't shut up.

775
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,020
I have to tell you.

776
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,220
There are countless particles in the dead's blood

777
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,220
that will be brought into the bullet.

778
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
There are countless poisons in the bullet.

779
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,220
That's called bad.

780
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,820
That's all dirty stuff.

781
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,420
People who take the poisons will be poisoned.

782
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,620
You're wasting your time.

783
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
Poisoned?

784
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,820
So much blood.

785
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,020
Will the crazy man die?

786
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,820
He must be alive.

787
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
Crazy man.

788
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,620
Hold on.

789
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
As long as you don't die,

790
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,220
I won't call you crazy anymore.

791
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,820
I can call you Grandpa Crazy.

792
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
Senior.

793
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,020
Can you still hold on?

794
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
You have a family history.

795
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,220
Why did you want to run to the heaven?

796
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,020
I didn't know you were poisoned.

797
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,420
The heaven is a lie.

798
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
I'm a martial artist.

799
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,820
There is no immortal

800
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,020
in this world.

801
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,220
I want to tell you.

802
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,020
Did I tell you?

803
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,620
Shut up.

804
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,820
Shut up.

805
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
Water.

806
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,820
It's all a lie.

807
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,220
There's a black paper on his right eye.

808
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,420
There's a black paper.

809
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,420
You are

810
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,420
the holy master of the heaven.

811
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,820
You are the holy master of the heaven.

812
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,820
You are the holy master of the heaven.

813
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,420
You can still talk.

814
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,620
I am very grateful to you

815
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,420
for your contribution to the heaven.

816
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,420
After we get the flying ginseng,

817
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,820
you can enjoy the wealth of the next life.

818
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,420
Okay, flying ginseng.

819
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,820
You will be punished

820
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,420
for being evil.

821
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,420
Your sacrifice

822
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,620
is interesting.

823
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,220
It's different from other sacrifices.

824
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,220
You are my practise.

825
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,620
Your wish is very shook.

826
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Go, adjust the CFP.

827
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,620
Nowadays,

828
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,420
when yourblade is on,

829
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,820
it's about to shoot a admired monster,

830
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,260
phase two,

831
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,280
phase three.

832
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,420
Are you ready?

833
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,300
and his roommate.

834
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,380
He should be nearby.

835
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,180
I'm sorry.

836
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,820
I'm sorry.

837
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,620
I'm sorry.

838
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,420
I'm sorry.

839
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,260
I'm sorry.

840
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,220
I'm sorry.

841
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,220
I'm sorry.

842
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,220
I'm sorry.

843
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,220
I'm sorry.

844
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,220
I'm sorry.

845
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
I'm sorry.

846
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
I'm sorry.

847
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
I'm sorry.

848
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
I'm sorry.

849
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
I'm sorry.

850
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
I'm sorry.

851
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
I'm sorry.

852
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
I'm sorry.

853
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
I'm sorry.

854
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
I'm sorry.

855
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
I'm sorry.

856
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
I'm sorry.

857
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
I'm sorry.

858
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
I'm sorry.

859
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220

I'm sorry.

864
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,220
I'm sorry.

865
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,220
I'm sorry.

866
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
I'm sorry.

867
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I'm sorry.

868
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
I'm sorry.

869
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
