In retrospect, it was truly an odd night.

The vehicle is going off course. Re-routing now.

And that doesn't happen every day.

11

Oh, no.

16
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,390

Yes.

23
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,690
What's this?

24
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,859
I had been a reporter for seven years.

25
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,988
I had been chasing only facts.

26
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,460
So that was nothing but a fantasy to me.

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,269
I had no intention of taking the lead role...

28
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,130
in an absurd fantasy.

29
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,840
But there was one factor I overlooked.

30
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,609

47

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,228
- You took great care of the elders. - Gosh.

73
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,150

Gosh, we have clean water. It's peaceful here.

76
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,529
Isn't this a great place to live? Don't you agree, everyone?

77
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,460
- Yes! - Of course!

- It's nice to see him so happy. - As if.

- Gosh. - Go ahead.

91
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,488
- What is this? I told you no. - No.

92
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,798
- Say something. - Stop it.

93
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,699

97
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:54,640

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,580
in our village first.

99
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,779
Secondly,

100
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,678
I have our children to thank for growing into such fine people.

101
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,879
That's not true.

102
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,829
You blindly believed each other...

103
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,128
when you knew so little about each other.

104
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,600
No wonder you ended up in a tragedy.

105
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:19,168
What's he talking about?

106
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,869
- What did he say? - What is that about?

107
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,700
About 30 seconds later,

108
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,710
you will hear screaming from the hill in the back.

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,938
Six delinquent teenagers...

110
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,780
will start running in six different directions.

111
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,549
All of them will be high on super glue.

112
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,479
And the three of them will be girls from this village.

113
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,248
What on earth is he talking about?

114
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:38,689
Some kids from our village got high on super glue?

115
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,748
No way.

116
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:42,319
A TV reporter got the tip before the incident.

117
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,859
The reporter is coming here all the way from Seoul.

118
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,559
- A TV reporter? - A TV reporter?

119
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,228
The reporter will arrive in five minutes.

120
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,859
So you have about 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

121
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,758
You must fix this before the reporter arrives.

122
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,729
Who are you? You don't look like you're from here.

123
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,898
How dare you interrupt our picnic and make such absurd accusations?

Kim Hae Kyung, a senior from Class One at Woojung High School.

125
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,738
My second-eldest daughter is in that class.

126
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:04,850
- Lee Eun Ha in the same class. - My Eun Ha?

127
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,179
My adorable youngest daughter?

128
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,080
Park Yu Ri, also in the same class.

129
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,219
Wait. She's my granddaughter.

130
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,619

00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,858

- Somebody screamed, right? - Yes. Over there.

134
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,100
Has it been 30 seconds already?

135
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,210
This concerns our children.

136
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:38,879
Let's believe him.

137
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,659
No. That's not true.

138
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,460
I didn't do anything.

139
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,300
Gosh.

140
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:02,470
Drink it. The water here is still clean.

141
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,080
By the way, who are you?

142
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,180
Missing your footing on the cliff over there...

143
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,849
and ending your life at the age of 19 was your fate.

144
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,249
And I just changed your fate.

145
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,619
You are...

146
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,589
so handsome!

147
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,628
- What? Hey! You little... - Eun Ha. Gosh.

148
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:31,099
- Unbelievable. You crazy girl. - Eun Ha.

149
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,029
- That little brat. - Gosh.

150
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,768
- Snap out of it. - You little brat.

151
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,739
- Snap out of it. - Gosh. Look at that.

152
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,738
- Hey. Unbelievable. - Let's go!

153
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,009
Go straight. Faster.

154
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,779
- Come on. Hurry. - Hey.

155
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,478
What are you doing?

156
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,919
- Snap out of it. - Grandma. Grandpa.

157
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,849
- You... What did you do? - What is this?

158
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,449
- Gosh. What on earth happened? - What is it?

159
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,149
Come here.

160
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,758
- Come here. Gosh. - Let's go.

161
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,529
- Come here. - Stop it.

162
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,960
- He's... - What?

163
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,540
Do you want me to push you?

164
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,509
You're the one who coaxed others into sniffing super glue.

165
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,278
You may have made yourself look like you were at risk,

166
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,239
but the others were the ones who suffered death.

167
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,748
I'm not willing to help a delinquent who killed two of their friends.

168
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:21,979
So tell me if that's what you want.

169
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,479
I'll push you.

170
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:25,920
What's with that jerk?

171
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,889
Get lost, will you?

("Out of 10 Who Sniffed Super Glue, 2 Suffered Death")

173
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,268
Hold on.

174
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,899
Let's go check.

175
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,889
Goodness, that scared me.

176
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,519
- Gosh. - Gosh, they survived.

177
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,960
He saved her.

178
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,840
You think your life is hard because your mom is different.

179
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,109
What?

180
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,840

even if you're a little different.

183
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,220
So don't ever do something like this with your friends.

184
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:35,489
Okay?

185
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,489
I can't be bothered too.

186
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,899
Even without you,

187
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,769
there are tons of people to save in this village.

188

You brat. You just recognized him?

196
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,728
The next story is about teen delinquents,

197
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,899
which has become a serious social issue.

198
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,200
There are teenagers who got high on super glue right here.

199
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,739
Gosh, where on earth are they?

200
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,239
Gosh, pull yourself together!

201
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,778
Gosh, you.

202
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,180
How should we thank you?

203
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,350
It was just a one-time thing.

204
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,389
They're still young,

205
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:41,590
so you should all embrace them and lead them well.

206
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,190
That's what adults should do.

207
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,359
It's as if you read my mind.

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,960

210
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,528
You were precisely on time.

211
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,540
Tell me about it.

Yes.

223
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,359
Coincidentally, he's moving to our village from Seoul.

No, not yet.

229

There's a vacancy at the school I'm running.

242
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,789
I became a teacher,

243
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,050
which I'd never wanted to become.

244
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,399

245
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,999
which I'd never wanted.

246

were still alive there.

were women only?

00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,050
can commit a murder,

00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,740
I sent Professor Park the location.

362
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,280
Did you see the introduction I sent you?

363
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,080
Don't you see the dark circles here?

364
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:11,520
It was so interesting that I stayed up all night.

365
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,189
That's good.

366
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,790
It won't be torn to shreds this time.

367
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,060
You hate my sentences.

368
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,500
No, I don't. Why would you say that?

369
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,959
It's received well only when you review it,

370
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:27,399
so I can't really complain.

371
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,609
Anyone can edit it.

372
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:39,050
Of course. It was all written by you.

373
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,310
Let me take them.

374
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,750
This work is going to be a success. I have a good feeling.

375
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
They say good shoes take you to a good place.

376
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,859
Why are you wearing those shoes, then?

377
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,218
- Move. - I want a pair.

378
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,259
- What shoes are they? - Let me see.

379
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,289
Mom?

380
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,198
- Stop it! - Please don't push me.

381
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,158
- Don't push me. - Watch it!

382
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,770
It looks like a flea market.

383
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,168
Why are they making a fuss over some tacky shoes on sale?

384
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,569
- What's with you? - Come on.

385
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,810
- Yes, that's size six. - I'm sorry.

386
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,509
What a pathetic life.

387
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,948
- They're nice. - Size 6.5, please.

388
00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:48,709
You may be poor, but you should have some class.

389
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,719
Keep that in mind before you get older.

390
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,060
- Mom. - Hey.

391
00:25:58,219 --> 00:25:59,589
Yoon Young, how have you been?

392
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,530
What are we eating today? I'm starving.

393
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,899
You haven't eaten since you had to follow my mom around, right?

394
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,128
Your dad must be waiting. Let's go.

395
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,039
Let's get going first. We'll talk after lunch.

396
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Okay.

397
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,350
Gosh.

398
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:24,179
Yoon Young?

399
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,520
Mom.

400
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,919
Mom!

401
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,459
Mom!

402
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,429
Mom!

403
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,740
Seriously?

404
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,648
Are you out of your mind?

405
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,718
Aren't you afraid of cars?

406
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,719
You have such bad hearing. I've been calling your name.

407
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,219
I've been calculating how much I spent today in my head.

408
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,218
Fine. Don't yell at me.

409
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:39,589
I wasn't yelling.

410
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,159
This is good. Try these on.

411
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
What are they?

412
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:51,500
Come on. If they don't fit you, I should exchange them.

413
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,639
Do you want me to put them on you?

414
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:56,639
No. Later.

415
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
- No! - Yoon Young.

416
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,010
I told you I'd try them later. Get up.

417
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,480
Okay. Fine.

418
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,760
- Done. - They're perfect, right?

419
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,530
Is it because you're pretty?

420
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,260
The shoes are glowing.

421
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,600
They say good shoes take you to a good place.

422
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,669
Who believes that? That's silly.

423
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,810
Hey, these are not cheap shoes.

424
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,979
I didn't buy them at the store where you saw me standing.

425
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,780
I paid the full price at their brand store.

426
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,179
They're good ones.

427
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,919
That's not what I meant.

428
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,919
Who asked for them?

429
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,490
I told you to buy clothes for yourself, didn't I?

430
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,100
I don't really go anywhere to show them off, anyway.

431
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,529
That's exactly why!

432
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,830
So don't dress up like this...

433
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,969
- This... - What?

434
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,698
How many times have I told you to throw this away?

435
00:28:57,699 --> 00:29:00,840
Why do you like this tacky, ten-year-old scarf?

436
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:02,709
Just look at the people around you.

437
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,709
Who wears something like this? Take a look.

438
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,949
I shouldn't have gotten that for you.

439
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,919
Okay. You're hurting my ears. Stop yelling.

440
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:14,850
Do I embarrass you that much?

441
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,629
You work with smart, high-class people,

442
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,570
so people like me are a joke to you.

443
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,469
Why would you put it like that?

444
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,540
But you know what?

445
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,849
I wouldn't ignore you even if you wore filthy shoes...

446
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,010
or an old-fashioned scarf.

447
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,820
I...

448
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,749
would never ignore you whatever you wear or do.

449
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,790
Do you get it?

450
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,060
I won't...

451
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,129
I won't hang out with you either.

452
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,570
Mom.

454
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,709
I hadn't let her leave like that...

455
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,980
Seriously.

456
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,010
Could things have taken a different path?

457
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,119
I won't spend time with you either.

458
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,790
- Do you need a bag? - Yes.

459
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,719

543
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,790
I couldn't.

544
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,299
My dream couldn't come true...

545
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:49,000
because I had died too young.

546
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,139
Exactly a year from now,

547
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,179
I will die in the year when I turn 35.

548
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:01,079
Do you want to know what my death has to do with you?

549
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
That's because...

550
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:06,690
the culprit who kills me is the real culprit...

551
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,889
of the serial murder case in Woojung-Ri in 1987.

552
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460

553
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:13,889

557
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,580
That was the culprit's signature in 1987.

558
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:46,630
This was also found at the scene of my murder.

559
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:50,060
So obviously, you were the first guy the police looked for.

560
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:51,900
But you...

561
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,730
had died even before me.

562
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,739
You said that you didn't kill anyone.

563
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,940
And you couldn't live with the injustice anymore.

564
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,080
The night before your release... So it was yesterday.

565
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,049
You hanged yourself in your cell.

566
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:10,650
No way.

567
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:14,920
How did you know that?

568
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,219
It made no sense, right?

569
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,360
How could a dead man kill me?

570
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,529
So I decided to believe that you were innocent.

571
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,869
You tell me now.

572
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,839
Can I?

573
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,179
Can we find...

574
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,319
the real culprit?

575
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,819
We must.

576
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,619
That's why I'm driving off course.

577
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,829
And that's the only way you and I will have a shot...

578

I'm sorry for making you upset earlier.

582

I won't...

583
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,319
I won't hang out with you either.

584
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:56,089

586
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,759
I couldn't help but feel that we were growing apart.

587
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:03,529

She called you three times before she died.

620
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,350

How will we go see her?

- Yoon Young. - Dad.

626
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,670
Do you know why I tried so hard to leave home?

627
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,310
It's because I hated seeing you and Mom together.

628
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:44,520
That's why.

629
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,350
You always fought when you were together,

630
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,420
and you always left home whenever you fought.

631
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,560
Then Mom would always wait for you.

632
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:57,929
I hated seeing that every day. That's why I ran out.

633
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,029
Even when I knew that Mom would be left alone.

634
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,569
But Mom told me she missed me.

635
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:12,880
If she could travel back in time,

636
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,250
she was silly enough to say she'd come to see me again.

637
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:26,389
I...

638
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:32,400
I really want to turn back time, Dad.

639
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,900
If I could go back to the past,

640
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,040
I would go way back.

641
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:43,880

00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,690
It must've hurt.

725
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,529
There's no better reason to stop by. You need to relieve your stress.

726
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,600
Why is everyone getting in my way?

727
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:45,400
Are you interested in that?

728
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:47,199
I hear the prizes are pretty nice.

729
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,270
You get a Walkman if you come in third place.

730
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:51,210
So I'm going to compete with my younger sibling tomorrow.

731
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:54,310
That number is a typo, right?

732
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:56,610
What number? It's tomorrow.

733
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,420
"May 10." A Sunday.

734
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,819
Is it "The 4th" instead of "The 3rd?"

735
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:03,420
No, not that. The "1987."

736
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,259
It's 2021 right now.

737
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,989
What's wrong with you?

738
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,600
Are you badly hurt?

739
00:57:13,259 --> 00:57:15,029
(May 10, 1987)

740
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,369
(Sobangcha at Club Moon Night!)

741
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:25,040
(Club Moon Night)

742
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,779
Just go home. I won't keep you any longer.

743
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,020
Is it really 1987 right now?

744
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,060
Don't you know that the 1988 Olympics will be held next year?

745
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:43,960
A nightclub?

746
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,600
You want to go clubbing?

747
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:56,540
Then...

748
00:57:57,469 --> 00:57:59,639
did you think we'd go to a playground at this hour?

749
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,279
No, but still.

750
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,750
We're still students.

751
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:07,049
"We're still students."

752
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:10,190
Hey, Lee Soon Ae, are you making it obvious that you're the top student?

753
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,289
We'll be 20 years old soon.

754
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,359
What's so bad about going clubbing a few months early?

755
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
Also,

756
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,759
you guys got caught sniffing super glue.

757
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,630
Will you be okay?

758
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:23,900
That's why...

759
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,270
we brought you along.

760
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,439
You better be careful when talking to my mom this time.

761
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,979
We were...

762
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,239
at your house studying all night, okay?

763
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:39,719
I don't like lying.

764
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:41,350
Hey.

765
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,960
Do we really have to take her with us?

766
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,389
Of course.

767
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,460
She needs to be our accomplice to get our story straight.

768
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:53,258
She told my mom last time that we weren't hanging out,

769
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:55,029
so I was nearly beaten to death.

770
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:02,810
Do I really need to...

771
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:05,980
die before I can get married to Hae Sung?

772
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:11,650
Fine.

773
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,020
But are you going to let her go like that?

774
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:18,789
Of course not. We don't want to be stopped...

775
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:19,920
at the entrance.

776
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,429
Gosh. Darn it.

777
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,860
What should I do about this?

778
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,630
What should I do about this?

779
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:30,029
(Jeon Young Nok)

780
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:34,239
So you're saying...

781
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:36,369
this year is 1987?

782
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,579
If you're ill, go to the hospital.

783
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,110
Don't act like this in front of someone else's business.

784
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,080
My gosh.

785
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:46,649
Stop joking around.

786
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,589
Didn't I already tell you that I'm not in the mood?

787
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,789
Is this a filming site?

788
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,190
Where exactly are we?

789
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,690
So...

790
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,630
this is Woojung-Ri.

791
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,960
And I don't know what you mean by "filming site."

792
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:05,270
Forget it.

793
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:07,270
I can just look it up.

794
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,069
Gosh.

795
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,009
What is that?

796
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,750
(Please check your connection and try again.)

797
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:23,449
Is there no service here?

798
01:00:30,529 --> 01:00:31,860
Does the Internet not work here?

799
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,560
What?

800
01:00:34,429 --> 01:00:36,699
- Is there no service? - What kind of service?

801
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:42,310
What's wrong with this neighbourhood?

802
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:48,580
Take care. Don't ever come back!

803
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:51,549
Gosh, I almost dug my own grave.

804
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,190
- It's this, right? - Yes.

805
01:00:58,619 --> 01:00:59,860
Until...

806
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,600
- We look great. - Let's go.

807
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,799
Darn it.

808
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,698
Watch where you're going.

809
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:14,040
Okay. I'm sorry.

810
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:50,210
Ribbit, the frog is singing

811
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,579
The son, the grandson, and the daughter-in-law

812
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,109
Gather around

813
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,449
They sing all night long, but no one is listening

814
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,159
Mom.

815
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:18,540
Mom.

816
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,400
Right.

817
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:52,400
I'm sorry. I'll explain everything.

818
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,339
Sorry?

819
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:58,980
You must already be in a state of shock.

820
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,549
But the situation is worse than you'd expect.

821
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,779
We have just...

822
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:10,150
arrived in the year, 1987.

823
01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:12,460
And there's no way...

824
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,029
to go back.

825
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,489
We're stuck here.

826
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:26,739
Are you serious?

827
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:29,409
Yes.

828
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,839
Gosh.

829
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:33,439
Don't be too scared.

830
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,509
I'll do whatever it takes...

831
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:37,850
Then...

832
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:41,449
This is real. Goodness.

833
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,060
Excuse me.

834
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,989
You're laughing?

835
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,170
(We thank Kim Hye Eun...)

836
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,170
(and Kim Hyeon Mok for their guest appearances.)

(My Perfect Stranger)

839
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,589
Is this real?

840
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,059
My mom is alive?

841
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,729
- Mom? - Please, don't do this.

842
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,798
Are you going to hit me?

843
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,568
Mom, what's wrong? Why would I hit you?

844
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,468
Okay. We will start a crackdown on minors.

845
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:11,068
What are you punks doing here?

846
01:05:11,069 --> 01:05:13,039
- Get over here. - She doesn't attend our school.

847
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,209
Yes, you, right there.

848
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,678
Why are you feigning ignorance?

849
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:16,679
Are you sightseeing?

850
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,419
Why did you go into the club?

851
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,319
He suddenly looked at me...

852
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:22,749
What's your name?

853
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,350
My name is Baek Hee Sub.

(Epilogue)

855
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,069
Where were you until this hour?

856
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:41,239
Woojung-Ri.

857
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,139
Woojung-Ri?

858
01:05:46,779 --> 01:05:49,080
Did you say Woojung-Ri was your hometown?

859
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,150
Why there all of a sudden?

860
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,219
Well...

861
01:05:57,089 --> 01:05:58,719
I had something I needed to finish.
