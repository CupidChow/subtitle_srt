00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,480
The culprit... I saw him.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,550
I saw the crime take place.

8
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,788

Ko Mi Sook wasn't the culprit...

12
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,629
but a witness.

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,729
The culprit is a man,

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,700
and the only person who saw his face is Ko Mi Sook.

15
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,838

Lee Soon Ae, get up!

19
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:25,819
Soon Ae, it's me.

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,520
Another person died.

21
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,319
It was a boy this time.

22
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,329
A boy died in an abandoned house out of nowhere.

23
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,989
If not, Lee Soon Ae would've died.

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,359
If it hadn't been for you,

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,929
I would've been caught by the criminal.

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,430
How dare you come here?

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,370
How dare you threaten us with that stupid note?

36
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,609
I should have seen that brazen face of his!

37
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,609
- Please calm down. Get in. - Gosh.

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,910
That shameless jerk!

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,519
Yoon Young, get in.

40
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,850
You should come with us to our house for the time being.

41
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,919
Okay.

42
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,519
That crazy jerk.

43
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:40,359
That jerk has some nerve to show up here.

44
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:44,199
He came here and left a threatening note.

45
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:49,340
It means that he's not scared of getting caught.

46
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,539
This...

47
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,269
Is that what you think?

48
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,979
To me, it looks like the complete opposite.

49
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,590
This guy is utterly scared in case he gets caught.

50
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,120
He's trying to threaten her with this note,

51
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,190
so she stays quiet.

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,359
This was the first time...

53
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,430
he failed to kill his victim.

54
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,569
The fact that the victim is alive has shocked him.

55
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,910
But how come there are only two detectives on this?

56
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,279
- What? - Is there...

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,949
another important case in this village than this?

58
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,359
How come only two detectives came when we reported this?

59
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,590
Well, that's...

60
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,430
I bet the police don't want to turn this into a big case...

61
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,699
again.

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,889
What do you mean only two of us will go?

63
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,989
We need every detective we can get. And that still might not be enough.

64
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,589
The culprit was at the hospital.

65
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,630
Who said that was the culprit?

66
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,728
- What did you say? - What if some guy...

67
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,029
was playing with the note?

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,900
Why are you jumping to the conclusion that it was the culprit?

69
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,739
Don't alarm the residents. Just go quietly.

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,139
And bring that note to me right away.

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,410

74
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,910
What choice do I have? He's been on my back about getting the boy.

75
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,979
Forget about getting promoted to commissioner.

76
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,450
He might lose his job over this. So he can't give us any more time.

77
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,350
So what could I do?

78
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,149
Since we already have Ko Min Soo in custody,

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,220
he'll have to be the culprit.

80
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,590
So Ko Min Soo killed Lee Ju Young and Lee Kyung Ae.

81
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,589
Then another guy is responsible for the latest incident?

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,729
That's right.

83
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,830
With that, we would have at least closed one case.

84
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:31,600
We didn't find any evidence on Yoo Bum Ryong.

85
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,140
But we found evidence on the girl, Lee Soon Ae.

Right. This would have made sense without that note.

89
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,579
Then the note from the hospital room today...

90
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,780
That should never have been there.

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,350
about what happened tonight for the time being.

96
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,320
It could interfere with our investigation.

97
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,350
You understand me, right?

98
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,789
Of course.

99
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,059
I just want you to do one thing. Catch that culprit.

100
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,689
Okay.

101
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,229
Why are you leaving?

102
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,629
The culprit could have been...

103
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,400
one of the people who came by today.

104
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,570
But how come you're not asking her...

105
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,010
who stopped by today?

106
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,709
Oh, that. There's a separate protocol.

107
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,009
Just wait a bit.

108
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,580
How much longer must we wait?

109
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,989
What do you plan to do going forward with this case?

110
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,960
She even got a threatening note from the culprit.

111
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,660
Sending her home like this cannot be everything you're doing. Right?

112
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,439
I will go to the station and check on that.

00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:58,970

117

They're inside, right?

118
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:04,180

120
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,690
Yes.

121
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,460
We can tell what happened yesterday on the news.

122
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,670
I walked all over the village...

123
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,399
after leaving the hospital yesterday.

124
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,609
But the residents and the police...

125
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,210
were way too quiet as if nothing had happened.

126
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,249
This silence will not keep Soon Ae safe.

127
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,649
On top of that, the culprit left a threatening note to Soon Ae.

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,889
But no police officers are guarding your house.

129
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,700
We need to get the public involved in this case as much as we can.

130
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,330
The police must investigate more aggressively.

131
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,909
If the police don't want to do so,

132
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,869
we must make them.

133
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,749
I believe the surest way to get them to work is through the news.

134
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,450
If we disclose this case to the press,

135
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:19,290
the police will have no choice but to start investigating.

136
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,859
Once the police start investigating,

137
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,729
the culprit will think twice before approaching Soon Ae.

138
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,199
As of now, this is the only way to catch the culprit...

139
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,229
while keeping Soon Ae safe.

140
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:35,700
But...

141
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,540
To do that,

142
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,979
Soon Ae will have to be on the news herself.

143
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,249
For a victim's interview or whatnot.

144
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,379
I know what you are concerned about.

145
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,778
We'll have to make sure...

146
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,619
they don't recognize her voice or her face.

147
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,989
I know reporters who will do that for her.

148
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,729
I trust you, of course. But...

149
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:04,600
Even if we alter her voice and blur her face,

150
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,369
the culprit will recognize her.

151
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,139
Since it involves my daughter,

152
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,940
things could become even more dangerous.

153
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,379
Honestly, I'm not so willing to do it.

154
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,840
I have never...

155
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,479
cooked for you, have I?

156
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,820
I've always wanted to cook for you.

157
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,219
There isn't much because I had to prepare it in a hurry,

158
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,320
but please eat up.

159
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,359
Eat up, sweetheart.

160
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,560
All right.

161
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,739
No matter what happens...

162
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,739
Even if...

163
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,950
something heartbreaking happens to my kid,

164
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,350
I must feed the rest of the family.

165
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,889
That's how a mom feels.

166
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:38,090
Mr. Yoon, you may not be my son,

167
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,600
but I still think of you as my family.

168
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,359
Otherwise,

169
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:47,028
how could you have cared about us,

170
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,070
thought of us, worried about us, and helped us...

171
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,170
all this time?

172
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,310
Just as you said, it wasn't your matter.

173
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,850
It couldn't have been your business.

174
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,649
So if you...

175
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:06,190
think being on a news show is that important,

176
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,259
then I'd like to trust your words.

177
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,259
Will you be able...

178
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,299
to keep Soon Ae safe, though?

179
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,399
Honey.

180
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,269
Do you know what the police have told us the most?

181
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,710
"Calm down. Keep quiet."

182
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,739
Has anything been resolved for keeping quiet?

183
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,278
If we just stand idly because we are scared,

184
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,350
then what will we do about Soon Ae?

185
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,220
Until when will she have to stay hidden?

186
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,389
I want to be on the news show.

187
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,899
I want to be on it too.

188
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:53,930
I'm not the one at fault.

189
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,600
The one who should be afraid...

190
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:01,239
is the culprit, not me.

191
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,689
I know how difficult this must be for you,

192
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,489
but please do well since it's an important interview.

193
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,719
Focus on the mother and the daughter.

194
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,159
- Mr. Kim. Fix your shirt. - Okay.

195
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,258
Make sure to blur their faces properly,

196
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,800
and alter their voices completely.

197
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,398
The viewers should be curious about the assailant, not the victim.

198
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,470
Of course.

199
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,310
It'd be better if we could show it directly.

200
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,680
The police must've taken the matchbox...

201
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,648
and the note inside it, right?

202
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,518
Yes, we submitted them all.

203
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,679
All right, then.

204
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,549
We'll just start the shoot as is.

205
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,690
Mr. Kim. Let's start with the interview.

206
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,700
What are you doing here?

207
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,670
What about you? What are you up to in there?

208
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,109
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

209
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,790
How could you reveal the case the police are still investigating?

210
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,389
Without evidence, at that.

211
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,159
But is it okay to pocket a piece of evidence like this?

212
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,700
I just figured it'd be destroyed if it stayed in there.

213
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,169
You were right, after all.

214
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,739
I doubt that a man from the future lied to me.

215
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,249
Still, I didn't know we'd become that horrible.

216
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,018
There's another thing that actually disappeared.

217
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,519
(Case File on Lee Soon Ae's abduction case)

218
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,389
The note that was in Lee Soon Ae's pocket...

219
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,159
when she ran out of the abandoned house. It's gone.

220
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,369
You must know what that implies.

221
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,470
That's why you called them.

222
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,440
The journalists.

223
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,379
I will never let it go unnoticed.

224
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,879
It will cause quite a stir.

225
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,518
Captain!

226
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,989
- Captain! - What is it?

227
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,658
The reporters from a broadcasting company from Seoul...

228
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:33,389
are poking around here and there to investigate the case.

229
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,528
The whole village has been stirred.

230
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,060
A broadcasting company from Seoul?

231
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,330
In 1, 2, 3. Start.

232
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,368
At Woojung-gun, Woojung-eup, Woojung-Ri,

233
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,369
which has been chosen...

234
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,599
as a crime-free village for five years in a row,

235
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,608
a total of 3 murder cases occurred in the last 30 days.

236
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,539
The village will be stirred up even more from now on.

237
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,108
Last May, the culprit brutally murdered two women,

238
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:57,079
and they left their signature sign with the victims.

239
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,319
And one of them is the note where they left their message.

240
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,789
It was in this matchbox.

241
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,819
It was made by the teahouse...

242
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,330
that the youths of this town frequent the most.

243
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,489
Based on such facts,

244
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,499
the police assumed the culprit to be a young man...

245
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,168
from the same town who frequents the same teahouse.

246
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,198
They've been checking the customers who could be...

247
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,300
Everyone will be talking about the culprit every day.

248
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,878
And the culprit will be watching this from someplace.

249
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:23,009
The whole village is anxious...

250
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,479
because the culprit hasn't been caught.

251
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,948
On fourth, the victim who survived...

252
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,549
another incident,

253
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,479
was blackmailed by the culprit once again,

254
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,619
leaving the whole village in shock.

255
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,560
The moment I saw this handwriting,

256
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,159
I felt as if...

257
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,070
the culprit was watching me right next to me.

258
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:52,240
And the police aren't taking any action.

259
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,669
That can't be true.

260
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,179
We, the police,

261
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,050
will do our best...

262
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,919
to protect the victim.

263
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:04,649
Things will start to change little by little.

264
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:11,090
Report to me if you see anyone suspicious.

265
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,959
Hello, sir.

266
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,729
We'll be guarding the place around the clock,

267
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,159
so you can be reassured.

268
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,729
It's been a month since the investigation started.

269
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,540
Hasn't there been any progress?

270
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,240
Of course, that's not true.

271
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,050
We've already gotten our hands on the prime suspect.

272
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,118
We'll be forwarding him to the prosecution soon.

273
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,589
If things don't change, then we'll have to change them.

274
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,159
You can be at ease.

275
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,590
Even if they cover up the case,

276
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:48,030
it looks like they'll make Ko Min Soo the actual culprit.

277
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,270
As long as he's stuck in there,

278
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,869
a proper investigation seems impossible.

279
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,909
What about Ko Mi Sook? Has she not spoken yet?

280
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,750
What on earth are you saying?

281
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,379
I have never lied, Mr. Detective.

282
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,619
Ko Mi Sook.

283
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:16,790
Do you know how dangerous it is to lie to the police?

284
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,830
If you tell me honestly now, I'll look past your mistake,

285
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,959
but you must know that this is the last chance I can offer.

286
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,169
If we find the real culprit,

287
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:32,540
we don't know how much we'll accuse you of.

288
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,269
Do you think it's easy to confess that the only brother I have...

289
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,840
is a culprit?

290
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,049
I barely managed to confess...

291
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,809
after contemplating turning in my own brother...

292
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,550
thousands of times.

293
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,850
And you're accusing me now.

294
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,560
I actually saw it.

295
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,959
I saw my brother by the riverside that day.

296
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,569
Even if we provided her with evidence...

297
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,129
that Ko Min Soo isn't the culprit,

298
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,699
she'd say she couldn't see it.

299
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,840
It must've been the last resolution for her.

300
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,409
We can't just wait for her answer.

301
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,208
The more the reporters press,

302
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,520
the faster the police will try to reach a conclusion.

303
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,750
If we use our means,

304
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,689
we might be able to get the confession in a few days.

305
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,928
No matter how trash of a man he is,

306
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:28,060
we can't make him take a fall for something he didn't do.

307
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,399
And that'd be advantageous for the real culprit.

308
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,030
Ko Mi Sook isn't even budging at all.

309
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,840
How am I supposed to get Ko Min Soo out?

310
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,169
Is it okay...

311
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,340
for me to meet him?

312
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,550
(Storage)

313
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:04,799
Someone will be guarding the door,

314
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,330
so be done with it in five minutes.

315
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,510
Do you remember...

316
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,510
bumping into me at night on the 16th?

317
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,379
Goodness. What do I do?

318
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,490
He won't die.

319
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,530
Gosh. It hurts. I broke my arm.

320
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,199
I'm trying to get you out of here.

321
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,600
Don't try to get smart with me. Just try to remember.

322
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,969
What did you do, and where did you go after that?

323
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,580
About Lee Kyung Ae...

324
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,179
Are you going to tell the police?

325
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,580
That night...

326
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,250
you hurt your hand.

327
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,359
How did you treat that?

328
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,330
Did Mi Sook help you?

329
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:09,199
Mi Sook?

330
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,730
Oh, dear.

331
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,199
Gosh.

332
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,949
Hey, I'm dying of thirst.

333
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,080
Go get me something to drink.

334
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,919
Go.

335
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,990
I think we took a taxi...

336
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,919
and went to the hospital.

337
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,359
But I kept falling asleep.

338
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,570
Mi Sook must know...

339
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,169
where we went.

340
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,139
Taxi...

(Woojung-gun Taxi Driver List)

342
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,820
Stop.

343
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,689
Hello, excuse me.

344
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:47,529
I'm Detective Baek Dong Sik, who called you earlier.

345
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,158
So you drove some customers...

346
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,199
between the night of the 16th and the early morning of the 17th?

347
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,429
Yes.

348
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,070
Were they these people?

349
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:16,719
The police claim that Ko Min Soo is the prime suspect.

350
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:17,990
This is his alibi.

(Hospital Admission and Discharge Certificate)

352
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:24,898
(Medical Certificate)

353
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:25,899
Oh, my.

354
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:29,740
You're the one who tipped us off, but where do you get these things?

355
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,310
Do you really just teach Korean?

356
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,869
I don't think so.

357
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,080
By the look of him, he looks like one of us.

358
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,709
How many minutes do you think it will air?

359
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:44,619
To be honest, I thought of one minute and a half on the way.

360
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,820
Then it became 3 minutes and 5 minutes.

361
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,959
I became more ambitious as there seemed to be more to it.

362
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,290
How about 20 minutes, then?

363
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,859
Twenty?

364
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,399
Mr. Yoon, you don't seem to know how news works.

365
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,639
There's a certain format.

366
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:06,269
If you cover 1 story for 20 minutes, people will...

367
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,469
Will they get bored?

368
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,709
I don't know much about it,

369
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,209
but there must be viewers...

370
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,119
who are interested in watching in-depth reporting.

371
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,419
As reporters, you all must have dreamed of doing it as well.

372
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,359
Hey, isn't it the format you've been wanting to do?

373
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,800
How about covering the top 2 stories for 20 minutes each?

374
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,899
Well, it is, but I'm not really there yet.

375
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,869
You could push yourself.

376
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,209
Would it work?

377
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:41,869
I think so.

378
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,179
Gosh. The work environment in broadcasting got a lot better.

379
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,010
When I was younger, it was much worse.

380
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,780
It goes back to 1989.

381
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,319
I suggested covering two in-depth stories...

382
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,889
for 20 minutes each for the weekend news.

383
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,489
I was so young, but I insisted on doing it.

384
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,030
Don't you get tired of talking about when you were young?

385
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,869
Hey, do you know how ground breaking it was in our station's history?

386
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,369
That kid.

387
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:12,709
Will someone take out the one who wrote history, please?

388
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,540
That's what an anchor ought to be.

389
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,679
He's firm and adamant.

390
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,449
He's admirable.

391
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,280
Am I capable of that?

392
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,049
I think once you do it, it will be ground breaking.

393
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,089
Do you think so?

394
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,389
Why don't you talk to the director?

395
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,060
It looks like he used a fake name.

396
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,359
He was in the hospital from the night of the 16th to the 18th.

397
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,570
If that's true, Ko Min Soo can't be the murderer.

398
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,699
To confirm that fact,

399
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,570
I need you...

400
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:46,869
to wrap this up for me.

401
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:50,878
The police arrested and investigated Mr. Ko as a prime suspect.

402
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,449
However, we obtained proof...

403
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,550
that Mr. Ko had an alibi on the day of the incident.

404
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,850
Film the chief as soon as he comes out.

405
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,389
He's coming out. Record!

406
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,119
- Sir, can we interview you? - Excuse me.

407
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,219
Is it true that your prime suspect Mr. Ko had an alibi?

408
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,990
How do you already know that?

409
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,159
How will this change the direction of the investigation?

410
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,060
Do you have more suspects?

411
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,799
The residents are demanding measures...

412
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,300
to strengthen security in the neighbourhood.

413
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,639
The police will be able to overcome Woojung-Ri residents' distrust...

414
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,280
and win their trust back...

415
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,879
only by conducting a responsible investigation.

416
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:03,149
What?

417
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,119
What's wrong?

418
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,530
Can I stop by somewhere?

419
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,300
- Okay. See you at home. - All right.

420
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,469
I'll be quick.

421
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,790
Mi Sook.

422
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,560
Why are you standing there? Come on in.

423
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,399
What are you doing?

424
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,179
Hey, Mi Sook.

425
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,780
Who is this?

426
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,719
It's good to see you. It's been so long.

427
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,399
What are you doing? Did you forget to meet me today?

428
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,639
What? Are you two friends now?

429
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,209
That's good.

430
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:12,340
Why don't you come in with us?

431
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:16,750
Do you want to go back in as soon as you're released?

432
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,219
Aren't you coming?

433
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,369
I'll be back.

434
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,250
Okay. I'm in a good mood today.

435
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,850
Go. I'll see you at home later.

436
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,020
Why did you help me?

437
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,679
That darn necklace.

438
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,009
When you're nervous, annoyed, or bothered,

439
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,780
you fidget with your necklace.

440
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,750
And my stupid habit of spotting that before anyone else.

441
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,219
That's why.

442
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:14,230
How do you feel...

443
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,240
now that Ko Min Soo has been released?

444
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,449
You're finally crying now.

445
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,260
You weren't affected when you saw other people in pain.

446
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,459
Even when you saw Ms. Lee dying by this cold riverside...

447
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,899
without knowing why she deserved such a death,

448
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:49,669
and when you saw your classmate in agony after losing her sister,

449
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:54,169
you only treated it as a chance to make things better for you.

450
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,709
And this is when you're going to cry?

451
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:52,760
Wait.

452
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,708
I'll hold on to this.

453
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,080
Is that important?

454
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,949
You're not married. Why do you have baby clothes?

455
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,579
Gosh. Look at that.

456
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,320
Baby clothes and baby shoes. You have so much stuff in there.

457
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:12,850
Are you pregnant?

458
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,819
Gosh. It must be a boy.

459
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,889
I won't...

460
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:23,330
throw this box out.

461
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,230
Just throw out the rest for me.

462
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,900
Sure.

463
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,789
I was curious about how the case was going...

464
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,130
and concerned too. So I asked you to come.

465
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:57,429
I'm hearing a lot of chatter in the village. Is everything okay?

466
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:02,299
Your grandson is responsible for it.

467
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,739
You should have stopped him if it was going to be dangerous.

468
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:11,079
He's not even from here.

469
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,710
What if it puts him in the spotlight and they start wondering about him?

470
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,319
But thanks to him, we solved a lot of problems.

471
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:20,119
Soon Ae has protection from the police now.

472
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,860
And the police stopped framing an innocent guy.

473
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,528
You've done enough.

474
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,730
You should leave the rest to the police.

475
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,299
Are you listening to me?

476
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
Gosh. Look at that.

477
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:41,068
Baby clothes and baby shoes. You have so much stuff in there.

478
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,440
Are you pregnant?

479
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,850
I won't...

480
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:48,880
throw this box out.

481
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,580
Just throw out the rest for me.

482
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:51,949
My grandson.

483
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,949
Yes.

484
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,118
Sure. Okay.

485
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,219
Are you sure?

486
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,959
Don't insert yourself into dangerous situations.

487
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,460
Don't do anything. Okay?

488
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,068
Right. I have a favour to ask you.

489
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:09,428
Yes, go on. What is it? Tell me.

490
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:11,899
Soon Ae probably didn't get treated properly...

491
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,969
because she had to leave the hospital all of a sudden.

492
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,980
I wanted her to stay in a safe place with her family.

493
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,580
But not in this village.

494
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,250
Right. I was actually worried about her.

495
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,949
I'll look for a great hospital in Seoul.

496
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,149
I'll have the officers...

497
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,619
- accompany her. - Yes.

498
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,319
And...

499
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,330
can I borrow your car?

500
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,060
Yoon Young.

501
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,710
Were you waiting for me?

502
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:51,509
What's this car?

503
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,909
I'll answer questions on our way.

504
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,150
It will take a while anyway.

505
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,850
Are we going somewhere?

506
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:01,250
A beautiful place.

507
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Get in.

508
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,480
What do you think about the sea from 1987?

509
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:27,880
The water seems clearer.

510
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,080
Is it just in my head?

511
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:33,719
You should check it yourself once you go back.

512
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:37,389
There are so many things to check.

513
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:43,159
By the way, what made you decide to bring me all the way here?

514
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:45,799
Come to think of it,

515
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,929
after bringing you so far into the past,

516
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,310
I had never taken you to see a pretty sight.

517
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:57,679
After discovering the time machine,

518
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,449
I lived as if I were racing against time.

519
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,309
I wanted to try out the future...

520
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,949
based on what I knew at certain times.

521
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,920
I was all over the place.

522
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,960
So I had never thought about what I wanted to do at those moments...

523
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,759
or with whom and where I wanted to be.

524
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,259
I never had the luxury to think about such things.

525
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,369
So when you gave that some thought,

526
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,199
you wanted to see a pretty sight with me?

527
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,170
I guess so.

528
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,080
- What else? - What else?

529
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,088
I wanted to order someone's favourite food,

530
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,619
sweet and salty food, and watch her eat with gusto.

531
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,420
What else?

532
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,659
I do want to listen to her talk on and on...

533
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,230
about trivial things like what she likes and hates.

534
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,409
I like all of your answers.

535
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:04,440
Should we do a trial run with each answer?

536
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,580
Sure.

537
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,299
The best sweet and salty dish is tteokbokki.

538
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,400
Next.

539
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,339
An old bookstore.

540
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,839
I like the smell of old books.

541
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,209
I like how it feels on my fingers...

542
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,339
when I flip through faded, yellow pages.

543
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,879
And I like the excitement of playing...

544
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,179
a treasure hunt with old, hard-to-find books.

545
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,049
What else?

546
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,389
Friday at 3pm.

547
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,548
It feels like I have the whole world to myself...

548
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,618
three hours before getting off work.

549
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:50,889
You know what I mean, right?

550
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,360
I used to run the weekend news.

551
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,259
I see. You worked on weekends.

552
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:01,299
Then you must hate Mondays.

553
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,068
Sunday at 9pm.

554
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,400
That's the exact time my mood gets spoiled.

555
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,940
That's the exact time I start appearing on TV.

556
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,350
I'll start liking Sunday evenings.

557
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,019
This must be a popular tteokbokki stall in 1987.

558
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,159
The rice cakes are so chewy. It's so good.

559
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,859
Have a bite.

560
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,060
I have my own plate of food.

561
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,400
I'll eat it from mine.

562
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,569
Bus 540.

563
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,739
When I feel gloomy, I just sit at a bus stop.

564
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:46,750
I just get on a random bus and sit there thoughtlessly.

565
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,979
I just look out the window.

566
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,779
Once the bus finishes the route, I feel somewhat better.

567
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,149
And among all the buses,

568
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,520
Bus 540 has the best view.

569
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,989
I should remember that. What else?

570
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,860
What else...

571
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,400
I want to stop here.

572
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,199
It was supposed to be a trial run.

573
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,710
I want to hear...

574
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,080
whatever you were going to tell me.

575
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,150
That's why you brought me all the way here.

576
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,380
The case isn't even closed.

577
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,190
There's no way you brought me here for no reason.

578
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,619
How tough is it for you to bring it up? Why are we here?

579
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,960
Whatever I do,

580
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,529
you will trust me, right?

581
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,500
What's this about?

582
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,739
I can't tell you what I plan to do right now.

583
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,940
But I can promise you that nothing will happen to me.

584
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,279
So don't worry. And just wait for me.

Are you leaving now?

589
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,520
Yes.

590
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,449
I see.

591
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,790
Wait.

592
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,929
Can you walk me to the bus terminal?

593
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,900
It's scary because it's dark.

594
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:59,580
People have been filming this and that around the town.

595
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,750
I heard it was because you reported it.

596
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,319
I heard you've been providing information to them.

597
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:08,049
Everyone's been talking about it.

598
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,290
It's not even your business.

599
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:12,360
Aren't you even scared?

600
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,759
It is my business after all.

601
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,830
Living in a town with a murderer on the loose...

602
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:23,569
means someone close to me could be in constant danger.

603
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,069
And there are many people I want to protect.

604
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,080
You're a nice guy.

605
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,179
But I bet your mom wouldn't think so.

606
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,460
Did I cross the line again?

607
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:55,500
Sorry. I just...

608
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,670
If my son were to sacrifice himself to save someone,

609
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,069
I'd be so worried.

610
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,179
I don't think I've ever asked your opinion.

611
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,679
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

612
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,080
I guess I've been having such thoughts a lot lately.

The baby in me.

617
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,239
I've been collecting these for the baby.

618
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,150
I made some of them,

619
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,049
and I bought some of them because they were pretty.

620
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,460
Isn't this shoe really cute?

621
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:31,929
How can it be this small?

622
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,400
It's even smaller than my hand.

623
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,239
It feels strange to think of him walking in this.

624
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:44,480
Only those who are desperate...

625
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,380
to have a child collect those, don't they?

626
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:57,159
Yes, I've been waiting.

627
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,060
I've already named him.

628
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,799
Hae for "greeting" and Jun for "happiness."

629

Someone you'd be happy to see.

630
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:09,100
Hae Jun.

631
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,739
You were startled because he has your name, right?

632
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:15,310
I felt the same way.

633
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,540
Well, I bet the meanings are different.

634
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,350
I've really wanted to meet...

If my child...

637
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:36,360
were to look at me with sparkling eyes,

638
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,569
I'd find them so beautiful.

639
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:48,170
You even had such thoughts.

640
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,080

641
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,819

Our news show will exclusively report...

649
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:43,088
on two cases, which is a format...

650
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:44,759
we have never taken before.

652
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,960
and each case was investigated in detail.

653
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:53,298
The first case is regarding a serial murder case...

654
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:55,230
in a town...

655
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:58,238
that had no crime for five years in a row.

656
00:48:58,239 --> 00:48:59,400
- Hey. - Yes.

657
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:02,609
That's the report they filmed in our town for several days, right?

658
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,210

662
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,499
which has been chosen...

663
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,469
as a crime-free village for five years in a row,

664
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,699
a total of 3 murder cases occurred in the last 30 days.

665
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,809
Last May, the culprit brutally murdered two women,

666
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,449
and they left their signature sign with the victims.

667
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,719
And one of them is the note where they left their message.

668
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,250
It was in this matchbox.

669
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,289
It was made by the teahouse...

670
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,819
that the youths of this town frequent the most.

671
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:51,989
Based on such facts,

672
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,129
the police assumed the culprit to be a young man...

673
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,730
from the same town who frequents the same teahouse.

674
00:49:56,929 --> 00:50:00,028
They've been checking the customers who could be suspects...

675
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:01,729
by questioning them,

676
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,670
but there hasn't been any significant result.

677
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,638
The whole village is anxious...

678
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:07,338
because the culprit hasn't been caught.

679
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:09,408
On fourth, the victim who survived...

680
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,710
another incident,

681
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,609
was blackmailed by the culprit once again,

682
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,549
leaving the whole village in shock.

683
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,719
The moment I saw this handwriting,

684
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:26,520
I felt as if the culprit was watching me right next to me.

685
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,758
Goodness. What a creepy guy.

686
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:31,859
I know, right?

687
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,758
Could he really be someone from our town?

688
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:36,068
- What? - The police ought to give trust...

689
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:37,638
Maybe he's among us.

690
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,399
Goodness. That's such a horrible thing to say.

691
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,068
Don't you know how quiet this town is?

692
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:43,669
- I mean, it could happen. - That's right.

693
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,508
- Don't say such things. - I mean...

694
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:49,349
Next up is the exclusive report...

695
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,519

that the reporters obtained.

698
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:57,819
is the additional witness...

who has made a report...

700

706
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,718
I witnessed what happened at the abandoned house...

707
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,119
for the third murder case.

708
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,420
I chased the culprit...

709
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,259
and ran toward to the mountain at the back.

710
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,009
Mr. Yoon actually did an interview?

711
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:52,339
He said he'd blur my face,

712
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:56,179
but why didn't he reveal his?

713
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,619
According to what I saw,

714
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,389
he was wearing a black hat and a black jacket.

715
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,159
And the back of his back was torn vertically.

716
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,929
Is it okay to expose his face like that?

717
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:19,099
I know, right? He tried to cover everyone else's.

718
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,639
- But with his identity... - I know.

719
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:22,469
Yu Sub.

720
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,839
- Yu Sub? - Yes.

721
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:30,210
What are you thinking so intently about?

722
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,420
I was just...

723
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,150
I was just so mad.

724
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,219
Is there anything else you'd like to report on?

725
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,259
While chasing the culprit,

726
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,259
I saw his face myself.

727
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,630
If I run into him again,

728
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:52,069
I'm sure I'll be able to recognize him.

729
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,649
Can you go to Gyeonggi Province, Woojung-Ri as fast as you can?

730
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,679
Yes.

731
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,650
Since both houses are empty now,

732
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:38,420
we just have to wait until tomorrow night.

733
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,190
Do you think he'll really show up?

734
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:46,920
If he watches the news, he's bound to show up.

735
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,130
It'll be hard to resist after hearing that I saw his face.

736
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:26,860
What?

737
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:35,900
Why are you here?

738
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,179
What you said on the news...

739
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,409
How you said that you saw the culprit's face.

740
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:52,850
You were lying, right?

741
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,689
What?

742
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,889
What are you going to do if he comes and finds you?

743
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,920
Why would you do something so dangerous?

744
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,099
Let's get out of here for now.

745
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,330
How did you know?

746
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:10,699
How did you know I was lying?

747
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,170
How do you know...

748
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,670
that I didn't see his face?

749
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:18,610
How are you so sure?

750
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,949
Because if you saw his face,

751
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:31,790
there's no way you wouldn't know.

752
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,790
There's no way...

753
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,469
you could say something like that.

754
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:50,810
Do you know...

755
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,610
who the culprit is?

756
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,029
In that baby box,

757
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,929
there was also this.

758
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,000
He's supposed to be born...

759
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:19,500
in the winter.

760
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:24,710
I wanted him to stay warm.

761
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:29,650
I made it myself.

762
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,650
Do you think...

763
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:39,259
you can tell what this is?

764
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,369
Everything's mine.

765
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,170
The string that was used to tie those people up,

766
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,339
and the matchboxes...

767
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,350
They all belonged to me.

768
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:11,259
Our Hae Jun...

769
00:58:16,029 --> 00:58:18,500
I wanted to see him so much.

770
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,330
But now I don't know what to do.

771
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:29,739
He...

772
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:32,880
That jerk...

773
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,679
That person.

774
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:46,319
The baby's father...

775
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,330
is the culprit?

776
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:00,270
And that's why you left?

777
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:02,710
I was scared.

778
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,310
It was horrific.

779
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,449
I could no longer stay next to a guy like him.

780
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:17,690
Even this baby that I've been waiting so long to see.

781
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,259
I don't know anymore.

782
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,730
I don't look forward to seeing my baby anymore.

783
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:29,170
I don't...

784
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:33,440
want to meet him anymore.

785
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,339
The fact that the baby is his child...

786
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,909
is so horrific...

787
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,020
and terrifying.

788
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,029
What in the world?

789
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:12,369
Why is he...

790
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,770
Darn it.

791
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,750
Yoon Yeon Woo!

792
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:20,259
(My Perfect Stranger)
