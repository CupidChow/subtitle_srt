(My Perfect Stranger)

5
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,510
So, this is not a normal car. It's a time machine.

6
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,919
And you're a time traveller.

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,580
I got hit by this car...

8
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:55,591
and travelled back to 1987. Is that the story?

9
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,590
- That's amazing. - "Amazing?"

10
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,220
That's what you think, seeing my car like this?

11
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:01,929
I'll fix the car by any means.

12
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,260
Stay here until it's fixed.

13
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,100
I'm Lee Soon Ae. That's my name.

14
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:07,100
But don't call me Mom.

15
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,430
It really scares me.

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,000
What's your name, by the way?

17
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,641
I'm Baek Hee Sub.

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,839
Do all those girls attend the same school as you?

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,209
They just stood and watched you drown.

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,709
How are they your friends?

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,281
Can you just pretend it never happened?

22
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:21,250
Exactly a year from now,

23
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,450
I will die in the year when I turn 35.

24
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:26,179
That's because the culprit who kills me is the real culprit...

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,849
of the serial murder case in Woojung-Ri in 1987.

26
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,020
This was also found at the scene of my murder.

27
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:33,190
That was the culprit's signature in 1987.

28
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:36,061
I must send her back before that no matter what.

29

(Bong Bong Teahouse)

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,061
What is this doing here?

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,781
(My Perfect Stranger, Episode 3, The Secret You Have)

32
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,161
I know how it sounds.

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,531
You must think it's absurd and odd that there's something I must do...

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,001
when I ended up travelling back in time by chance.

35
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,501
But...

36
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,711
Out.

37
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,760
It's colder in here than outside.

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,661
So let's get out of here first.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,211
(Episode 3)

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,251
I highly doubt that we'll be able to go back tonight anyway.

41
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,901
You should go in and change your clothes.

42
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,091
Ko Mi Sook and Mom knew each other?

43
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,631
They were even in the same class.

44
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,100
And the novel? What happened with that?

45
00:03:57,001 --> 00:04:00,001
People don't really seem to like me.

46
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,741
So...

47
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,640
So what I'm saying is...

48
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:11,281
I want to die.

49
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,591
It had never crossed my mind that my mom had...

50
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,491
dark days like this.

51
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:20,061
But was this all of it?

52
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,491
All the moments I didn't know my mom had.

53
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,931
There was a time when I dreamed of becoming a novelist.

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,530
What's the plot?

55
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:32,671
Can you give me a signed book too?

56
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,070
You're going to read it?

57
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,640
Why would I read books?

58
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:41,181
How much of Mom's time have I missed all these years?

59
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,090
No.

60
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,830
I can change everything here.

61
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,111
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,520
How did she end up with this?

63
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,861
I don't think I can go back just yet.

64
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:32,631
There's something I must do here.

65
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,540
What do you plan on doing there?

66
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,541
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

67
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,041
You remember them, right?

68
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,181
These 2 female victims died on May 14...

69
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,090
and May 16, 1987, respectively.

70
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,291
And a woman went missing on May 20 and remains missing...

71
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,660
to this day.

72
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,030
Yes. I saw them in my neighbourhood...

73
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:05,631
or knew them from the area.

74
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,801
But you didn't murder these women.

75
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,501
It really wasn't me.

76
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,871
If only those detectives didn't pin everything on me...

77
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,671
I was wrongfully accused.

78
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,640
You must believe me.

79
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,121
Okay. And right here.

80
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,121
This was the list of prime suspects the police had back then.

81
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:31,220
There were three people including yourself.

82
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,791
Do you also recognize the other two men on the list?

83
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,601
Yes. It was a small neighbourhood.

84
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,770
Then...

85
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,501
tell me everything you remember...

86
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,970
about these six people including yourself.

87
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,410
Tell me everything even if you think it's insignificant.

88
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,811
It's been a long time. I'm not sure if my memory is accurate.

89
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,681
I'll only use it as reference. Don't worry.

90
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
I'll verify the details once I get there.

91
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,861
There isn't much information or evidence left for this case.

92
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,931
So I'll get as close as I can,

93
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,330
blend in as one of them, and observe.

94
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,871
I will watch every movement.

95
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,871
And I will have to wait...

96
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,311
right before the incident takes place.

97
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:34,251
Can you think of a place where at least half of these people...

98
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,191
were part of in 1987?

99
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,561
A place they were part of...

100
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,590
The school?

101
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,830
The school.

102
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,301
That will be my starting point.

103
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,241
I need to go to school.

104
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:59,881
The school. I need to be there.

105
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,681
It's hot!

106
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,450
- It's hot. - Are you crazy?

107
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:06,921
It's hot.

108
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:10,320
(Call to inquire about spies and communist criminals.)

109
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:16,830
Do they really give out cash rewards for bringing in a spy?

110
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,160
Why do you ask? Did you see a suspicious individual?

111
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,801
Everyone looks suspicious.

112
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,470
Look at that girl.

113
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,269
- Let's go. - Let's go for another round!

114
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,941
- Kyung Hye. - Goodness.

115
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,111
I even know how many pairs of spoons and chopsticks her family has.

116
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,611
She's a lost cause.

117
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,981
I'm talking about strangers who talk funny.

118
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,990
People who seem to have come from a different world.

119
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,251
I see. Strangers from a different world.

120
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,659
Right. And those people might not know where they are...

121
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,861
or what year or date it is.

122
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,429
- Right. They might not know. - Right.

123
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,430
On top of that,

124
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:56,101
they might be carrying a weird machine and saying weird stuff.

125
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:58,701
A weird machine...

126
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:02,010
Wait. I saw someone yesterday who fits your description.

127
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,340
I see. Right. I'm sure. I bet you see those people every day.

128
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,080
I see them clearly too because I have good eyes.

129
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,111
No.

130
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,510
Who is it?

131
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,020
Who are you talking about?

132
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:17,351
Do you think that makes any sense? You want to go to school?

133
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:20,461
You want to go there as a student, not a teacher?

134
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,790
Is it that shocking to you?

135
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,660
So shocking that you couldn't feel the hot water?

136
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,871
Well, as you can see,

137
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,740
once I remove my makeup,

138
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:40,940
it's hard to tell my age.

139
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:43,779
If I tell them I am held back three times,

140
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,920
I'm sure people would...

141
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:50,091
That's not what you should be concerned about.

142
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,991
Have you forgotten where we are?

143
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:54,491
No. It's hot. Slow down.

144
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,741
I haven't forgotten. We're in 1987.

145
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,711
We won't be able to go back for the time being.

146
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:16,150
You said having an identity would be safe.

147
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,020
You gave yourself an identity. Can't I do the same?

148
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,060
Give me the other hand.

149
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,420
Did it cross your mind that the order might be wrong?

150
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,861
There's no right order. It's fine as long as I apply it to both hands.

151
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,440
Oh, you weren't talking about that.

152
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:43,241
It's because of what you must do here, isn't it?

153
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,981
I think it's only right for you to tell me what that is about first.

154
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:05,930
Are you expecting someone at this hour?

155
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,241
Are you sure we can do this?

156
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,269
He's a teacher at Woojung High, nonetheless.

157
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,371
If the chairman finds out...

158
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,711
Gosh, he's close to our chief too.

159
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:37,030
What is Detective Baek Dong Sik doing here?

160
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,001
Hold on a second. I'll be right back.

161
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,381
What's going on at this late hour?

162
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,990
I'm Detective Baek Dong Sik of Violent Crimes Unit...

163
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,020
at Woojung Police Station.

164
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,091
We're here to check on something. Please excuse us.

165
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:06,461
Wait.

166
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:10,131
I think you forgot to tell me what this is all about.

167
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,030
Do you think that's necessary?

168
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:15,501
Right now?

169
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:17,731
Mr. Yoon.

170
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,540
Try calling the chairman, at least.

171
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,241
That dude from Moon Night always says this nonsense.

172
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,611
This is going to put you in a pickle.

173
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,231
Can I see your ID?

174
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:44,690
Let me see it properly this time.

175
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,601
- Sorry? - Didn't you hear me?

176
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:50,601
I got a report that a suspicious person is here,

177
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,601
so take out your ID.

178
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,170
I lost it last time.

179
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,361
It seems like this wasn't prepared with that much effort.

180
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,991
There seems to be no other way to prove their identity.

181
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,400
All right, then.

182
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,501
I'll take you down to the station.

183
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,501
Wait. The police station?

184
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,540
- Follow me out. - To the police station?

185
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,341
- Follow me! - Wait.

186
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:42,451
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,951
Are you acting this way because you've got the chairman's back?

188
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,519
I get that you're desperate to arrest her...

189
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,260
because of your performance.

190
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:50,461
I'm only helping you so you don't waste your energy.

191
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,160
This is only a waste of time.

192
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:56,101
She has a valid ID, and I have a way to prove it.

193
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,571
If you want, I can have you see it for yourself.

194
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:07,910
She has a valid ID?

195
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,111
Yes.

196
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,420
She is...

197
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,060
She is...

198
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:26,101
a senior in Class One at Woojung High School.

199
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,201
Yes!

200
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,821
- Are you serious? - Of course.

201
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,690
Forget it.

202
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,759
- Hi. - Hi.

203
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,060
Oh, gosh.

204
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,260
When was I born again? Oh, right. It was 1965.

205
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:31,659
May 15, 1965.

206
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,299
Sir, good morning.

207
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,429
Oh, good morning, Mi Sun.

208
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,570
- Hello. - Was it Mi Sook?

209
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,300
- I'm Mi Sun. - Right.

210
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,241
I'm really sorry,

211
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,510
but what came after 63 for my ID number?

212
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,581
Time out.

213
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,821
Come over here.

214
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,419
What? The school's right there! Where are we going?

215
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,520
- Gosh, follow me for a second. - What's this place? What is it?

216
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,430
Why does it have to be her of all places?

217
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,400
You are aware of how dangerous this is, right?

218
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,600
If things go wrong, both you and I...

219
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,799
will suffer a really awkward ending here.

220
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,871
I know that.

221
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,670
I realized it after what happened yesterday.

222
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,009
I'm going to school so things don't get messed up.

223
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,341
You need to state it clearly.

224
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,581
You're only going to school because you need to.

225
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:24,610
Well, considering how much of a crisis it was,

226
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:25,821
this actually played out really well for me.

227
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,850
"Played out?" I'm saying...

228
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,491
that you must be careful not to use such expressions.

229
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,560
All right, I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.

230
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,631
It's my first time travelling through time.

231
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,231
I know.

232
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,201
Why go to school when it's your first time time-travelling?

233
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,310
I must have a backstory, just like you do.

234
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,341
You thought I wouldn't know?

235
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,810
You could time travel freely,

236
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,750
yet you bought a house in a different time...

237
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,019
and went to work...

238
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,650
as if you were an ordinary teacher.

239
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,790
Going to work itself...

240
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,390
is already horrible in our lifetime.

241
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,929
You must have a reason that's more important...

242
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,199
than coming up with a dangerous lie...

243
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,541
so diligently.

244
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,980
But I won't ask what that reason is.

245
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:30,081
Don't ask if you can't tell me what your reason is.

246
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:33,121
Exactly.

247
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,621
Let's just focus on our own stuff first.

248
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,590
But I'll try my best so I won't put you in a pickle...

249
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,960
like I did yesterday.

250
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:44,531
Until we return to our time,

251
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,900
we're in the same boat.

252
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,670
You're only going to attend the school.

253
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,430
You'll come home straight after school.

254
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:53,170
Try your best not to stand out and stay quiet.

255
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,771
If you get in the way of what I do,

256
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:57,410
then your school life will be over.

257
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,940
Whenever that may be.

258
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:01,680
Deal.

259
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,351
Will the detective from yesterday come look for me again?

260
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,150
I'm not sure.

261
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,021
Let's get going for now.

262
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,291
Let's go.

263
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,440
Yes.

264
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,350
You don't have to worry about that.

265
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:36,650
Don't worry.

266
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:39,881
It's natural for things like that to happen while they work.

267
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,220
Just come visit me with a bottle of makgeolli.

268
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,760
Think of your friend who must feel empty...

269
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,890
after sending his son to a faraway town.

270
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,060
All right, then. I'll talk to you later, Chief Kim.

271
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:53,560
(Principal Yoon Byung Gu)

272
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:55,271
Goodness. I'm sorry about that.

273
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:57,801
That lasted for quite a while, didn't it?

274
00:18:58,841 --> 00:18:59,970
All right, now.

275
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I'm really happy today.

276
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,341
You are our first transfer students since our school was founded.

277
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,410
And we have two students, at that.

278
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,011
And on the same day, of all days.

279
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,649
And they kind of look alike too.

280
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,121
- No, we don't. - No, we don't.

281
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,600
I know that you saw each other in a club a few days ago,

282
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:26,700
but please greet each other officially.

283
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,531
This is Mr. Yoon Hae Jun.

284
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,101
If you look at him closely,

285
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,670
- he... - No, we don't look alike.

286
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Right.

287
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,381
Anyway,

288
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:44,081
he'll be the homeroom teacher for your nephew starting today.

289
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,950
Dad is someone's nephew?

290
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,551
Then he's related to me too.

291
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,960
Thank you in advance.

292
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,090
He's Detective Baek Dong Sik, and he's very competent.

293
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:59,630
Thanks to a guy like him,

294
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,100
our town is much safer.

295
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,970
We should always be grateful.

296
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I'd like to thank you in advance.

297
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,511
Why did you do that last night when you're so competent?

298
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,581
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Chairman Yoon.

299
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,220
It's all right. You must've had no idea that he was one of us.

300
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,890
As a teacher and a parent,

301
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,321
we all belong to the family of Woojung High.

302
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,429
So please get along with each other from now on. Okay?

303
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,631
The second forehead.

304
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:37,230
And I get to see the first forehead here too.

305
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,499
It's so fascinating!

306
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,571
Uncle, I get to meet the two foreheads here.

307
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,750
From what I saw,

308
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,851
it looks like you don't have a father.

309
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,730
Can you not talk to me?

310
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,660
What was it again?

311
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,330
You're transferring to a new school.

312
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:10,571
But seeing how you came here with your distant relative's uncle,

313
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:12,601
it's obvious what the answer is.

314
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,910
I know a dad who just doesn't show up for anything.

315
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,281
For 12 years from elementary school to high school.

316
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:27,350
The entrance ceremonies, graduations, and sports days.

317
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:29,150
A dad who has never shown up for any meaningful occasion.

318
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,419
A dad who was never part of my life...

319
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,730
because he was too busy drinking and fighting some random people.

320
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,061
Someone like him used to be my dad.

321
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,301
He sounds like an awful dad.

322
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,301
Gosh.

323
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:47,271
It sure feels weird to hear that from you of all people.

324
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:54,611
By the way, what's "elementary school?"

325
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:55,881
Primary school.

326
00:21:57,511 --> 00:22:00,450
I see. That must have been the name. Elementary Primary School.

327
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,660
Hey, seeing how you're here...

328
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,861
Does it mean Soon Ae also...

329
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:11,890
Hey.

330
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:14,101
Remember what I told you yesterday?

331
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:15,601
- Stay away from her. - Hold on.

332
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,370
Hey!

333
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,770
I warned you too yesterday.

334
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,301
I told you not to meddle in my business!

335
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:25,111
Hey! Let go of my ear!

336

(Teachers' Office)

337
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,180
Didn't you say that your distant relative's niece...

338
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,190
was nice?

339
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,890
Yes. She promised to be nice.

340
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,600
- He's so handsome. - No. He's the hottest.

341
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,560
- Hey. - She bought it.

342
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:51,830
- Hey, I ran out of my allowance. - Let me try this.

343
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:54,140
- I knew it. - Not these girls.

344
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:57,011
- Hey, do you have some left? - No. Give me one.

345

(Career Research)

346
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,440
- Is that right? - Yes, it is.

347
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Gosh.

348
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,249
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

349
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,821
- Are you all right? - Oh, no. That must have hurt.

350
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,021
Goodness.

351
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,591
Hey.

353
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,071
Attention. Bow.

354
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,341
- Hello. - Hello.

355
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,710
Come in.

357
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,860
She's a new student who will join your class starting today.

00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:47,990
Her name is Baek Yoon Young.

359
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,561
Because of a family matter, she took some time off from school.

360
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:52,189
So she's a bit older than you.

361
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,730
Who cares about age here?

362
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,000
As long as we're in the same class, we're the same age.

363
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,499
- Right. - That's true.

364
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,541
All right. You guys can sort that out.

365
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,811
No.

366
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:06,581
Kim Hae Kyung. Lee Eun Ha. Park Yu Ri.

367
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:09,881
You three. Kim-Lee-Park. You'd better behave.

368
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,281
If I catch you bullying her, I'll scold you. Okay?

369
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,020
Okay.

370
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,591
Goodness. You are high school seniors.

371
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,291
You guys are hopeless. Seriously.

372
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,091
Except for you, Mi Sook.

373
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,101
(Ko Mi Sook)

374
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:30,400
You can take the empty seat over there.

375
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:33,101
Okay.

376
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,740
That's all.

377
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,011
- Thank you. - Thank you.

378
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,790
Come here.

379
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,820
- Come on. - Hey.

380
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:56,660
- I told you no. - Seriously? Come on.

381
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,699
- You've got to be kidding me. - Nice!

382
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,030
- That's it. I won. - Hey. He's here.

383
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,200
- You. - Bring it back.

384
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:05,841
Be quiet.

385
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,970
Sit down. That's fine.

386
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:12,740
We have a transfer student today.

387
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:14,881
Introduce yourself however you want.

388
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:24,690
I'm Baek Hee Sub.

389
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,061
What? That's it?

390
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,230
Yes.

391
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,041
Giving a long introduction...

392
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,940
goes against the spirit of rock and roll.

393
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:52,821
- Nice. - Did you see that?

394
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:55,791
I see.

395
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:59,189
Okay. That's your concept.

396
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,361
You can't go against the spirit.

397
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:02,590
Sit wherever you want.

398
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:03,761
That's it.

399
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:05,660
Bye.

400
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,831
- Bye. - Bye.

401
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:16,940
What happened?

402
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,480
I thought I should stay here for a bit longer.

403
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:24,351
Aren't you happy to see me?

404
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,091
Do you like Virginia Woolf? Can I take a look?

405
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,000
Do you know this book?

406
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,170
"Give her another hundred years."

407
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:53,240
"Give her a room of her own..."

408
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,381
"and five hundred a year."

409
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,220
"Let her speak her mind..."

410
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,420
"And leave out half that she now puts in,"

411
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:07,261
"and she will write a better book one of these days."

412
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:12,430
"'She will be a poet,' I said..."

413
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,460
"In another hundred years' time."

414
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,740
That was the lamest thing I've ever heard.

415
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:25,311
(Career Research)

416
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:33,021
Hey, it's nice to see you.

417
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:46,601
(Diligence, Honesty, Commitment)

418
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,111
Gosh.

419
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,111
You must be an amazing guitarist.

420
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:03,750
You can hear that?

421
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,811
You put the selector on the fourth position.

422
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,781
You played the E chord with down-stroke picking.

423
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:11,621
Gosh. You have fast fingers and a good sense of rhythm.

424
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,690
I finally met my partner.

425
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,990
Nice to meet you.

426
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:20,700
My name is Yoo Bum Ryong.

427
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,430
You sound crazy.

428
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,311
Nice to meet you.

429
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,881
Didn't you hear me? I said, "It's nice to see you."

430
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:34,841
Shouldn't you at least say something?

431
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:39,220
It's definitely childish.

432
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,420
But you are being childish.

433
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,670
What's that?

434
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,210
I wonder if she's making good use of that.

435
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,250
- Come with me. - Okay.

436
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,960
Come with me.

437
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,561
Gosh. This is bothering me.

438
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,230
Sir.

439
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,101
Can you give me a minute? It won't take long.

440
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,781
Don't act like we're friends. Do you want to die?

441
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,861
I don't have much time. So listen up.

442
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:58,031
All right. Look right in the eye.

443
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,031
And glare like me.

444
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:06,601
You're good. Yes.

445
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,011
And then say this. "Oh, my. What's that?"

446
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,381
That's it. Then they'll lower their heads. Right?

447
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,950
At that moment, crouch down, pretending to pick it up.

448
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:21,420
Then come up while lifting your head.

449
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,021
That's going to cause a big nosebleed...

450
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,061
Hey, you're hopeless.

451
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,801
Now, pretend that you're pulling this trick on me.

452
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,670
See? I lowered my head.

453
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,440
Oh, my. Is your head made of rock?

454
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,081
So why are you teaching me this?

455
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Darn it.

456
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,220
My father taught me this.

457
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,561
When I started primary school,

458
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,761
he told me to use this trick to intimidate anyone...

459
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,230
who tried to pick a fight with me.

460
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,540
By the time I graduated, both of my parents had passed away.

461
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,341
So this is the only thing I learned.

462
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,980
It's been quite useful so far.

463
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,621
Gosh. I'm saying all dads would want to teach tricks like this.

464
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,281
So...

465
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:32,091
I'm sure your dad didn't mean to miss out on these occasions.

466
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:34,660
He must have had a reason.

467
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,831
- What do you know? - What?

468
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,200
This is such a childish trick for a 19-year-old kid to share.

469
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:50,511
I don't need your trick.

470
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:00,351
Gosh.

471
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,190
Are you all right?

472
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,660
- Your nose is bleeding. - Darn it.

473
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:13,531
Have you gone mad?

474
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,801
Can you be quiet?

475
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,440
I can't focus.

476
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,011
I think you've done enough.

477
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,680
Darn it.

478
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:36,220
Five-Second Prince is coming!

479
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:44,091
What?

480
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,390
- Attention. - Sit down.

481
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,261
Five.

482
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,361
Four.

483
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,400
- What's the countdown for? - Quiet.

484
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:23,430
You must enjoy these five seconds as much as you can.

485
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,470
Three.

486
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,101
Two.

487
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,371
One.

488
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,940
What are you supposed to do right after school?

489
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,611
- We go home. - We go home.

490
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,950
Yes. Go home right away.

491
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,390
Don't stay outside past 10pm.

492
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:47,660
Don't even go to the reading room to study.

493
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,021
Just study at home.

494
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,761
If you can't focus, just go to sleep.

495
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,430
Sleep is the best medicine.

496
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,930
Don't go to the hill or the river even during the day.

497
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,970
Just don't go there.

498
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,301
Don't even go to dark places.

499
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:02,541
Don't trust any strangers.

500
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:04,841
Bad guys will approach you while smiling.

501
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:08,209
Only think about coming to school, going home, and interacting...

502
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,881
with your classmates and your teachers for now.

503
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,250
Be patient for a few months until you turn 20.

504
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:13,951
You'll be free after that.

505
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,350
- And... - Can you just start your lesson?

506
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:24,991
Open your book.

507
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,470
We only have five seconds before he starts...

508
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:32,971
nagging us.

509
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:36,210
He's a prince for only five seconds. Five-Second Prince.

510
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:38,240
That's his nickname.

511
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,181
Do we have to listen to that before every class?

512
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,381
That's awful.

513
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,380
There are so many things he tells us not to do.

514
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,620
So he's also Don't-Do-It Prince.

515
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,150
Don't tell him that.

516
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,091
But why do you keep adding "Prince" to his nicknames?

517
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:58,230
How could you not?

518
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,099
Study the purpose behind the creation of "Yongbieocheonga."

519
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,801
Observe how the book was used.

520
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,971
Understand the distinct features...

521
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,670
of the book...

522
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,040
and the writing style.

523
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,471
All right. Firstly,

524
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,641
let's talk about the value of "Yongbieocheonga."

525
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:17,580
As I briefly went over yesterday,

526
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,180
"Yongbieocheonga" is the first epic poem...

527
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:21,850
that was written in Korean.

528
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,890
As it's the most representative work in musical literature,

529
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,920
it's considered an important piece in Korean literature as well.

530
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:27,919
This is a great literary piece to study the language...

531
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,189
from the late Goryeo Dynasty to the early Joseon Dynasty.

532
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,330
It's also deemed a valuable piece for studying history...

533
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:39,741
- Hello. - Hello.

534
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:45,641
Goodness. I hate boomers.

535
00:35:49,511 --> 00:35:51,150
I hate people who fight too.

536
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,750
I've told you many times to keep a low profile.

537
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:57,721
You acted like a UFC fighter on your first day here.

538
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,790
Let's just focus on our own things instead of criticizing each other.

539
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:03,891
You took the words right out of my mouth.

540
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,701
And stop staring at me in class.

541
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:16,200
Don't go anywhere after school.

542
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:18,741
Stay in the classroom. I'll come and pick you up.

543
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,840
- Mr. Yoon. - Hey.

544
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:22,881
Go on your way.

545
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:24,181
Go.

546
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:25,781
Did he drop his honorifics on me?

547
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:29,181
Thank you for earlier.

548
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,650
You complimented my writing homework.

549
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,891
I said it was good because you did a good job.

550
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:37,861
You don't have to thank me.

551
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,400
I was a bit shy about showing my writing to you this time.

552
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:43,700
Do you really think...

553
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,770
I can be a novelist when I grow up?

554
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,201
Of course.

555
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,641
It may not take that long either.

556
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,810
You may be a famous writer too.

557
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:54,111
So keep it up.

558
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,091
Does he know about her?

559
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,960
Well, she is a best-selling author.

560
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:19,870
(Academic Point)

561
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,511
She wasn't in the restroom.

562
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:27,940
Where did she go?

563
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:35,821
Did you bring it?

564
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,190
Yes.

565
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,721
Well,

566
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,391
I fixed some awkward sentences.

567
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,330
And I also fixed some parts that didn't add up.

568
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,270
The writing assignment is taking up a lot of your time.

569
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:13,420
But...

570
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,960
you mostly got rid of my sentences.

571
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:27,801
Well...

572
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:30,011
It's okay.

573
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:34,080
Well, the results come out better that way.

574
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:37,181
I'm the one who wrote it, anyway.

575
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,620
But anyone can edit it.

576
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:43,591
Don't you agree?

577
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,790
Right. That's true.

578
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:52,460
Don't come out right away.

579
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:54,701
I won't.

580
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,080
It's received well only when you review it,

581
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,420
so I can't really complain.

582
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,891
Anyone...

583
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:22,420
can edit it.

584
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,289
(Storage)

585
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,100
(Always beware of fire.)

586
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,181
So this is what you have always been doing.

587
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,290
I wasn't sure. But you were the same.

588
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,500
Do you even know how to write without other people's help?

589
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:04,729
I watched you do it for six years.

590
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,399
But it's shocking that you had to get...

591
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,100
someone else to finish your writing assignment.

592
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,939
If you truly believe anyone can do it,

593
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,841
you can do it yourself. How come...

594
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:16,709
you're so brazen after using someone else's time...

595
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,881
and talent?

596
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,420
No. You're not brazen.

597
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:27,820
Because you know this is embarrassing,

598
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,690
you're hiding here to talk about it.

599
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,531
I can't...

600
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,201
keep this a secret. Not here, at least.

601
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,040
Let's go to the teachers' office.

602
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:03,391
Are you okay, Mi Sook?

603
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,270
I did this...

604
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,571
because I wanted to.

605
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,241
The class will start soon. Hurry.

606
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:25,181
Let's go, Mi Sook.

607
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:53,640
What on earth did she do to Mom?

608
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:56,011
Why can't Mom stand up to her?

609
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,810
I'm sure there's something between them.

610
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,560
I've never seen you before.

611
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,290
Are you a senior in Class One?

612
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,071
Lee Soon Ae is in your class, right?

613
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,781
Soon Ae? What about her?

614
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:29,841
Can you...

615
00:42:30,611 --> 00:42:33,051
pass this on to her?

616
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:37,951
Yoo Bum Ryong.

617
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,100
Do you know how suspicious you look?

618
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,769
Don't you know you can't pass the hallways...

619
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,841
where the girls' classrooms are?

620
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,111
Do you find school rules easy?

621
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:01,011
No, sir. I'm sorry.

622
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:03,850
- Please let this slide. - Follow me.

623
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:17,729
(Let's move forward...)

624
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,631
(with our autonomy, creativity, and intelligence.)

625
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,571
- Are you going home? - Bye.

626
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,611
If Ko Mi Sook actually stole the novel that Mom wrote,

627
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:33,741
then what happened today must've been the beginning.

628
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,391
She won't be able to sleep well after what she did.

629
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,460
(Let us sacrifice ourselves and love each other.)

630
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:57,900
What's taking him so long?

631
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:01,870
He told me to wait right here.

632
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:17,250
Watch yourself.

633
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,190
What?

634
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:22,861
Watch yourself, Yoon Young.

635
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:40,911
Are you actually leaving?

636
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,580
The principal told us...

637
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,550
to attend tonight's get-together...

638
00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:47,451
no matter what happened.

639
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:51,221
He's always extreme with things.

640
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,190
Well, then.

641
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,391
He's been here for only a month. What does he know?

642
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,000
By the way,

643
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,971
why does the principal adore him so much then?

644
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,500
I'm sorry I'm late.

645
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:11,540
She's not here?

646
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,620
What is it?

647
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,161
You're not as smart as I thought.

648
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,960
Blackmailing...

649
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:38,801
only works on someone who's afraid of losing something.

650
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:41,470
I don't know how you bound up Soon Ae...

651
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,500
with such lame warnings, but listen to me carefully.

652
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,340
The cowardly things you've done...

653
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:48,980
and that you will do from now on...

654
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,210
They won't go your way anymore.

655
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,181
I will stop all of them, no matter what.

656
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,491
So it is you.

657
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:13,031
Mi Sook.

658
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:40,560
Where on earth is she?

659
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:45,631
The new senior girl in Class One.

660
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,241
What are you doing there? Let's go.

661
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,881
Mother told us to come home early.

662
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:04,620
I need to stop by somewhere. You can go ahead first.

663
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,100
Hey, Ko Mi Sook!

664
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,210
Do you think my sister just ran away from you?

665
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,019
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

666
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,821
I only happened to have the windows open.

667
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,761
I'm sorry,

668
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,661
but you don't know what Mi Sook is like at all.

669
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,959
Isn't it normal to know...

670
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,471
about your opponent if you want to fight them?

671
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,210
Where are you headed?

672
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:03,210
I should write a note to that transfer...

673
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,381
next time.

674
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,579
Hey, I thought you had a girlfriend.

675
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,350
Hey, don't you know that your feelings can always change?

676
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:16,190
Whenever I see a pretty girl,

677
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,290
I want to courageously give a love letter...

678
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:24,330
to her.

679
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,599
I might as well just hit on her for the sake of it.

680
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,169
For the sake of it? He can't even poop.

681
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,370
I should've asked for her phone number.

682
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,310
Gosh, if it weren't for the homeroom teacher.

683
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:37,551
Wait.

684
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,451
Tomorrow, I'll go to her without the homeroom teacher knowing.

685
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,620
- And I'll make it cool. - You jerk.

686
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,761
"What's your line number?"

687
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:53,091
It's 53-2355.

688
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:57,000
What? It's 53-2355?

689
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,471
Wait. I've heard of it.

690
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:03,500
Gosh, that's the homeroom teacher's number!

691
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,040
Yes, that transfer lives with me.

692
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,451
Call me if you miss her. I'll answer it for her.

693
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,850
Go home already.

694
00:49:30,571 --> 00:49:33,900
(Let's use it as though it's our own.)

695
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,100
What do I do?

696
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,790
I'm glad I found you. You must not have had an umbrella.

697
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:00,031
I can speak casually to you since you're in high school, right?

698
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,500
I'm 22.

699
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,330
Right.

700
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,841
By the way, what did you mean by what you said earlier?

701
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,741
That I do not know what Mi Sook is like at all.

702
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,051
You said she blackmailed you.

703
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,249
If you actually felt that she blackmailed you,

704
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,120
it's highly likely that she didn't.

705
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,761
I bet it was like a simple test on you.

706
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:31,661
A test?

707
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,431
You know,

708
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,161
how one tests what triggers you.

709
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:38,330
What flaws you might have.

710
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,641
Or if you have any secret weapons she might find useful.

711
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:46,111
Until she finds out about all of them, she never attacks first.

712
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,980
But once she figures it out,

713
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,951
it's the end.

714
00:50:58,391 --> 00:50:59,491
Blackmailing...

715
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:02,591
only works on someone who's afraid of losing something.

716
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:08,431
So it is you.

717
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,571
Watch yourself.

718
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:13,600
What?

719
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,301
Watch yourself, Yoon Young.

720
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,511
You said she was your sister,

721
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:23,710
so is it okay to talk about her this way when I'm a stranger?

722
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,721
I thought you were in danger.

723
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:33,091
When you charge forward after the target only,

724
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:35,560
it is likely that you will fall into a trap.

725
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,071
Are you okay?

726
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,870
You should've been careful.

727
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,060
Drink this slowly,

728
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:46,491
so you can come to your senses.

729
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:22,330
Darn it. She's driving me crazy.

730
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,010
Don't look at me like that.

731
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:33,511
This is my house. It's not some dangerous place.

732
00:53:35,681 --> 00:53:37,580
I admit it wasn't the best method,

733
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:39,551
but it's nothing much.

734
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,321
Let's just have a drink together and have fun.

735
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:45,690
It's because I like you. Got it?

736
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,560
Does Ko Mi Sook know you're like this?

737
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,801
I'm not sure. She may know.

738
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:02,600
She could be turning a blind eye.

739
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:05,870
That means this isn't your first time doing this.

740
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,451
It means you'll be okay soon.

741
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:34,770
Goodness.

742
00:54:36,141 --> 00:54:37,571
You have a cut.

743
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,091
I said everything would turn out okay.

744
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:23,681
How dare you...

745
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:35,531
You punk.

746
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,971
You punk.

747
00:55:47,071 --> 00:55:48,080
Are you okay?

748
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,080
Come with me.

749
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:21,841
You begged me to trust you, didn't you?

750
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:23,281
Please.

751
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,551
It really isn't me.

752
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:28,980
I was falsely accused.

753
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:30,920
Please trust me.

754
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,920
I'll see you in Woojung-Ri.

755
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,891
I'll tell you what on earth I was talking about.

756
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,391
So make sure to stay alive.

757
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:40,190
I was worried that you might not come.

758
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,631
No. I was worried that you couldn't come. I'm glad to see you.

759
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,480
Listen carefully.

760
00:56:57,951 --> 00:57:00,580
Your life will become painful from now on.

761
00:57:01,281 --> 00:57:03,180
I'm not going to take my gaze off...

762
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:04,620
of you for even a second.

763
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,419
If you need to pay for your crimes,

764
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,520
whatever they may be,

765
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:11,031
I'll make sure you pay for them all.

766
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:15,600
So you better get your life together.

767
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:18,270
Inmate 4013,

768
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:20,801
Ko Min Soo.

769
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:26,270
Who are you?

770
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:27,631
Can you move your hair?

771
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,460
How did you know I'd be there?

772
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,290
Because it was his turn.

773
00:59:19,591 --> 00:59:21,620
This was the list of prime suspects.

774
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:24,660
There were three people including yourself.

775
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,261
(Personal Information of the 1987 Murder Case Suspects: Baek Hee Sub)

776
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,999
The first suspect in the murder that will happen...

777
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,301
three days from now, Baek Hee Sub.

778
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:46,010
The second suspect, Yoo Bum Ryong.

779
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:47,650
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

780
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,250
(Yoo Bum Ryong)

781
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,919
The 3rd suspect, who served 30 years...

782
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,460
after being convicted,

783
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,020
Ko Min Soo.

784
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:02,060
(Ko Min Soo)

785
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,730
Those are the people you met today.

786
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,451
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

787
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:39,230
Who are you?

788
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,571
Why in the world did you come here?

789
01:01:20,741 --> 01:01:22,540
(My Perfect Stranger)

790
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,950
Two days before the first murder,

791
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:26,951
one of the suspects...

792
01:01:26,952 --> 01:01:28,620
had already been taken into custody by the police.

793
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:31,951
The remaining two suspects have not shown any singularities.

794
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:35,491
Right when everything seemed to be covered in fog,

795
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:37,620
she arrived.

796
01:01:37,991 --> 01:01:40,560
The first victim.

797
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:42,400
He...

798
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:44,571
knows something.

799
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:49,040
If she is not aware of what will end up happening here,

800
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:50,440
I need to let her know.

801
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:52,810
Since no one knows what's going to happen.

802
01:01:53,841 --> 01:01:56,011
