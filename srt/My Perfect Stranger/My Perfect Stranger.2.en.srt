In retrospect, it was truly an odd night.

The pool of blood found at the scene was tested for DNA. And it showed...

it belonged to Anchor Yoon.

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,409
Excuse me. What's going on?

187
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,779
Can't you see?

188
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,540
They're checking our IDs.

189
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,050
Take yours out already.

190
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:21,479
Unless you want to end up at the police station with them.

191
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,489
So that's how the IDs look like here.

192
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,319
There are IDs that look different from this?

193
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
That means you're a spy.

194
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:41,940
I think you made the wrong choice of words.

195
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,369
Sorry.

196
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,980
You punks. What are you doing here?

197
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:27,780
- Mr. Yoon. - Mr. Yoon.

198
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,780
"Mr. Yoon?"

199
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,888
I told you numerous times to get your act together.

200
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,750
How dare you come to a night club when you're high school seniors?

201
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,090
Come out here.

202
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,319
Mr. Yoon...

203
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,290
Please forgive us!

204
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,858
- Seniors? - Forgive us.

205
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,458
- Mr. Yoon. - What are you waiting for?

206
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,459
Come here.

207
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,429
Mr. Yoon!

208
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,429
- She's not in our school. - Yes, you.

209
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:50,300
Why are you feigning ignorance there?

210
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,309
Mr. Yoon!

211
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,080
What do you think you're doing?

212
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,379
Detective Baek Dong Sik.

213
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,389
Five days from now,

214
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,719
right after 2 murder cases and 1 missing case,

215
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,560
he suddenly quits his job after having worked diligently.

216
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,300
He's someone who will leave this town and go off the grid.

217
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,669
He goes off the grid for 30 years.

218
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
What did you say?

219
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,309
What's wrong with a teacher taking his students?

220
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,719
How could you put it that way?

221
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,719
The police are taking offenders,

222
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,560
and you shouldn't get in the way like that.

223
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,199
Don't try to threaten the youngsters by calling them "offenders."

224
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,570
Why don't you do your job and catch the real criminals?

225
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,540
What did you say?

226
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,409
Because you didn't do your job right, things got mixed up.

227
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,409
What you just said...

228
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,580
What do you mean by that?

229
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,520
Goodness, I appreciate your work, Dong Sik.

230
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,260
- Gosh, sir. - Hey.

231
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,600
Goodness, you're a father,

232
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,929
but you can't go home when it's already late.

233
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,939
This won't do.

234
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:33,069
- I'll give a scolding to Chief Kim. - Look at your clothes.

235
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,240
- You brat. You're out of your mind. - Dad.

236
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,809
- It's nothing like that. - You should go home, at least.

237
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,179
You should go home.

238
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,509
I'll take you.

239
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,319
- Oh, will you? - Yes.

240
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,618
Then shall I get in the police car since it's been a while?

241
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,490
Yes, sure. Let's go.

242
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:48,520
Hold on.

243
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,159
Come to the principal's office until 8am on Monday.

244
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,958
- Let us go, sir. - Yes, let's go.

245
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:57,959
Sure.

246
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,368
- Follow me. - Dad.

247
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,199
Dad!

248
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,219
Detective Baek?

249
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,090
Yes, I'm coming, sir!

250
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,468
(Moon Night)

251
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:39,939
Thank you. Have a safe trip home!

252
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:50,250
Wait.

253
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,060
Where are you going?

254
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:00,229
I'm going to take care of the things I couldn't because of someone...

255
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,859
I wasn't supposed to save.

256
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,830
Who are you, by the way?

257
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,070
Are you finally curious about my identity?

258
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,780
It was too hectic back there, so...

259
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,948
Besides, things are...

260
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,079
quite extraordinary right now.

261
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,019
You know that it's extraordinary,

262
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,689
yet, you're poking around here and there?

263
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:28,350
Are you here for a tour?

264
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,219
Why on earth did you go into a nightclub?

265
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,590
That's...

266
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,699
What about you?

267
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:45,708
Who on earth are you? How come you look so natural...

268
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,840
in this place at this hour?

269
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
You're him, right?

270
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,469
The one who hit me with a car.

271
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,269
It's beyond my understanding why it took someone of sound mind...

272
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,240
that much time to figure that out.

273
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:23,580
Yes, it is me.

274
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,949
Follow me.

275
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,320
You'll understand it faster if I show you.

276
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,030
So, this is not a normal car. It's a time machine.

277
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:45,260
And you're a time traveller.

278
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,100
I got hit by this car...

279
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:51,639
and travelled back to 1987. Is that the story?

280
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,939
- That's amazing. - "Amazing?"

281
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:01,010
That's what you think, seeing my car like this?

282
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,879
I'm not the one who caused this, am I?

283
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,719
Why didn't I think of that?

284
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:13,929
Why did I think it was only my problem?

285
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,330
Why did you get hit?

286
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:19,699
What?

287
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,500
How and why did you end up being hit by my car?

288
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,638
Is there a way to get hit?

289
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,570
I got hit because you hit me as the driver.

290
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,379
No, you don't know how this works.

291
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,080
This car can't bump into things.

292
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,649
It becomes transparent.

293
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:39,020
I've been travelling between countless points in time...

294
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,148
at least twice a day for the past two months,

295
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:42,790
but this never happened.

296
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:45,520
You didn't just get hit but also followed me here.

297
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,260
Which of us is likely to be a variable here?

298
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:53,500
A variable.

299
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,240
Does anything come to mind?

300
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,409
The music. Isn't it the music?

301
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,649
- What? - Right. It was a Sanullim song.

302
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,550
It was so loud that I was hurting my ears outside.

303
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,230
Laying silk in my heart

304
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:23,859
What does that have to do with this?

305
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,699
Did you make a call or something?

306
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:26,969
Make a call?

307
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,079
(Speaker)

308
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Hello.

309
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,179
What? Hello?

310
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,859
You did.

311
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,529
Isn't it likely to lead to an accident...

312
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,730
when you do such a thing while driving?

313
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,770
Look. It's designed not to crash in the first place.

314
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,199
It can't be covered by insurance here, anyway.

315
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:06,340
What are we arguing for?

316
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Gosh.

317
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,040
I was just asking to see If it could help me fix it.

318
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:15,080
Do you have a place to get back to?

319
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,820
You said you were a teacher here.

320
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:28,260
It looks like she didn’t really watch the news.

321
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,330
I was just on a trip.

322
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,330
The timeline you live in is my home ground too.

323
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,939
I just got a job to have an identity for safety.

324
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,850
You and I are in the same position since we don’t belong here.

325
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,649
Which means we could be in a dangerous situation.

326
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,250
Especially for you.

327
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,060
Hey, Mr. Yoon!

328
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,659
Are you all right?

329
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,459
Sir, I'm sorry for the trouble at this late hour.

330
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,790
Oh, my.

331
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,428
Did something happen to your car?

332
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,658
He seems to know a lot of people...

333
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,000
for a person who is not supposed to be here.

334
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,439
Hello, we're G-Rock. Thank you!

335
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,879
- Let's go! - Let's do this!

336
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:07,688
Stop thinking

337
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,358
And start talking

338
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,329
Stop the boring stuff

339
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,968
And start speaking your heart out

340
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,739
My body's fidgeting, I'm in a knot I'm hesitating, feeling unsure

341
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,580
My face is turning red I'm hesitating, feeling unsure

342
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,879
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

343
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,780
- Gosh. - Did I break your head?

344
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,719
I'm okay.

345
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:38,919
No.

346
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,790
I can't break 3 heads in 1 night,

347
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,359
so I should always be careful.

348
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,199
Wait. Stay away.

349
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,469
Let's keep that distance.

350
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,209
What is with him?

351
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,520
Are you okay? You've been walking in a weird way.

352
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:13,990
I'm all right.

353
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,760
I can't be covered by insurance here, anyway.

354
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:17,929
What about you?

355
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,329
I should be okay.

356
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,469
It'd get a little complicated if I died here.

357
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,770
It'd be the death of a person who was never born.

358
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,820
There is no way I can take responsibility for this.

359
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,520
This sweet, salty snack is the solution to everything.

360
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:50,429
Gosh. It's the worst.

361
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:53,169
Oh, dear.

362
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:14,719
Come on in first.

363
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,070
Drink some.

364
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,209
You could keep living here.

365
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,350
Are you cursing me?

366
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,219
Well, I have to crash here because I don't even have a house.

367
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,889
I'll fix the car by any means.

368
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:53,530
Stay here until it's fixed.

369
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,629
Try not to go out since it could be dangerous.

370
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,869
Why? What is dangerous?

371
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:04,500
Didn't you feel that way at the club earlier?

372
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,639
Do you have an ID?

373
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,540
What about a job? Do you have one?

374
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,439
I could be a spy.

375
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:14,980
I'll be careful.

376
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,820
Most of all, you could become a danger yourself.

377
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,289
If you drop a seed here by accident,

378
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,060
it'll become a tree in 30 years.

379
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,159
Your one action can completely change someone's future.

380
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,669
I'll keep that in mind.

381
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,569
- Hey. - Mom!

382
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,240
- Why are you so strong? - Let me go, Mom.

383
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,839
You brat! You went to a nightclub?

384
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,579
You want to get on my nerves just like your older sister.

385
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,349
- No, Mom. - Right? Shut it!

386
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,520
I don't need any of you. Just move out.

387
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,149
Goodness.

388
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:56,289
Honey, you've scolded her enough.

389
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,918
You can't kick her out in the middle of the night.

390
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,560
What? If you have complaints, get out of the house with her.

391
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,300
- Mom. - What?

392
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,428
- Mom. - How could you?

393
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,929
Mom, I'm sorry.

394
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,040
Soon Ae, take the punishment for a little while.

395
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:17,209
Oh, my.

396
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
It looks like Mr. Yoon is home.

397
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,399
Given the fact that she called him a teacher,

398
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,240
she must go to school nearby.

399
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,609
Her house must be in this neighbourhood, then.

400
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,590
Is that why I ended up in Woojung-Ri?

401
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,419
Because it's Mom's hometown?

402
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,959
Is that why I was sent all the way here, Mom?

403
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:46,869
Are you really okay with sleeping here?

404
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:49,469
I feel comfortable here.

405
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,139
If you need anything while staying here, let me know.

406
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:55,869
Clothes, food, or drinks.

407
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,179
Being a rich, jobless person is a dream I've had for a long time.

408
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,689
Enjoy it while it lasts since it won't take long.

409
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,359
I'm a better handyman than you think.

410
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,790
That's good.

411
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,699
Thank you for everything today.

412
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,800
You must've been quite frightened today.

413
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,770
Don't worry too much, and just get some rest.

414
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:30,409
I'll get you back home in no time.

415
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,629
This is killing me.

416
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:51,060
I'm utterly clueless.

417
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:56,600
Darn it.

(The first murder)

419
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,139
I must send her back before that no matter what.

420
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,449

Mr. Yoon. Gosh.

424
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,988
Hello.

425
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:58,229
It's 7am on a Sunday. What's going on, Mr. Lee?

426
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,230
I was wondering...

427
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,270
- if your forehead was okay. - Gosh.

428
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,639
- I see. I'm all right. Thank you. - Okay.

429
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:06,739
Then come with me.

430
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,069
Go where?

431
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,138
Don't tell me you're not going to participate...

432
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:12,678
in the Woojung-Ri Family Walkathon. I'm hosting it.

433
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,549
I already put your name on the T-shirt.

434
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,420
I see. I don't have a family here. And I'm busy.

435
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,488
There's someone in the same boat as you.

436
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:21,618
And that person needs a partner.

437
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,718
- Let's go. - Pardon?

438
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,419
- No. I was in the middle of... - All right.

439
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,759
I'm sure you'll have a blast once you get there.

440
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,369
Nice. That was some impeccable timing.

441
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,639
By the way, how can I find Mom's house?

442
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,139
Gosh.

443
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,580
Mom.

444
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:53,589
The super glue lady?

445
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,589
Wait. This is my mother's house?

446
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,230
Gosh. This is a miracle.

447
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,900
It's a miracle!

448
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,619
Why do you keep following me?

449
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,819
Because...

450
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,319
I like you.

451
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:33,730
It's fascinating.

452
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,259
And I missed you too.

453
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,850
Did your mom pass away?

454
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,350
Yesterday in the restroom...

455
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,489
Is that why you're staying with your relative?

456
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,210
I'm Lee Soon Ae.

457
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,509
That's my name.

458
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,150
I don't know if it's because I resemble her...

459
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,750
or because you've been sniffing super glue.

460
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,290
But don't call me Mom.

461
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,219
It really scares me.

462
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:42,759
Then can I follow you?

463
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:45,860

No.

Usually, my parents take turns working here.

471
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,989
But they have the Walkathon today. So I'm filling in for them.

472
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:49,130
I see.

473
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,100
Are you going to stay there?

474
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,139
I have to work now.

475
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,178
Okay. I won't get in your way.

476
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,909
I'll be outside looking around.

Mom, what are you doing here?

481
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,408
Your father goes to the hospital nearby.

482
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,610
I was so surprised to see you when we were walking by.

483
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,409
Are you busy?

484
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,778
- No. - Look how slim your face got.

485
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,449
- You'll ruin my makeup. - Okay.

486
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,420
The writer will be here?

487
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,319
Yes. Won't you be late for the doctor's appointment?

488
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,489
There was a time when I dreamed of becoming a novelist.

489
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:03,159
That's not easy.

490
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,630
What's the plot?

491
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,699
Can you give me a signed book too?

492
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,199
You're going to read it?

493
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,940
That's fine. You won't even read it.

494
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,710
Let's go now.

495
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,009
Right.

496
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,049
My eyes are getting bad these days. Why would I read books?

497
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,790
- Bye. - Okay.

- Don't skip your meals. - Okay. Bye.

00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,309
I'd be alone after the breakup

500
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,008
And I'd cry with a broken heart

501
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:57,948
I knew I'd regret it when she left

502
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,989
But why couldn't I tell her that?

503
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,719
Gosh.

As long as I can find some members,

505
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,860
I can easily form a band.

00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:27,589
It started beating like crazy.

547
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,730
It was as if ten or more drums...

548
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,330
were being played.

549
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:44,409
- Oh, my. - Careful.

550
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,880
- What's your name, by the way? - Sorry?

551
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,989
I'm Baek Hee Sub.

552
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,520
And what's your name?

553
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:04,199
Oh, gosh.

554
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,170
Wait, you're the first forehead.

555
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,210
What are you trying to pull here?

556
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:21,850
I need to talk to you.

557
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,179
Soon Ae, get back inside.

558
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,920
- So... - Come here.

559
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,089
So it's Soon Ae.

560
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:31,060
Come on.

561
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,259
Get back inside!

562
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,789
- You're quite strong. - Come here.

563
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,000
- What's the matter? - Come!

564
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,699
- What's wrong with you? - Just come!

565
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,569
They kind of look alike.

566
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,440
They're both so weird.

567
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,310
Is your forehead all right?

568
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,009
I guess your heart is feeling okay now.

569
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,810
It seems to be totally fine.

570
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,650
You're right.

571
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,549
Are your legs okay?

572
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,330
- Try running. - Run?

573
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,279
They're fine.

574
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:04,579
Since when did you speak in dialect?

575
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,548
Since I was born.

576
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:09,489
You're asking so many weird questions. What's going on here?

577
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:15,330
You...

578
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:18,659
Don't you dare come near Soon Ae.

579
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,770
Bread?

580
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:28,310
Gosh, you're studying hard as usual, our literary girl.

581
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,779
Hey, girls.

582
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,879
Come on out. We have somewhere to be.

583
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,009
But my mom will tell me off if I leave now.

584
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:38,650
It'll only take a second.

585
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,019
We want to do something fun at school tomorrow.

586
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,420
We wanted to plan ahead.

587
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:44,790
Plan?

588
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,360
Why must I do that?

589
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,959
Who are you to tell me what to do?

590
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,029
I...

591
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,069
am Soon Ae's BF, okay?

592
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:58,139
What? BF?

593
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,409
What on earth is that?

594
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,239
It means I'm her closest friend in this world, okay?

595
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,750
That's how close Soon Ae and I are.

596
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:14,548
I'm sorry about bumping into your head...

597
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:16,389
and cracking it yesterday.

598
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:18,659
Forget it.

599
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,560
As long as I'm here,

600
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,960
you'll never get a chance with my Soon Ae.

601
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,630
So quit now before you develop more feelings.

602
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,000
Why do you not like me?

603
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:45,350
"Why?"

604
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,460
I know who you are,

605
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,630
what kind of person you are,

606
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,299
and how light and insignificant your love is.

607
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,239
I've seen it all.

608
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,339
What...

609
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:13,909
Who are you to say that?

610
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,909
How would you know?

00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:37,239

Please find him.

645
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,738
Gosh.

646
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:27,380
I didn't even expect to join the walkathon this year,

647
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,310
but I'm really glad I did.

648
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,549
I could only be on the sidelines and clap for them.

649
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,250
I see.

650
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,460
I heard the prize for third place is a Walkman.

651
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:42,389
I think we can win that much.

652

All you have is money. Gosh, you're so cheap.

653
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:49,928
The only family I have is my son,

654
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:51,699
but I sent him to the US to study.

655
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:55,940
Waiting for his return is the only joy in life.

656
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,909
Since when did you adore him so much?

657
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:02,710
Sorry? What have you been mumbling all this time?

658
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,889
You need to speed up if you want to win third place.

659
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,619
Third place? Right, the Walkman.

It's a Family Walkathon.

664
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,868

I'll only be able to fix it if I go back.

I told her not to go outside, but she couldn't even last a day.

668
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,799
It's almost as if she'd had this planned.

So? You don't want to do it?

680
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,730
You just need to pretend to have lost it.

00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,319
how many people became fans because of your first novel?

728
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:56,790
I'm the first fan of yours.

729
00:59:58,259 --> 00:59:59,330
Right?

730
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:02,000
You're Ko Mi Sook, right?

731
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,009
How do you know my name?

732
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:40,969
Soon Ae, are you okay?

733
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,839
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

734
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,239
I'm going home.

735
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:49,679
Let's go, Soon Ae.

736
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:52,719
Let's go.

737
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,489
There's a big hospital at our town's intersection.

738
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:01,560
My mom's a doctor there.

739
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:04,329
If her condition gets worse, make sure to take her there.

740
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,659
I'll put in a good word.

741
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:10,929
Come on. Let's go, Soon Ae.

742
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,009
I'm sorry, Soon Ae.

743
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,080
See you at school tomorrow.

744
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,429
I'm sorry. I'm not good at swimming.

745
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,830
I caused such an inconvenience.

746
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,480
Do all those girls attend the same school as you?

747
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:53,679
Even Ko Mi Sook?

748
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:57,279
Yes, we're friends in the same class.

749
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:00,449
They just stood and watched you drown. How are they your friends?

750
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,830
You can be honest with me.

751
01:02:13,929 --> 01:02:15,330
Do they bully you?

752
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:16,429
No.

753
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:18,739
They were just joking.

754
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,210
"Joking?"

755
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,179
How is that a joke, Soon Ae?

756
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:29,810
Can you just pretend it never happened?

757
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:34,919
Still, they're the only friends I can talk to...

758
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,219
at school.

759
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:41,730
People don't really seem to like me.

760
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:48,069
So no one wants to talk to me.

761
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:50,230
That's why...

762
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:53,940
I need to continue being friends with them.

763
01:02:55,569 --> 01:02:57,810
And everything needs to be a joke.

764
01:02:59,779 --> 01:03:00,779
So...

765
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,750
So what I'm saying is...

766
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,889
I want to die.

767
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,009
Hey, Lee Soon Ae!

768
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,420
What are you doing over there? Hurry up and come inside.

769
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,319
Please keep what happened today a secret.

770
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,428
Go back inside.

771
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,230
(Congratulations on hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics.)

772
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,139
Have you ever...

773
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:11,310
realized how someone felt,

774
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,679
but it was too late?

775
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,719
If only I had realized a little earlier.

776
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,619
If only I knew a bit faster,

777
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,790
everything could've changed.

778
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,100
But that's not the case here.

779
01:05:39,799 --> 01:05:41,968
In this place, it's not too late.

780
01:05:41,969 --> 01:05:43,540
Nothing has happened yet.

781
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:50,449
I'm sorry,

782
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,989
but I don't think I can go back just yet.

783
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,619
There's something I must do here.

784
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,429
(My Perfect Stranger)

785
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,999
I need to go to school.

786
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,408
If I remove my makeup,

787
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:49,738
I don't look my age.

788
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,778
Do you think that makes sense?

789
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:53,479
You want to go as a student, not a teacher?

790
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,380
I need to see your ID for real this time.

791
01:06:55,549 --> 01:06:57,349
Her identity is verified?

792
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:00,649
She is a senior in Class One at Woojung High School.

793
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,849
What happened?

794
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:02,850
Aren't you glad to see me?

795
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:05,060
Unbelievable. What nonsense.

796
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,419
The list of prime suspects.

797
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,588
Three people.

798
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:09,729
I'm going to move as close as possible.

799
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,658
I'll blend in with them and keep my eyes on them.

800
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:13,960
The school is my starting point.

801
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:29,580
