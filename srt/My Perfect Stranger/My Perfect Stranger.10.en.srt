(Previously)

6
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:48,819
You remember them, right?

7
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,420
These 2 female victims died on May 14...

8
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,859
and May 16, 1987, respectively.

9
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,490
And a woman went missing on May 20 and remains missing to this day.

10
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,958
Because of a note she left behind,

11
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,230
she was thought to have run away from home.

12
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:04,969
But she died.

13
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,130
I only told you the things that were written here.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,800
It's a novel written by Ko Mi Sook.

15
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,809
Anyway, that's what was written in the manuscript. Three women died.

16
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,209
And that the real culprit couldn't be caught until the end.

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,280
Do you want Ko Mi Sook to be the culprit?

18
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,579
So you are asking why the murderers in my novel...

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,280
were women only?

20
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:25,919
Just as any man can commit a murder,

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,360
any woman can commit a brutal murder.

22
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,819
I only choose the stories...

23
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,300
that I'm more familiar with to write a novel.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,569
The Ko Mi Sook that I know is more than capable of doing all of that.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,699

(Inn Entrance)

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,619
Perhaps, some truth...

30
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,619
is bound to reach its destination.

31
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,929
Even if it has to travel for a long time,

32
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,759
it reaches the intended person.

33
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,930
Do you think you can walk?

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,069
Let's go to the hospital.

35
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,269
No.

36
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,769
I came out of the inn alone.

37
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,210
I can't be that shameless. I don't deserve to be treated.

38
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,449
Until my brother comes out,

39
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm not going anywhere.

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,900
That's what you probably thought.

41
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,370
You probably let your leg go untreated...

42
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,069
when you were here alone.

43
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,310
But not now.

44
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,850
I won't let you do that.

45
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,789
- Let go of me. - Be careful.

46
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,470
Just leave me alone.

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,370
I have to go to my brother.

48
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,489
Please take good care of Hee Sub once he comes out.

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Wait.

50
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,530
Actually, as soon as they took Baek Hee Sub,

51
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,059
I called my colleagues right away.

52
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,129
They will arrive in 50 minutes. So they'll be here soon.

53
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,469
- Are you sure it's Woojung Inn? - Yes, that's it.

54
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,139
- What room? - Room 204.

55
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,978
- Seriously? What's the room number? - It's Room 204.

56
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,239
Hey, go up to Room 204.

57
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,950
Darn it.

58
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:42,979
I understand our current situation.

59
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,090
But...

60
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,020
No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

61
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:09,780
Just like you said,

62
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,850
there might not be a good plan here.

63
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,919
But there is someone even those people can't beat.

64
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,419
Someone who knows the future.

65
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,460
TV reporters got a tip and will arrive here shortly.

66
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,859
Fifteen minutes.

67
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,299
Someone who knows that everything will end in 15 minutes.

68
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,400
You are the only one in the room who knows that.

69
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,410
Get your brother out first.

70
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,979
And stall as much time as you can, so you don't worsen your injury.

71
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:45,609
Just be safe for 15 minutes.

72
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,249
For your family.

73
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,460
Yes. I'll do that.

74
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,129
Let's pull out.

75
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,100
Did you torture him?

76
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,070
You tortured them, didn't you?

77
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,239
Let's get out of here.

78
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,850
- Answer our questions. - You tortured them, right?

79
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,879
- Answer our questions. - You tortured the kids, right?

80
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,850
Why did you bring a high school kid to this inn?

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,959
- Say something! - Why can't you say anything?

82
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,389
- Answer us! - Did you torture the kids?

83
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,159
- Why did you bring them here? - Answer the question!

84
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,390
- Why? - Answer us!

85
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,039
Thank you...

86
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,609
for making the future I know come true.

87
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,080
(Woojung Hospital)

88
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,039
Did your colleagues go back to Seoul safely?

89
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,710
They got what they came here for.

90
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:23,179
I bet they're having a party at a makgeolli bar after work.

91
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,249
We're in 1987.

92
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,150
There's no way this would air on TV.

93
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:32,689
They still came here, knowing that.

94
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,619
And I happen to know direct lines to people who would come anyway.

95
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:42,660
Then tripping like that must have been staged as well.

96
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,600
I see. It was all part of the performance. Right?

97
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:48,669
Oh, that.

98
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,970
You saw that.

99
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,809
That was cute.

100
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,710
It reminded me of the time I was new to my job.

101
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:01,520
The world is a scary place.

102
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,890
I'm worried if he can survive in this tough world.

103
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,119
Gosh. He did more than survive.

104
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,959
He had the longest career...

105
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,189
as director of the news department.

106
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,998
That guy who looked like a total newbie?

107
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:15,999
Yes.

108
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,729
No way.

109
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,090
What kind of future do you think they will have?

110
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:42,859
I hope...

111
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,790
they can start over from here.

112
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,330
Since they have suffered and been in a lot of pain so far,

113
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,629
I hope they can now live the life...

114
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,840
they want.

115
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,479
They will.

116
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:10,479
The surgery went well.

117
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,590
The two of them will recover from this as good as new.

118
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,889
I'm sure a lot has changed already.

119
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,960
When we go back, you should see...

120
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,759
what kind of family awaits you at home.

121
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,009
You know what? I want to buy you a meal.

122
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,479
Do you have money from this era?

123
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:39,049
You have to lend me money.

124
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,550
But I want it to be my treat.

125
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,080
I'll pay you back when we go back.

126
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,849
Buy me a meal tomorrow.

127
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,489
I'll look for an expensive restaurant.

128
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,659
Yu Sub.

129
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,639
Sir.

130
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,710
What on earth happened?

131
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,649
I couldn't get a hold of you for a while.

132
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,550
How could you show up all banged up like this?

133
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,729
Does it even make sense? Let me go!

134
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,729
Do you think this makes sense?

135
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,969
How could you send him away...

136
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,970
when there was no evidence?

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
You knew what kind of jerks they were!

138
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,309
You didn't even tell me!

139
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,209
Don't be ridiculous, you prick.

140
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,809
If you were so worried about your nephew,

141
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,679
why did you arrest him and drag him here?

142
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Why did you do that to Baek Hee Sub?

143
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,089
What? How is that any different?

144
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,420
Oh, right.

145
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:55,618
If he was a murderer, it'd have been a plus for your evaluation.

146
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:58,089
But with a protester, it'd put us in trouble!

147
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,758
He even has history! Don't you agree?

148
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,830
- Calm down! - What?

149
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,128
Hey, either way,

150
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:08,498
we're all doing this to make a living,

151
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,799
so don't go overboard.

152
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,210
It's embarrassing for both of us!

153
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,049
Dong Sik! What's wrong with you?

154
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,149
What is this?

155
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:22,420
Hey! Wait.

156
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,479
The chairman is here.

157
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,950
Goodness.

158
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,059
We were in the middle of a meeting,

159
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,590
and we got worked up.

160
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,590
What a disgrace.

161
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,769
Two people died in our village.

162
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,300
I treated you all to drinks and food every day.

163
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,569
The villagers are shedding bitter tears...

164
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,108
because they lost their family,

165
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,579
and yet, you're fighting among yourselves.

166
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,040
Were you always this pathetic?

167
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,379
I apologize.

168
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,479
- I apologize. - I apologize.

169
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,149
I'm truly disappointed.

170
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,690
And about Baek Hee Sub...

171
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,960
Don't you dare lay a finger on my student barbarically again.

172
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,560
Okay?

173
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,040
Darn you guys.

174
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,070
Chairman Yoon. Wait...

175
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,239
Have a nice day, sir!

176
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,378
Gosh.

177
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,379
Darn it!

178
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,450
Gosh.

179
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
(It's better if you dip it in soy sauce.)

180
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
What are you doing there?

181
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,330
What's that?

182
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:17,330
I'm not sure.

183
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,609
It's twisted breadsticks.

184
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,609
Kyung Ae used to love these.

185
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:40,489
Dinner is ready. Let's go inside, Ok Ja.

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,519
He finally came back.

188
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,349
Who?

189
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,420
Our hero.

190
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,970
There are two conditions...

191
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll ask of you.

192
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,300
So suddenly?

193
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,710
I usually prefer having one meal a day in the evening.

194
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:36,080
And that will be a grilled cheese.

195
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,210
It'd be best if you could prepare it between 8pm and 9pm.

196
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,049
The second condition...

197
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,920
is not interrupting me except for the meal.

198
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,950
I hate getting interrupted once I'm focused.

199
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,859
- Okay. - And the premise...

200
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,290
is that you can solve a Rubik's Cube in five seconds.

201
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,540
Five, four, three, two...

202
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,489
All right. I'll fix it for you.

203
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,019
You're quite domineering, aren't you?

204
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,190
Once you open the hood, you'll be begging me...

205
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:28,330
to let you fix it.

206
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,659
I also have two conditions.

207
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,670
First, do not share whatever you see here...

208
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,609
with anyone.

209
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,970
Second.

210
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,340
You'll only be in the garage,

211
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,810
so the lady I live with won't feel uncomfortable.

212
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,779
You have conditions when I'm doing this for free?

213
00:15:58,659 --> 00:15:59,659
What is this?

214
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,659
What? Is it different from others?

215
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,670
No, I mean, the battery...

216
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,340
So? Do you think you can fix it?

217
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,570
Yes, Hae Jun.

218
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,149
Now that the time machine is being fixed,

219
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,850
we should do all we can here...

220
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:01,489
before we return.

221
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,159
We'll catch those who need to be caught...

222
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,359
and save the ones who must live.

223
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,759

(Lee Ju Young, Lee Kyung Ae)

226
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,869
Here. Try it. Do you know how it goes?

227
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:21,169
- Okay, I'll play with you. - Try it.

228
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,039
It goes like this.

229
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,279
- Impressive. - You saw that, right?

230
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,948
Then I'll go like this.

231
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:26,949
Gosh, you.

232
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,250
She's here!

233
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,550
Hae Kyung!

234
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:33,590
Kim Hae Kyung, a third-year student in Class One at Woojung High.

235
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,060
We no longer have suspects to look into,

236
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,320
but maybe it's neater this way.

237
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,730
It means we could take the lead without having to...

238
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,760
overlap our paths with the police.

239
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,269
We know a suspect...

240
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,300
whom they missed.

241
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:00,149
Do you still think Ko Mi Sook isn't a possible suspect?

242
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:01,850
Because it's just a story in her novel?

243
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,179
The only person who claimed that Kim Hae Kyung was the victim...

244
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,790
But nothing particular is written in the story.

245
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:09,959
Is there anything Ko Mi Sook has told you...

246
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,219
about Kim Hae Kyung?

247
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,030
There is.

248
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,600
How she was going to write about the third victim.

249
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,600
She told me about it.

250
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,070
I'm on a diet!

251
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:26,969
You gained weight.

252
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,280
- No, I lost some weight. - No, you gained weight.

253
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:30,709
Come on.

254
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,879
She said...

255
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,320
Kim Hae Kyung...

256
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,619

258
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:41,889
Hi.

259
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:43,520
Ko Mi Sook...

260
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,889
knew about it also.

261
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,060
Listen up. Since we're all here, I'll show you.

262
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,399
- All right. - What's she doing?

263
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,330
Ta-Da!

264
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,968
My mom's been working on the side.

265
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,070
They pay her two cents per ribbon she attaches.

266
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,909
But they sell the hairband for three dollars.

267
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,439
Isn't that a total rip-off?

268
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,779
So I stole some...

269
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,209
so you could wear one each.

270
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,750
Are you out of your mind? Why would we wear the same hairband?

271
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:13,149
It's tacky.

272
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,859
How do I look?

273
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:23,629
Is it pretty?

274
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,139
Mi Sook, you make the hairband...

275
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,369
look like it costs nine dollars.

276
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,600
I'll put it on too.

277
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,439
You must have one extra.

278
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,679
I'll take one.

279
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,879
I took one for you, of course.

280
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,320
You're so pretty.

281
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,119
- Chung Ah. - Chung Ah.

282
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,689
How does it look? Does it look like it costs ten dollars?

283
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,060
No, it looks like it costs a dollar.

284
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,230
You gained weight.

285
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,429
Can we talk?

286
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,810
What will you do now?

287
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,010
About what?

288
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,480
It looks like Baek Hee Sub has been released.

289
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,250
It's for the better.

290
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,790
Why didn't he listen when I told him not to act up?

291
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,699
He just wouldn't listen.

292
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,730
I thought he'd act up...

293
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,669
because of his darn brother.

294
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:40,740
So I was going to lie for him,

295
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,409
but he got dragged away.

296
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,649
But I think it's for the best.

297
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:49,050
He earned us some time.

298
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,649
They weren't completely healed yet.

299
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:55,389
His hands.

300
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,060
Mi Sook's friend.

301
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,129
Can you...

302
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,500
Can you call her? Please?

303
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,330
Tell her that I'm hurt.

304
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:08,469
Are you...

305
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,709
really going to frame...

306
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:14,909
your brother?

307
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,949
Why do you keep asking again?

308
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,080
That's annoying.

309
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,918
Hae Kyung, who knew about her secret,

310
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,419
kept making her uneasy,

311
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,290
which got on her nerves.

312
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,589
Then Hae Kyung even ran away from home.

313
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,129
It's true that she ran away.

314
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,829
Since she even left a handwritten letter.

315
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,270
(The People I Killed)

316
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,169
She became fearless as she even left home.

317
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,740
She told Mi Sook that she'd disclose her secret...

318
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,539
if she didn't come to Seoul with her.

319
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,149
The secret that she's the culprit?

320
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,820
Yes.

321
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,990
Let's take that story into account as well.

322
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,419
"As well?"

323
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,560
There's a story I discovered too.

324
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:09,030
The reason why Hae Kyung ran away from home.

325
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,698
We should drink on a good day like this.

326
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:13,829
- Right. - Congratulations.

327
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,800
- Here. Cheers. - Cheers.

328
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
The school drill teacher?

329
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,310
You mean my homeroom teacher?

330
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,280
What does he have to do with this story?

331
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,480
He had feelings for Hae Kyung's mom.

332
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,889
She was also into him.

333
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,129
- Ma'am, here. - Ma'am.

334
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,329
- Two more bottles of beer. - Do you want more beer?

335
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,928
- Yes. - Okay. Let me bring you more.

336
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,198
How's business these days?

337
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,428
- Come on. - What are you doing?

338
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,668
- Stop moving. - Please. Why are you doing this?

339
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,770
Stop!

340
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,638
- What? - What was that?

341
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,070
- What? - What did you say?

342
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,079
Is he out of his mind?

343
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,908
- No. - Let me go!

344
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:03,250
- Let go of me. - Calm down.

345
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,020
Still!

346
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,760
How could you make my husband look like this as a teacher?

347
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,060
Let me apologize for him.

348
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,729
I'll pay for the medicine.

349
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,429
Can you please leave before Hae Kyung comes back?

350
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,000
So you're too embarrassed to face your daughter at least?

351
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,300
You're fooling around with her teacher.

352
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,469
Please watch your mouth.

353
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,509
She doesn't deserve to hear that.

354
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,709
Let's just go home, Mom.

355
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,649
Come on.

356
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:35,719
Gosh.

357
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,169
How long have you been standing there?

358
00:23:58,969 --> 00:23:59,969
Did you have dinner?

359
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,750
It's kimchi soup again? We don't even have that on the menu.

360
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:09,020
It's his favourite.

361
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,149
I want to have seaweed soup.

362
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:15,659
What?

363
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:18,560
Okay. I'll make it tomorrow.

364
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,429
Only make seaweed soup.

365
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:24,600
If you make kimchi soup again, I am not coming home again.

366
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,939
Are you saying she'll run away tomorrow because of kimchi soup?

367
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,010
Sort of, yes.

368
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,350
So, Hae Kyung likes seaweed soup,

369
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,350
and my teacher likes kimchi soup.

370
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,590
But as her mom chose to make kimchi soup in the end...

371
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:51,389
That's the misunderstanding Hae Kyung had.

372
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:54,629
Actually, she did that for her daughter.

373
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,198
She made him the soup for the last time,

374
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,169
asking him not to come back again.

375
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:06,540
What matters to us is what she did after she left home, isn't it?

376
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,109
Not why she ran away.

377
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,709
It would be if it were in the past.

378
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,879
Because we used to think it was important...

379
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,179
where and when they came across the culprit.

380
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
But now...

381
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,119
I don't want to leave room for any other possibilities...

382
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:25,219
so that she doesn't run away again, whatever variables appear.

383
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,530
But...

384
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,398
this could be our last chance to run into the culprit.

385
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,859
There must be another way.

386
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,369
Before that,

387
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,639
let's make sure to keep her alive first.

388
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,080
(The People I Killed)

389
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,850
If it was because of an understanding,

390
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,980
she could easily change her mind about leaving home.

391
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,090
"Your mom chose you over your teacher."

392
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,359
"It was seaweed soup, not kimchi soup."

393
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,159
We just have to let her know the truth.

394
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,168
(Let's achieve national harmony...)

395
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,040
(through self-help, self-reliance, and cooperation.)

396
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,840
(Forward with our autonomy, creativity, and intelligence.)

397
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,678
- It looks so good on you. - Do you think so?

398
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,490
Are they a group of four princesses or what?

399
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:29,590
Why are they wearing matching headbands?

400
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,060
Besides, they're tacky pink.

401
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,260
Did she like pink?

402
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,800
Then are you garaetteok or what?

403
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
That's what you compare me to? Gosh.

404
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,939
I mean, how can handsome men understand?

405
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:08,330
Are you going to propose today?

406
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,260
Yes. Today is a very good day.

407
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,770
Aren't you too optimistic?

408
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,600
You don't think you could be rejected?

409
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,709
No, I don't. I'll make certain that she doesn't say no.

410
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:26,179
You must have heard it already.

411
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,409
People only speak ill of her...

412
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,919
because she runs a bar alone.

413
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,590
People are gossiping more about her because she got involved with me.

414
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,320
It's not like I can take my feelings back.

415
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:44,300
I'll put an end to the rumours now.

416
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:48,070
I'll become a pillar of support for them...

417
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,600
so that the mother and daughter are not on everyone's lips anymore.

418
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,490
Hello.

419
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:12,290
Goodness.

420
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,359
When will he come to his senses?

421
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:20,669
Look at his outfit. Is he chalk?

422
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:25,070
I heard he got into a fight at the bar of a parent yesterday.

423
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:26,839
He goes out with a parent...

424
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,770
and even has a fist fight with another parent.

425
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Oh, dear.

426
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,909
Should I just fire him already?

427
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,149
You always say that, but you never do.

428
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,719
Right.

429
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,419
How can you fire your family, right?

430
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,830
Right.

431
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,020
I heard your dad was totally humiliated last night.

432
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,418
Are your dad and Hae Kyung's mom really having an affair?

433
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,159
Hey, what if Hae Kyung hears you?

434
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,530
She went to the cafeteria.

435
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:21,230
You should watch out.

436
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,230
Her mom is really pretty.

437
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,300
Do you want a piece of me?

438
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:29,129
You know Hae Kyung's mom and our teacher are an item.

439
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,840
Doesn't she feel ashamed?

440
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,668
After bewitching all kinds of men,

441
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,839
she even messed with her daughter's teacher.

442
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,909
What?

443
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Oh, my.

444
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,810
Can't she live without men?

445
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:48,050
- Be quiet. - Be quiet.

446
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,459
It's okay. Sit down.

447
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,929
Page 58.

448
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,280
- My goodness. - Gosh.

449
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,320
Did you see my mom bewitching guys?

450
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,079
How does that even work?

451
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,689
How would I know?

452
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:23,060
But I saw it. I did!

453
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,889
Kim Hae Kyung!

454
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:26,260
You...

455
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,590
Stop it.

456
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,030
- Stop it! - Get off of me!

457
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,230
- Get here! - Stop, Kim Hae Kyung!

458
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,770
Pull yourself together for your mom.

459
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,439
It's none of your business. Stay out of it.

460
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,739
You're a teacher...

461
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,209
who can only date a bar owner like my mom.

462
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,580
You brat!

463
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,000
- Hae Kyung. - Oh, dear.

464
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,139
I'll be back.

465
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,379
Oh, no.

466
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,189
(Arcade)

467
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,530
(Stella)

468
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:06,659
No. Go back inside.

469
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,459
What?

470
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,459
Go back inside.

471
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,510
You left a letter for your mom, didn't you?

472
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:24,139
How did you know that?

473
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,609
Take a look at yourself.

474
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:28,580
That's what kids who run away from home do.

475
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,949
Go back inside and grab it.

476
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,990
Should I go in and grab it myself?

477
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,530
Gosh. Come on.

478
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:46,830
"Mom, I truly hate that you are my mom."

479
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:48,969
"I'm sure you feel the same way."

480
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,800
"So we should never see each other again until we die."

481
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:55,609
- "Let's go our separate ways." - Gosh, stop reading that.

482
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:58,080
I only read it nine times.

483
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,179
If you really left this note,

484
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,448
your mother would probably have read it thousands of times.

485
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,178
Then it would have broken her heart into pieces.

486
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,290
What? You can't handle it only after nine times?

487
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:10,590
Where are we going?

488
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,429
I'm sure you don't want to go back home right away.

489
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,429
You did run away from home.

490
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:20,629
You should at least get some fresh air.

491
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,639
There it is.

492
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:27,869
Get on the bus.

493
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,270
Sir.

494
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,270
Sir.

495
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,510
Yes.

496
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,709
Can I leave early today?

497
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,350
- I have to... - Sure. Go ahead.

498
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:13,389
Thank you.

499
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,000
Sit down.

500
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,069
This is a one-day field trip.

501
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,509
We'll observe the 300-year-old tree.

502
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,610
It's just some stupid tree.

503
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,549
Do you have any idea how long 300 years is?

504
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,989
There must have been several droughts and floods.

505
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,629
But it managed to stay...

506
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,630
in this spot without getting swept away in the water.

507
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,130
For 300 years.

508
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:02,529
That's how all trees are.

509
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,100
Sure.

510
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,639
Trees don't have a choice.

511
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,779
But why do you think people do that?

512
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:16,920
I know someone...

513
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,420
who lived just like this tree.

514
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,298
(August 2013)

515
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,469
(Please help me find my daughter. Kim Hae Kyung)

516
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,040
Thank you.

517
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,810
Thank you.

518
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,150
Okay.

519
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,219
- I already took this... - Thank you for taking it.

520
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,219
- Thank you. - Sure.

521
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:05,299
(December 2015)

522
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,940
- Okay. - Thank you.

523
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,479
(August 2020)

524
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,778
- Thank you for lunch, Hae Jun. - Thank you for the meal.

525
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:22,880
I'll buy you lunch again.

526
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,759
(Name: Kim Hae Kyung)

527
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,540
(October 2020)

528
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,920
Goodness. Oh, no.

529
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,619
Are you okay, ma'am?

530
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,319
- Please get up. - Gosh.

531
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,799
Thank you.

532
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:18,000
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

533
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,210
Gosh, I'm all right.

534
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,380
Thank you.

535
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,380
But still. You should get some rest.

536
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,880
What if...

537
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,089
my daughter comes back when I'm resting?

538
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,460
What if she hears that I'm here...

539
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:40,759
and somehow comes here to find me?

540
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:45,499
But if I'm not here, she might be disappointed and leave.

541
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,799
Then what am I going to do?

542
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:51,670
People tell me that she's probably dead.

543
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,409
But I don't believe that.

544
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,509
I...

545
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,210
only believe the letter she left...

546
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,380
for me to read.

547
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:11,719
She wrote she hated me and that I was a terrible mother.

548
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:17,330
So I believe that she's just hiding from me.

549
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,000
I really hope that's the case.

550
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:27,369
I want her to live a good life on her own.

551
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:30,810
But I just wish...

552
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,580
I could see her just once before I die.

553
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,389
I would want nothing else if I could just see her once.

554
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,920
I want to tell her I wasn't a good mother...

555
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,659
and that I am sorry.

556
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,759
But...

557
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,600
I had missed her...

558
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,440
very much.

559
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,319
She did that for 40 years...

560
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,259
in the same spot, whether it rained or snowed.

561
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,029
Then she passed away.

562
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:30,069
But in the end, she never got to see her daughter.

563
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,139
I was just going to be gone for a while, not 40 years.

564
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,710
I know that. Then...

565
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,279
why did you run away from home?

566
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,580
Didn't you fight that girl because of your mom?

567
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,249
You should only hate those who spread rumours about her.

568
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,350
Why are you trying to hate your mother too?

569
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:50,319
You don't even hate your mom.

570
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:00,869
Soon Ae.

571
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,540
Yoon Young.

572
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,940
What are you doing here now?

573
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:15,110
What about school?

574
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:18,319
I left early because I knew you would be doing this.

575
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:20,619
Did you eat?

576
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm okay.

577
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:31,330
No one's home, right?

578
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,000
Yes. Did your parents go somewhere?

579
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:38,270
To the police station.

580
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,509
To collect my sister's body.

581
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,940
We have to hold a funeral for her.

582
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,509
But the police kept delaying it.

583
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:01,060
Baek Hee Sub was released.

584
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:10,239
Where is he right now?

585
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,139
How is he?

586
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,909
Is he hurt?

587
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,719
Do you want to see him?

588
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:43,839
(Elevator)

589
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,699
Why did you come?

590
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:18,239
I only want you to see my handsome side.

591
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,210
You should respect my priverse.

592
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:22,369
You mean "privacy."

593
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,449
It's because I hurt my head.

594
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:30,819
Why didn't you tell them?

595
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,419
If you had told them you were with me,

596
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,920
you wouldn't have been dragged away.

597
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,960
Gosh, that's your priverse.

598
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:45,000
I mean, privasy.

599
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:46,869
You fool.

600
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,799
You can't even remember what I just said.

601
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:13,759
Soon Ae.

602
00:43:17,259 --> 00:43:18,560
There is nothing...

603
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,230
that you did wrong.

604
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,170
When you lose someone you love,

605
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,610
you tend to think this way.

606
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,110
"Would it have been different if I had acted this way?"

607
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,509
"What if I did this?"

608
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,219
Because it feels like it's all your fault.

609
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:49,330
But it's not true.

610
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:53,869
There was nothing you did wrong that night.

611
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,799
I saw it myself.

612
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,239
You did nothing wrong.

613
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,719
(Stella)

614
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,400
Go on inside.

615
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:08,839
Go inside and see what she made for you.

616
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,889
Hi, sweetheart. You're back.

617
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,589
You haven't eaten, right?

618
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:29,429
I made seaweed soup for you.

619
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,759
Come here.

620
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,699
Take a seat and have this.

621
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,670
I don't know if it's seasoned all right.

622
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:46,810
All right.

623
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,080
Here you go.

624
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,960
I thought you made kimchi soup.

625
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:01,960
What?

626
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,029
Oh, I made that too.

627
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,270
But he didn't come.

628
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,569
He won't come anymore.

629
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,639
I was going to tell him to stop coming here too.

630
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,139
I'm serious.

631
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,440
I was going to tell him that today,

632
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,710
but he said he wouldn't come.

633
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:25,679
It's all fine.

634
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,589
I only need you in my life.

635
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,790
Even if you don't run away from home now,

636
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,259
you'll eventually part with your mom one day.

637
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,599
When you turn 20, you'll go to college and live alone.

638
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,600
You'll date people and get a job too.

639
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,839
And when you look back, you'll see how aged your mom is.

640
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:51,509
She'll be waiting for you to come home.

641
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:53,610
Won't that be too much to handle?

642
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,819
The things you didn't like up close...

643
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:04,659
will become sad from a distance...

644
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,659
after some time passes.

645
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:11,830
That's how it is.

646
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,069
Did he not come because of me?

647
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:20,138
He slapped me in the face earlier in the afternoon.

648
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,339
That crazy jerk!

649
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:24,310
I talked badly about you.

650
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,509
That's why he couldn't come.

651
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,089
Tell him to come.

652
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:41,589
I don't really like seaweed soup, to be honest.

653
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Eat up.

654
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:02,980
- Is it good? - Yes, it's good.

655
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:10,020
(Stella)

656
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:17,629
(Woojung Shopping Arcade)

657
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,230
Maybe for some truths,

658
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:23,500
they're bound to reach them.

659
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,969
Even if they take the long way,

660
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:31,940
the person who needs to find the truth will reach it.

661
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:36,150
You see, there was something...

662
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,920
I really didn't get about my mom.

663
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,218
She said she hated Dad, but whenever his birthday came around,

664
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:44,759
she'd prepare a feast for him.

665
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,790
And she'd be anxious in case I don't make it.

666
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,829
I always wondered...

667
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,259
why she couldn't let him go.

668
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,029
But from what I saw today,

669
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,139
I kind of get it.

670
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,170
He's someone who was next to her...

671
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,350
during her most difficult time.

672
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,690
Did you see how the grilled eel only cost two dollars?

673
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:24,299
You should consider the price level when you pay me back.

674
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,860
Here.

675
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,138
We should've gone to a better place.

676
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,540
I wanted to treat you to something more expensive.

677
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:38,040
Maybe next time. You can treat me to a meal when we return.

678
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:40,710
Seriously.

679
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,179
There's this really nice restaurant I know.

680
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,819
Let's meet there next time.

681
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,960
But I don't go to just any restaurant.

682
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,259
I figured so.

683
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:57,959
I know what an uptight person,

684
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,359
who doesn't even like salty and sweet stuff,

685
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
would like.

686
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:03,000
Dishes that are mild and healthy,

687
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,798
which use good ingredients.

688
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:07,509
The expensive sorts that taste bad.

689
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:08,940
Right.

690
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,310
You know me well.

691
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:16,679
Just be patient with me and wait for about 34 years.

692
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,119
Here's your grilled eel.

693
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:25,920
Thank you.

694
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,330
All right. Try it.

695
00:50:33,299 --> 00:50:34,999
It's spicy, salty, and sweet.

696
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,569
The dish that's right up your alley.

697
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,480
It's really good!

698
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,580
Enjoy.

699
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,860
Do you want to try it? You won't?

700
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,190
You won't eat it, right?

701
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,060
I'll just enjoy it myself.

(Woojung Shopping Arcade)

703
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,489
Be careful. You might fall.

704
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:36,960
It's really refreshing.

705
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,299
This is what I like about the countryside.

706
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:45,170
All right, now. You should come out.

707
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:49,670
Oh, no.

708
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,380
- Oh, no! - Goodness.

709
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:11,860
Did you see that? My sense of balance?

710
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,170
I did, so come out now.

711
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,000
If you fall, you'll crack your head.

712
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,170
Isn't one time enough?

713
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,580
Can you come in just once? It feels so nice.

714
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,650
Over my dead body.

715
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:33,650
Come on. Just once.

716
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:36,989
No.

717
00:53:06,779 --> 00:53:07,850
Why won't you?

718
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:09,619
I don't want to.

719
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:18,929
Come on.

720
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,080
Don't tell me you're sleeping right now.

721
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,110
All of a sudden?

722
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,489
Goodness.

723
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:47,560
You're so indifferent.

724
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,330
You're consistently indifferent.

725
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,799
I knew it...

726
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,299
ever since you said it'd make me feel better if you disappeared.

727
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:12,779
It makes me upset.

728
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,790
This is a problem.

729
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:48,319
(Safety first, Safety always)

730
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,600
Sorry, I'm late.

731
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,929
Someone was having too much fun in the water.

732
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,650
You scared me. When did you get here?

733
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,020
I even knocked. Have some of this.

734
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,819
Thank you.

735
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:31,659
What time is it?

736
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,230
It's 10pm.

737
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:36,199
What? It's 10pm?

738
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:39,839
Darn it. The movie started at 9:30pm. Gosh.

739
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:42,839
"Movie?"

740
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,409
Yes. What was it called again? "Our Sweet Days of Youth?"

741
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:47,980
Where did I put it?

742
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,980
Gosh, she told me not to be late. I'm off.

743
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,259
(Year 2020)

744
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,060
You've collected all of these?

745
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,600
Those are just...

746
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,670
the tickets for the movies I watched on my dates.

747
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,100
I kept them for memory's sake.

748
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:15,610
With Mother?

749
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:19,679
That's right.

750
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,279
What was the movie we first watched together again?

751
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:28,650
"Our Sweet Days of Youth."

752
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:30,819
But I was sleeping, so I couldn't watch it.

753
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:32,759
I always fall asleep during movies.

754
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:39,400
(Ticket)

755
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:00,250
(Woojung Cinema)

756
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,949
Why did I come...

757
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,318
here?

758
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,360
("Our Sweet Days of Youth")

759
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,929
What will I do if I see her?

760
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:43,589
What's the point of knowing who she is now?

761
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:10,250
What was she like?

762
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,059
My mom.

763
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,588
(Year 1994)

764
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:18,960
What was my mom like, Grandpa?

765
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,639
Your mother left the village the day she gave birth to you.

766
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,499
You were crying your eyes out,

767
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,540
but...

768
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,839
she left without even giving you a hug.

769
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,580
She considered you a mistake in her life,

770
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,779
so don't even be curious about her or think about her from now on.

771
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:47,159
- That was a great movie. - Yes.

772
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,730
- Wasn't that great? - Yes.

773
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,639
Some truths...

774
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:10,940
end up reaching their destination.

775
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:28,960
No matter how long it takes,

776
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,759
the truth reaches the one who needs it the most.

777
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,449
Mr. Yoon.

778
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,020
Hello.

779
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,139
But why does that have to be now?

780
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,940
How is it you?

781
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,779
(My Perfect Stranger)

782
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,979
- Did you look inside the bookstore? - I did.

783
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,718
I can't believe Ko Mi Sook is a novelist. It took me by surprise.

784
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:01,819
I wondered why girls who like reading were all like that.

785
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,948
They act like they're special.

786
01:02:03,949 --> 01:02:05,259
They rub me the wrong way.

787
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,088
What puzzled me the most...

788
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:09,290
was this sentence.

789
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:11,400
"Women who read are dangerous."

790
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,500
This could be a warning.

791
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,170
Don't try to lie in front of me too.

792
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,429
I'm going to expose you.

793
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:21,100
Why are you so annoying, Soon Ae?

794
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,839
Don't get in the way if you don't want to end up like your sister.

795
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:29,810
