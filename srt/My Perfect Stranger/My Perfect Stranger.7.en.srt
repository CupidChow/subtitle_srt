(My Perfect Stranger)

5
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,748
So did the guy with the blue cap show up?

6
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,950
(Previously)

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,420
There were more people.

8
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,329
- Hee Sub. - Yu Sub.

9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,369
Baek Hee Sub was the guy with the blue cap.

10
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,899
It was he who ran away from the bridge that night.

11
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,839
And Yoo Bum Ryong...

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,509
went in the same direction as the victim.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,749
He was 1 of the 3 suspects...

14
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,419
and the mysterious guy with the blue cap.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,919
His whereabouts matched Lee Ju Young's whereabouts.

16
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,419
So far, he's the prime suspect.

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,690
Your father,

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,530
Baek Hee Sub.

19
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,190
The guy with the blue cap.

20
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,458
He could be the culprit who killed my mother.

21
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,199
You saw him at the teahouse. Right?

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,199
I think I can figure it out.

(Episode 7)

27
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,519
Yes.

28
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,130
I might have been wrong about this from the start.

29
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,539
There were 3 suspects in 1987.

30
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,180
This list came from the police who failed to catch the culprit.

31
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,149
Trying to find the real culprit from their suspect list...

33
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,359

(Woojung-ri Serial Murder Case Suspects)

35
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,970
Are you all right?

36
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,579
I told you I could handle it.

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Well,

38
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:33,849
except for the fact that they were suspects,

39
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,380
this is nothing new to me...

40
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,190
although I only found out five minutes ago...

41
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,350
and I was still surprised.

42
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,728
By the way, where did you get these photos?

43
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,030
Even I haven't seen them.

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,600
You must have investigated thoroughly.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,299
Gosh, you put your investigative skills to use.

46
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,979
I have nothing...

47
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,380
about Baek Yu Sub.

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,850
I have so many files, but I have nothing on him.

49
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,919
It didn't cross my mind that he could be a suspect.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,590
What kind of man was he?

51
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,359
Your uncle.

52
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,359
Baek Yu Sub.

53
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,830
I'm not sure.

54
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,640
I thought I knew him well...

55
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,369
before I met him at the record shop today.

56
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,400
(Disco)

57
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,299
He was too distant to call family.

58
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,200
But he was too close to be a stranger to me.

59
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,470
But...

60
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,479
his face looked nothing like the familiar face...

61
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,410
I got sick and tired of.

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,520
What are you doing right now, Uncle?

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,660
Books.

64
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,859
I told you not to enter my room without my permission.

65
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,700
Why are you doing this to me?

66
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,270
- Stop it. Let go! - No.

67
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:42,340
- It's okay. - She's mean.

68
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:50,879
("Small Door")

69
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,059
Apologize.

70
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,489
Apologize to me!

71
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,530
Don't yell at him.

72
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,669
We're our family.

73
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,869
He's your family.

74
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,140
You have never considered me and Mom your family.

75
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,379
Did you think I wouldn't know?

76
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:22,780
That's why I don't consider you family.

77
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,700
Oh, no. Yoon Young.

78
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,470
What...

79
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:45,710
I'm not sure...

80
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,979
if he's really the man I used to know.

81
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,049
I don't know who he really was.

82
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:55,249
(Baek Dong Sik)

83
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,379
Then we should find out. And that's where we'll start.

84
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,410
Gosh. You startled me.

85
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:28,320
- Gosh. - Come with me.

86
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,830
I'm going to ask you simple questions.

87
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,890
If you lie to me,

88
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,298
I will have to talk to your uncle tomorrow morning.

89
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,869
What? That doesn't sound fair.

90
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,470
Whatever happens, my uncle...

91
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,270
- cannot... - So answer them truthfully.

92
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,679
Whose cap is that?

93
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,580
This cap?

94
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,189
Gosh. But you barged into my house in the middle of the night.

95
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,859
Why are you asking me about my cap?

96
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,890
Should we do this tomorrow?

97
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,959
Bring your uncle to school by 8am.

98
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,129
This belongs to my brother. Why do you ask?

99
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,470
I borrowed it from him last night and tried it on.

100
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,600
Why did you...

101
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,439
go to Woojung Inn's alley last night? Tell me the truth.

102
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,410
Come on. I explained everything.

103
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,079
I was out for a walk.

104
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,249
If you're not sure, let me ask you more clearly.

105
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,950
Who made you...

106
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,589
change your course...

107
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,659
and end up in the alley last night?

108
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,460
You walked away with a man, but he disappeared.

109
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,700
He made you...

110
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,300
come up with a lame lie like going on a walk.

111
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,070
Who was that?

112
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,050
He asked me to check if the light...

113
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,060
in the second-floor room was on.

114
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,090
Who?

115
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,930
Who asked you to check that?

116
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,840
I want to hear it from you. Who asked you?

117
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,050
My...

118
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,779
brother.

119
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,450
It was all Baek Yu Sub's doing.

120
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,179
He happened to be curious about the room on the second floor...

121
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,350
Lee Ju Young was staying in.

122
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,618
He asked his brother to check that even when Lee Ju Young...

123
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,919
hadn't shown up at Bong Bong Teahouse.

124
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,759
That means he was after Lee Ju Young from the start.

125
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,290
On top of that,

126
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,129
he ran away when we saw him here.

127
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,829
He was secretly peeking at Lee Ju Young,

128
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,899
who was down there, and he ran.

129
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,369
The owner of the blue hat.

130
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,639
Baek Yu Sub is certainly the real culprit.

131
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,180
You might get dizzy if you get ahead of yourself.

132
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,290
If Baek Yu Sub is the culprit,

133
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:56,389
we're going to see him again tomorrow night...

134
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:02,999
because he needs...

135
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,570
to kill the second victim.

136
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,739
Are you sure you can face that?

137
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,979
You don't have to suppress how you really feel.

138
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,680
It's only natural for you to be distressed...

139
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,220
because he's your family.

140
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:59,050
It's so horrible how I have a lot on my mind.

141
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,889
But that's all I can spare for him.

142
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,129
The rest of my mind is filled...

143
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,800
with the thought...

144
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,200
of saving my mom and you...

145
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,700
from that horrendous man.

146
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,239
So...

147
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,350
Are you going to share it with the whole neighborhood?

148
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,889
A story about your mother and me?

149
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,109
It's just that I was confused. No one knows Baek Yu Sub...

150
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:00,080
better than me.

151
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,420
The missing information and files.

152
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,950
I'll give you everything you need from now on.

153
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,220
You don't even know...

154
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,720
what you will witness from now on.

155
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,259
Are you sure you can do it?

156
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,430
Yes.

157
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,070
(Trash can)

158
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,840
No matter who does what,

159
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:27,639
if it's the truth that I must know,

160
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,119
I will never run from it.

161
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,519
That way, I'll be able to protect my mom.

162
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:09,619
You're here.

163
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,290
Yes.

164
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,090
I brought the clothes you could change into.

165
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,259
What should I do now?

166
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
You'll need to find out...

167
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,899
who the second victim is.

168
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,639
And who is that?

169
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,019
Hello.

170
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,489
I'm contestant number two,

171
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,060
Miss Gyeonggi,

172
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:00,170
Lee Kyung Ae.

173
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,899
Please look kindly upon me.

174
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,639
No way.

175
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,190
You didn't have the slightest idea?

176
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,060
It's the aunt you never had.

177
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,129
I was told...

178
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,229
that she died young because she was weak.

179
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,470
Is there anything more you're keeping from me?

180
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,710
I showed you the second floor.

181
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,009
That means I've told you all.

182
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,479
You have a plan for her too, right?

183
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,748
Do you think it's a coincidence that I rented a house...

184
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,119
across from theirs?

185
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,519
You've had a plan all along?

186
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:19,850
Based on what I observed for a month,

187
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,119
today will be the most difficult and trickiest day.

188
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,889
And that's because the person we need to save is extraordinary.

189
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,970
(Scholastic Aptitude Mock Test)

190
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,830
(Ten dollars)

191
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,149
I found Dad's stash!

192
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,350
I should've thought of this earlier!

193
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,359
Yes! I need to save just a little more.

194
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,260
Save just a little more

195
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,159
Save just a little more

196
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,800
Save just a little more

197
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,469
Save just a little more

198
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:23,699
Save just a little more

199
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:42,389
The so-called scoundrel of Woojung-ri.

200
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,820
The craziest girl in this neighborhood.

201
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,589
You shouldn't try to understand...

202
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,530
why or what she does logically.

203
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,070
You chose to stay at a house across from theirs...

204
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,040
because you didn't know what she might do.

205
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,990
And the paths the police figured out then...

206
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,760
are no longer trustable.

207
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,889
There are so many things they missed.

208
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,359
And I became more certain of it after what happened last night.

209
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,369
Oh, dear.

210
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,600
Gosh.

211
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,409
In any case, her last whereabouts that they found out...

212
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,209
are at Bong Bong Teahouse at 9pm tonight.

213
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,310
It's the same path as Lee Ju Young's, right?

214
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,889
She must've run into the culprit after she left the teahouse.

215
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,389
But tonight, it'll be different...

216
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,300
because we'll be there for her.

217
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,800
Let's catch the culprit in earnest this time.

218
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,770
I will make sure we do that.

219
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,179
But what will we do about our school?

220
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,550
What?

221
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:20,719
Her fever is...

222
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:22,919
as high as 39°C?

223
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,929
Yes. What should I do? I'm her only guardian.

224
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,429
The school is not the problem now. Take her to the hospital.

225
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:38,399
You know the one at the intersection, right?

226
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,009
Don't worry about the class.

227
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,609
Stay close to her and nurse her.

228
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,449
Okay.

229
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,080
Goodness.

230
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,980
I guess today is not the day.

231
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,189
I can just stop by the hospital then.

232
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,189
Right. It's on the way.

233
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,600
By the way, do your kids feel better?

234
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,129
Yes. They were well enough to be discharged,

235
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,500
but I insisted on keeping them one more day at the hospital.

236
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,740
Good job.

237
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,800
Take this opportunity to let them eat whatever they want.

238
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,039
Be around them as much as you want to.

239
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,750
- You don't have to do this, sir. - Come on.

240
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:23,750
If I don't do this,

241
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,320
I won't be comfortable when I see my son in a few days.

242
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,419
Hey.

243
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,290
I was the one...

244
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,159
who kept you there that night.

245
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,459
It's not like you did it on purpose.

246
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,399
Well...

247
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:44,439
It's cherry-flavored.

248
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,909
Is Yeon Woo returning to Korea?

249
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,510
Yes. He called me.

250
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,649
He wants to come to see his dad.

251
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,350
It's been three years.

252
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:02,459
You should be grateful when they act all cute with you.

253
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,859
Your children don't stay in your arms forever.

254
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:07,189
Okay.

255
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,499
Do you want one?

256
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,330
All right. Thank you.

257
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:19,770
I'm serious.

258
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:23,510
Once I become Miss Korea, I'll get you a mink coat.

259
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,449
Gosh!

260
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,409
I can't believe you're my daughter.

261
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,580
Do you think anyone can afford a mink coat?

262
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,589
I'm not asking you to buy me one.

263
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,590
- I said I'd get you one. - Oh, dear.

264
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,559
Mom, if I become Miss Korea...

265
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,958
Stop hustling her and just quit drinking.

266
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,559
Miss Korea? My foot.

267
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,000
- Show some respect to your elder. - That's enough.

268
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:48,128
Why doesn't anyone believe in me?

269
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:50,540
They said I had potential for sure.

270
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,540
If you bring up 500 dollars again, I will tell you off.

271
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,480
You're not involved with a bad crowd, right?

272
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,080
You don't know these things.

273
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:09,219
But can you help me out a little?

274
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,760
Are you out of your mind?

275
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:14,060
We have no money. We're flat broke.

276
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,830
Can I get a tutor for math?

277
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,439
I've been struggling lately.

278
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,379
The college entrance exam is around the corner too.

279
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,889
I've saved some money, so I just want a little help...

280
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,790
with it...

281
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:43,260
How can you...

282
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,730
be so clueless like this?

283
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,580
Soon Ae.

284
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,750
I'll get you a tutor as soon as we make some extra money.

285
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,280
I'm late.

286
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,619
Have a good day, my baby. Okay?

287
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:21,929
Mom, I have a few books to buy.

288
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,198
If it's not enough, let me know, all right?

289
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,609
Don't tell your sisters.

290
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:34,869
I'm going to go now.

291
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:13,080
We can't be caught or miss her.

292
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,709
She works at a hair salon, right?

293
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,819
Then will she go to work?

294
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,218
It won't be that ordinary. She missed work without notice,

295
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:21,250
and there's no record left about what she did during that time.

296
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,490
We'll find out if we follow her.

297
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,889
My goodness. Be quiet.

298
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,290
Is she there?

299
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,939
Soon Ae, you did it on purpose earlier, didn't you?

300
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
What did I do?

301
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,938
You don't take my dream seriously.

302
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,750
That's why you swooped in to talk about yourself.

303
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,379
"Don't waste your money on her pipe dream."

304
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,590
"Spend it on your smart daughter." That's what you were saying.

305
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,990
I'm sorry that I interrupted you,

306
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:57,820
but I didn't know. I wasn't paying attention to you.

307
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,230
You weren't...

308
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,259
Now you'll just openly look down on me?

309
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,229
No. That's not what I meant.

310
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,469
Hey, do you think you're better than everyone else?

311
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,240
Gosh, that hairpin.

312
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,139
That's the hairpin I told Dad I wanted.

313
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,010
But he got it for you only.

314
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,379
What's the big deal about getting the highest grade in school?

315
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:23,379
By the way, there's only so much you can get...

316
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,719
from being on his good side.

317
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:30,090
Do you think Dad really doesn't have money to hire a tutor for you?

318
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:31,659
What are you talking about?

319
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,590
Dad...

320
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,260
doesn't think of sending you to college.

321
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,439
How do you know?

322
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,969
You're the only one who doesn't know.

323
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,209
Hey, what do you think he wants for us?

324
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,939
He wants us...

325
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,279
to marry someone from a good family at a young age...

326
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,549
and live in luxury.

327
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,188
He wants to make Oh Bok study more...

328
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:01,389
and have a great job.

329
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,090
Those two are his only wishes.

330
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,889
You're going in the wrong direction.

331
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:08,889
So?

332
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,300
Are you going to live like that?

333
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,330
- What? - I'm not going to live...

334
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:16,899
the way he wants me to.

335
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:21,810
I can study without a tutor.

336
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
If you need money to live your own life,

337
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,449
make use of this.

338
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,520
I've never looked down on you.

339
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:44,459
Is she telling me to read this and become smarter?

340
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,699
She's still walking all over me.

341
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,800
(Ten dollars)

342
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,209
Gosh.

343
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,439
Goodness. It's so annoying.

344
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,290
I can go alone.

345
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,490
No.

346
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:51,659
She would want me to follow Kyung Ae instead.

347
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,379
(Payphone)

348
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,619
I resent my grandpa for the first time.

349
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,230
It was my mom's lifelong wish.

350
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,659
She didn't go to college in the end.

351
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,129
It wouldn't have been so rare back then.

352
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:29,939
Just because it's common doesn't mean it's not tragic.

353
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,709
I'm just saying he wouldn't have known.

354
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,869
How he would feel later about holding his daughter back.

355
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,389
What is she doing now?

356
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,530
Whatever she's doing,

357
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,629
we have to watch until the culprit shows up.

358
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,669
We can't create any more variables.

359
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,320
Peekaboo.

360
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Hi.

361
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:20,149
How have you been, pretty girl?

362
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,919
I heard you finally got it.

363
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,329
By the way, who are they?

364
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,330
Isn't it obvious?

365
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,100
They're going to prepare for Miss Korea with you.

366
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,800
She's going to win second place in South Jeolla Province.

367
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,609
She will win first place in Daegu.

368
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,868
Then she will win third place in North Gyeongsang Province.

369
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:44,439
Hey, I paid 500 dollars. You said I would win 2nd place.

370
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,709
Sorry. You will win second place.

371
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
All right.

372
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,418
What about you, pretty lady?

373
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,820
What place do you want to win in Gyeonggi Province?

374
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,129
Second place.

375
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,570
Second place? No, first place.

376
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:10,070
All right. Hop in.

377
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:11,740
Get in now.

378
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,168
Let's go.

379
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,739
(Wanted for Fraud)

380
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,840
Get in.

381
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,679
Why are you stalling? I don't have time. Get in now.

382
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,550
What do you think is happening?

383
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,250
Was it today? The day she gets scammed?

384
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,859
She gets scammed? What do you mean?

385
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,589
They promised young girls...

386
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,389
that they would win Miss Korea for only 500 dollars.

387
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,329
- Come on. - I noticed their operation...

388
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,500
on my first day here.

389
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,999
Well, even if she got money, she had to use it...

390
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,199
on alcohol and settlement money after fights.

391
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,439
So she didn't have any money to get scammed.

392
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,070
But that money... My mom gave the money to her!

393
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,010
There's nothing we can do.

394
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,749
Of course, there's something we can do.

395
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,280
The 500 dollars is enough for her college tuition.

396
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,719
I bet you came from a rich family. Were you the only child?

397
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,059
How could you understand that? You never had to live as a girl.

398
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,490
That's why you're laid-back like this.

399
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,590
What on earth are you saying?

400
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:10,859
Give it back! No!

401
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,399
Goodness. What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

402
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:15,570
We should go to Seoul together now.

403
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,968
I just don't think I can go through with this.

404
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,408
I have this dumb but smart sister.

405
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,040
I can't stop thinking about her.

406
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,148
Her scholastic aptitude test will end next year.

407
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:28,448
So I'll participate then. I'll do it next year!

408
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,419
Gosh. What are you talking about? You silly girl.

409
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,580
- Hey. - No.

410
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,619
What are you doing? Let's go!

411
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,730
- Gosh. - That jerk!

412
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:43,560
Hey!

413
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,699
Gosh.

414
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,800
Gosh, come on. Be quiet.

415
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,409
Hey.

416
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,679
- Gosh. - Wait.

417
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:14,730
- Get Kyung Ae first. - Okay. Aunt.

418
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,729
- Gosh. - Where are you going?

419
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,968
Goodness. Get your hands off me.

420
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,299
Give back my money, you jerk.

421
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,938
Hey. You little...

422
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:26,969
Hey!

423
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,980
Gosh. Oh, no.

424
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,580
- Gosh. - Goodness.

425
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:34,839
- It's about Soon Ae. - Yes?

426
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,810
How do you know her?

427
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,909
I wasn't going to ask because I didn't want to put you on a spot.

428
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,520
But my curiosity got the best of me.

429
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,449
You just transferred to our school.

430
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,259
Forget it. We're friends.

431
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,489
It's fine as long as we get along well.

432
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,860
Don't you agree?

433
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,600
It's whom you're thinking.

434
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,069
My crush.

435
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,040
The girl I fell for at first...

436
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,949
But you know what happened.

437
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,380
I confessed my feelings to her, and she dumped me hard.

438
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,719
She said she was seeing someone,

439
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:23,089
so she couldn't accept my feelings for her.

440
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,389
Gosh. You're so honest.

441
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,429
Thank you for telling me.

442
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What was that?

443
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,969
Gosh, what's going on now?

444
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Come on.

445
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,309
- Hey, should I let you have her? - What?

446
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,709
- Should I? - What?

447
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,138
Have whom?

448
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,779
Soon Ae. Should I let you have her?

449
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,650
What?

450
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,380
It was a joke.

451
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:07,429
Are you okay?

452
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:09,199
Are you hurt?

453
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,480
Why now? Already?

454
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,610
I wasn't supposed to see him here.

455
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,190
If he knows that I'm the guy who chased him that night,

456
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,560
did Baek Yu Sub get involved now...

457
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,929
because of me...

458
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:37,460
or Lee Kyung Ae?

459
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,830
Then was this supposed to happen?

460
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,699
Or is this a new incident?

461
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,449
We're okay. Are you all right?

462
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,880
Thank you.

463
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,949
It must not have been easy to get involved.

464
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,560
I was just passing by and thought I had to do something to help.

465
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,389
You were just passing by?

466
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Yes.

467
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,429
Gosh. What you guys did was amazing.

468
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,769
You should wait here for a bit.

469
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,369
I just called the police.

470
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,779
What on earth is going on?

471
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:32,119
We were just passing by and spotted these con artists.

472
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:34,350
Arrest all of them.

473
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,759
They could have been involved in a human trafficking operation.

474
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,389
You will score a good one.

475
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,959
Goodness. He must be a detective.

476
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,290
- Let's go. - Right.

477
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:44,499
- You're a detective, right? - Are you a cop?

478
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,769
- Are you a cop? - Can you help us?

479
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,270
- They took our money! - Okay.

480
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,969
- Can you help me go back home? - Please.

481
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,469
- I'm begging you. - Please.

482
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:56,908
- My mom is going to kill me! - Please help me go back home.

483
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:58,178
- Please. - Help us.

484
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,750
- My mom will be furious. - What are we going to do?

485
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,178
- Can you call my mom? - Please.

486
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,980
- Mom! - I need to go home.

487
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,619
- She'll kill me if I don't call. - Darn it.

488
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:21,029
Did they really disappear together?

489
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,369
Do you remember...

490
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,839
what we decided to do if something were to go wrong?

491
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,409
Yes. I do.

492
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,080
Then be careful.

493
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,250
If... This is only a hypothetical.

494
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,989
But this must never happen.

495
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,429
But if it doesn't go as we planned...

496
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,429
or we end up losing the suspect...

497
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,929
Gosh.

498
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,369
Okay.

499
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,670
Are you okay?

500
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,339
It's nothing. It stops pretty soon.

501
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,349
Was there a night you actually slept...

502
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,750
since you got here?

503
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:14,089
From what I observed, you didn't.

504
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,589
Sleep isn't important.

505
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,199
You said this world was filled with tragedies.

506
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:28,969
Why are you going this far?

507
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:33,469
To you, they are all strangers.

508
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,880
Saving every victim doesn't mean you will live in the future.

509
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:41,909
If you only have to find the real culprit,

510
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,150
there must be a simpler and easier way.

511
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,389
I just thought you had other options.

512
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:02,799
The ground was way too cold.

513
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:09,610
(March 2022)

514
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,279
By the time I went there after finding out about my death,

515
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,850
everything had already happened.

516
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:19,920
It was March.

517
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,319
And I had been murdered two months earlier.

518
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,589
The only thing I could decide was the year,

519
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,758
so if I had wanted to run into the culprit there,

520
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:32,230
I must've had no choice but to wait...

521
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,969
until it became January again.

522
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,869
For the whole ten months.

523
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,119
They say everyone dies,

524
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,659
but it was an awful death.

525
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,299
Just because of a coincidence...

526
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,239
of running into a scumbag at that time and place,

527
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,440
my life ended at once.

528
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,580
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

529
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,060
It was too cold...

530
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,819
to be abandoned there on the ground.

531
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,310
But I found out...

532
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:56,719
that there were more victims like me,

533
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,449
and that's when I became afraid.

534
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,150
That I wouldn't be able to stop him even when I knew the truth.

535
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:11,460
Knowing the truth means I have the power to change fate.

536
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,199
And...

537
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:17,699
it's hope that comes with heavy responsibility.

538
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,889
You should search the places Baek Yu Sub might be.

539
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:41,230
What about you?

540
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,000
I'll go to the spots where the murders actually occurred.

541
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,099
("A Mysterious Murder Case, Body Found with Hands and Neck Tied")

542
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,799

545
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,420
what it means, right?

546
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,229
I'm just hoping that I won't find the dead body myself.

549
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,239
Because it would mean...

550
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,549
that it is already too late.

552
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,310
Do you think it's too late?

553
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,980
We haven't found any traces,

554
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,020
so I believe she isn't dead yet.

555
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,719
Then where and what do you think she is doing?

556
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,759
We have looked everywhere.

557
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,100
Right.

558
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:28,469
She might be doing something.

559
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,069
If something really didn't happen,

560
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,810
she must be doing something somewhere.

561
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,439
Don't you think we only searched...

562
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,509
the places where a murder could've happened?

563
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:45,449
The spots where a murder might've taken place.

564
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:49,690
If she had been with Baek Yu Sub, she would have...

565
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,900
It can't be.

566
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:01,029
Then the boundary would be too big.

That's her last whereabouts, which the police recorded.

571
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,310
But things have changed already.

572
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:17,520
- She can't be there... - But she could be.

573
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,889
I know that you became more afraid because of the variables,

574
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:24,460
but you never know.

575
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,360
There are problems that reach the same conclusion...

576
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:30,759
no matter how much you try to change them.

And tomorrow

00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:54,789
- Don't block the entrance. - I always want to

587
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,488

588
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:59,359

You said they shouldn't spot us. Let's take a seat for now.

Ko Min Soo was one of the suspects too, right?

599
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,250
He served time for over 30 years as the real culprit.

600
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,650
But he denied all charges until the end.

601
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,980
That was Ko Min Soo?

602
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,219
Why? How?

603
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,960
There were a few pieces of evidence,

604
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,060
but what decided his verdict was the witness.

605
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,960
She said she saw him murder the victim in person.

606
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:13,770
It was his sister, Ko Mi Sook.

607
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:19,069
The very Ko Mi Sook?

608
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:26,980
One of them must be lying.

609
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,610

You're not trying to trick me, are you?

724
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:47,048
You've already lost all your money. What else can I do?

725
00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:48,819
Darn it. That money.

726
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:53,360
I was really going to give the money to Soon Ae to pay for her tuition.

727
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:54,790
Gosh.

728
00:54:54,989 --> 00:54:56,759
You're not trying to trick me, are you?

729
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,159
Don't you dare use it all up on alcohol.

730
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:01,869
Sorry?

731
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,270
Here.

732
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,639
What?

733
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:09,610
I secretly took it back from him earlier. Take it with you.

734
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,080
Oh, my goodness.

735
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,380
Oh, my. Gosh.

736
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:21,020
This... I can't...

737
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:24,719
Can I give you a peck?

738
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,860
What?

739
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,960
You can't. Go home.

740
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:35,699
Hey, Lee Soon Ae.

741
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,639
- Do you know what happened today? - Kyung Ae.

742
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,480
- Kyung Ae. - I'm sorry, Soon Ae.

743
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:49,909
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

744
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,020
- I'm sorry. - Kyung Ae.

745
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:59,190
I got mad at you.

746
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,339
(Lee Hyung Man)

747
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,589
Thank you for everything you did today.

748
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:35,429
I couldn't see the culprit.

749
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,258
I thought I could escape from the fog,

750
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:41,000
but things got messed up again.

751
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:45,069
We only have one chance left.

752
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,639
But things have gotten more clear.

753
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,009
So for today, just being able to watch that scene is enough.

754
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,650
Hello?

755
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,440
Who are you?

756
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:07,690
Mr. Yoon.

757
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:10,020
Yoo Bum Ryong?

758
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,860
She's dead.

759
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:32,279
She's dead, Mr. Yoon.

760
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:51,659
She's dead.

761
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,830
It ended up happening.

762
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,060
(My Perfect Stranger)

763
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:56,489
What happened?

764
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,259
Explain.

765
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:00,699
Explain everything you saw and did...

766
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,699
from start to finish.

767
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:04,440
She never left?

768
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,339
The time and place have changed, but the same person died.

769
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:08,969
No one has ever died there.

770
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,580
Everything's back to square one, and this is our end.

771
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:13,810
She's not even from this village. Why did she have to die here?

772
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,020
Why do you look so serious?

773
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,190
Relax.

774
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:23,850
You're making it obvious.

775
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,440
