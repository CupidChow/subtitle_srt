00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,410
Hae Jun.

8
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,039
Dad!

9
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,979
Dad.

10
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,620
Do you think this will bring back Hae Jun?

11
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,729
You should have been nice to him when you had the chance.

12
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,000
Do you think hopelessly waiting for him here would...

13
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,699
bring my son back?

14
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,269
You're really getting on my nerves. Darn it.

15
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,840
What's your deal?

16
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,410
What's your angle, you jerk?

17
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,579
Seriously. What do you want from me? Why did you come to me?

18
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,819
Why did you blabber about finding me?

19
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,220
(Episode 15)

20
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,539
(Congratulations on hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics.)

21
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,130
Mr. Yoon was on the news.

22
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,900
He said he saw the culprit's face.

23
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,439
Is that true?

24
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,780
I came here this afternoon too.

25
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,720
My plan had already fallen through.

26
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,820
And you seemed desperate for my answer.

27
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,390
I came here, thinking I might consider telling you.

28
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:53,760
But I didn't see you here. Some guy was here.

29
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,700
None other than the culprit.

30
00:04:58,729 --> 00:04:59,770
What?

31
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,600
It's easier to miss what's right under your nose.

32
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,309
But you came to me for answers after bringing him into your house.

33
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,080
What was I supposed to do?

34
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,919
What are you talking about?

35
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,650
You really had no idea.

36
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,260
I'm talking about Yeon Woo.

37
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,989
The son of the principal.

38
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,770
He's the culprit.

39
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,419
Why did you come find me?

40
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,359
Darn it.

41
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Yoon Young.

42
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,359
I know where we should check.

43
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,499
On account of murdering Lee Ju Young, Lee Kyung Ae,

44
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,499
and Yoo Bum Ryong...

45
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,900
and attempting to murder Lee Soon Ae and Yoon Hae Jun,

46
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,410
Yoon Yeon Woo was arrested.

47
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,950
To collect evidence, we will search the house and seize items.

48
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Let's go.

49
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,229
Gosh. Are you all right?

50
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,229
Listen. How did this happen?

51
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,600
What's going on, Dong Sik?

52
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:02,080
Mr. Yoon is transported to the hospital.

53
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,210
He's still unconscious.

54
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,239
Hae Jun.

55
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,570
Hae Jun.

56
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,350
What on earth is happening right now?

57
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,489
Gosh.

58
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,129
Hae Jun.

59
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,100
Hae Jun.

60
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,149
Hae Jun...

61
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,440
What will happen to the culprit now?

62
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,840
We'll have to make him pay the price...

63
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,909
after writing up the report well.

64
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,879
I'm sure...

65
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,379
that's what Mr. Yoon also wants.

66
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,159
I thought this would be all over once we caught the culprit.

67
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,159
The innocent victims...

68
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,330
who had to suffer a horrible death.

69
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm not sure if he can pay for all the sins he's committed.

70
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,149
But now, I'm so afraid...

71
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,589
that this whole thing has become something that'll never end...

72
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,029
for Hae Jun.

73
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,539
How can this be the ultimate answer?

74
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,040
I feel so bad for him.

75
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,119
So it was...

76
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,029
It was really him who hurt Hae Jun that badly?

77
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,339
When Yeon Woo flew back to Korea,

78
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,450
I even went to the airport myself to pick him up.

79
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:29,320
I drove four hours in my own car...

80
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,450
and took him back in the same car.

81
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,950
That was after the murder incidents had occurred in the village.

82
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:36,359
We saw all the commotion together...

83
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,529
after we came back, so how is he the culprit?

84
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,129
Chairman Yoon, did you not check his passport?

85
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,830
His passport?

86
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,279
Yeon Woo came back...

87
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:06,220
way earlier than the day you picked him up.

88
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,790
That was the reason...

89
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,190
he was excluded from the list of suspects.

90
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,300
Yeon Woo fooled everyone in the first place.

91
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,769
Even the date of his return.

92
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,249
It's time for you to confess when, where, and how...

93
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,580
you committed those crimes.

94
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,050
It hurts.

95
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:43,159
Don't you dare try to pull a trick.

96
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,830
Be straight with me!

97
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,330
I said it hurt.

98
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,159
The arm you shot at...

99
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,430
hurts like crazy.

100
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,639
I think I need to get it treated.

101
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,769
Can you call my father?

102
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,080
Don't you know where you are?

103
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,019
Don't you know why you ended up here?

104
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,090
I'm not so sure.

105
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,060
Could you explain it to me?

106
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:22,529
- What? - The evidence.

107
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,369
If you show me the evidence you found...

108
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,509
What is it?

109
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,379
You don't have any evidence?

110
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm sure you have already searched...

111
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,859
my house and my room.

112
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,369
But you didn't find anything, did you?

113
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,009
Of course not.

114
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,779
Because I didn't do it.

115
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,879
Right?

116
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,090
Are you okay?

117
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,019
Are you feeling better?

118
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,869
What happened to the culprit?

119
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,040
It's all settled now.

120
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,440
Detective Baek took him in and is investigating him.

121
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,730
Are you going to keep avoiding my eyes?

122
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,070
I'm sorry.

123
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:25,909
It was my father who hurt your family...

124
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,719
and made you lose a family member.

125
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,750
And I was born to that horrifying man.

126
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,560
And that horrifying man hurt you too.

127
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,830
So why are you apologizing?

128
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,399
What you and I...

129
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:51,240
and our families went through...

130
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,310
None of that is your fault.

131
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,350
So don't ever say sorry...

132
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,879
or feel guilty.

133
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,659
Whoever your father is,

134
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:16,159
nothing changes the way I perceive you.

135
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,409
Thank you for coming around.

136
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,369
Chairman Yoon.

137
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,649
I'm sure he's the culprit.

138
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,719
He fell into the trap we set up.

139
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,519
Also, he ran as soon as he found out that I was there.

140
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,889
On top of that, he tried to run with your car.

141
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,889
And he hurt you.

142
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,659
He even lied about the date of entry.

143
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,469
There are so many suspicious things about him.

144
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,070
But we don't have...

145
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,040
a dead give-away.

146
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,969
He must know that because he seems really relaxed.

147
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:37,639
I bet he's cleaned them up so we wouldn't find them,

148
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,449
seeing how he asked me if I had found any evidence.

149
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:41,850
What about his handwriting?

150
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,020
Have you checked if it matches the one on the note?

151
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:55,730
What is all this?

152
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,359
The letters...

153
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,330
Yeon Woo sent me...

154
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,500
every week from the States.

155
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,510
I'm the only one who has these.

156
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,279
(Dear Chung Ah)

157
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,889
(I just arrived in the States and have been busy sorting things.)

158
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,459
This is...

159
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,189
different from his handwriting that I know of.

160
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,830
That's because he only wrote that way for me.

161
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,230
I'm the only one...

162
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,199
who knows this handwriting of his...

163
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,340
in the entire world.

164
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,310
People...

165
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,280
might start to recognize it now.

166
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,050
The note left by the culprit to the victims...

167
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,919
That handwriting is...

168
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,389
the same as this.

169
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,330
You...

170
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,000
can't really fake your handwriting.

171
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,730
That's why it's frustrating.

172
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,600
Just like with Ko Min Soo,

173
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,070
if there was anything with his handwriting,

174
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,770
I could compare the handwriting.

175
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,179
But I can't find any no matter how hard I look.

176
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,679
About the lady who came to you after the news aired...

177
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,080
The owner of Bong Bong Teahouse.

178
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,919
She's the one who told you Yeon Woo was the culprit, right?

179
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,329
I thought I could get something from her,

180
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,859
so I've been looking everywhere for her.

181
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,800
She closed the teahouse and disappeared.

182
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,100
She's nowhere to be found.

183
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,270
She must have left town by now.

184
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:47,469
She wanted to.

185
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,409
What are you talking about?

186
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,250
He said he wanted to write me...

187
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,290
in a special way.

188
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,629
He said he'd use the other hand...

189
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,600
only when he wrote me.

190
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,699
I thought it was romantic.

191
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,570
Because of that idea,

192
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,040
I liked him even more.

193
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,909
Then one day...

194
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:26,479
detectives came to me.

195
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,079
(From Yoon Yeon Woo, To Lee Chung Ah)

196
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
And they showed me the note in a matchbox.

197
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,149
Since it was the matchbox of my teahouse,

198
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:36,059
they thought I could recognize the handwriting...

199
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
if it was by a regular.

200
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,030
I recognized it immediately for sure.

201
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,459
It was the handwriting that only I knew.

202
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,830
Then...

203
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:51,139
why didn't you tell them at that time?

204
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,189
Do you...

205
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,899
I wanted to run away.

206
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,570
I just...

207
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,899
I just wanted to run away.

208
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,070
I really was going to.

209
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,310
Yoon Hae Jun.

210
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,550
I ended up confessing to him.

211
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,619
But I don't think he has proof.

212
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,830
You know Yeon Woo is smart.

213
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,800
He wouldn't have made any mistakes.

214
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,929
Except for these.

215
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,639
(Dear Chung Ah)

216
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,740
- So... - Chung Ah.

217
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:04,310
What is the real reason you came to me?

218
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:15,219
Detective Baek.

219
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:21,659
Well,

220
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,560
about the owner of Bong Bong Teahouse.

221
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:29,240
Is there anything I can do to help you find her?

222
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,570
What?

223
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,609
She seems like an important person.

224
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,439
Of course, to us now...

225
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:40,810
and more to him.

226
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:47,490
Are you...

227
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,859
If she had left town,

228
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,530
she might have dropped by the general store.

229
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,129
I'll go to my grandpa...

230
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:04,439
and see if I can find something.

231
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,139
Thank you, Yoon Young.

232
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,780
The owner of Bong Bong Teahouse? Yes, I saw her.

233
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,090
She was sitting alone in front of our store for a while.

234
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,659
I felt bad seeing a woman sitting alone like that.

235
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,090
So I sat with her for a moment...

236
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,358
to see her get on her bus.

237
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,629
Then you must've seen what bus she took and where she went.

238
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,530
I'm not sure about that.

239
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,399
I don't really remember.

240
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,040
Thank you.

241
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,080
Are you all right?

242
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
What?

243
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,250
Because of Chairman Yoon's son?

244
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:01,230
To be honest, I still can't believe it.

245
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,359
Chairman Yoon...

246
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,969
is such a good person.

247
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,600
How could the son of such a decent man...

248
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:14,010
be like that?

249
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,939
On one hand,

250
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:20,909
I do hope he's the real culprit.

251
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,219
How so?

252
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:28,350
Then that means the culprit has been caught.

253
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,389
It's all over.

254
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,830
Other people...

255
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,060
don't have to go through the pain that my kids went through.

256
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,129
Since it's a pain...

257
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:42,439
that I don't wish...

258
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,609
upon anyone or any family...

259
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,040
in the whole world.

260
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,580
Please...

261
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,189
thank Mr. Yoon for me again.

262
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,719
Tell him that I thank him for catching the culprit.

263
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:06,730
And that I'm truly thankful that he ended this for me.

264
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:10,899
Okay.

265
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,270
There's no proof?

266
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,240
How?

267
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,209
There's no handwriting of his...

268
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,379
that I remember.

269
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,709
I don't remember seeing his handwriting.

270
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:39,429
Grandpa.

271
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,059
What is this?

272
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,730
I told Dad that I could read now,

273
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,730
and he sent me a letter, Grandpa.

274
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,369
(From Yoon Yeon Woo, To Yoon Hae Jun)

275
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:55,169
(Dear lovely Hae Jun)

276
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,010
What a horrible brat.

277
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,550
He knew.

278
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,730
He knew about it all along.

279
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
Hae Jun.

280
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:45,619
(Dear Chung Ah)

281
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,189
(I hope you'll use the diary I gifted you well.)

282
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,500
What are you doing here?

283
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,699
What do you think you're doing?

284
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,869
Hae Jun, this is...

285
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,469
This is evidence with the culprit's handwriting on it.

286
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:02,909
What? Are you going to burn it down?

287
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,810
I know.

288
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,850
I know that this is a crazy thing to do.

289
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,349
And that this is something I would never be forgiven for.

290
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,419
And what?

291
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,289
The rest of your life depends on this.

292
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,820
Since your future relies on it,

293
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:20,030
I had no choice.

294
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,100
This was the best choice I could make for you.

295
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,629
The baby in your mom's belly now, which is you.

296
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,539
How could I let him live...

297
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,070
as the son of a murderer?

298
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,240
How can I just let that happen?

299
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,310
Hae Jun.

300
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,310
I'll be punished for everything.

301
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,149
Even if I'm sent to the fiery pit, I'll take responsibility for it.

302
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,090
Can you just turn a blind eye...

303
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,520
and live a normal life like others?

304
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,589
I'll keep him away from you...

305
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,830
so he doesn't do anything horrible to you again, Hae Jun.

306
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:02,699
You did this back then as well.

307
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,409
Even you decided to cover this up,

308
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,580
so everything was swept under the rug.

309
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,909
If you did this...

310
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,119
If you buried this problem,

311
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,449
would I live as happily as you wanted?

312
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,459
Don't make an excuse, saying this was for my future.

313
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:29,330
You couldn't live in peace after hushing this up,

314
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,929
so you even shunned your grandson for the rest of your life.

315
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,240
All my life,

316
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:42,070
the only thing I saw was your back turned toward me.

317
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,250
No.

318
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,619
Knowing that future,

319
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,389
would you still choose to do this?

320
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,929
He saw her get on a direct bus at the general store.

321
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,559
But he didn't see where the bus was headed.

322
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,359
It's all right. We don't have to look for her anymore.

323
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,570
Why is that?

324
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,969
Mr. Yoon just stopped by.

325
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,708
What are you talking about? He should be at the hospital. Why...

326
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:49,639
He gave me evidence that shows Yeon Woo,

327
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,240
the culprit's handwriting.

328
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,148
He found evidence?

329
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:56,719
Yes. This will be enough to close the case.

330
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,649
Thanks to his help, I'll be able to put away the right guy.

331
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,379
You're not going to ask where I have been?

332
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,510
I heard everything.

333
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,060
I'm all right now. Can I get discharged?

334
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,759
Of course, not. Not yet.

335
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,659
I want to go home now.

336
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:49,199
My grandpa told me to thank you.

337
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,109
He said that he ran into...

338
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,709
the owner of Bong Bong Teahouse in front of the general store.

339
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,219
It seemed she didn't know which bus to get on.

340
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,090
Even when the bus stopped, she didn't seem to want to get on.

341
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,290
He said she kept looking down at something.

342
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,070
Are you going far?

343
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,469
Yes.

344
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,010
You have a lot of time left until the first bus.

345
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:28,609
It's early in the morning.

346
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:31,909
Hold on. Let me open up the door. You should stay inside.

347
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,250
I'm good.

348
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,550
Gosh. I'm good too.

349
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,080
After losing a daughter,

350
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,790
everything in this world worries me.

351
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:46,929
But I'm glad that the culprit got caught. Right?

352
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,030
Yes.

353
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,000
Goodness. How beautiful.

354
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,879
She kept fidgeting with baby socks for a long time.

355
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,949
She barely brought herself to get on the bus.

356
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,480
That's what your mother did.

357
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,560
You knew?

358
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,259
Should I see if I can find out where she went?

359
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,440
No. I'm okay.

360
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:52,118
The suspect in the serial murder in Woojung-Ri was caught.

361
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,060
Can you give us a status update?

362
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,400
Sure.

363
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,670
The police successfully arrested the suspect,

364
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:09,440
who is responsible for three murders...

365
00:35:10,009 --> 00:35:12,008
and two attempted murders...

366
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:15,080
that have taken place in Woojung-Ri since this May.

367
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,649
The suspect, Yoon, had stayed abroad to study for a long time.

368
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,388
He was an international student in his mid-20s.

369
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:23,420
An arrest warrant for his charges has been issued.

370
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,020
So we arrested Yoon.

371
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:28,059
We plan to thoroughly investigate the motive and his whereabouts...

372
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,759
and send him over to the prosecution.

373
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,459
Gosh. Oh, dear.

374
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,638
To Chairman Yoon, his only child was the apple of his eye.

375
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,000
Are you really sure he was the culprit?

376
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,939
Gosh. He was smart, and his family was rich.

377
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,979
He had everything he ever wanted. What more did he want?

378
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,778
Why did he do such a horrible thing?

379
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,948
- Gosh. - Goodness.

380
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,278
Does growing up in a poor family give you the right to kill people?

381
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:54,319
- Gosh. We didn't mean that. - Oh, no. That's not it.

382
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,190
My daughter was the apple of my eye too.

383
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:59,560
Seriously. You and your gossips.

384
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,429
- Goodness. That guy. - Oh, my.

385
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,159
Gosh.

386
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,439
The serial murder in Woojung-Ri lasted a month. And the suspect...

387
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,139
was finally arrested.

388
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,379
The nightmare of the local residents who trembled in fear...

389
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,049
- finally ended. - Seriously.

390
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,150
Let's hear the coverage from Reporter Kim Sang Woo.

391
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:27,588
A series of murders took place in Woojung-Ri in the past month.

392
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:30,520
The suspect, Yoon, was arrested. And he was brought into the station.

393
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,059
Yoon was moved to the interview room at the police station...

394
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,889
while facing a barrage of cameras.

395
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,229
Yoon denied the murder charges.

396
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,669
But the police announced that they had acquired evidence...

397
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,568
that showed Yoon's handwriting matched...

398
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,869
the handwriting of the culprit from the notes he left at the scene.

399
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:51,509
I think everything is over now.

400
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,049
They got the culprit. I've done everything I can do here.

401
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,250
The car is fixed too.

402
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:05,060
We should get ready to go back now.

403
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,460
Leave here?

404
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,429
We can't live here as invisible people.

405
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,730
We should go and check how the future has changed.

406
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,210
You'll need time to say goodbye to your parents...

407
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:24,409
and the rest of the family.

408
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,850
What do you think about leaving tomorrow night?

409
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,719
Sure.

410
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,060
Let's do that.

411
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,980
Do you want it?

412
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,060
I said no.

413
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:14,389
Did my dad call yet?

414
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:33,509
I trust you. Come out once you're done talking to him.

415
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,719
Okay.

416
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,068
I was wondering who would be the lucky guy.

417
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:55,729
I guess that guy was Hee Sub.

418
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,169
You always drooled over the guitar because you didn't have money.

419
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,270
Good for you.

420
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,809
Your girlfriend bought it for you.

421
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,239
- Don't be ridiculous! - Don't be ridiculous!

422
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,709
Hey!

423
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,879
- This isn't right. - Come on.

424
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,679
- We're not buying that. - Too late.

425
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:18,819
Have you gone mad?

426
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,730
Two hundred dollars is a lot of money.

427
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,960
Why are you buying me that?

428
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,500
It's probably not your money anyway.

429
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,770
You stole Mr. Yoon's money, right?

430
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,270
- If you get caught, I will... - Hey!

431
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:37,609
I'm going to pay him back.

432
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,150
Stop fighting me on this. Get the guitar and come out.

433
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,179
You're so loud.

434
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,279
Gosh.

435
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,690
Here. It's really yours.

436
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,540
- Thank you. - Gosh.

437

(Sun and Moon Record Shop)

438
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,810
Gosh.

439
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,270
Don't tell me...

440
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,299
you bought this for me because you like...

441
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,480
It's a bribe.

442
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,759
I want you to be good...

443
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,230
to my best friend, Soon Ae, for the rest of your life.

444
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,000
If you make her cry even once,

445
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,469
I'm not going to let that slide.

446
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:13,569
Is this a bribe or a threat?

447
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:16,710
I'll take care of that myself.

448
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:17,940
So why would you...

449
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:21,779
No matter what obstacle you face,

450
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,319
don't ever break up and stay next to each other.

451
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,360
That way,

452
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,730
I'll be able to see you two again.

453
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,230
Are you going somewhere?

454
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,369
We'll be able to see each other soon.

455
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,210
Well, it might take you a bit longer.

456
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,110
What are you saying?

457
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,420
Is your head hurting again?

458
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:03,659
It looks like you don't have a fever.

459
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,830
That's enough. You can get going now.

460
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,909
Gosh, I don't feel too good about this.

461
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,429
Dad, make sure to live happily with Mom this time.

462
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,239
Don't be sick.

463
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,639
Do whatever you want in life...

464
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:58,679
without getting hurt.

465
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:12,020
Why on earth did you kill me?

466
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,989
I've really wanted to ask you this.

467
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,400
I won't be able to learn the answer now...

468
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:25,369
since the future where you can kill me is no longer possible.

470
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,310

I see. Was that it?

You were killed by me,

481
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,420
so you came back to take revenge?

482
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:02,559
If you were that curious about the reason,

483
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
why didn't you let things be?

484
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,400
That way, I wouldn't have been caught.

485
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,600
Then I'd have been...

486
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,799
able to kill you again.

487
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,869
I know we lived apart,

488
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,110
but I didn't know you'd have such a different side.

489
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
What?

490
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,819
The crucial evidence.

491
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,989

(I hope you'll use the diary I gifted you well.)

495
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,069
You're a smart guy.

496
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:47,770
You didn't leave any traces at the scene,

497
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,409
but why did you not remember those?

498
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,179
I'm sure you knew that they could be crucial evidence.

499
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,679
You knew that she could have...

500
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,449
ended you with those letters.

501
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:05,290
Why did you let her go?

502
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:12,500
Did you actually love her?

503
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,969
What an unexpected question.

504
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:25,980
I thought you'd ask why I killed them...

505
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:28,310
and how.

506
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:35,150
Love?

507
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,389
I loved her.

508
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,130
I did love her.

509
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:45,560
I thought she was someone who could make my dream come true.

510
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,440
I thought she'd be different...

511
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,670
from the dreadful woman...

512
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,080
I know.

513
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:01,750
From what I remember,

514
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:04,219
she was mostly reading books.

515
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,690
She never looked at me warmly,

516
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:12,089
not even once. I have no such memory.

517
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:16,488

("Nietzsche")

519
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,400
she ran away from home.

520
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,900
She said she no longer wanted to live as someone's mom.

521
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:34,750
Should I...

522
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:38,219
go meet my mom?

523
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:42,089
Your mom?

524
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,659
Have you heard about your mom?

525
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:11,619
I was abandoned...

526
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,750
by someone who should've given me...

527
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,719
unconditional love.

528
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,589
Do you know how miserable that feels?

529
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:23,759
Missing the person who abandoned you and crying all night...

530
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,000
without a sense of pride.

531
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,000
In that endless cycle of pain,

532
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,139
I promised myself...

533
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,270
that one day,

534
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,779
if I had a son of my own,

535
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:43,880
I would...

536
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,350
never let my kid live the life that I did.

537
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,659
I wanted to live happily with a woman...

538
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,690
who'd love our child more than anyone in the world.

539
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,730
So I did meet...

540
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,929
the woman I wanted.

541
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:05,699
That woman...

542
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:08,440
She was an orphan.

543
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:12,639
She was desperate to have a family of her own.

544
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:17,219
Do you know that you almost achieved that?

545
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,089
- What? - The perfect happiness...

546
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:26,719
and family that you desperately wanted.

547
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,830
You ruined that chance yourself. Do you know that?

548
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,029
What are you talking about?

549
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,869
It's why I'm glad.

550
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,500
That my mom...

551
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,569
could get away from a jerk like you.

552
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,889
You...

553
00:51:01,889 --> 00:51:03,389
You are not...

554
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:12,969
This can't be.

555
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,409
If you were really my son,

556
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,810
you wouldn't be able to do this to me. No.

557
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,219
How could I have killed you?

558
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,549
Thanks to having a horrible dad like you,

559
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,860
I was abandoned from birth. I'll tell you what happened.

560
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,560
Everything you've said until now...

561
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,330
It's just ridiculous self-pity...

562
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:42,969
from a murderer with a victim mentality.

563
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:49,040
So you better live the rest of your life...

564
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:52,940
in pain, behind those bars.

565
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,419
This is my last request,

566
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,920
as your son whom you wanted to have so dearly.

567
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,610
- Mr. Yoon. - Goodness.

568
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,738
- Yes, sir. - Gosh.

569
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:00,079
Why are all of you outside? Is there something wrong?

570
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,779
Of course, there is.

571
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,549
I heard you're moving out tonight.

572
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:07,690
How could you leave so suddenly without telling us?

573
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,690
I'm disappointed. Do you know that?

574
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:13,860
- Yes. - It's so disappointing, Mr. Yoon.

575
00:53:14,029 --> 00:53:16,589
I considered you family. How could...

576
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,610
I'm telling you, we're going to see each other again.

577
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,610
When?

578
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,250
Where?

579
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:43,889
In about 34 years,

580
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,060
in your house.

581
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,159
I hate you.

582
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,369
Just say that we won't see each other until we die.

583
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:58,940
That we won't be able to see each other anymore.

584
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:03,810
So that I don't have to wait.

585
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,920
By that time,

586
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,690
you might look different than now,

587
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,759
but I love that face too.

588
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:28,730
That face...

589
00:54:30,429 --> 00:54:31,900
I miss it a lot.

590
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:40,440
I'm so glad I was able to come here.

591
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,580
I...

592
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:48,020
I was able to meet this version of you...

593
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,690
and have you back in my life.

594
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,860
And I'm so glad.

595
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,909
Me too.

596
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:15,110
Me too.

597
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,420
I'm so glad that I was able...

598
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,020
to meet you.

599
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,420
Thank you.

600
00:55:58,259 --> 00:56:00,259
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

601
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,529
I'm so thankful...

602
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,929
- that you were our neighbour. - Thank you.

603
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:10,170
Thank you for saying that.

604
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Goodness.

605
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,210
Thank you so much for helping my sisters, Mr. Yoon.

606
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,040
Sure.

607
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,679
Can you just tell us where you're going?

608
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,880
So we can think of you being in some place.

609
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,020
Just the location.

610
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,960
Well, it's quite far.

611
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:36,929
Please stay healthy for a long time.

612
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,699
I'll make sure to come back and visit you guys.

613
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,949
We're really leaving this place.

614
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,589
You're right.

615
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,759
I haven't time travelled in a while.

616
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,860
I'm slightly nervous.

617
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,730
Will you be okay?

618
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,199
What do you mean?

619
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,900
Leaving without saying goodbye...

620
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:23,369
to your grandfather and your mother.

621
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,380
Especially your mother. This might be the last time you get to see her.

622
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,850
I didn't come here to see them anyway.

623
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:35,250
I've already spent enough time with them.

624
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,690
It was enough.

625
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:46,758
What are you going to do once we go back?

626
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:47,929
What do you want to do?

627
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,028
An iced caramel macchiato.

628
00:57:50,029 --> 00:57:52,270
Let's make it super sweet and drink it together.

629
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,310
Do you know how good it is with salted butter rolls?

630
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,080
There you go again with the sweet and salty.

631
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,920
This is pretty nerve-wracking.

632
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,750
Don't worry.

633
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:44,659
It'll end in the blink of an eye.

634
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,159
Once we pass this tunnel,

635
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,499
we'll be back on home ground,

636
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,900
in 2021, like magic.

637
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:59,299
Sounds good. Let's go.

638
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:42,509
Are we here?

639
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,650
Is this it?

640
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,190
Are we in 2021?

641
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,790
That was smoother than I thought.

642
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,360
I'm not sure since it's been a while.

643
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,400
Is this 2021?

644
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,869
It has to be.

645
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:12,309
- Mr. Yoon! - Yes.

646
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,710
Hey! Mr. Yoon!

647
01:00:21,949 --> 01:00:25,259
I thought you were an anchor in 2021.

648
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:48,980
June 14, 1987,

649
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:51,350
at 10:40pm,

650
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:55,119
we attempted to leave this place after completing everything.

651
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:58,860
But we were still in the same place.

652
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,790
Perhaps it is our fate...

653
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,130
to be trapped here forever.

654
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:16,440
(The final episode will air tomorrow at 9:50pm.)

655
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:50,270
