6
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,090
Hey, isn't that the car that broke down a while ago?

7
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,920
Gosh. You've fixed it up now.

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,159
Yes.

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,029
Goodness. Good for you.

10
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:02,630
You must be going somewhere. Drive safely.

11
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:04,499
Bye.

12
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,220
(Battery, 2 percent)

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,720
How big of a mess...

14
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,759
are we in?

15
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,759
I'm not sure. I've never experienced this before.

16
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,959
Are we going to get stuck here for the rest of our lives?

17
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,569
Does it mean we can't go back home?

18
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,369
No.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,240
Don't worry. I just have to fix this. I can fix it.

20
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:48,339
I can just fix it.

21
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,619
I can fix it. I can do it.

22
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,649
Let's go back home for now.

(My Perfect Stranger, Episode 16, My Perfect Stranger)

24
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,919
I didn't think...

25
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,120
it was necessary for me to ask you this...

26
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,059
because the existence of a time machine...

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,789
didn't make sense in the first place, anyway.

28
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,899
It didn't matter who invented it.

29
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,969
Even if it came out of the Genie's lamp,

30
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,199
I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it.

31
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,810
You didn't invent it, right?

32
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,250
Then where did you get it?

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,019
I just found it.

34
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,350
You just found it.

35
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,060
You happened to come across...

36
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,329
a time machine.

37
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,030
You just found a time machine.

38
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,630
You just found a time machine.

39
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,850
(Congratulations on hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics.)

40
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:36,879
Hyung Man.

41
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,049
Don't call him by his name like that.

42
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,520
I don't want to talk to you. Please leave.

43
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,150
Leave!

44
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,689
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,460
I'm truly sorry.

46
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,830
It's my fault.

47
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,010
I raised him wrong.

48
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,710
Because I didn't do my job right,

49
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,580
you had to lose your precious daughter.

50
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,749
I know that...

51
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,189
nothing I say can erase the pain you feel...

52
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,059
or comfort you in any way.

53
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,660
For the rest of my life,

54
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,900
I will live in atonement.

55
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:34,470
I will never live in peace even for a moment.

56
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,640
I will live my life in suffering.

57
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,780
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,919
Do you think you can really do that?

59
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,720
Do you...

60
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,619
really think you can live the rest of your life in suffering?

61
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,400
I will.

62
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,030
I will live in suffering.

63
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,369
I'm really sorry.

64
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,340
I want that jerk...

65
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,010
and his family to live in suffering...

66
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,239
and be tortured for the rest of their lives.

67
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,249
I know how difficult it is for a father...

68
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
to reveal his son's crime...

69
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,789
no matter how heinous...

70
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,400
it may be.

71
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,570
I thank you for doing what you did.

72
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,669
Gosh.

73
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:55,809
Well,

74
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,780
I'm glad we at least have a home to come back to.

75
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,950
Why don't we get drunk today?

76
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,720
We can't get anything done today anyway.

77
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,989
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

78
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,340
I thought he had fixed everything. But he didn't.

79
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,609
It's not all bad.

80
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,939
Even if I were to go back now,

81
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,379
I would probably have to start working.

82
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,350
At least while I'm here,

83
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,850
I won't have to set the alarms at 6:30am, 6:35am, and 6:40am.

84
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,619
I won't have to hear the alarms at five-minute intervals.

85
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,560
It's not all bad.

86
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,560
I get to hang out with my mom more.

87
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,200
And I can breathe in more of this fresh air.

88
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,639
And grilled eels are only two dollars.

89
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,970
You don't even have two dollars.

90
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,580
Are you telling me I'm on my own now?

91
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,249
I know you have money.

92
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,180
Actually, I'm running out of the money I brought over.

93
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,820
I didn't plan on staying this long.

94
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,960
I didn't plan on getting stuck here.

95
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,460
The lottery.

96
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,970
You didn't memorize any winning lottery numbers?

97
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,499
What do you think?

98
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:35,879
Darn it.

99
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,909
You are conscientious for no good reason.

100
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,420
It's all right.

101
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,920
We're both healthy.

102
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,129
We know the future. You know?

103
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:59,430
It's more likely that we'll make a fortune. We won't be poor.

104
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,590
But...

105
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,690
how could you just happen to find it?

106
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,129
Finding a 50-cent coin on the street isn't even easy nowadays.

107
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,729
That puzzles me too.

108
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,940
How did you come to find it?

109
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,649
It rained a lot that night.

110
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,550
Deviated from the course. Redirecting to a new route.

111
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,320
The GPS was broken that night,

112
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,359
and I could barely see ahead because of the rain.

113
00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:00,489
I was driving around without knowing exactly where I was.

114
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,070
That's when I ran into it.

115
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,300
In front of the underpass.

116
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,879
It was sitting there as though it were abandoned?

117
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,680
The door was wide open too.

118
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,079
On top of that,

119
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,220
there was an owner's manual that told me...

120
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:31,060
to drive past the underpass in front of me and such.

121
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,529
The underpass in front of you.

122
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:40,999
It sounds like it was waiting for someone to discover it.

123
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,970
Now that I think back, that wasn't the only strange thing.

124
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,810
The day I crashed into you.

125
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,279
Do you remember what you asked me? About the phone call?

126
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,378
This car can't bump into things.

127
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:58,920
Did you make a call or something?

128
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,920
You did.

129
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,319
Isn't it likely to lead to an accident...

130
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,159
when you do such a thing while driving?

131
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,430
But what's so strange about that?

132
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,830
Actually, I did...

133
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,940
get a phone call that day.

134
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,139
Hello.

135
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,779
What?

136
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,879
You're the only one who can resolve this from start to finish.

137
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,149
Sorry?

138
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,258
I was so out of it then...

139
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:44,859
that I just disregarded it, thinking it was a random call.

140
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,028
But it sounded like it came from someone...

141
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,739
who knew about this.

142
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,310
Who could it have been?

143
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,139
I'm not sure.

144
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,830
Are you all right?

145
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,869
You're not walking straight.

146
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,769
I'm fine.

147
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,440
I can't be covered by insurance here.

148
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,479
That sounds oddly familiar.

149
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:30,540
I'm fine.

150
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,080
If I died here, things would get so iffy.

151
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:43,489
I was so lost then,

152
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,330
but now, I don't feel that lost, to be honest.

153
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,170
Now that I'm with someone I like.

154
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,509
If...

155
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,639
This is hypothetical.

156
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:06,878
Even if we get stuck here for good...

157
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,649
because we can't find a way back,

158
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,389
I think I'll be okay with it,

159
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,590
as long as I'm with you.

160
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,729
Really?

161
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,200
What about you?

162
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,210
Me?

163
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,779
You don't even need to ask.

164
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,879
Of course, I don't want to be here.

165
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,169
This is different from what you told me last night.

166
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,228
What do you mean?

167
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:35,399
You said it'd be okay.

168
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,599
You said it'd be okay to be stuck here forever...

169
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,608
as long as you were with me.

170
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,869
You almost drilled a hole in the back of my head with your glare.

171
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,779
You've been watching me for hours.

172
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,339
I was just curious...

173
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,210
to see if things were going all right.

174
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,778
You were only curious,

175
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,019
but you sighed so deeply every time I looked confused.

176
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,790
I was the only one who meant it, wasn't I?

177
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,859
Of course, I meant it too.

178
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,460
But...

179
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:05,529
it'd be nicer to be together in 2021,

180
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,129
enjoying modern conveniences.

181
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,279
I'm sorry! I won't look anymore!

182
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,149
But could you leave the door open a little?

183
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,830
All right, then.

184
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,300
Okay, fine. I'll get back inside.

185
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,899
I'm going inside.

186
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,138
("Small Door")

187
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,878
I hear this novel is really popular these days.

188
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,249
- Really? - Yes.

189
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,950
- It looks fun. - It looks fun, right?

190
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,950
- Would you like to read it? - Sure.

191
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,219
("Small Door," full-length novel by Lee Soon Ae)

192
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,929
Thank you so much. Come again!

193
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,960
- Thank you. - Sure.

194
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:22,040
I read it,

195
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:24,080
and it was fun.

196
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,250
You're a great writer.

197
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,049
Can you sign your autograph on the cover later?

198
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,418
(Bookstore)

199
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,820
Are you feeling better?

200
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,730
Yes, I'm better now.

201
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,129
That lunatic. He should've been caught long ago.

202
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,199
By the way,

203
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,300
why don't you come to school when you're out of the hospital?

204
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,570
Is it because of us?

205
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,409
No, it's not like that.

206
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,040
I should go soon.

207
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,510
Come back soon.

208
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,379
The teachers and everyone else are waiting for you.

209
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,219
Thank you.

210
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,159
- I'll see you at school, then. - Okay.

211
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,429
See you at school, Soon Ae.

212
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:28,780
I used to be so scared when they said, "See you at school."

213
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,580
But now I'm totally fine with it.

214
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,050
I'm glad.

215
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,919
Oh, right.

216
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,459
I got you a gift.

217
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,000
It's the first edition.

218
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,309
("Small Door" by Lee Soon Ae)

219
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,409
Lee Soon Ae.

220
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,409
Your name is printed on it too.

221
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,280
Can you give me your autograph?

222
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,449
I already did.

223
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,919
Check out the first page.

224
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,718
(To my closest friend, To my Y, Yoon Young)

225
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,260
(From Soon Ae)

226
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,629
To my closest friend.

227
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,540
To my Y, Yoon Young.

228
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,280
Thank you.

229
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,149
Thank you so much.

230
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,730
It's the best gift of my life.

231
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,909
Do you have any idea how to fix the car?

232
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,550
If I did, I'd have fixed it long ago.

233
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,350
How's everything going?

234
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,830
The rest of the procedure will be carried out well.

235
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,388
Chairman Yoon told his son to admit everything...

236
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:29,629
and pay for what he did.

237
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:32,030
It seems like that's the only thing he's telling...

238
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,500
your father.

239
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,810
Chairman Yoon is going through a tough time.

240
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,109
Who else can be there for him...

241
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,080
other than family?

242
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,480
But now, he has no one by his side.

243
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:59,560
(You're brazen and shameless.)

244
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,368
(Murderer)

245
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,500
(You raised a murderer.)

246
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:27,050
Why did you leave the gate open like that?

247
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:29,189
Hae Jun.

248
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,260
Didn't you see what people did outside?

249
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,600
It's dangerous. What if someone comes in to harm you?

250
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,730
Who could be more dangerous than my own son...

251
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:42,800
in this town?

252
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,609
I thought you had gone back.

253
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,409
I thought all your family was so horrible...

254
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:57,649
that you got sick of them...

255
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,990
and decided to leave without saying goodbye.

256
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,260
I was going to if I could.

257
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,500
Thank you for not doing that.

258
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,399
I wanted to see you again for the last time.

259
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,810
Don't you hate me?

260
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,040
You are going through something you shouldn't have to because of me.

261
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,879
You don't even know how long it's going to last.

262
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,389
I wanted to see you again...

263
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:36,419
in case you thought that way.

264
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,590
I wanted to tell you that I was okay.

265
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,159
That I was rather thankful.

266
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,659
I really wanted to tell you this.

267
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,669
Thanks to you,

268
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,469
I can correct everything at least now.

269
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,010
I'm so sorry...

270
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,679
that you had to see me doing something shameful like this.

271
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,219
I wondered...

272
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,629
how long I should wait to tell you this.

273
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:21,129
I'm so glad that I could do this 30 years earlier.

274
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,340
It's a relief.

275
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:37,850
Where have you been?

276
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,689
I had to see someone.

277
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,939
Why do you look depressed?

278
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,010
We...

279
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,149
can jump 30 years...

280
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,919
in the blink of an eye.

281
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:15,090
Then I realized...

282
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,119
that there are people who have to endure...

283
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,859
each and every day of those 30 years.

284
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,469
Did you see your grandpa?

285
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:35,540
I'm not saying I regret what we did.

286
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:38,379
I know, and I get it.

287
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,889
This could be an opportunity for us.

288
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:57,699
We might not go back right now,

289
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,070
but that means we have more time left to spend here.

290
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:06,369
Why don't we spend some quality time that we couldn't have before?

291
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,639
Some quality time we couldn't have before?

292
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,010
The moments you wanted to share but couldn't.

293
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:17,379
We can see them again after 30 years.

294
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:22,250
We can make good memories for them to reminisce about.

295
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,570
Do you like fishing?

296
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:46,050
I know a good spot,

297
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,780
but I don't really want to go alone.

298
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,550
Do you know what my dream was?

299
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,459
I wanted to live an ordinary life with a regular job...

300
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,159
and go fishing...

301
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,199
and laze around alone after I retired.

302
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,369
Alone?

303
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:09,340
With a family or children?

304
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,869
Maybe.

305
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,840
That's understandable.

306
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,179
Your family...

307
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:21,149
didn't do you any good.

308
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,050
But I think I changed my mind a little.

309
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,760
I kind of hope I have someone by my side.

310
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:35,330
We could chat about silly things...

311
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,230
and be there for each other.

312
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,199
I might want that kind of life too.

313
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,438
Of course, that's what life is.

314
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,169
You can have that life for sure.

315
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,438
Do you think I can?

316
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,139
Why not?

317
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,550
Once you decide to have that kind of life,

318
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,219
I'll do everything in my power to help.

319
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,118
Then please do me some favours.

320
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,149
"Favours?"

321
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,419
Cut down on alcohol from now on...

322
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,659
if you don't want to take all kinds of pills.

323
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,429
Don't skip any meals.

324
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,899
Starting eight years from now, get a health checkup every year.

325
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,540
Okay.

326
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,968
I shouldn't have any worries,

327
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:20,810
so I can banter and make jokes.

328
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,639
Those favours are for my own good. What else?

329
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,750
Is there anything you want me to do for you?

330
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:34,389
You could take me fishing sometimes.

331
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,688
My colleague first introduced it to me when I was a newcomer,

332
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:40,030
and I liked it.

333
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,159
I wished back then that I had known sooner.

334
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,070
If you like fishing today, you can introduce me to it earlier.

335
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:54,840
The real fun is night fishing, though.

336
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,240
You can make ramyeon too.

337
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,850
All right.

338
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:07,750
- Here. - Thank you.

339
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,219
Blow on it.

340
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:24,369
That would be nice.

341
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,669
Would that be enough, though?

342
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:30,409
That's more than enough for me.

343
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,619
Gosh. The float was...

344
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,688
Grandpa, I told you to wait.

345
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:41,249
But the float just moved.

346
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,349
No, it didn't.

347
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,820
The beauty of fishing is patience. Put that down now.

348
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,899
Okay. We'll go over there and come back here.

349
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,530
The one who comes last will buy tteokbokki.

350
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:55,399
Then... Go!

351
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,169
That was a cute trick.

352
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,340
What are you doing?

353
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:07,379
I can't.

354
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,649
What? Say it louder.

355
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,149
I can't bike!

356
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,169
Why don't you two go and leave me here?

357
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,609
How is it possible that you can't bike at this age?

358
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,939
Why didn't your dad teach you?

359
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:41,409
He can't bike either.

360
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:43,580
He has difficulty with his legs.

361
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:45,780
Is that so?

362
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,990
If...

363
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,419
he didn't,

364
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,260
would he want to teach me this too?

365
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,830
What kind of dad wouldn't?

366
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:02,299
He must have been sad...

367
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,840
to see other people teaching their children how to bike.

368
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,969
Saying, "I want to do that."

369
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,040
"I want to teach her too."

370
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,719
Don't worry about it.

371
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,949
I'll teach you instead.

372
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,060
Here, put your feet on the pedals. Try it.

373
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,689
And just keep pedalling without thinking.

374
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,760
Even if you wobble and feel like falling,

375
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,230
don't stop and keep going straight, all right?

376
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,198
What if I actually fall?

377
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:37,899
No, I'll be behind you. No worries.

378
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,070
Here we go.

379
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,270
You better not let it go without telling me. Don't let it go.

380
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,399
Oh, dear. She's not athletic at all.

381
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,340
You should've held on to it since it was her first time.

382
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,169
Why did you just let it go?

383
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,379
You shouldn't get involved so one can learn on one's own.

384
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,580
What are you talking about?

385
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,250
What if it becomes a scar?

386
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:29,990
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

387
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,219
Goodness.

388
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:35,158
I'm so upset.

389
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,859
- Were you wrong or not? - I was wrong.

390
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,069
I wondered why it felt so unfamiliar.

391
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,129
Seriously.

392
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,138
It was because we'd never had this time before.

393
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:46,208
- Was it your fault or not? - It was.

394
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:48,270
In my changed future,

395
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,609
would I have...

396
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,780
more of this kind of memory?

397
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,319
Ribbit, ribbit, the froggy is singing

398
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,089
The son, the grandson, and the daughter-in-law

399
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,020
All gather around

400
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:08,889
I hope that's the case.

401
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,070
I really hope that will be my new future.

402
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,669
Yoon Young.

403
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:24,679
Do you want a bite of the rice cake?

404
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
I'll eat it myself.

405
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:29,280
Gosh. Let me feed it to you. Here.

406
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,790
- Open it. - He's apologizing. Just eat it.

407
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,959
I said I was fine.

408
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,969
How is it? Isn't it tasty?

409
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:50,600
Isn't it tastier because I fed it to you?

410
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,369
It's just tasty.

411
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,980
Hey, it's tastier because the rice cake is nice and chewy.

412
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:27,740
Who is that guy, looking through Mr. Yoon's house?

413
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,668
I told you not to come for a while. What are you doing here?

414
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:58,070
How could I not? I know how hard this must be for you.

415
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,909
You have helped me so many times over the years.

416
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:04,480
- Let's go inside. - Okay. Thank you.

417
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,520
Can you tell me before you leave?

418
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,389
Sure. I'll do that.

419
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,489
Okay. I'll wait for you then.

420
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,959
Okay. You should go inside now.

421
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,029
Okay.

422
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,619
Gosh.

423
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,060
How am I going to fix that?

424
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,369
So we meet here.

425
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,310
Who are you?

426
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,779
Gosh, you're hurting my feelings.

427
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,080
I thought you would recognize me right away.

428
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,179
Don't you remember my voice?

429
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:20,690
"Only you can make this right from start to finish."

430
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:24,920
The phone call at the underpass.

431
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,630
What? Hello?

432
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:32,259
Only you can make this right from start to finish.

433
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,000
I knew you would remember me.

434
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,239
You're a smart guy.

435
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,209
You can solve the Rubik's cube in five seconds.

436
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,839
You know who I am?

437
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,580
How could I not?

438
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:51,319
You're my dad.

439
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,889
What?

440
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,659
I missed you, Dad.

441
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,569
But you broke the time machine I gave you. Right?

442
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,330
Did you have fun fishing with your grandfather?

443
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,529
Yes.

444
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,400
We should go fishing together next time.

445
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,199
I know how to ride a bicycle now.

446
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,110
The place I went to today had a great view.

447
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,469
I want to go there with you too.

448
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,179
That place doesn't exist in 2021?

449
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,049
It probably does.

450
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,020
Wait. Did you fix everything?

451
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,560
Probably.

452
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,429
Had I known, I wouldn't have said I would see them tomorrow.

453
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,369
We don't have to leave tonight.

454
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,670
No.

455
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,540
We were never supposed to be here.

456
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,580
We can't be here.

457
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,679
Once I go back, I'll see them right away.

458
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,319
What about you?

459
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,719
Are you sure you're okay leaving right now?

460
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,739
How...

461
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,969
did you find me here?

462
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

463
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,949
I won't tell other people where you are.

464
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:38,880
I'm going to forget about this place after today.

465
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,060
Can I sit down?

466
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,560
Are you really going to give up your baby once he's born?

467
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:22,029
Will you really give him to Chairman Yoon?

468
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,029
Yes.

469
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,739
I've already said that.

470
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,909
Because you find your baby awful and scary?

471
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,339
Yes.

472
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,449
Fine.

473
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:53,529
Then live a good life.

474
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,600
Don't feel guilty.

475
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,369
Forget about everything and move on.

476
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,310
I know how things are with you.

477
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,040
I understand why you would find him awful and scary.

478
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,949
If this is too tough on you, you don't have to be in his life.

479
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:21,290
I understand that.

480
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,119
Chairman Yoon...

481
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,589
is rich and a good person.

482
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,730
I'm sure it will be good for the baby too.

483
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:34,369
The baby will live in a good house and have everything he needs.

484
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,170
He'll be able to live his life...

485
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,639
without hating...

486
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:43,739
or resenting his mother.

487
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,210
I'm sure of it.

488
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,580
Liar.

489
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,790
How can the baby not resent me?

490
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,489
How can the baby not hate me...

491
00:40:58,219 --> 00:40:59,819
for leaving the baby?

492
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:04,759
In the end, I'm a mother who abandons her child.

493
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,929
Trust me on this.

494
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,639
You said he had the same name as mine.

495
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,909
I'm sure your baby will have a similar thought.

496
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,250
Do you...

497
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:23,110
really think so?

498
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:28,790
He will be more than grateful...

499
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,560
that you let him into this world.

500
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:42,699
I bet that's what he will think.

501
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:04,889
Did you get it off your chest?

502
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,259
Yes.

503
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,400
I said goodbye to the woman who abandoned me.

504
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,969
For some reason, a part of me feels liberated.

505
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,170
Then we can finally go back. Right?

506
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,009
Yes.

507
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,079
Are you sure you fixed the car properly this time?

508
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,179
We won't run into the village head again, will we?

509
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,949
I don't think so...

510
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,389
because the right man came to fix it this time.

511
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,259
Did someone come by?

512
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,759
The man who called me at the underpass.

513
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,630
The one who made this time machine.

514
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,699
At first, it was hard for me to believe it too.

515
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,500
I thought his existence was impossible.

516
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:53,969
No way.

517
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,380
- How... - How can you have a son?

518
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,250
When you died in 2022?

519
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,619
Because you didn't die.

520
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,750
Well, you almost did.

521
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,889
But you survived in the end.

522
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,460
There was a big loophole that you missed.

523
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,600
And I was the one who was born...

524
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,600
in the hidden future.

525
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,610
I wanted to give you another chance, Dad.

526
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,779
A chance to make another choice.

527
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:35,049
But...

528
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,150
you did it in the end, Dad.

529
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,060
I had a hidden future,

530
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:48,130
and thanks to that future, everything here started.

531
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,860
So who was that guy?

532
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,630
It's a secret.

533
00:43:58,299 --> 00:43:59,569
Are you serious?

534
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,540
Let's go.

535
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,960
We're here.

536
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,230
Yes, we are.

537
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,900
Thanks to that mysterious someone, we get to go back.

538
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,969
There were many nice moments too, right?

539
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:36,239
There were many grateful moments.

540
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,580
And it's thanks to you.

541
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,920
But do you think things will have changed...

542
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,719
once we go back?

543
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,049
What if nothing has changed?

544
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,819
Let's go and check now.

545
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:55,830
Are you ready?

546
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,230
Yes, see you in the future.

547
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,369
All right. See you in 34 years.

(Grandpa)

552
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,130
- Hello. - Did you arrive well, Hae Jun?

553
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,630
You must've waited a long time.

554
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:42,500
I arrived safely, Grandpa.

555
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:45,869
Yes.

Hurry up and pick it up.

(Incoming call, Mom)

560
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:29,049
Hello.

561
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:36,949
Is that really you, Mom?

562
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,029
And so...

563
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:45,400
we arrived in the future safely.

564
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,310
A lot of things...

565
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:02,750
have changed in our present.

566
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,580
The house...

567
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,020
is different.

568
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:42,089

Yoon Young!

573
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:17,960
You brat!

574
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,659
Where...

575
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:27,600
Where on earth have you been?

576
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,040
I went to see you, Mom.

577
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,540
What?

578
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,238
What... What is she saying?

579
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:42,310
My mom and dad who waited for their daughter...

580
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:46,779
- who was gone for a month... - I was so worried.

581
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,219
They looked just like the ones I saw in my dream some day.

582
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,589
- You brat. - Don't hit her.

583

(The day Hae Jun will return)

584
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:40,839
For over 30 years,

585
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:43,610
he waited for me in the same place.

586
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,409
He didn't forget the promised he made with me.

587
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,580
Hae Jun.

588
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:08,029
I...

589
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:11,699
finally met the novelist of my dream...

590
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,770
and became her editor.

591
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,710
Mom.

592
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,850
I think it'll be better to remove that sentence.

593
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,219
I don't want to.

594
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:27,150
If you're going to interfere like that, just write your own.

595
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:31,089
You're being stubborn again.

596
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,559
You're more stubborn now. You...

597
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,489
She's right. You should write your own novel.

598
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:39,259
Honey.

599
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:42,500
Should I give hers or not?

600
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,839
There you go.

601
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:49,339
It's so fun.

602
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,060
Stop it.

00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,869

605
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:22,409
And...

606
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:24,939
Dad. Quiet down. Stop playing.

607
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,080
I've become someone who loves the 9pm news on every Sunday.

608
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,508
Good evening.

609
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:32,719
"KSBC 9 o'clock News" will begin now.

610
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,088
The prosecution is looking into the embezzlement...

611
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:37,089
of Chairman Cho Myung Seok of Songhwan Group.

612
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:39,158
The prosecution have seized and searched...

613
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,929
the headquarters and its affiliations.

614
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:43,389
He does look like him.

615
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,028
The core suspicion is siphoning the company money...

616
00:52:47,029 --> 00:52:48,069
Hee Sub.

617
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:49,600
Hey, Yu Sub.

618
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:52,040
You're here, Uncle.

619
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:54,968
How come there aren't any customers?

620
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:57,338
Well, it's a retro bar, so...

621
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:59,039
- The amount reaches four million... - Dad!

622
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,979
- They have captured the amount... - Quiet down.

623
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,949
- used for Chairman Cho. - What is it?

624
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:06,250
Reporter Kim will follow up with details.

625
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,670
Let's go.

626
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,339
It feels weird walking here like this. Don't you think?

627
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,139
It's better.

628
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:34,750
We can hold each other's hands anywhere we want.

629
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,009
And talk about anything.

630
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,790
Did your parents not say anything after seeing my face?

631
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,319
Why wouldn't they?

632
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,519
Whenever they watch the news,

633
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,428
they always say that you have...

634
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:50,698
the same face and voice as their old teacher...

635
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:52,259
and talk about how fascinating it is.

636
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,799
Did they not suspect anything about you?

637
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,369
Of course, they did.

638
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,068
(Grandma's Garae Tteokbokki)

639
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:02,669
Let's try it.

640
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,239
- Oh, my. The garaetteok looks good. - Yes.

641
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,850
Here you go.

642
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:10,448
- Oh, my. - Here. Have some.

643
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:11,520
Let's try.

644
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:17,690
It tastes exactly like the old garaetteok.

645
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,388
Do you remember when we rode bicycles...

646
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:24,199
in the park with Yoon Young? It tastes like...

647
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:32,238
Even after 30 years,

648
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,839
there's a friend that your mom can't forget.

649
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:39,440
That's why I even named you after her.

650
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:43,850
Goodness.

651
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:52,618
But the thing is, you even started looking like her as you grew older.

652
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:54,389
How is this possible?

653
00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:57,499
Maybe you thought a lot...

654
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,429
about her when you had me. Then that can happen.

655
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,500
- Do you think so? - Maybe.

656
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:05,670
Gosh.

657
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,369
They believed that?

658
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:10,040
What else can they do?

659
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:13,338
Would they think we time-travelled...

660
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:15,009
just because we look like...

661
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,949
their friend and teacher from 34 years ago?

662
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,560
A few days ago,

663
00:55:27,489 --> 00:55:30,029
I ran into that person by chance.

664
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,000
("Where the Black Butterfly Sat")

665
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:12,969
Do you not regret...

666
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:15,009
what you did?

667
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:17,710
I do.

668
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,009
If I like something, I like it.

669
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,719
If I'm hurt, I'm hurt.

670
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:28,150
If I'm jealous, I'm jealous.

671
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,389
I wish I was more honest with myself.

672
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,730
But I wasn't.

673
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,130
And now it's too late.

674
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:47,540
I'll probably have to live a life...

675
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:51,239
wandering around other people.

676
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,850
It's never too late.

677
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:02,389
Because the present...

678
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,520
is the past to your future.

679
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:11,159
Do you think so?

680
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,850
I don't know what her life is like right now.

681
00:57:33,819 --> 00:57:35,319
But I thought that maybe...

682
00:57:36,449 --> 00:57:39,460
it was a little more honest now.

683
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,860
And I...

684
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,830
am still living my life,

685
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:49,130
thinking of the future and the past.

686
00:58:01,009 --> 00:58:03,778
Good night. See you tomorrow.

687
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:05,619
- I had fun. - Yes.

688
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,488
But can't I take a closer look...

689
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:10,719
at my mom's face?

690
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,689
Later. Now is not a good time.

691
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:15,759
Why?

692
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,759
It won't be fun if she knows the end result.

693
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:23,699
I want our relationship to stay fun.

694
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:32,080
I guess people who are meant for each other...

695
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,549
end up meeting each other no matter what.

696
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:38,879
Seeing how you and Mom met here...

697
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,520
and fell in love again.

698
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,159
Yes.

699
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:50,360
In your opinion, what does she like the most?

700
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:53,060
Since I know everything now, give me a hint before you go.

701
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:56,069
It'll be helpful when I need to give her a present.

702
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,540
You.

703
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:04,069
Mom liked you the most in this world.

704
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,580
Also, she really liked it when you bought her a flower...

705
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,779
from time to time.

706
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,339
- What is this? - A gift.

707
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:44,049
I like it.

708
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,219
I like it so much.

709
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,949
Don't you think you're too simple?

710
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,290
Why are you so happy over something this small?

711
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,060
Why do I need more gifts when I already have you?

712
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,600
- That's true. - My gift.

713
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:11,080
By the way, can we not use the time machine anymore?

714
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,339
It can only be used for one more round trip...

715
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:15,710
to anywhere.

716
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:22,619
Do you know that tomorrow is May 16?

717
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,960
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

718
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,259
What if...

719
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:34,060
What if we went back just one more time?

720
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,569
What do you think?

721
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,310
I think we'll be able to do a proper job this time.

722
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,839
Should we go back just one more time?

723
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,210
To make things perfect?

724
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,779
What do we do...

725
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:55,949
if something unexpected happens?

726
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:00,980
Then our future selves will find us.

727
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,719
Because we'll be together no matter what.

728
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,989
We didn't meet each other by chance.
