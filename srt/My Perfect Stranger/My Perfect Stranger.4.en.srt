5
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:48,034
Exactly a year from now,

6
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,373
I will die in the year when I turn 35.

7
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:53,244
That's because the culprit who kills me is the real culprit...

8
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:55,914
in the 1987 serial murder case in Woojung-Ri.

9
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:58,284
That was the culprit's signature in 1987.

10
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:00,584
This was also found at the scene of my murder.

11
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:02,814
How did she end up with this?

12
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:06,523
She's a new student who will join your class starting today.

13
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,624
Her name is Baek Yoon Young.

14
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:12,864
Don't act like we're friends. Do you want to die?

15
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:15,764
Nice to meet you. My name is Yoo Bum Ryong.

16
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:18,135
- Watch yourself. - What?

17
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:20,974
Do you think my sister just ran away from you?

18
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:25,644
It's because I like you.

19
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:29,314
How did you know I'd be there?

20
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:31,944
The first suspect in the murder that will happen...

21
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:33,585
three days from now, Baek Hee Sub.

22
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:35,685

00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:39,484
after being convicted, Ko Min Soo.

25
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,995

Who are you?

28
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,635
Why in the world did you come here?

29
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:00,144
What on earth are you talking about?

(Bong Bong Teahouse)

31
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:08,514
How do you have this?

32
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:14,594
It was on the floor, so I happened to pick it up.

33
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,124
If you were trying to hide it, that's too bad.

34
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:20,865
Why would I want to hide something that was picked up?

35
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:26,705
No. I'm the one who picked it up here.

36
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:29,004
I also picked it up by chance.

37
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:34,205
You picked that up by chance?

38
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,115
Where and when?

39
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,115
Before I ended up here.

40
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:44,215
It was an hour before you crashed into me.

41
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:48,323
I saw this floating around by the riverside in this village.

42
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,055
I picked it up without thinking much about it.

43
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:52,724
"By the riverside."

44
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,235
What on earth were you doing late at night?

45
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,735
I was...

(Dear Yoon Young)

47
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:17,455
There...

48
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,134
Is that one more thing you can't tell me about?

49
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,275
Just like why you had to meet Ko Min Soo.

50
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,085
I just had some questions for him.

51
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,594
That's all I can explain for now.

52
00:03:58,564 --> 00:03:59,624
Okay.

53
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:04,465
Then this is all we can talk about.

54
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,275
You didn't answer my question yet.

55
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:15,373
When I asked you how you knew I would be there,

56
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:17,175
you only gave me...

57
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:19,715
this.

58
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,984
What's this?

59
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:23,885
What does this mean to you?

60
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:27,354
The thing that made me come here.

61
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,924
The thing I must keep looking for.

62
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:36,664
The cause and result of everything that's happened.

63
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:41,135
That's all I can tell you right now.

64
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:44,205
Unfortunately, it looks like...

65
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:47,405
both of us aren't ready to tell each other everything yet.

66
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:01,895
Yes. You're right.

67
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:20,474
On May 11, 1987.

68
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,945
Three days before the first murder.

69
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:28,984
It's a critical moment,

70
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,184
but the past I knew is changing.

71
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:37,724
A new incident had happened.

72
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,434
The prime suspect... No.

73
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,434
Ko Min Soo, who was accused of being the real culprit,

74
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,505
has already been arrested by the police.

75
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:50,775
Then what will happen now?

76
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:52,905
You picked that up...

77
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:54,945
by chance?

80
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,554

That's good news.

88
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,094
He's stalling time on his own.

89
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:44,765
What do you mean?

90
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,733
Punks like him should be locked up as long as possible...

91
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,364
for the village's safety.

92
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:56,135
You never know what else he might do.

93
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:13,255
So keep doing that.

94
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,554
Don't say anything or do anything.

95
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:17,994
Stay in there...

96
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:21,224
and try to last a week without stepping a foot outside.

97
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,234
If nothing happens during that week,

98
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:28,205
it will be confirmed that you did indeed kill them.

99
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,044
Or your innocence will be proven.

100
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,244
"Kill them?"

101
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:37,445

No, I'm okay.

107

You haven't eaten anything.

111
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:38,605
You should eat something to sleep well.

112

00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:16,174
Hey. Can you stay open for 30 more minutes today?

120

Gosh.

124
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:47,405
Here.

125
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:50,704
Why do they sell these at a teahouse?

126
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:52,905
It's up to the owner.

127
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,474
She's quite unique.

128
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,574
She's very nosy too.

129
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,914
By the way, did people from this time...

130
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,084
dip the bread in soy sauce?

131
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,615
Well, I'm not sure.

132
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:07,755
There wasn't any bread that tasted salty.

133
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,034
Give it a try and see how their bread tastes.

134
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:21,574
I really don't have an appetite,

135
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,034
but since you bought it already...

136
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:55,074
Do you like salty and sweet stuff that much?

137
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:59,005
Don't you know it's a must-have for modern people?

138
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:01,043
I got off work in the morning every day for a month...

139
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,414
to meet the deadline.

140
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,573
When I want to finally take a rest on the weekend,

141
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:07,183
the writer I'm in charge of calls me out...

142
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,213
to complain about the fountain pen ink that she doesn't like,

143
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:12,225
which makes me lose the will to live.

144
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:15,424
But sweet and salty stuff...

145
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:17,824

What about you?

149
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:27,005
I was jobless.

150
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,845
Of course. You wouldn't tell me.

151
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:36,574
I'm the one who told you the truth again.

152
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,485
That's not exactly the case.

153
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,034
Gosh, this is the worst.

154
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,204
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,574
You don't have to apologize. We just have different palates.

156
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:17,314
I promised not to put you in a pickle.

157
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,924
But I made you come down to the station.

158
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,464
I'm really sorry.

159
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:35,304
But you didn't make that happen.

160
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,105
Whether you had something to ask him or other issues,

161
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,674
such a thing should not have happened...

162
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:45,214
even if you followed him for whatever reason.

163
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:50,115
He created this mess, not you.

164
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:54,924
So you don't have to apologize.

165
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,155
And don't be too scared.

166
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:02,534

Make sure to put more ointment on your wound.

184
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:34,704
You don't have to do the dishes. Just put them in the sink.

185
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:37,315
Don't ever be late.

186
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,285
He sounds like Mom.

187
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,825
(A wonderful and remarkable life)

188
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:01,464
Mom!

189
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:04,104
- Mom! - What is it?

190
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:05,743
Didn't you see my sparkly tights?

191
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:07,473
I might be late for the salon.

192
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:08,574
Darn you.

193
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,315
You cause a scene at night drunk and sober in the afternoon.

194
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,645
Gosh, I have to make fried eggs for Oh Bok.

195
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,284
- Honey. - Yes?

196
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:18,413
How come there aren't any intact socks?

197
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:20,953
You took a pair from the basket, not from the wardrobe, right?

198
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:23,953
I told you I put the socks with holes in the basket.

199
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:24,954
Why do you always take pairs...

200
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:26,565
- from there? - Mom! There's no tissue.

201
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:29,164
Oh, right. I'll get you a roll.

202
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,795
Mom, I asked you about my tights first.

203
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,234
Where did I put my wallet?

204
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:36,574
Oh, right. I changed my pants too. My wallet.

205
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,634
- What? - My wallet.

206
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,943
- I didn't take out your wallets. - Mom.

207
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,905
- Mom, are fried eggs ready? - Fried eggs?

208
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:43,575
No, not yet.

209
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:46,743
Gimbap isn't seasoned at all.

210
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:48,814
- It's not? - What are you saying?

211
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:51,014
Just eat it. She always makes it bland.

212
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:53,754
You should eat some too.

213
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:09,535
Gosh, you.

214
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,274
That darn book!

215
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:15,443
You'd have been done folding them...

216
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:17,974
and making fried eggs for your brother.

217
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,614
Here. Stop folding them.

218
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,514
Go and make fried eggs for Oh Bok.

219
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:24,254
Now.

220
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:26,524
Okay.

221
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:39,734
Hello?

222
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,274
I'll be right back.

223
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,785
Are you Oh Bok?

224
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:57,885
Who are you?

225
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:03,055
It's me, Uncle. Yoon Young.

226
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,694
What is it?

227
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:10,294
Who are you...

228
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:12,135
to be standing in my yard, just blinking your big eyes?

229
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:13,704
Grandpa?

230
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:16,605
It's me. Yoon Young.

231
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:24,345
I might not have enough time to change my socks.

232
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:25,914
Just hurry up and give me a pair.

233
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:28,645
- Honey! - Coming!

234
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:31,315
Stop calling me already!

235
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:53,105
And then...

236
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,014
Goodness.

237
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,815
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

238
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:07,585
Give me the matchbox from the hallway yesterday.

239
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:13,065
You...

240
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:17,564
are so pretty. Who are you?

241
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:18,763
Mom.

242
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:20,463
Like heck she is, my gosh.

243
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:22,605
She looks like a wet weasel.

244
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:27,144
Aren't you late? Just be quiet and go to work.

245
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:28,545
You drunkard.

246
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:29,845
Fine.

247
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,045
What?

248
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:36,484
- Gosh. - Wait for me.

249
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:38,885
- See you. - See you.

250
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:42,754
So you're Mr. Yoon's...

251
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:45,453
parent's in-law's family's...

252
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:48,365
I see. You are Mr. Yoon's relative.

253
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,194
You should've told me earlier.

254
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:51,564
Nice to meet you.

255
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:55,035
You look smart just like Mr. Yoon.

256
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,434
You look intelligent.

257
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:01,804
Mr. Yoon couldn't go with you,

258
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:05,785
so he asked me to make sure you went with Soon Ae.

259
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:09,514
When I was packing lunch, I also packed some for you and Mr. Yoon.

260
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:11,753
- Eat it for lunch. - I packed my lunch too.

261
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,854
That's your packed lunch.

262
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:15,355
And this is from me.

263
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,895
Chew well when you eat.

264
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:21,395
Come back anytime if you want my food.

265
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:25,764
Gosh, come over often, sweetie.

266
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,764
Okay. Thank you.

267
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:31,105
That's good.

268
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:36,845
My goodness.

269
00:22:37,744 --> 00:22:39,385
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

270
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:42,684
- A love letter? - Yes.

271
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:45,114
You put a note in that...

272
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,724
and give it to your crush or a girl you like.

273
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,555
Kids in other classes must do this too.

274
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,625
It's trending in our school.

275
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,635
The stupid trend made things more complicated.

276
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,335
Pardon?

277
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:04,905
"My love."

278
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:06,875
Love who?

279
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,913
How can you love her already?

280
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:10,574
I have a different matchbox for the transfer.

281
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,615
That's for a different girl.

282
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:15,855
If you already have a crush, why would you give it to her?

283
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,355
Are you avoiding it?

284
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:20,483
I won't give it to her, then.

285
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,125
Why would you hit me in the mouth?

286
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:23,625
Get back here.

287
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:30,334
(Let's use it as though it's our own.)

288
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:31,365
What do I do?

289
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:33,565
Gosh.

290
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:53,325
Why aren't you coming out?

291
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:58,825
Fine. I'm coming.

292
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:29,754
The main reason why Yoo Bum Ryong was named as the prime suspect...

293
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:33,424
was because of the things he hid.

294
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,375
So there's nothing so far. Is that right?

295
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:37,194
What is this?

296
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:40,664
I'm sorry...

297
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:42,535
about yesterday.

298
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:47,905
You just wanted to help me, and I was mean.

299
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:53,075
It bothered me all night, so I couldn't sleep.

300
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:54,905
That's why.

301
00:25:55,914 --> 00:25:57,614
You always write a letter...

302
00:25:57,615 --> 00:25:59,345
when you'll eventually say sorry in person.

303
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,184
You always did this every time we fought.

304
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:05,315
Me?

305
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:07,555
When?

306
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:13,095
I meant my mom.

307
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:14,924
I just suddenly remembered.

308
00:26:17,395 --> 00:26:19,635
She must've loved writing.

309
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:25,204
I guess so.

310
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:28,605
(Hello, Yoon Young. This is Soon Ae.)

311
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:32,585
I never thought that could be the reason...

312
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:35,484
until now.

313
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:43,424
- Hello. - Hello.

314
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:50,295
The second forehead?

315
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:54,365
Mr. Yoon. Right.

316
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:58,405
You have a matchbox in the front pocket. Give me that.

317
00:26:58,474 --> 00:26:59,474
Sorry?

318
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:03,315
Do I have a matchbox in my bag? Where?

319
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:08,644
You can't go through someone else's bag like that.

320
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,285
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

321
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:11,615
What?

322
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:13,983
There's really one in there.

323
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:15,154
You just transferred yesterday,

324
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,295
so you couldn't have known the trend.

325
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:20,524
Why would a student have a matchbox from a teahouse?

326
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:24,135
How did it get in there?

327
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:28,035
I got it.

328
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:30,134
My brother came over this Sunday...

329
00:27:30,135 --> 00:27:31,535
and wanted to introduce coffee to me.

330
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:33,404
He took me to a teahouse in town,

331
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:34,575
and I made towers with matchboxes there.

332
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:37,244
It was so much fun, and he...

333
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:39,513
Does your brother still have the lock too?

334
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:40,744
Of course.

335
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:43,954
A lock?

336
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,785
Why is your back so light?

337
00:27:47,954 --> 00:27:50,555
Should I have brought books on a field trip, then?

338
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:52,625
Didn't she pack you lunch?

339
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,224
It's not that.

340
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:58,635
She did, but I just forgot to bring one.

341
00:27:59,504 --> 00:28:01,635
Ask your friends to find you my bag.

342
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:05,105
I went through your bag, so you can rummage through mine.

343
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:06,773
Take the packed lunch in my bag.

344
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:08,045
Get yourself a soda...

345
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:16,184
and also buy some for the kids in the other class.

346
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:19,325
It's an errand.

347
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:21,424
Okay.

348
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,565
Rochester's room caught fire,

349
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,763
and Jane put it out with a water bucket.

350
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:29,994
He grabbed her by the wrist...

351
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:32,365
and said, "You saved my life."

352
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:34,764
How could I have stopped reading there?

353
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:39,035
Then my mom hit me with a spatula.

354
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,174
But you were just reading.

355
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:45,115
She hates it when I read.

356
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:47,784
She says I'm wasting my time doing something useless...

357
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:49,615
instead of doing housework.

358
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:52,085
Gosh.

359
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:55,124
I want to read all the books I love...

360
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,655
and listen to music as much as I want.

361
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:00,595
I also want to sip my coffee. I wish I could live like that.

362
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:05,964
That dream of hers...

363
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,264
came true...

364
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,605
through me.

365
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:24,815
What?

366
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:28,024
I'm just happy.

367
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:30,655
If you're done, give me the cup.

368
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,924
You're almost done. I'll do it later.

369
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:34,895
Just give it to me. Leave it to me.

370
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:38,065
Just read as much as you want.

371
00:29:38,835 --> 00:29:41,434
You left me

372
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:44,605
You left

373
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:03,555
What?

374
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:06,895
I mean...

375
00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:10,764
I was just curious to know what you were listening to.

376
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:16,734
Give me that. I'll clean.

377
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:18,075
No. It's okay.

378
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,375
When you get married, you'll get to do it until you get sick of it.

379
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:23,944
I won't bother you. Get back to that.

380
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:26,714
I'm sick of hearing that.

381
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:28,545
I kept telling you I wouldn't get married.

382
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:31,454
Mom...

383
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:34,754
was giving me the time...

384
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:37,224
she couldn't have.

385
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,024
What are you doing?

386
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:45,635
I'll give it back to you now.

387
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:47,805
The time you lost.

388
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,905
Everything you gave up.

389
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:53,504
I'll get everything back to you.

390
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:57,145
We'll be late. We have to run.

391
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:00,815
Why are you going that way? Our school is that way.

392
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,885
Didn't you hear it at the end of the class yesterday?

393
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:05,014
Today is field trip day.

394
00:31:09,855 --> 00:31:10,895
Right.

395
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:13,494
You're right.

396
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:15,865
Wait for me.

397
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,234
- Kim Hae Kyung. - Yes.

398
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,405
- Lee Eun Ha. - Here!

399
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,065
- Park Yu Ri! - Here!

400
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:23,974
- Seo Ji Eun. - Here.

401
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:26,305
- Yoo Eun Young. - Here.

402
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:28,703
- Kwon Soo Kyung. - Here.

403
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:32,575
- Baek Yoon... - Gosh. Come on.

404
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:35,845
Mr. Yoon.

405
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:39,315
Mr. Yoon.

406
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:40,625
What?

407
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:42,655
What are you doing here?

408
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:45,055
Shouldn't you be checking up on your class?

409
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:48,124
Look at them. They're a disorderly group.

410
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,535
- Look. - You've got this! Let's go.

411
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:52,595
No. Look.

412
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:56,135
They're all over the place. Seriously.

413
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:59,304
Kids who don't study always cause trouble.

414
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:02,003
I wrote very clearly not to be late. Seriously.

415
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,575
She's making me nervous. Come on.

416
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:05,815
Why are you going down?

417
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:07,944
Hey!

418
00:32:08,045 --> 00:32:09,315
Go easy on it.

419
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:20,194
Why did the principal pair my class up with his class?

420
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:22,494
Goodness.

421
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,605
You next to the cotton candy. You'd better walk away now.

422
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:28,464
You punks.

423
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,075
Sun Jung Sook.

424
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:58,494
How did the second forehead know...

425
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:00,964
that it was for a lock?

426
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:45,774
Soon Ae.

427
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:48,714
The guy from the terminal.

428
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,595
Seeing how we're meeting here again,

429
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:58,253
it must mean we are fated...

430
00:33:58,254 --> 00:33:59,724
As if!

431
00:34:08,605 --> 00:34:09,674
Listen up, Soon Ae.

432
00:34:11,204 --> 00:34:12,205
Take a look at his face.

433
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:15,245
You'd be wasting your time with this guy.

434
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:17,674
What nonsense is that?

435
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:19,415
He's not going to make...

436
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:22,314
your life better in any way.

437
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:25,084
You seem to be out of breath.

438
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:27,124
Why don't we get a head start?

439
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:30,023
But still. That's...

440
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:31,354
You're not taking her anywhere.

441
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:34,765
It's better to rest up first when you're out of breath like this.

442
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,694
Take a break, and then climb up.

443
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,834
Hey.

444
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:45,975
Soon Ae!

445
00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:47,944
Darn it.

446
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:11,794
The sky looked beautiful.

447
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:25,015
- Goodness. - Gosh.

448
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:26,944
Why are there so many hills?

449
00:35:27,685 --> 00:35:29,285
Why would anyone come here on a school picnic?

450
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:33,825
This is a tough hike for someone who was born in 1965.

451
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:38,995
All right.

452
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,893
You guys are here today to have fun. So just do that.

453
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:44,463
Don't read your textbook in secret...

454
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,905
because you're worried about the college entrance exam.

455
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,034
- Bum Ryong. - Bum Ryong.

456
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:52,174
- Come on. - That's awful.

457
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:53,405
All right.

458
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:55,143
Have as much fun as you can today.

459
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:57,844
However, do not leave this area. Okay?

460
00:35:57,845 --> 00:35:59,543
- Okay. - Okay.

461
00:35:59,544 --> 00:36:00,644
Entertainment Leader, come on out.

462
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:05,284
All right. Guys, you all know who I am, right?

463
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:06,523
- Yes! - Yes!

464
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:08,325
What's the highlight of a school picnic?

465
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:09,584
- A talent show. - A talent show.

466
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:11,954
That's right. We're going to have a talent show.

467
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:13,424
Hey, this is an important moment.

468
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:15,193
And you brought me a valuable present.

469
00:36:15,194 --> 00:36:17,665
- All right. Who wants to try it? - I stole it for you...

470
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:19,234
from my dad.

471
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,004
Hey.

472
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,274
But do you think you can do it?

473
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:26,004
You said you had never played a real guitar before.

474
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:33,643
I need to stop playing the air guitar.

475
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:34,915
I'll give it a try.

476
00:36:37,415 --> 00:36:38,655
No.

477
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:41,124
Shouldn't you practice first?

478
00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:45,854
You might embarrass yourself in front of the girls.

479
00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:48,324
We'll start the talent show now.

480
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:49,495
Clap, everyone.

481
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,765
All right. Who wants to give it a try?

482
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,205
No one?

483
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:58,504
Come on. Is this all you guys amount to?

484
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:04,274
I'm sick of practicing.

485
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:07,415
All right.

486
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:10,185
If you guys take a break just like everyone else,

487
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:12,055
you will fall behind.

488
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,624
- Come on, Mr. Park. - You guys are high school seniors.

489
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:17,054
Don't get too excited.

490
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:19,194
Always think about the college entrance exam.

491
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:28,305
Attention!

492
00:37:28,635 --> 00:37:29,705
I'm still talking.

493
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,404
Always think about the college entrance exam.

494
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:32,934
Can you stop talking?

495
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:34,544
- What? - We can't hear him sing.

496
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,643
Sir, let's take a five-minute break!

497
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:38,414
- Thank you. - We'll be back.

498
00:37:38,415 --> 00:37:40,245
- Where are you going? - Thank you.

499
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:41,544
Hey.

500
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,915
What a mess.

501
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,124
So nothing really happened?

502
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,394
No.

503
00:37:51,495 --> 00:37:52,894
I only said two things.

504
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:55,365
Then we ran into his homeroom teacher.

505
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:58,194
Mr. Yoon pulled on his ear and dragged him away.

506
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:01,504
What were the two things you said to him?

507
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:04,905
He asked me about my type.

508
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:07,405
So I said I liked men who were good at singing.

509
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:13,745
Let's go.

510
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,084
Hey.

511
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:39,334
It's all right!

512
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:42,104
- Okay. You've got this! - Go for it!

513
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:20,814
Did he know how to play the guitar?

514
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:24,084
Stop thinking

515
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:26,724
And start talking

516
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:29,324
Stop the boring stuff

517
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,725
- Who is that guy? - And start speaking your heart out

518
00:39:32,055 --> 00:39:33,225
- He's a new transfer student. - My body's fidgeting. I'm in a knot

519
00:39:33,495 --> 00:39:35,023
I'm hesitating, feeling unsure

520
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,034
- My face is turning red - My face is turning red

521
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:38,595
- I'm hesitating, feeling unsure - I'm hesitating, feeling unsure

522
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,305
- I'd be alone after the breakup - I'd be alone after the breakup

523
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:46,003
- And I'd cry with a broken heart - And I'd cry with a broken heart

524
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:48,744
- I knew I'd regret it when she left - I knew I'd regret it when she left

525
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:51,313
- But why couldn't I tell her that? - But why couldn't I tell her that?

526
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:52,673
- My body's fidgeting. I'm in a knot - My body's fidgeting. I'm in a knot

527
00:39:52,674 --> 00:39:54,043
- I'm hesitating, feeling unsure - I'm hesitating, feeling unsure

528
00:39:54,044 --> 00:39:56,313
- My face is turning red - My face is turning red

529
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,185
- I'm hesitating, feeling unsure - I'm hesitating, feeling unsure

530
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:03,623
- I should have just told her - I should have just told her

531
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:04,994
- I should have told her - I should have told her

532
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:08,994
- I should have just told her - I should have just told her

533
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,364
- I should have told her - I should have told her

534
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:11,764
I should have told her

535
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:13,134
- I should have told her - I should have told her

536
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:14,135
I should have told her

537
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:15,305
It's May 12.

538
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:17,905
- I should have told her - Two days before the first murder.

539
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:22,305
One of the three suspects has already been arrested by the police.

540
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:24,015
And the other two suspects...

541
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:26,345
aren't showing any unusual movements.

542
00:40:28,044 --> 00:40:30,114
The matchbox which was the culprit's signature.

543
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:31,284
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

544
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:32,455
It's everywhere.

545
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:35,555
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

546
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:44,365
When everything seemed to be getting more perplexing,

547
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:47,834
she arrived.

548
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,975
She was the first victim of the serial murder in Woojung-Ri.

549
00:40:53,705 --> 00:40:54,705
It's her.

550
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:01,415
You remember them, right?

551
00:41:01,915 --> 00:41:04,213
(Personal Information of the 1987 Murder Case Suspects)

552
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,285
(Lee Ju Young)

553
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,935
- You're here, Principal Yoon. - Yes.

554
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,373
You brats.

555
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:26,405
Stand up.

556
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:28,543
No. It's okay.

557
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:30,575
Sit down, everyone. It's okay. Sit.

558
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:36,884
She will be your student teacher for a month.

559
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,685
Her name is Lee Ju Young.

560
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:41,583
She's a fourth-year student at Seoul National University,

561
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:42,655
majoring in Korean literature.

562
00:41:42,955 --> 00:41:45,454
She was supposed to start tomorrow.

563
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:46,793
But I brought her today...

564
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:49,164
so I can introduce her to you on a good day.

565
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,694
Give it up for her.

566
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,194
Where did I see her?

567
00:41:58,135 --> 00:42:01,475
Ms. Lee! You should sing for us too!

568
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,244
- Sing for us! - Sing for us!

569
00:42:05,245 --> 00:42:08,143
- Sing for us! - Sing for us!

570
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:09,684
- Sing for us! - Sing for us!

571
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:11,784
- Sing for us! - Quiet down.

572
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:13,385
- Be quiet! - I'll sing.

573
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:17,894
Sure. Go ahead.

574
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:20,225
You're awesome!

575
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:23,564
You're amazing.

576
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:32,234
The strong wind blew

577
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:37,814
Fluttering Mother's tears

578
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:43,655
In this divided world

579
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:47,924
Where one cries with a bitter grudge

580
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:51,054
- The soul of the people - What is that?

581
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:54,865
- No idea. Never heard before. - Becomes the owner of this world

582
00:42:55,524 --> 00:43:00,535
- She totally ruined the mood. - For the freedom of that world

583
00:43:00,964 --> 00:43:06,104
- Even if your heart becomes blue - She's so charming.

584
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:08,103
Don't you think so?

585
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:11,444
- Keep rowing ahead - Why is this song so sad?

586
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:13,684
It's "Dear Green Pine."

587
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:15,643
Dear green pine

588
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:17,884
Do you know this song?

589
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:20,784
- No. - Don't be shaken by the wind

590
00:43:20,785 --> 00:43:23,523
- From the east - Why does it sound so familiar?

591
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:28,793
Under the bars where I'm tied

592
00:43:28,794 --> 00:43:33,294
Stay alive until we meet again

593
00:43:34,964 --> 00:43:36,234
- Gosh. - What was that?

594
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:38,905
Gosh.

595
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:44,044
I told you not to see me off, but both of you came?

596
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:48,284
If it had to be just one, that would've been me.

597
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:49,844
Then I'll just go back.

598
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:52,055
No, not you. You should stay.

599
00:43:54,325 --> 00:43:58,095
Mr. Park. Don't you get the feeling that Mr. Yoon resembles someone...

600
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:00,794
whenever you see him?

601
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:07,365
I'm not sure.

602
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:10,064
I don't watch TV much.

603
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:13,504
No, not someone from TV.

604
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:16,305
Take a good look at someone close to you.

605
00:44:19,314 --> 00:44:20,685
I'm not sure.

606
00:44:20,885 --> 00:44:23,384
I'm not really interested in the people around me.

607
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:25,254
Why aren't you?

608
00:44:25,854 --> 00:44:27,023
Mr. Park, I like everything about you,

609
00:44:27,024 --> 00:44:28,354
but you're so slow-witted!

610
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:29,825
Gosh.

611
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:31,325
I...

612
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,924
need to go back to guide the students.

613
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:36,124
Please excuse me.

614
00:44:40,535 --> 00:44:41,834
Darn it.

615
00:44:42,504 --> 00:44:44,535
Gosh, I should just fire him.

616
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:48,944
I heard you went down to the station yesterday.

617
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:51,044
- Oh, yes. - Anything I can do to help?

618
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:53,744
No, it's all right.

619
00:44:53,745 --> 00:44:55,684
- Thank you for asking. - It's nothing.

620
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:56,915
- Actually... - Yes?

621
00:44:57,415 --> 00:44:58,984
I asked you this before.

622
00:44:59,314 --> 00:45:01,483
Can I take charge of the new student teacher?

623
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:04,623
Right. We decided to do that.

624
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:05,655
Yes.

625
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:10,893
Actually, instead of that...

626
00:45:10,894 --> 00:45:13,035
No, we don't look alike.

627
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:15,464
Let's go.

628
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:22,345
He strangely looks like the younger version of me.

629
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:26,174
Yes, we do look alike.

630
00:45:26,345 --> 00:45:29,484
Mr. Choi, let's go.

631
00:45:31,484 --> 00:45:32,785
Goodness.

632
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:47,504
No way!

633
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:52,374
How come she looks so familiar?

634
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,274
It's impossible to find someone familiar here, though.

635
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:12,155
Gosh, Five-Second Prince...

636
00:46:13,894 --> 00:46:16,124
I mean, Mr. Yoon made it himself?

637
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:17,495
Yes.

638
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:19,194
It's so good.

639
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:21,064
Right? My grandma...

640
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:26,305
The gimbap your mom made is really good too.

641
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:33,415
You're talking to me casually after the incident at the lab.

642
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:40,185
Because we're friends.

643
00:46:44,254 --> 00:46:45,354
Right, we are.

644
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:47,394
You can call me whatever.

645
00:46:50,294 --> 00:46:51,365
Baek Yoon Young.

646
00:46:52,194 --> 00:46:53,964
"My love and passion for you."

647
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:58,204
It's a love letter from one of the gentlemen over there.

648
00:46:58,205 --> 00:46:59,234
Here.

649
00:46:59,674 --> 00:47:01,144
Here's one for Soon Ae.

650
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:05,274
Please check out the gentlemen's feelings.

651
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:07,115
Thank you.

652
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:15,024
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

653
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:16,725
This matchbox...

654
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:19,394
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

655
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:33,944
(You have the prettiest smile. Please call me.)

656
00:47:43,515 --> 00:47:45,214
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

657
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:48,024
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

658
00:47:49,424 --> 00:47:50,754
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

659
00:47:52,894 --> 00:47:55,424
(Women who read are dangerous.)

660
00:47:56,464 --> 00:47:58,595
I can't say this is a common item.

661
00:47:59,464 --> 00:48:02,103
But it doesn't make any sense...

662
00:48:02,104 --> 00:48:05,475
that I picked up an item from 30 years ago by the river.

663
00:48:05,874 --> 00:48:08,644
You picked that up by chance?

664
00:48:09,544 --> 00:48:10,814
Where and when?

665
00:48:10,944 --> 00:48:12,015
"By the riverside."

666
00:48:13,314 --> 00:48:15,484
What on earth were you doing late at night?

667
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:27,294
He must know something.

668
00:48:37,504 --> 00:48:39,135
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

669
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:47,285
Hurry up and take it.

670
00:48:48,544 --> 00:48:50,854
- Take it. - I said I didn't want to.

671
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:52,615
She doesn't want it! Go away!

672
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:55,685
Darn it. Fine.

673
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:05,035
What happened?

674
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:19,443
- Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye, sir.

675
00:49:19,444 --> 00:49:21,444
- Goodbye. - Just go straight home.

676
00:49:24,785 --> 00:49:26,915
Have you decided where to stay for the month?

677
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:29,955
Yes, a relative of mine lives in the neighbourhood.

678
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:31,854
She's lying.

679
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:35,694
She doesn't have any family or relatives.

680
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:39,064
Why on earth did she lie?

681
00:49:40,834 --> 00:49:41,865
I see.

682
00:49:42,504 --> 00:49:43,935
But just in case...

683
00:49:48,174 --> 00:49:49,374
It's my home phone number.

684
00:49:52,774 --> 00:49:53,774
Here.

685
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,754
I even make the students memorize my number.

686
00:50:01,424 --> 00:50:02,984
It's like an emergency contact.

687
00:50:07,524 --> 00:50:10,264
Please call me anytime if something happens.

688
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:11,894
Even if it's trivial, I wouldn't mind.

689
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,694
Thank you.

690
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:17,435
But I'll be fine since my relatives will be around.

691
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:21,705
Still, you shouldn't throw it away.

692
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:23,774
Okay.

693
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:26,245
Get home safely. I'll see you tomorrow.

694
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:40,325
Wait, my flask.

695
00:50:41,225 --> 00:50:42,963
I must've left it up there.

696
00:50:42,964 --> 00:50:44,595
- I'll come with you. - No.

697
00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:47,604
It's right there, so I'll make it quick. Wait here.

698
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,975
Don't run! Be careful.

699
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:52,305
Okay!

700
00:51:02,984 --> 00:51:06,285
Are you responsible for putting my brother in a holding cell?

701
00:51:08,084 --> 00:51:09,984
It was your brother who did it to himself.

702
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:13,694
He got locked up for what he did.

703
00:51:16,964 --> 00:51:17,964
Sure.

704
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:22,734
So what's my vulnerable point that you found?

705
00:51:27,604 --> 00:51:29,345
What triggers me to react.

706
00:51:30,274 --> 00:51:31,915
A useful card.

707
00:51:33,274 --> 00:51:34,484
You know it already.

708
00:51:36,584 --> 00:51:38,455
It was so obvious that I didn't even have to try finding it.

709
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:42,055
Soon Ae.

710
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:46,455
Lee Soon Ae is your vulnerable point.

711
00:51:48,265 --> 00:51:50,524
But I'm still not sure why you're so vulnerable to her.

712
00:51:57,135 --> 00:51:58,435
If you know it, then don't forget.

713
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:01,205
My warning from yesterday is still valid.

714
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:08,584
About my brother...

715
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,854
Do you think I'm happy...

716
00:52:12,285 --> 00:52:14,185
about how he ended up,

717
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:16,955
or the opposite?

718
00:52:20,194 --> 00:52:21,294
You're happy?

719
00:52:25,635 --> 00:52:27,365
I didn't expect to hear that word.

720
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:29,564
But do I need to know that?

721
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:34,004
You should be trying to find out.

722
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:39,415
That way, you'll know whether I'll use your weakness...

723
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:41,544
or not.

724
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:47,924
Then I'll see you tomorrow, Yoon Young.

725
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,135
- Excuse... - Excuse...

726
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:03,905
You can go first.

727
00:53:05,504 --> 00:53:06,705
I'll wash my hands first.

728
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:08,544
Since we have a lot of time.

729
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:12,944
Sure. Since we have a lot of time.

730
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:33,234
If, by any chance,

731
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:36,665
she is not aware of what will end up happening here,

732
00:53:37,234 --> 00:53:38,874
I need to let her know now.

733
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:42,444
Since no one knows what's going to happen.

734
00:53:58,794 --> 00:54:00,024
Something's strange.

735
00:54:02,024 --> 00:54:03,424
There's definitely something going on.

736
00:54:18,044 --> 00:54:19,245
That's impossible.

737
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:21,115
What's the matter?

738
00:54:21,714 --> 00:54:23,845
I just received a call from Principal Yoon.

739
00:54:24,555 --> 00:54:27,285
He was supposed to meet Ms. Lee, but he can't get in touch with her.

740
00:54:28,024 --> 00:54:29,354
I'll be heading out for a moment.

741
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:32,825
- Wait. - Right.

742
00:54:33,495 --> 00:54:35,623
Don't go anywhere, and stay home. Okay?

743
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:36,765
I'll be quick.

744
00:54:42,765 --> 00:54:43,765
Ms. Lee.

745
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:46,334
The student teacher.

746
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:01,955
This feels strange.

747
00:55:03,725 --> 00:55:06,225
I know this situation.

748
00:55:22,644 --> 00:55:24,475
("The People I Killed", Ko Mi Sook)

749
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:28,115
It can't be. No way.

750
00:55:37,995 --> 00:55:39,454
(My first impression of her...)

751
00:55:39,455 --> 00:55:41,095
(was a little peculiar.)

752
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:45,865
Why is this in Ko Mi Sook's novel?

753
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:50,365
No.

754
00:55:51,374 --> 00:55:53,074
She could've just described...

755
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:54,944
what she saw in the past.

756
00:55:58,345 --> 00:55:59,944
My first impression of her...

757
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:03,685
was a little peculiar.

758
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:06,554
Her thick eyebrows stood out...

759
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:09,854
on her fair and soft face.

760
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:13,394
Also, the unique wood ring...

761
00:56:13,555 --> 00:56:16,394
on her slender index finger. Also,

762
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:19,035
her dirty shoes...

763
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:21,665
mismatched her neat clothes.

764
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:37,245
That is why she felt familiar.

765
00:56:48,694 --> 00:56:49,894
Excuse me.

766
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:52,495
Where is Ko Min Soo right now?

767
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:57,464
Where is he?

768
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:01,745
Ko Min Soo.

769
00:57:04,144 --> 00:57:05,144
Ko Min Soo!

770
00:57:30,104 --> 00:57:33,274
Nami, Kim Wan Sun, Min Hae Kyung,

771
00:57:34,274 --> 00:57:36,674
and Sobangcha. Those are the singers that the kids were expecting.

772
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:40,214
But with her soft but strong voice,

773
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:42,115
she sang that song.

774
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:45,555
All these things...

775
00:57:46,515 --> 00:57:48,924
made her look special.

776
00:57:50,124 --> 00:57:53,024
That is why...

777
00:58:09,305 --> 00:58:13,944
(Woojung General Store)

778
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:15,785
What are you doing here?

779
00:58:18,155 --> 00:58:20,714
Why did you come outside?

780
00:58:22,785 --> 00:58:23,854
That woman...

781
00:58:28,124 --> 00:58:29,194
Is she going to die?

782
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:34,135
What?

783
00:58:36,604 --> 00:58:38,405
That day,

784
00:58:39,104 --> 00:58:40,774
I picked her at first sight.

785
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:44,174
My beautiful...

786
00:58:45,345 --> 00:58:46,444
first victim.

787
00:58:52,214 --> 00:58:53,254
It's not true, is it?

788
00:58:54,015 --> 00:58:55,325
I was just getting ahead of myself, right?

789
00:59:06,894 --> 00:59:08,365
Did you come here knowing something?

790
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:15,444
How did you know that?

791
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,975
It hasn't even happened yet.

792
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:22,885
How did you know that, right here and right now?

793
00:59:40,564 --> 00:59:41,635
I feel like...

794
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:46,135
it's time for us to become honest with each other.

795
00:59:50,144 --> 00:59:51,615
The fact that we met here...

796
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:55,015
is probably not a coincidence.

797
01:00:27,214 --> 01:00:29,185
(My Perfect Stranger)

798
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:31,515
It's a novel written by Ko Mi Sook.

799
01:00:31,685 --> 01:00:34,954
I kept feeling this weird deja vu after seeing the student teacher.

800
01:00:34,955 --> 01:00:36,123
So you reread the manuscript,

801
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:37,853
and everything was just like the content of the novel?

802
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:39,554
Do you want Ko Mi Sook to be the culprit?

803
01:00:39,555 --> 01:00:42,464
The Ko Mi Sook that I know is more than capable of doing all of that.

804
01:00:42,794 --> 01:00:44,324
You released Ko Min Soo?

805
01:00:44,325 --> 01:00:46,135
I was only following orders.

806
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:47,834
I don't think I can stay here for long, either.

807
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:50,063
Who is it that knows my identity?

808
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,635
(There is someone who is watching you.)

809
01:00:52,174 --> 01:00:53,674
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

810
01:00:59,714 --> 01:01:02,114
Are you aware that there was someone...

811
01:01:02,115 --> 01:01:04,083
who witnessed your crime at the time?

812
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:06,584
(Epilogue)

813
01:01:11,995 --> 01:01:15,225
Do you know who that person is?

814
01:01:59,774 --> 01:02:01,544
Didn't I tell you?

815
01:02:02,745 --> 01:02:05,515
If you only look at one thing and recklessly make a rush at it,

816
01:02:07,714 --> 01:02:11,015
you'll end up falling into multiple traps.

817
01:02:31,435 --> 01:02:34,905
(My Perfect Stranger)
