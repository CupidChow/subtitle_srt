(Jin Ki Joo)

4
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:44,046
(My Perfect Stranger)

5
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:46,744
So two nights before the death of the student teacher,

6
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,714
she suddenly disappeared.

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,815
It seemed as if she was being chased by someone.

8
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:53,685
It was close to the general store. So it should be around here.

9
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:54,954
(Previously)

10
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,024
Ms. Lee.

11
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,595
- Ms. Lee. - No! It wasn't me!

12
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:06,936
But what about the man...

13
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,134
from last night who was stalking the student teacher but fled?

14
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,135
Who could he be?

15
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,605
I think that's the guy I've been waiting for.

16
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:14,875
Then I'll be able to run into the man in a blue hat again.

17
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,345
The 20 minutes Ms. Lee spent in the teahouse.

18
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,015
The only person she met there.

19
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,915
But the man I was pursuing last night...

20
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,086
was wearing a blue hat.

21
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,685
That's why I'm planning to witness that myself.

22
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,146
(My Perfect Stranger, Episode 6, Lie After Lie After Lie)

23
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,646
(Episode 6)

24
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:11,566
Gosh.

25
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,186
Do you know what time it is?

26
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,615
Well...

27
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,226
Then do you know how it feels...

28
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:39,656
to be waiting for someone who went out to see a murderer?

29
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,695
You said you were just going to check his face,

30
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,025
but you were gone for three hours!

31
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:44,365
Gosh. What was that?

32
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,196
I was worried that...

33
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:48,365
you might have gone after him and gotten hurt like last night.

34
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,976
- Are you hurt? - No.

35
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,376
I couldn't call the police or go outside to look for you.

36
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,144
Because we're living in this stupid year 1987,

37
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,416
I couldn't even call you.

38
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:01,446
I was going crazy here.

39
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,145
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:13,325
So did the guy with the blue cap show up?

41
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,066
Well...

42
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,705
Who was it?

43
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,415
(Three hours ago)

44
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,145
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

45
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,015
Your father,

46
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:09,346
Baek Hee Sub.

47
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:15,626
Darn it.

48
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:31,675
May 14,1987.

49
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,675
That was the day the first murder case took place.

50
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:37,675
The man who met with the victim, Lee Ju Young, that day...

51
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,846
was her father?

52
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:46,716
If the man with the blue cap is the real culprit,

53
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,286
it means he even killed her mother.

54
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,156
So he even killed his own wife.

55
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,466
And then me.

56
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:20,786
I can't be biased.

57
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:24,086
I need to stay calm and be objective.

58
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:26,456
Let's sum this up.

59
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:35,406
If everything had stayed the same,

60
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,675
Lee Ju Young was supposed to arrive seven minutes before him.

61
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,776
If nothing had happened today,

62
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:43,406
I was going to visit the teahouse after school.

63
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:46,276
I wanted to drink some coffee by myself...

64
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,716
and finish reading the book I was reading.

65
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,656
I really didn't have any plans to meet anyone.

66
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,195
But she ended up seeing someone she didn't plan to meet.

67
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,794
I don't want to talk about this.

68
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:06,966
The guy with the blue cap, Baek Hee Sub.

69
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,004
For whatever reason, the two of them argued.

70
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,405
I told you to stay there!

71
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:17,105
And the only person who witnessed their altercation was...

72
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,916
the owner of Bong Bong Teahouse.

73
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:27,156
Where did she go?

74
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:29,656
Hey.

75
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,136
There were more people.

76
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,065
Hey, you're here.

77
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:42,765
Gosh, sorry.

78
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:46,036
I'm late because I heard some crazy news on my way here.

79
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,544
Remember there being a huge scene at school this morning...

80
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:51,675
because of the student teacher?

81
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,315
Do you know why?

82
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:55,545
It turned out...

83
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,886
she was a commie.

84
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:05,355
Don't you watch the news?

85
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,026
These college students went cuckoo and went on protests.

86
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,694
Remember the weird song...

87
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:14,466
she sang at the school picnic?

88
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,666
That's what people sing at those protests.

89
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:19,675
I bet she was going to influence us too.

90
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:23,505
Isn't that so creepy?

91
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,476
- Yes, it is creepy. - Right?

92
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:31,416
Gosh. Just thinking about that gives me goosebumps.

93
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,216
My parents...

94
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:39,255
Because my friend did stuff like this.

95
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:49,305
How did you know?

96
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,365
You said you were taking a dump.

97
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,065
But I was wondering why it never smelled.

98
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,435
Hey, Yoo Bum Ryong. Are you still not done?

99
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:26,076
No.

100
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:29,745
I have a lot to discharge especially today.

101
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,044
Hey, I don't know what this is about,

102
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,445
but there's a huge scene at our school.

103
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:35,915
Police officers are swarming at our school.

104
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,616
And they're looking for the student teacher.

105
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,555
- Looking for who? - The student teacher.

106
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,725
Goodness. That punk.

107
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,395
He didn't flush.

108
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:54,065
Darn it. That disgusting punk.

109
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,705
(Let's use it as though it was our own.)

110
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:27,496
That's the student teacher's, right?

111
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:29,736
Did you steal it?

112
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,906
Will you tell on me?

113
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:36,606
What?

114
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,016
Will you...

115
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,045
tell other people about this ring?

116
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,955
You stole it anyway when you knew it was wrong?

117
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:49,386
You stole someone else's stuff and hid it in the restroom.

118
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:52,496
If Soon Ae finds out what you did...

119
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,725
Soon Ae?

120
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,136
How do you know my girlfriend's name?

121
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:01,465
Did you think about...

122
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,075
how much it would hurt her if she found out?

123
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,416
Don't do anything you'd be embarrassed...

124
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,715
to face your girlfriend for.

125
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,116
Every man ought to know that.

126
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,266
Hold on, Hee Sub.

127
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:35,666
Wait.

128
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:38,835
Okay.

129
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:40,776
Okay.

130
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:42,805
I'll return it to her.

131
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,745
I'll tell her that my curiosity got the best of me...

132
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,315
and apologize to her in person.

133
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,486
I'll return it to her.

134
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:52,916
So give it back to me.

135
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,095
I mean it.

136
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,496
Just like you said, I don't want to do anything...

137
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,666
I'd be embarrassed to face my girlfriend...

138
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,396
and you, my friend.

139
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,215
I'll keep it a secret.

140
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,616
I won't tell anyone.

141
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:28,185
I'll pretend this never happened.

142
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,126
You must keep your promise too.

143
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,095
Okay.

144
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:41,666
Thank you, partner.

145
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,536
- Hee Sub. - Yu Sub.

146
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,305
Hello.

147
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,075
Be a good friend to my brother.

148
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:53,646
Okay.

149
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,945
What's wrong?

150
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:04,585
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

151
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,266
Yoo Bum Ryong stole Lee Ju Young's ring.

152
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:15,005
Baek Hee Sub was the guy with the blue cap.

153
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:16,636
It was he who ran away from the bridge that night.

154
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,776
Back then, Baek Hee Sub left the teahouse with someone.

155
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,475
And Yoo Bum Ryong...

156
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:23,975
went in the same direction as the victim.

157
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,616
And the path Lee Ju Young took.

158
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:04,986
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

159
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:27,935
(Inn)

160
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,545
(Inn)

161
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,585
Hurry up!

162
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,555
Are you joking with me right now?

163
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:48,896
Ko Min Soo?

164
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,095
It was pure injustice.

165
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,406
On the day of the murder,

166
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,935
I wasn't even in Woojung-Ri.

167
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,745
Back then, I was staying at a private boarding school...

168
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,106
away from the city.

169
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,786
My mother sent me there, so I could focus on my studies.

170
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,814
The school was in the middle of a mountain...

171
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:14,416
without even landlines.

172
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,225
Do you want to die?

173
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:18,526
Why is he here?

174
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:25,295
Your dear brother is...

175
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,065
asking for it.

176
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,606
Just give it to me and put an end to this.

177
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,175
Why are you talking back to me?

178
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:38,815
Hey.

179
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:43,916
Hey, is this your money?

180
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,856
You probably took it from Mom's wallet anyway.

181
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,626
Didn't you?

182
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,795
Mi Sook.

183
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:57,666
What a loser.

184
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:02,435
Mom kicked you out.

185
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:05,805
Don't act so mighty.

186
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:14,075
You little...

187
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,256
Are you okay?

188
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,325
Come on. You...

189
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:32,896
Darn it.

190
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,736
My arm...

191
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,136
You're hurting my arm.

192
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,845
I regret that my future self saved a dirtbag like you!

193
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:49,646
What should I do with you?

194
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,055
This is all because of you. You jerk!

195
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,315
- This is your fault! - Are you okay?

196
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,986
Go to the closest payphone and call the police.

197
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,655
I don't trust the system,

198
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:02,565
but I should at least leave a record in that darn system.

199
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:06,565
I'll make sure he pays for what he did this time.

200
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:10,606
Ko Mi Sook. Think carefully.

201
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,146
I don't want...

202
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,215
to call the police.

203
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,195
He has some money now.

204
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,365
He'll go back to the boarding school after he has some fun...

205
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,465
and feels better.

206
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:43,805
That's all I need.

207
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,376
If he gets into trouble again,

208
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,646
my mom will punish me.

209
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:54,516
So...

210
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:01,386
I hope this can stay between us.

211
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,215
(Woojung Inn)

212
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,965
This is driving me crazy. These kids never go home.

213
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:03,116
That was the path Lee Ju Young took.

214
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,915
It's most likely that...

215
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,285
one of the kids I met tonight is the real culprit.

216
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:10,386
But I met...

217
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:13,755
all three suspects during my walk tonight.

218
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:20,995
I'll keep it a secret.

219
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,606
I won't tell anyone.

220
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:27,136
(Restroom)

221
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,416
Okay.

222
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,086
I'll return it to her.

223
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:45,285
I'll apologize to her in person. I'll return it to her.

224
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:05,146
I'll never show up in this neighbourhood again.

225
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:08,616
Happy now?

226
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:09,816
(Direct)

227
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,296
Everyone I met on this path...

228
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,195
was lying.

229
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:37,275
Why lie? Why on earth would they?

230
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:49,185
Why are you so quiet?

231
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,025
The guy with the blue cap.

232
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,724
He could be the culprit who killed my mother.

233
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,336
You saw him at the teahouse. Right?

234
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:09,945
Who was it? Do we know him?

235
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:15,616
I couldn't see his face.

236
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,856
I lost him like last time.

237
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,785
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

238
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:28,525
You lied.

239
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,235
You said you weren't hurt, but you are.

240
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,806
It must have hurt whenever the shirt grazed...

241
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,146
It's nothing.

242
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:46,146
How's Ms. Lee?

243
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:51,316
She seems anxious, but she's okay.

244
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:55,755
She's worried that the police might get wind of this and come here.

245
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:58,656
She said we'd be in trouble too.

246
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:01,195
Don't worry.

247
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,066
No one will be able to come here tonight.

248
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:13,076
Yoon Young.

249
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:15,035
Yoon Young.

250
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,146
Yoon Young.

251
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,754
If you were going to knock,

252
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,725
you shouldn't have whispered, and vice versa.

253
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:34,626
Shouldn't you have chosen one strategy?

254
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,066
I'm sorry for coming over so late.

255
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:39,596
Is Yoon Young home?

256
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,066
Yoon Young, are you all right?

257
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:47,406
What about me?

258
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,505
I heard everything from my dad.

259
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,046
He said something horrible happened.

260
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,975
Someone was holding a knife at the general store this morning.

261
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:56,445
You must've been so scared.

262
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,586
- It was nothing. - How is that nothing?

263
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,525
By the way,

264
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:08,326
are you going to make Yoon Young sleep here tonight?

265
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,396
With you?

266
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,296
What?

267
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:15,705
Well, I mean...

268
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:18,606
Can I have her over for just one night?

269
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:23,275
Yes. That would be nice.

270
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:27,146
I didn't think it through.

271
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,245
You can go with her.

272
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:35,586
No, it's okay. There was just a misunderstanding.

273
00:22:39,396 --> 00:22:41,626
Just go get some rest,

274
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:43,695
using that as an excuse.

275
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:47,535
You came here right after she passed away.

276
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:51,005
Just relax for at least one night...

277
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,576
next to your mom. It's a good opportunity.

278
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:38,955
Is my room a little messy?

279
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:41,255
I did tidy it up, though.

280
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,185
My mom always smacks me on the back first.

281
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,425
She even threatens me, saying she'll throw everything away.

282
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,396
My mom was just like that too.

283
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:51,465
Right?

284
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,596
What's wrong with moms?

285
00:23:56,806 --> 00:24:00,005
I would never do that to my daughter.

286
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,004
I'll go wash up. Make yourself at home.

287
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:06,515
Okay. Wash up.

288
00:24:25,935 --> 00:24:26,995
No.

289
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:29,465
Why would he hide it?

290
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:45,515
Who are you calling...

291
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,916
this late?

292
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:50,126
You said you were anxious all day.

293
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:52,656
Let me check the barricade.

294
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:57,994
(Woojung Restaurant)

295
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:00,566
Do you really have to check?

296
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:03,666
- It's chaotic enough here. - The person I miss

297
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:05,734
Bravo!

298
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:08,335
I miss her

299
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:10,445
Yes. Everyone is here.

300
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,004
- Chairman Yoon. - Hold on.

301
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:14,014
What are you doing here? It's your turn.

302
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,745
Okay. Fine.

303
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:17,886
Hold on a second.

304
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,916
- Go. - Applaud!

305
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:24,386
All right.

306
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:27,356
Chairman Yoon will sing. Let's give him a big hand.

307
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:32,166
No. I'm not going to sing.

308
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,096
I just wish our police officers' happiness,

309
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:37,765
who work tirelessly day and night...

310
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,806
to keep Woojung-Ri crime-free and peaceful.

311
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:41,806
That's all I need.

312
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:43,675
Applaud for Chairman Yoon!

313
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:49,085
As I said earlier,

314
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,316
I'm treating you today for the peace of our town.

315
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:54,156
Don't think about going home tonight.

316
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:58,126
Eat and drink as much as you want.

317
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,595
- Yes! - Let's go!

318
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:03,724
To the happiness and prosperity of Woojung-Ri police officers!

319
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:06,666
- Cheers! - Cheers!

320
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:09,765
Gosh.

321
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:13,275
Grill more meat too.

322
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:15,705
Can we also get more alcohol?

323
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:19,475
What did you do?

324
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:22,714
As the principal, how could he not have known...

325
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,515
that someone with a criminal record was coming as a student teacher?

326
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:28,416
She was just trying to help me.

327
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:31,085
I'm just making sure that the person finishes what they started,

328
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:32,386
so you don't have to worry about it.

329
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,465
Yes. As we talked earlier,

330
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:40,136
please keep everyone there until sunrise.

331
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:44,406
Let me pour you a drink. Good work.

332
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,975
Hey, sit down.

333
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:55,345
Can't you see we're cleaning up the mess you made...

334
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:57,715
by turning the school upside down?

335
00:26:58,445 --> 00:26:59,455
Move.

336
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,326
Hey, Chief Kim said he was too ashamed to face Chairman Yoon.

337
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:11,425
To be honest, there were no clear charges against him.

338
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:12,735
Tell me the truth.

339
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:15,135
You just wanted to blame a protester from Seoul...

340
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:17,235
to improve your image.

341
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:32,146
You said it was your fault if you looked suspicious.

342
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:34,984
It was also you who said if you put the screws on someone,

343
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:36,826
you could easily make up charges.

344
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,356
Cleaning up my image?

345
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:41,525
I wonder who needs to be doing that.

346
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,425
You punk, how dare you?

347
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:47,465
- Get off of me. - Have you lost your mind?

348
00:27:49,306 --> 00:27:52,306
I should go pick up my kids.

349
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,205
- Gosh, you jerk. - Come on.

350
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,406
What do you think you're doing?

351
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,376
I was starting to cool off.

352
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:03,316
- Hey, are you really doing this? - I'm sorry.

353
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:06,086
- Dong Sik. - Yes.

354
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:11,425
What happened to Yong Woo and Yong Soon? They're not home?

355
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,455
My wife went to her parents'...

356
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,994
to take care of her ill dad.

357
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:17,995
Okay.

358
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,096
She left the kids at the house by the persimmon tree.

359
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,906
I see.

360
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:27,576
Especially Baek Dong Sik.

361
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:30,975
He brought all the police officers to our school today...

362
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:33,745
and turned the entire place upside down.

363
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,346
We never know what or when he will do next.

364
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,156
That's not a big problem.

365
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,755
Look at the time.

366
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:45,056
Just let them stay the night there.

367
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,695
Sit down. Just sit down, everyone.

368
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:52,525
Your kids will love it.

369
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:54,636
Their grandson is about their age, right?

370
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,505
- Am I right? - Yes.

371
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,135
Also, I'll call the lady at the persimmon tree house.

372
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:02,035
Don't worry about that.

373
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:03,974
Until the sun rises...

374
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,005
Okay. Pour me a drink.

375
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:07,076
Just stay right here.

376
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,416
- Okay. - Come on.

377
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:10,944
I'm sorry for making a scene, Chairman Yoon.

378
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:11,945
It's all right. Drink up.

379
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:14,714
Get ready to sing for Chairman Yoon!

380
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:15,785
- Goodness. - Yes!

381
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:18,525
One, two, three, four.

382
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:10,306
Is there anything that is bothering you?

383
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:13,346
I noticed that you didn't sleep a wink.

384
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,346
You woke up?

385
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:21,255
It's just that...

386
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:26,096
I can't get it out of my head.

387
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,455
What is it?

388
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:34,366
What's bothering you so much that you can't even sleep?

389
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,136
Baek Hee Sub.

390
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:42,435
What? Already?

391
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,945
Hey, you said you still had a boyfriend.

392
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,116
I'm the worst.

393
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,715
What do I do?

394
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:55,685
Gosh, it gives me a headache.

395
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,025
To think that I could have a relaxing night.

396
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:02,056
Hey.

397
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,296
You haven't even known Hee Sub for a long time.

398
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,995
You don't even know what he's like.

399
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,735
So I asked him.

400
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,376
When I saw him at Bong Bong Teahouse.

401
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,896
By the way,

402
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,695
what do you like so much about me?

403
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,596
You don't know me well.

404
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:42,694
You transferred only a few days ago,

405
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:44,465
and you don't know what I'm like.

406
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:45,806
Why would I not know you?

407
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:49,336
As soon as I met you, I figured you out.

408
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,576
What kind of girl am I?

409
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:53,346
A gorgeous girl.

410
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:06,156
And...

411
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,396
you have your own world.

412
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:15,035
When I first saw you...

413
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:16,965
in that tiny ticket booth,

414
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,675
you were listening to your favourite song on the radio.

415
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:21,306
And you were so focused on writing...

416
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,806
that you didn't even know I was standing there.

417
00:32:25,306 --> 00:32:27,715
You were so engrossed in the world you created.

418
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:30,586
You had no idea how beautiful you looked.

419
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,744
And that tiny booth...

420
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:35,156
was so spotless that it shone like a star.

421
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:38,525
"I don't have a care in the world."

422
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:42,296
You were just smiling to yourself.

423
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:46,126
So...

424
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:51,166
I've never met anyone as cool as you.

425
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:56,646
He shone like a star.

426
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,745
What he told me,

427
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:07,386
the look on his face when he was talking,

428
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:12,326
and the shaky voice he had.

429
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,056
Everything was shining.

430
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:24,366
"A moment that never ends."

431
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,435
("Small Door")

432
00:33:28,636 --> 00:33:30,375
(The 25th Letter)

433
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,846
"Did you know, Y?"

434
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:37,616
"There's a moment..."

435
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:40,785
"that never ends."

436
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:48,796
I thought about the shining words he told me that day...

437
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,796
over and over again.

438
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,265
Get out! If you're going to keep this up,

439
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:59,935
spend the rest of your life taking care of him.

440
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:26,666
Whatever darkness were to befall me in the future,

441
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,666
if I could hold on to these shining moments,

442
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:34,836
I thought nothing in the world could scare me.

443
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:39,646
It only took a moment for him to see my world.

444
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:43,745
I wonder what kind of world he has.

445
00:34:45,646 --> 00:34:47,155
I keep getting curious...

446
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,216
about his world.

447
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:56,296
The guy in Mom's novel...

448
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:58,126
was...

449
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,466
It was Baek Hee Sub.

450
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:04,765
What?

451
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,185
Are you going to sleep?

452
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:20,816
What should I do?

453
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:27,756
Baek Hee Sub.

454
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:41,276
I came here because I had to return something to her.

455
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:42,905
To the student teacher.

456
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:57,026
I just came out...

457
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:00,655
for a walk.

458
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,696
He was 1 of the 3 suspects...

459
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,595
and the mysterious guy with the blue cap.

460
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,535
His whereabouts matched Lee Ju Young's whereabouts.

461
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:10,606
So far, he's the prime suspect.

462
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:12,466
But...

463
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,404
why would he kill her if he told Yoo Bum Ryong...

464
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:16,575
to return the ring?

465
00:36:17,146 --> 00:36:18,676
Something doesn't add up.

466
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,345
Or am I hoping that it doesn't?

467
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,926
(Woojung Inn)

468
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,126
I got all my important belongings.

469
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:40,566
- Let's go. - Okay.

470
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:55,014
(From Woojung-Ri to Wonju)

471
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,015
Darn it.

472
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:58,615
How did I end up getting involved with that dangerous neighbour?

473
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:08,626
You won't be in danger as long as you leave this village.

474
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:09,995
But just to be sure,

475
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,864
call me as soon as you arrive at your friend's house.

476
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:14,836
- My landline number is... - I know.

477
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,606
You told me the number when I first got here.

478
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:29,845
I know that this will make no sense.

479
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:32,285
But it feels as if...

480
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,555
you came here on purpose just to save me.

481
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:40,955
As if you knew that I would be here, you waited for me.

482
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,526
It's like you thought about...

483
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:47,635
how you could help me for a long time.

484
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,035
No way.

485
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:51,736
Right.

486
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:55,376
I know that's not possible, but you helped me as if you could.

487
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:57,575
Thank you.

488
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,946
If it hadn't been for you,

489
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,146
I don't know what would have happened to me.

490
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:08,355
Thank you so much.

491
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:12,825
(Woojung General Store)

492
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:14,655
Here.

493
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,066
Don't lose that.

494
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,865
Have a good life...

495
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:26,506
until you turn old and Gray. Have a long, healthy life.

496
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,236
You too.

497
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:36,475
There's the bus.

498
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:51,066
Be safe.

499
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:07,676
Goodness. This is killing me.

500
00:39:11,946 --> 00:39:13,385
The bus is already running?

501
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,595
Hey!

502
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,135
Hey!

503
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:31,736
Darn it.

504
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:35,035
Come on.

505
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:55,655
You jerk. You!

506
00:39:57,566 --> 00:39:58,595
You jerk.

507
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,965
When you were under the bridge that night,

508
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,635
you secretly sent me signals to help her.

509
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:04,635
How dare you make a cop help a protester?

510
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:07,405
After realizing what you did,

511
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:11,646
I just thought you were some clueless teacher.

512
00:40:12,606 --> 00:40:14,046
Were you one of them?

513
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:15,816
Is that it?

514
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:19,146
How much have you had to drink?

515
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:21,014
"One of them?"

516
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:22,756
I was just passing by.

517
00:40:23,055 --> 00:40:24,055
Is that so?

518
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:26,486
I'll find out the truth once I start digging.

519
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:29,054
Let's have this conversation at the station. Okay?

520
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:31,026
Why are you taking me when I haven't done a thing?

521
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:33,764
Stop talking back to me. Come with me, you jerk.

522
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,765
Gosh.

523
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,716
Oh, no. How could this happen? Goodness.

524
00:40:56,115 --> 00:40:58,426
- Hey. - Yes.

525
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:02,396
What happened? Is there a fire?

526
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:06,026
There's a huge fire at the house with the persimmon tree.

527
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,364
What? Where?

528
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,665
The house with the persimmon tree...

529
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,166
where the boy lives with his grandma.

530
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:15,236
Goodness. I hope they're okay. What should we do?

531
00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:18,305
On May 15, there was a fire incident.

532
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,716
No one died from it.

533
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:24,586
My kids are at that house.

534
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,514
What are you talking about?

535
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:31,086
There should only be two people inside.

536
00:41:33,495 --> 00:41:35,725
I should have gone to pick them up last night.

537
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:39,296
But I couldn't.

538
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:42,896
Oh, no.

539
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:45,135
Oh, no. Goodness.

540
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:48,505
Oh, dear. What are we going to do, Dong Sik?

541
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,776
- Yong Woo. - Oh, no.

542
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,805
Oh, no. Goodness.

543
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:57,515
Yong Woo! Yong Soon!

544
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:01,515
Yong Woo!

545
00:42:02,216 --> 00:42:03,385
Yong Woo! Yong Soon!

546
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:07,154
Yong Woo! Yong Soon!

547
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:08,995
- Right here. - She's here.

548
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,565
- Yong Soon, it's Dad. - Your dad is here.

549
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:12,566
Are you all right?

550
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:15,236
Yong Soon!

551
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,365
I'm sorry. Yoon Soon.

552
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,075
- The old lady is out. - Ma'am.

553
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:25,974
Where are the rest of the kids?

554
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,074
I'm not sure.

555
00:42:27,075 --> 00:42:30,385
I think I brought my grandchild out.

556
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:37,185
Oh, my gosh. It's going to collapse.

557
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:38,824
- Goodness. - What do we do?

558
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:39,885
Yong Woo!

559
00:42:40,526 --> 00:42:41,594
Yong Woo!

560
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:42,896
Yong Woo!

561
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:44,566
Yong Woo!

562
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:47,736
Yong Woo!

563
00:42:49,535 --> 00:42:50,606
Yong Woo!

564
00:42:52,106 --> 00:42:53,134
Yong Woo!

565
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:55,535
Yong Woo!

566
00:42:56,435 --> 00:42:58,776
- Yong Woo! - Yong Woo!

567
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,515
Can you keep them from budging until the sun rises?

568
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:03,075
Especially Baek Dong Sik.

569
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:06,546
He brought all the police officers to our school today...

570
00:43:07,316 --> 00:43:09,885
and turned the entire place upside down.

571
00:43:10,225 --> 00:43:12,385
I should've picked them up yesterday.

572
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,196
But I couldn't.

573
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:18,365
Yong Woo!

574
00:43:18,825 --> 00:43:19,926
Yong Woo!

575
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:23,705
Yong Woo!

576
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:25,765
Gosh, that's hot.

577
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:28,236
Yong Woo!

578
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:31,506
Yong Woo!

579
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:33,745
Yong Woo!

580
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:35,975
Yong Woo.

581
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:37,946
Yong Woo!

582
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:40,155
Detective Baek, over here!

583
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:41,955
- Yong Woo! - Over here.

584
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,685
Take him out. Hurry.

585
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:46,926
Yong Woo.

586
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,495
Yong Woo! Yong Woo.

587
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:54,495
Come on. Yong Woo.

588
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,796
Yong Woo, stay with me.

589
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:58,865
Yong Woo.

590
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:02,276
Yong Woo.

591
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:05,245
Yong Woo, are you okay?

592
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:07,645
I'm so sorry.

593
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:10,514
- What a relief. - Thank goodness.

594
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:13,215
- His father saved him. - You're amazing.

595
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:15,114
- That was close. - Goodness.

596
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:16,485
(Woojung-Ri Fire Rescue)

597
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:17,685
Hee Sub.

598
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:20,395
Uncle Dong Sik.

599
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:22,555
Your homeroom teacher needs to go to the hospital.

600
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:23,796
Sorry?

601
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:31,805
You're badly hurt.

602
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:33,876
Let's go to the hospital.

603
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,146
What are you waiting for? Let's go already.

604
00:44:54,296 --> 00:44:57,296
(Call 119 in case of fire)

605
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:06,305
What I did to get Lee Ju Young to safety...

606
00:45:06,865 --> 00:45:08,405
created another variable,

607
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:11,646
and that variable created another situation.

608
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,185
I saved someone who could've died, but in turn,

609
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,816
I almost made someone...

610
00:45:22,816 --> 00:45:24,026
who should have lived...

611
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:25,885
die.

612
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:44,176
It's somewhere here.

613
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,685
Did you see Ms. Lee off...

614
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,356
Did something happen?

615
00:46:04,365 --> 00:46:05,896
Oh, it's nothing.

616
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:09,196
Did you have a good time with your mother?

617
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:11,836
Yes.

618
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:14,135
Why are you holding that?

619
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,845
I think I can figure it out.

620
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,515
- Figure what out? - The guy with the blue cap.

621
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,416
The answer...

622
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:24,986
might be in this manuscript.

623
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:39,225
A novel is not a report.

624
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:43,434
Although it was based on a true story,

625
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:45,836
that doesn't mean actual names were used.

626
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:48,235
At first,

627
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:50,405
I thought Ko Mi Sook didn't write about a person with a blue cap.

628
00:46:51,546 --> 00:46:54,075
But then I remembered that there was a similar line.

629
00:46:55,975 --> 00:46:57,446
"A blue-headed man."

630
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:01,015
This whole time,

631
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,955
I thought that meant that he had blue hair.

632
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,296
What on earth happened?

633
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,896
Do I have to tell you everything?

634
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:19,865
Do I have to share every tiny detail of everything that happens here?

635
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,475
Are you?

636
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:24,606
Were we even that close?

637
00:47:34,716 --> 00:47:35,856
You know, don't you?

638
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:41,426
The blue cap.

639
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:45,325
You're not even curious.

640
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,135
You found out who it is, right?

641
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:53,606
You didn't miss him at the teahouse.

642
00:47:58,245 --> 00:47:59,676
You don't need to tell me,

643
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:01,614
but isn't there also no reason for you to hide it from me?

644
00:48:01,615 --> 00:48:03,445
Why? What is it?

645
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:05,745
I think you're misunderstanding something.

646
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:07,955
Think carefully.

647
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,025
If I really came here for coverage purposes,

648
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:13,756
why would I go out of my way to catch the criminal?

649
00:48:15,455 --> 00:48:16,995
Because I feel bad for the victims?

650
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:20,126
This world is full of such tragedies.

651
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:23,836
I don't have enough time on my hands to save all those people.

652
00:48:25,765 --> 00:48:26,935
Then what's the reason?

653
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,606
I am also a victim.

654
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:35,075
The fifth victim.

655
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:40,455
I end up dying in the future, just like your mother,

656
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:43,416
because the culprit was not caught properly.

657
00:48:44,126 --> 00:48:46,256
I came here to save my own life.

658
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,925
I input every newspaper story, news broadcast, and case file...

659
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,965
related to this village in 1987...

660
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:53,526
into my head.

661
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,205
But everything might go down the drain because of one variable.

662
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:01,435
That alone makes me feel like my head is going to explode.

663
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:05,106
But you know what?

664
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,975
Do you know who the biggest variable is?

665
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:15,555
Is that why you sent me to my mom last night?

666
00:49:18,586 --> 00:49:21,126
"Don't even be curious about the variables."

667
00:49:22,896 --> 00:49:24,225
"Don't get in the way."

668
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:26,466
"Stay out of this."

669
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,095
Is that what you want to say?

670
00:49:34,736 --> 00:49:36,506
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

671
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:39,676
Since I've already come this far,

672
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:43,015
I don't want to sit on my hands like an idiot.

673
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:47,486
If you don't want to tell me, suit yourself.

674
00:49:49,216 --> 00:49:50,756
I'm going to find out myself.

675
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:05,736
I feel so uncomfortable.

676
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:10,546
What if Bum Ryong cries and becomes clingy?

677
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:13,946
He said he only had me in his life.

678
00:50:16,615 --> 00:50:17,745
What are you doing?

679
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:20,345
Hey, Baek Yoon Young.

680
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:30,225
"On the afternoon that the first victim's corpse was found,"

681
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:34,635
"there were a few people who started acting strange."

682
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:37,565
"The blue-headed man..."

683
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:40,006
"stood between the sun and the moon for what seemed like forever."

684
00:50:41,035 --> 00:50:42,635
"The man with glasses..."

685
00:50:43,236 --> 00:50:45,975
"was not able to come out of the third stall for a long time."

686
00:50:47,146 --> 00:50:48,776
"The man who had lost his memory..."

687
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:52,185
"lay down under the bridge, not realizing who he was."

688
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:56,715
(The blue-headed man stood between the sun...)

689
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:59,086
(and the moon for what seemed like forever.)

690
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:02,725
Lee Ju Young was found dead today.

691
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:05,966
So this is talking about this afternoon.

692
00:51:07,495 --> 00:51:11,236
If "the blue-headed man" really means a man in a blue hat...

693
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:15,336
(The sun and the moon)

694
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,845
where could "between the sun and the moon" be?

695
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:19,946
I don't know.

696
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,276
What is that? It's scaring me.

697
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:28,785
Just go and meet Yoo Bum Ryong.

698
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,825
You have to deal with it one way or another.

699
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:35,225
Fine, I will.

700
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:42,135
By the way, don't hang out with whoever wrote that.

701
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:47,676
I don't like it.

702
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:49,975
How did you know it wasn't me who wrote it?

703
00:51:50,376 --> 00:51:51,446
Are you stupid?

704
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,075
There's no way...

705
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,245
you wouldn't understand something you wrote yourself.

706
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:55,975
The writer should know everything...

707
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:58,546
because they chose each word carefully.

708
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:03,955
See you.

709
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:20,405
She wouldn't know something she wrote 30 years from now.

710
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:26,236
Hae Jun!

711
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:29,704
- Hae Jun! - What in the world?

712
00:53:29,705 --> 00:53:30,776
Hey.

713
00:53:57,836 --> 00:53:58,865
(The 1st murder, the 2nd murder)

714
00:54:04,805 --> 00:54:06,575

(Investigation Report)

716
00:55:01,935 --> 00:55:03,495
I heard Mr. Yoon got hurt.

717
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:08,135
Let me know if you need any help.

718
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,405
Because I'm still grateful for what you did.

719
00:55:13,506 --> 00:55:14,546
So...

720
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,785
you were happy about what happened to Ko Min Soo.

721
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:28,896
"A man stood between the sun and the moon for what seemed like forever."

722
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:37,396
If a sentence like this exists,

723
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:40,805
what could "between the sun and the moon" mean?

724
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:49,446
How am I supposed to know?

725
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:58,856
I shouldn't have asked her.

726
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:02,896
Isn't that the name of the record shop?

727
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,475

Do you know what time it is right now?

732

Then...

733
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,215
do you know how it feels to wait for someone...

734
00:58:03,216 --> 00:58:04,845
after hearing that they left school early?

735
00:58:07,015 --> 00:58:08,755
Because we're living in this stupid year 1987,

736
00:58:08,756 --> 00:58:10,655
I couldn't even call you.

737
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:18,995
I'm sorry.

738
00:58:21,466 --> 00:58:23,195
I knew I should've told you,

739
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:25,066
but I hid the truth from you.

740
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:28,935
But I didn't send you to your mom to get rid of you or anything.

741
00:58:30,905 --> 00:58:31,975
I know.

742
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:37,614
The man with the blue cap is your...

743
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:38,845
I know that as well.

744
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:43,856
I saw him with my own eyes.

745
00:58:45,256 --> 00:58:47,154
I also think I know why you had no choice...

746
00:58:47,155 --> 00:58:48,825
but to hide the truth from me.

747
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:52,225
Because we're family.

748
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:56,595
He's just one of the suspects.

749
00:59:01,836 --> 00:59:03,106
I never really liked him,

750
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,446
but I also never expected him to be so cruel.

751
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:11,986
My father loves him to bits.

752
00:59:14,816 --> 00:59:15,856
Even more than he loves us.

753
00:59:19,185 --> 00:59:20,285
What?

754
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:23,796
Sorry?

755
00:59:24,396 --> 00:59:25,396
I mean...

756
00:59:27,265 --> 00:59:29,336
Who are you talking about right now?

757
00:59:29,935 --> 00:59:32,534
I thought we were talking about the man with the blue cap.

758
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:33,566
Exactly.

759
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:37,876
Why does Baek Hee Sub love himself to bits?

760
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:44,046
Are you saying the man with the blue cap is my father?

761
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:49,955
Then who did you see?

762
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:54,995
(Sun and Moon Record Shop)

763
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:26,926
My uncle.

764
01:00:28,296 --> 01:00:29,296
Baek Yu Sub.

765
01:00:30,655 --> 01:00:32,595
Baek Yu Sub wasn't even a suspect,

766
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,495
and he wasn't in the vicinity last night.

767
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:53,015
Everything makes sense now.

768
01:01:07,526 --> 01:01:08,665
(Bong Bong)

769
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:12,765
(Epilogue)

770
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:14,736
Yu Sub.

771
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,975
What are you doing here? It's not even the weekend.

772
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:21,006
I was supposed to meet someone here, but I don't think they came.

773
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,646
- What about you? - I'm here to meet someone too.

774
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:26,816
- Do you want to go in together? - It's okay. It's stuffy inside.

775
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:29,285
If you're going to be done soon, I'll wait outside.

776
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:30,855
- Will you? - Sure.

777
01:01:30,856 --> 01:01:32,225
I'd love that.

778
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:37,995
Gosh, your hat is so cool.

779
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:49,635
Here you go.

780
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:51,606
Let me see.

781
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,376
Goodness, it looks good on you.

782
01:01:53,975 --> 01:01:55,745
It looks better on me, doesn't it?

783
01:01:57,345 --> 01:01:59,146
- Make it quick. - Okay, Yu Sub.

784
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,736
(My Perfect Stranger)

785
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:52,865
There's nothing about Baek Yu Sub.

786
01:02:52,966 --> 01:02:54,776
None of these files have any information.

787
01:02:54,876 --> 01:02:57,135
No one knows Baek Yu Sub better than me.

788
01:02:57,176 --> 01:02:59,106
I'll give you everything you need.

789
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:01,005
If Baek Yu Sub is the culprit,

790
01:03:01,006 --> 01:03:02,844
we're going to see him again tomorrow night...

791
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,046
because he needs to kill the second victim.

792
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:07,085
Where in the world could he be?

793
01:03:07,086 --> 01:03:09,115
- We looked everywhere... - It won't happen anytime soon.

794
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,385
Hello?

795
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:35,646
