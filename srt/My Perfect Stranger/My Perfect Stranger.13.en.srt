5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,278
Steal what? What are you talking about?

6
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,678
My novel.

7
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,349
Don't be so brazen and try to lie to me too!

8
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,519
I'll tell them everything.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,159
(Previously)

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Why are you so annoying, Soon Ae?

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,189
Don't get in the way if you don't want to end up like your sister.

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,799
The biggest mystery for me...

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,059
was this sentence.

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,998
"Women who read are dangerous."

15
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,998
Lee Ju Young had a book, though.

16
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:09,668
The reason Lee Kyung Ae went to the abandoned house that night.

17
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,139
Baek Yu Sub and Lee Ju Young. The only item they said they needed.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,240
It must've been a book.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,079
All the victims had something in common.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,209
They had books with them.

21
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:20,350
This could be some sort of warning.

22
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:24,550
I wondered why girls who like reading were all like that.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,648
As if reading some words on paper will make them special.

24
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:27,789
It makes me sick.

25
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,130
What?

26
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,270
You probably can't tie any strings for the time being.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,899
So does it hurt a lot?

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,550
You keep drinking.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,750
That's why it's taking so long.

30
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,149
The incidents that happened in our village...

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,089
The culprit... I saw him.

32
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,819
I saw the crime take place.

33
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,399
It was my brother.

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,699
(My Perfect Stranger, Episode 13, Time Flies, Love Remains)

35
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:14,970

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,680
(TV, record player, radio, on-site repair)

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,519
(Time flies...)

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,120
There.

39
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,729
You're certain this is a good watch. Right?

40
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,660
Of course.

41
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,970
If you take good care of the watch,

42
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,339
it will be good for 100 years. No, for even 200 years.

43
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,769
Yes. It ought to be.

44
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,009
My future grandson will wear this too.

45
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,039
Your grandson? Yeon Woo...

46
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,910
Is Yeon Woo engaged?

47
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,949
- Did he get the girl pregnant? - Hey.

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,519
Are you trying to ruin his future? It's nothing like that.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,049
Then what is it?

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,819
You know what?

51
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,288
I recently had a dream.

52
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,759
I was walking on a foggy path.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,560
You know the old underpass near the hill in the back, right?

54
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,828
Then I saw...

55
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,900
Roar! A tiger as big as this jumped out of the underpass.

56
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,508
Then it came into my arms.

57
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,210
That's a great dream.

58
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:30,139
So I'm going to treat it as a dream for my future grandson.

59
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,049
Gosh. I don't know when it will be.

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,079
But I guess you will have a very bright grandson.

61
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,190
I'm buying this in advance for meeting him in my dream.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,530
I wonder when I will actually get to meet him.

63
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,859
Gosh. I can't wait to find out. You know?

64
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,759
Wait.

65
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:19,729
Wait.

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,799
It's a misunderstanding.

67
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,830
It's not what you think.

68
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,669
Move. Or you'll get hurt.

69
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,400
Wait. No!

70
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,070
I explained everything to you.

71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,949
He's the one who told me to go find you.

72
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,449
How do you think he could kill anyone? It makes no sense!

73
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,650
Didn't you hear me? Get out of my way!

74
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,850
Yoon Young, it's okay.

75
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:47,090
It's okay.

76
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,359
Let me talk to her for a second.

77
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,869
She's my family. She will be on her own while I'm away.

78
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,549
I'll give you three minutes.

79
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,859
You trust me, right?

80
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,859
Of course. Why are you even asking me that?

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,229
By the time I arrived,

82
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,100
it was already over.

83
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,600
I think he faced the culprit...

84
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,939
to save your mother.

85
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,140
What should I do?

86
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,309
Tell me what to do.

87
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,179
I'll be back soon. Don't worry.

88
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,249
You should stay with your mother.

89
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,830
She must be in a safe place with other people.

90
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,900
By the way,

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,830
do you drive?

92
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,910
Do you know how to drive?

93
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,340
Why are you asking me that?

94
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:21,820
You said you would be back soon.

95
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,020
Why are you asking me that right now?

96
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,689
If...

97
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,959
If I...

98
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,830
There's no if.

99
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,970
I told you what kind of future I wanted.

100
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,570
Whatever happens,

101
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,840
I will wait for you at our house.

102
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Alone.

103
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:53,850
In fear.

104
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,090
So don't take too long.

105
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:03,220
Don't get hurt. Okay?

106
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,090
I won't.

107
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,169
I'll make sure of it.

108
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,220
Gosh. You brazen punk.

109
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,619
Forget it. This evidence is rock solid.

110
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,960
We don't have to stall just to get a confession from him.

111
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,659
Wrap it up with the evidence we have.

112
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
Let's transfer him as soon as the sun comes up.

113
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

114
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,530
Gosh. I'm so sick of it. It's finally over.

115
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,160
Hey, what is this? Darn it.

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,928
This is driving me crazy!

117
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,869
You said you had caught the culprit!

118
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,669
You said the case was basically over!

119
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,369
How could this happen?

120
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,340
Why my daughter again?

121
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,280
What if the culprit had really killed her?

122
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,080
- Dad, stop it. - Gosh.

123
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,629
He tried to hurt Soon Ae too after taking Kyung Ae from me?

124
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,940
That jerk!

125
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,639
I'm going to rip him to pieces once I get my hands on him!

126
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,580
My poor daughter. Oh, no.

127
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:09,850
Goodness.

128
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,649
Soon Ae.

129
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,540
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

130
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,909
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

131
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,019
(Women who read are dangerous.)

132
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,470
I found a matchbox from Bong Bong Teahouse from Lee Soon Ae.

133
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,200
And the note was in the matchbox too.

134
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,209
It said, "Women who read are dangerous."

135
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,509
And it was the same handwriting. I'm sure of it.

136
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,009
It matches the notes the culprit had written before.

137
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,680
Ko Mi Sook wasn't the culprit but a witness.

138
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,389
The culprit is a man,

139
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:23,060
and the only person who saw his face...

140
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,489
is Ko Mi Sook.

141
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,840
I think the guy at the abandoned house is the real culprit.

142
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,440
Okay.

143
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,739
Call me as soon as Lee Soon Ae wakes up.

144
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
Okay.

145
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,779
Mr. Yoon Hae Jun.

146
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,459
Tell me your alibi between the night of the 16th...

147
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,659
and the morning of the 17th.

148
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,690
So...

149
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,300
the times when Lee Ju Young and Lee Kyung Ae were murdered.

150
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,670
What were you up to during those hours?

151
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:09,369
Tell me.

152
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,279
What is it?

153
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:19,279
Who is the culprit?

154
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,079
Who is it?

155
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,619
Why are you asking me?

156
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,190
Another person died.

157
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,460
It was a boy this time.

158
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,028
A boy from your school, who was in your grade,

159
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,629
died in an abandoned house out of nowhere.

160
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,729
If not, Lee Soon Ae would've died.

161
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,700
What are you saying?

162
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,970
Soon Ae could've been killed by the actual culprit.

163
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,778
He died while trying to save her,

164
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,248
and that's all because of you!

165
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,080
How come that's my fault?

166
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,190
If you made a report in the first place,

167
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,459
if they didn't arrest someone wrong...

168
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,358
because of the false report...

169
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,800
you made in the first place,

170
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,129
this would not have happened.

171
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:21,739
I don't know why you are behaving like this,

172
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,210
but I don't know anything.

173
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,090
Cut the nonsense and tell me.

174
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,060
Who is the real culprit?

175
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:39,929
Who are you to accuse me of such things?

176
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,859
Why do you keep appearing in front of me and interfering?

177
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:50,200
Your plan has become all messed up,

178
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,340
Ko Mi Sook.

179
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,210
Mr. Yoon has been arrested.

180
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,050
What?

181
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:05,720
He might have to take all the faults for whatever happened.

182
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,659
What are you talking about?

183
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,159
It's all been messed up.

184
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,699
Who could Ko Min Soo, who was apprehended by the police,

185
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,129
have killed?

186
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,569
The police needed a new culprit,

187
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,070
and that happened to be...

188
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,249
I know why you did that.

189
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,790
But this isn't right.

190
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,790
So many people have fallen into danger.

191
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,259
If you need any other way, I'll help you.

192
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,830
So please help me this once.

193
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,869
If you tell me who the culprit is...

194
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,170
Let go.

195
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:56,570
I don't need help from you.

196
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,840
I don't know anything, so just get going.

197
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:11,080
I already know that you were there on the scene of Lee Kyung Ae.

198
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,050
I'm questioning your time before that.

199
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,320
Where were you, and what were you up to?

200
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,430
I was with Yoo Bum Ryong back then too.

201
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,330
Because Yoo Bum Ryong got a call...

202
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,470
back then too.

203
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,300
She's already dead.

204
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,239
She's dead.

205
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,580
That's what happened.

206
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,488
You were looking at the dead body of Lee Ju Young.

207
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:51,190
She looked for me, all scared.

208
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,690
She was afraid of telling the police.

209
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,499
I heard she was a commie.

210
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,899
They might arrest me for not reporting her...

211
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,899
He was that afraid of getting involved with Ms. Lee.

212
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,609
I bet you know why...

213
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,180
since you have nephews too.

214
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,249
If you're thinking...

215
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,518
of dumping all these on Yoo Bum Ryong...

216
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,389
I only answered with all my heart because you asked.

217
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,460
Yoo Bum Ryong isn't the culprit.

218
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,690
You can tell from the handwriting alone.

219
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,729
It's the same thing for what I'm researching.

220
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,430
You'll be able to tell in detail once you're at school.

221
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,300
The test papers and assignments...

222
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,070
I couldn't have fooled them all.

223
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,920
Then what is this?

224
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,090
How come this was in your pocket?

225
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,619
I picked that up by accident.

226
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,889
Are you kidding me right now?

227
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:03,930
I know how complicated my situation is,

228
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,670
but there are many ways in which you can check.

229
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:08,570
My handwriting.

230
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,340
And Lee Soon Ae.

231
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,609
You should listen to her when she wakes up...

232
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,040
and find out who she ran away from.

233
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,249
Why Yoo Bum Ryong had to die there.

234
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,519
I can't wait to find out the truth.

235
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,529
There were many things...

236
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,830
I found suspicious whenever I ran into you.

237
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,710
That's why I want to take this chance to get to know you.

238
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,180
Why you were always there when the incident took place.

239
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,310
Please look forward to it.

240
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,779
This time, you won't be able to get out.

241
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,810
I know that this will make no sense.

242
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:59,250
But it feels as if you came here on purpose just to save me.

243
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Thank you.

244
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:05,080
I was really going to give the money to Soon Ae to pay for her tuition.

245
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,330
It's me, Soon Ae.

246
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:14,889
Mr. Yoon!

247
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,030
The culprit is following us.

248
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,030
Get to your senses, Bum Ryong.

249
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,139
Whatever happens,

250
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,839
I will wait for you at our house.

251
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,179
So don't take too long.

252
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,480
Don't get hurt. Okay?

253
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,949
I'll make sure of it.

254
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,629
Who is he, though? He's been here all night, crying his heart out.

255
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,540
He's been to our rooftop.

256
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,100
What?

257
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,840
Then that's the jerk...

258
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,409
Come on. Let him be.

259
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,679
He went through a lot because of us.

260
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,350
He was arrested by the police when he didn't do anything wrong...

261
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,850
for our Soon Ae,

262
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,219
with his mouth closed.

263
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,590
It looks like he didn't eat all day.

264
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:01,530
What is he to starve, though?

265
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,699
Who are you to starve because of Soon Ae?

266
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,868
It must've been because of shock. It's not like anything's wrong.

267
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:17,439
She'll wake up soon. Okay?

268
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,750
Start eating.

269
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,129
Gosh.

270
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,629
I don't think I can.

271
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Soon Ae is lying in the hospital.

272
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,340
She was so scared...

273
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,740
and terrified...

274
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,040
that she couldn't even wake up.

275
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,639
What a jerk.

276
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:54,780
Once I catch him,

277
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,148
I'll make him pay for it.

278
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,580
Then you should eat more.

279
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,990
What kind of man is scrawny like you?

280
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:03,990
Come on.

281
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:05,689
Open your mouth.

282
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,389
Open it.

283
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,459
Eat like me now.

284
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,770
Go.

285
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,300
Hold your chopsticks now.

286
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,320
(Truth and faith)

287
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,109
Come out.

288
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,149
(Teaching Certificate)

289
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,689
(Safe Woojung, happy citizens, together with police)

290
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:32,709
What?

291
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:34,580
What's going on?

292
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,550
Your ID, resume, and teaching certificate.

293
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,949
They're all fake.

294
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,189
What's with all this?

295
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,019
I also checked your previous work, address,

296
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,729
and everything you wrote down just in case.

297
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,530
But there was no proof that you existed.

298
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:56,570
No. You haven't even been born.

299
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,310
Do you know what this could mean?

300
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,240
Do you know this is more dangerous than being a murderer?

301
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,580
Tell the truth when I'm giving you a chance.

302
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:13,750
You and Baek Yoon Young...

303
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,219
I'm dying to arrest and report you two...

304
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,830
as spies.

305
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:24,899
But I know I owe you one.

306
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,629
Uncle Dong Sik, you're wrong.

307
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,540
You never visited us while we were hospitalized,

308
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,369
so you might not know this.

309
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,949
I don't know what would've happened to me and my brother...

310
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,320
if it hadn't been for Mr. Yoon.

311
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,990
He came to our room every day and gave me a pat on the shoulder.

312
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,060
He was like our guardian.

313
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,090
The guardian...

314
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,300
that my brother and I don't have anymore.

315
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,000
You took care of my poor nephews...

316
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:01,530
instead of...

317
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,969
this stupid, pathetic uncle.

318
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:06,739
Because I owe you that,

319
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,079
I came to ask you...

320
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,679
about these obviously ridiculous, suspicious moves.

321
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:13,980
So talk!

322
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,090
Give me an explanation I can understand. Okay?

323
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,790
If I do,

324
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,689
will you believe me?

325
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:33,000
If I were honest...

326
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,770
and told you the entire truth,

327
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,139
would you believe me?

328
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,469
What?

329
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,270
I have something to show you.

330
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,080
Also,

331
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,350
I would never want to think that you owe me,

332
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:51,020
but if you do, will you do me...

333
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,820
one last favour?

334
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:56,889
Chairman Yoon Byung Gu.

335
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,230
Would you bring him to my house?

336
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,790
Now.

337
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,399
What is going on?

338
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,729
Well, this is...

339
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,800
Goodness.

340
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,149
- Please come up. - Okay.

341
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,590
- Let's go. - Go ahead.

342
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,850
What's all this?

343
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:05,658
How...

(Serial Killer Ko Sentenced to Life)

345
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:10,329
How do you have an article from 1988?

346
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,530
(October 17, 1988)

350
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:27,149
Why is my report here?

351
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,919
I thought you had to see it for yourself to believe it.

352
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,159
The fact...

353
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:43,899
that I came from the future.

354
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,240
I travelled from the far future,

355
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,209
but we're not too distantly related.

The future daughter of your nephew, Baek Hee Sub,

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,290
is the one I'm living with, Baek Yoon Young.

360
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,260
You must've bumped into her many times already.

361
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:23,599
So, you took something called a time machine...

362
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,240
and came here?

363
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:27,510
Yes.

364
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,040

365
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,340
for the crimes committed here.

00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,550
It caused you to die,

367
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,350
so you came here to catch the culprit yourself?

368
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,619
Is that what you're saying?

369
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:44,959
Yes.

370
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,159
I'm sorry, Chairman Yoon. Let's go.

371
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,569
I trusted this lunatic...

372
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,899
and brought you to hear the nonsense in the middle of the night.

373
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,908
No. You get up.

374
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:01,340
Get up, you punk!

375
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,908
A jerk like you should be sent to the National Security Agency...

376
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,340
or a mental hospital.

377
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,678
Anyway, I'll send you to either of those places.

378
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,679
That one.

379
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,590
Can I take a look at that?

380
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,609
(Tempus fugit amor Manet)

381
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,580
Then...

382
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,590
Are you really...

383
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,490
my grandson?

384
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:56,429
Yes.

385
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,100
Dong Sik.

386
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,638
What are you doing, Chairman Yoon?

387
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:06,340
Are you going to believe that ridiculous story?

388
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,939
Well...

389
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,310
I know that sounds absurd.

390
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,219
But that's the watch I bought at the jeweller’s yesterday.

391
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:19,949
He said he managed to get this one watch from overseas.

392
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,889
I spent good money on it to give it to my future grandson.

393
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,659
Besides, that's my handwriting.

394
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,659
Even the engraving on the back is exactly the same.

395
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:31,830
How could I not recognize my own handwriting?

396
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,469
Where is the watch?

397
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,310
Didn't he steal the watch?

398
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,409
I received it this morning.

399
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,409
You arrested him last night.

400
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,580
I'm just as confused as you,

401
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,919
but he says he's my grandson.

402
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:58,659
Weirdly,

403
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,389
I feel close to him for some reason.

404
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:13,939
No.

405
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,909
No way, Chairman Yoon.

406
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,040
This is nonsense.

407
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,480
He needs to be thrown back in the cell right now.

408
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:49,270
Soon Ae.

409
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,609
Soon Ae.

410
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,580
Soon Ae, can you recognize me?

411
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,689
It's me, Yoon Young. Soon Ae.

412
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,330
Soon Ae.

413
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,300
Thank you.

414
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,639
Yoon Young.

415
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,469
Gosh. Soon Ae.

416
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,480
- Gosh. - Mom.

417
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,580
Are you okay?

418
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,208
I'm sorry.

419
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,980
Why are you apologizing?

420
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,719
It's okay. I'm glad that you're awake now.

421
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,149
It's okay.

422
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,590
- It's all right. - It's okay, my baby.

423
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
Mom.

424
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,379
Soon Ae.

425
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,179
Did you see the culprit's face?

426
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,129
No.

427
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,070
Yoon Hae Jun, the teacher who lives across from you.

428
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:21,899
It was him, right?

429
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,510
What are you talking about?

430
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,439
What do you mean he's the culprit?

431
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,350
That's absurd.

432
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,619
What...

433
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:30,670
Thank you for coming back in one piece.

434
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,080
Sorry.

435
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,949
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:09,509
Do you think...

437
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,679
we looked like two relatives sharing a hug?

438
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:18,380
Right. They might not think that way.

439
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:24,860
It's okay.

440
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,029
I've already told them everything.

441
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,299
But you knew I was at home?

442
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,270
Right.

443
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,009
Soon Ae woke up.

444
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:46,350
And she told everything to the detectives.

445
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,480
What happened that night,

446
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,150
and who saved her.

447
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,219
Mr. Yoon...

448
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,230
came to help me.

449
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:03,429
Let's go.

450
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,130
Gosh.

451
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,639
Yes. I got it.

452
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,440
What? Well,

453
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,110
no.

454
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,509
I didn't find anything suspicious.

455
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,719
Yes. Okay.

456
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,719
Thank you, Dong Sik.

457
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,119
It's not because I believe him.

458
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:32,420
You begged me not to say anything. That's why.

459
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,459
But I need more than this to believe him.

460
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,830
I need something more definitive.

461
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,769
This TV show reunites people with their families from North Korea.

462
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,799
You've seen that, right?

463
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,839
I hear that this is used to find separated families.

464
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,339
Didn't it hurt?

465
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:50,509
They just drew my blood.

466
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:52,710
But I'm not sure how the results will come out.

467
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,710
You'd better be certain.

468
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:57,278
If the results don't match, I'll send you...

469
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,420
to a mental hospital at the Agency for National Security Planning.

470
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,619
Okay.

471
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,388
I cut you loose because Chairman Yoon vouched for you,

472
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,718
not because I believed you.

473
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,460
I don't believe any of this silly nonsense.

474
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,229
I'll be watching you until the results come out.

475
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,330
Don't even think about doing anything funny. Stay home.

476
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:15,630
Don't even go to school.

477
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,540
I'll be checking up on you around the clock. Got it?

478
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,480
Well...

479
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,920
Gosh. No. Well,

480
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,850
whom did Hee Sub marry?

481
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:41,060
Oh, that. My mother is Lee Soon Ae.

482
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:43,429
Lee Soon Ae.

483
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,630
Hyung Man from the general store...

484
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,540
Gosh. I see.

485
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,310
Then...

486
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,150
did you know about me from the start?

487
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:03,650
I only found out about you after coming here.

488
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,219
I had no idea that my father had a relative.

489
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,920
Why is that?

490
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,159
How could you not have known about me?

491
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,330
I don't think you stayed in touch with him.

492
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,230
He never told me about you either.

493
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,940
Let's go.

494
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,850
That brat.

495
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,388
He said he didn't believe any of this.

496
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:49,758
He seems pretty upset. Doesn't he?

497
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:50,860
Right.

498
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:56,000
So you really didn't get hurt. Right?

499
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,739
You're not hiding it from me because I can't see it. Right?

500
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,509
He wasn't rough.

501
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:09,150
I was really scared...

502
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,449
that something might happen to you and you might be in danger.

503
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,230
I bet I was more scared than you...

504
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,299
in case you ended up in trouble because of me.

505
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,040
In case I had messed up everything.

506
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,580
Well, I think it's gotten a bit messy already.

507
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,420
I will catch the culprit no matter what.

508
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,860
I'll catch the culprit and make him pay for everything he did.

509
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,159
We're really close now.

510
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,429
We have a witness who knows the culprit. And the police...

511
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:02,969
At least, one police officer is on our side.

512
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,880
On our side?

513
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,580
That might be a bit of a stretch.

514
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,860
He's surveilling us for now, but he will help us soon enough.

515
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,690
He has already started to believe us. And we will soon be able...

516
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,830
to win him over completely.

517
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,159
How?

518
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,429
No one can beat...

519
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,369
people from the future.

520
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:44,480
Hey.

521
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,449
- How much is it? - Here.

522
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,690
Why are you reading the newspaper?

523
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,790
Today is June 7.

524
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,658
Was the article...

525
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:03,860
about building the new expressways on the front page?

526
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,798
From Daejeon to Jingo.

527
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,440
From Cheongju to Sangju.

528
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,868
From Cheonan to Nonsan. I think those were the routes.

529
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:15,339
("Expected to Build 3 Expressways")

530
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,150
You're here to keep an eye on me, right?

531
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,548
The catcher is Kim Dong Ki.

532
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:24,178
He starts running to first base.

533
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,379
He's going for it.

534
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,089
- How suffocating. - Safe.

535
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,589
I can't even go out.

536
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,629
All right. The ball flies high into the outfield.

537
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,529
I already know the result.

538
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,130
So baseball games aren't fun to watch.

539
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,369
Pintos, 5. Lions, 4.

540
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,239
Pintos will win.

541
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,779
The game is over.

542
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,549
(Pintos: 5, Lions: 4)

543
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,428
He's offering it to his opponent.

544
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:10,658
All right. Given what happened last year,

545
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:13,198
this will be interesting to watch.

546
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,428
Counting all the matches,

547
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:17,639
- this is the fifth one. - Right.

548
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,639
The guy with the red belt will come from behind and win with 3 to 2.

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,770
Why don't you just trust us?

550
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,569
We don't have much time.

551
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,110
At this hour,

552
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:02,779
the culprit who has already killed three people is roaming about.

553
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,770
I'm someone who isn't supposed to be here.

554
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,770
Even if we catch the culprit,

555
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:31,739
there's nothing much I can do from that.

556
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,409
You're the one who has to wrap it up as a detective.

557
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,420
I'll share all the information I have,

558
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,150
and from now on,

559
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,060
how about we work together?

(Serial Killer Ko Sentenced to Life)

(Record of Statement)

562
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,670
Ko Mi Sook lied about it?

563
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,969
Instead of reporting the real culprit,

564
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,179
she thought of blaming it on her own brother.

565
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:10,819
I knew she was somewhat off,

566
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,880
but how could she sell off her own family?

567
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,860
Well, I guess I'm in no position to point that out.

568
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,060
You only wanted to do your best to catch them.

569
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,259
You even thought that...

570
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,169
a family member had to receive the punishment...

571
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,239
if they deserved it.

572
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,869
While Baek Hee Sub and Yu Sub were in the hospital,

573
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:37,839
you went to see them. I know that you did.

574
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:41,449
Excuse me.

575
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,250
Hello.

576
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,250
Here it is.

577
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:50,589
Things would've been bad if they had been as they were.

578
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:54,029
Hee Sub would've blamed himself and the world...

579
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:57,659
for what happened to himself and to his brother.

580
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,600
And you'd have lived all your life in guilt.

581
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,170
Perhaps solving this case...

582
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,139
could be a chance to change your life.

583
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,440
And that's the same case for me.

584
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,819
Gosh.

585
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,460
So you're saying...

586
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,330
that you're willing to work with me?

587
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:40,310
I'll be able to tell if you're a lunatic or not.

588
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,210
Now that I've talked with him a lot, I feel like a lunatic.

589
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,610
Well, then...

590
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,420
Shall we meet Ko Mi Sook first?

591
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,389
That punk. He's being helpful since he's the father.

592
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,130
"Father?" But you never know.

593
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,770
Is that you, Dong Sik?

594
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,569
- What's going on at this hour? - Hey, Dong Sik.

595
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,279
Can I take Mr. Yoon for a moment?

596
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:21,179
Well, that's...

597
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,650
- I ask this of you, Dong Sik. - Well...

(Night Cart Bar)

599
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,290
I was told I could never leave.

600
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,000
Under the condition that I'll be right next to you.

601
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,299
You know how credible I am.

602
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:46,839
I mean, your grandfather.

603
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,210
Why are you so startled?

604
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,409
I'm the one who should be awkward.

605
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:57,350
You must be used to it.

606
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,350
When I call you Hae Jun,

607
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:02,350
you should say, "Yes, Grandpa."

608
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:06,790
My gosh.

609
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,060
This feels...

610
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:11,199
a little weird.

611
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,829
Now that we're at it, why don't we try calling each other...

612
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,869
- Have a drink. - Sure.

613
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,489
I've always wanted...

614
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,460
to have soju with my grandson.

615
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,158
The result isn't out yet, but you've already accepted it.

616
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,330
The results are for others.

617
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,130
Why wouldn't I recognize my own grandson?

618
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,630
When it suits you so well.

619
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,880
Let me see it.

620
00:47:58,909 --> 00:47:59,940
Go on.

621
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,319
Here, I wrote...

622
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,759
the quote for you myself.

623
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,100
"Tempus fugit amor Manet."

624
00:48:19,759 --> 00:48:21,069
Do you know what it means?

625
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,540
Time flies, but love remains.

626
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:29,639
You know it well. I knew it.

627
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,279
Why did you write it, though? It's corny.

628
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,580
Was it?

629
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,850
I mean...

630
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:46,989
I thought it'd be nice to see it when things got tough.

631
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:51,900
"My grandpa used to adore me."

632
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,869
"He couldn't wait to meet me even before my birth..."

633
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:59,569
"and got this for me."

634
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,449
As time passes...

635
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,049
and I leave this world for good,

636
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,889
my love for my children will last for hundreds of years,

637
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:22,659
being their support. That's what I hoped for.

638
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:39,239
By the way, who is Yeon Woo's partner?

639
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,649
Then are you saying Chung Ah of Bong Bong Teahouse...

640
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,089
is your mother and my daughter-in-law?

641
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,219
Really?

642
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:53,118
Yes, I'm serious, so start walking properly.

643
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,190
Walk properly.

644
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,988
Hey! Wait. It's here.

645
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,758
That's where your mother is.

646
00:49:58,759 --> 00:49:59,860
Please.

647
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:03,029
Hey. Let's go up there.

648
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:05,839
Let's just go up there.

649
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,409
Let's see what your mother is up to.

650
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,678
Let's go take a little peek.

651
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,008
Come on. Why would we peek?

652
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,678
Just walk properly and head home.

653
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,880
Come on. Let's go in there.

654
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,520
- Walk properly, will you? - We should've gone there.

655
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:26,389
It's easy for you to call yourself a grandpa, isn't it?

656
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,489
You darn grandpa.

657
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,560
Goodness.

658
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,199
Stop drinking so much, will you?

659
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:39,069
You'll suffer from high blood pressure later.

660
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,110
Gosh.

661
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:55,549
So I was his darn grandpa.

662
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,589
My precious grandson...

663
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,630

00:52:28,509 --> 00:52:29,779
of Bong Bong Teahouse.

670
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:33,080
That's total nonsense.

671
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:34,750
I'm serious.

672
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,149
I know you told me not to talk to you...

673
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,920
or recommend any menus,

674
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,190
but I can't give in since you're our 20,000th customer.

675
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,060
Take a seat. I'll make you ssanghwa tea.

676
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,589
Why are you sitting?

How is your name Hae Jun out of the many names out there?

681
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,250
Did your boyfriend tell you my name?

682
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,049
The other day...

683
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,790
in front of the cinema, why did you look at me like that?

684
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:48,529
How did I look at you?

685
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:52,960
And after that, why did you ignore me for a while?

686
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,170
Are you interrogating me right now?

687
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,670
It's nothing like that.

688
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,278
It looks like I won't be sipping on this anymore,

689
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:10,150
even though it's good for me.

690
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,650
This is my tenth ssanghwa tea.

Since this will be my last.

693
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,290
You're my last customer.

00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:33,839
I'm going to close down this teahouse.

696

700
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,699
Does he know?

701
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,170
Of course not.

702
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:06,400
I'm only letting you know.

703
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,110
Why me?

704
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:09,969
I don't know.

705
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,409
It must've been your destiny to hear it.

706
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,109
Isn't that why you came at just the right time?

707
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,119
I was feeling the urge to spill my secret.

708
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,049
Why are you leaving?

709
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,589
If you wanted to know that,

710
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,460
you should've made an effort to get to know me a lot sooner.

711
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,500
It's too late now.

712
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,230
I should get ready now.

(Bong Bong Teahouse)

714
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:55,920
Why is she already leaving?

715
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:12,500
What? When did you get here?

716
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,869
Well, just now.

717
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,139
It's gotten pretty late.

718
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:24,679
Is that so? I was so focused that I lost track of time again.

719
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,790
Especially because someone forgot to make me toast again.

720
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,920
Right. Sorry. You didn't get to eat dinner, right?

721
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:35,028
It's fine.

722
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:37,060
My brain stops working when my stomach feels heavy.

723
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,869
You went through a lot today.

724
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:46,739
They mistook you for a criminal.

725
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:49,440
I heard you saved someone.

726
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:52,440
You were a good person.

727
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,679
I didn't even know that and I...

728
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:00,449
Gosh, I should just go meet my girlfriend.

729
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,988
You're going to see your girlfriend right now?

730
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:07,459
Yes. Lately, I've always been here,

731
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,290
so I haven't been able to see her that often.

732
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:12,060
I think she's a little upset because of that.

733
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:14,900
I should go and score some brownie points.

734
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,830
I can do that, right? I'll have the toast next time.

735

(Funeral Home)

736
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,218
Did you get to see your girlfriend yesterday?

737
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,659
Yes, we had a nice date in a while.

738
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,119
Is that so?

739
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,690
Did anything else happen?

740
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:19,330
Everything was the same as usual. Why?

741
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,830
Should something have happened?

742
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:24,069
No, I was just asking.

743
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,639
What the... What was that?

744
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:32,880
- Here. - Thanks.

745
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,719
Gosh, that's a lot.

746
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,920
I know, right? Why did they bring so much stuff?

747
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,118
I'm totally fine.

748
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,389
It's their way of comforting you...

749
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:49,029
and telling you to shake it off and get back on your feet.

750
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,929
Are you feeling okay?

751
00:59:25,259 --> 00:59:26,330
Yes.

752
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:29,900
Right.

753
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:33,699
I heard you had to go through trouble because of me.

754
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,710
I'm sorry that I couldn't find the culprit sooner.

755
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:40,779
No, you don't have to be.

756
00:59:41,509 --> 00:59:43,349
If it hadn't been for you,

757
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,219
I would've been caught by the criminal.

758
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:48,789
In the dark and scary woods,

759
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,790
when I saw your face,

760
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,659
I thought, "It's okay now,"

761
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:56,730
and felt so relieved.

762
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,469
How did you get released?

763
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,679
It just happened.

764
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:23,190
You must've had a lot of visitors.

765
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,989
Yes, a lot of people from the village stopped by.

766
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,959
And you know how our homeroom teacher is, don't you?

767
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,359
He came every night with a bunch of students.

768
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,299
They were so loud.

769
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:38,739
I didn't get any quiet rest. It was just hectic.

770
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,839
How long was this here?

772
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,790
(I'm glad you regained consciousness. I'll see you again.)

773
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,480
The culprit was here.

774
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:40,719
Possibly to completely get rid of his failed attempt.

775
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:27,600
(I'm glad you regained consciousness. I'll see you again.)
