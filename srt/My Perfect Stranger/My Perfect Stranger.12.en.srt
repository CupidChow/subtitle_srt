You remember them, right?

6
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,349
These 2 female victims died on May 14...

7
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,749
and May 16, 1987, respectively.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,550
And a woman went missing on May 20 and remains missing to this day.

9
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,389
This was the list of prime suspects the police had back then.

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,459
The first suspect, Baek Hee Sub.

11
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,359
The second suspect, Yoo Bum Ryong.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,059
The 3rd suspect, who served 30 years...

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,069
after being convicted,

14
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,539

(Bong Bong Teahouse)

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,380
He wouldn't have been able to tie anyone up with those fingers.

17
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,519
You probably can't tie any strings for the time being.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,719
Both victims were tied up with red strings...

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
when they were found.

20
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,519
Yoo Bum Ryong wasn't afraid of being accused of the murder.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,788
I heard she was a commie.

22
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,228
They might arrest me for not reporting her...

23
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,530
That's what you're afraid of?

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,429
Baek Hee Sub wasn't trying to cover up the murder.

25
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm trying to catch college students who are worse than murderers.

26
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,209
You have to come with us now.

27
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,780

What are you talking about?

35
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,460
I'm wondering who you wanted me to be...

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,660
when you came to my house.

37
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,999
If you really wanted to know who I was,

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,460
you should have gone to the police.

39
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,630
"I found this matchbox in his house."

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,739
"And there was..."

41
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,139
"an item that seemed even more suspicious."

42
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,310
"He's a very suspicious man."

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,410
You would have asked the police to find out who I was.

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,710
You had plenty of chances to do that.

45
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,150
But you came to me in the end...

46
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,549
because you couldn't go to the police.

47
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,519
Am I wrong?

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,759
- Hey, hurry! - Hurry up!

49
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,000
Hurry up. Let's go!

50
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,930
- Where? - There you are.

51
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,340
- Hey. - You punk.

52
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,669
- We finally caught this jerk. - Gosh.

53
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,280
- Hey, what's happening? - Step back, please.

54
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,789
What are you doing?

55
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,100
I found it.

56
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,669
I found one too.

(Bong Bong Teahouse)

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,810
Because you think I'm not him.

59
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,079
Because you don't want me to be him.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,519
That's what you think.

61
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,660
Only then would you be able to get an answer to your question.

62
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,760
That's why you came to me.

63
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,460
Not the police.

64
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,700
If you need me to answer that, my answer is no.

65
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,809
I can't explain everything right now.

66
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,879
But I didn't do anything you're suspecting me of.

67
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,749
I don't trust you.

68
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:45,320
Is that so?

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,919
There's nothing I can do.

70
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,859
But...

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,460
if you cover this up,

72
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,330
you'll have a chance to keep fixing this car.

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,070
Why does that matter right now?

74
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,299
When you do,

75
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,070
you'll be able to find the answer on your own...

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,780
and find out who I am.

77
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,979
And what this all means.

78
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,840
What's wrong? Did something happen?

79
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,049
What did you two talk about?

80
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,489
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

81
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:31,059
It's my fault.

82
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,400
I should have been more careful letting him into the house.

83
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,369
Don't worry.

84
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,510
He returned it to me.

85
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,510
So he doesn't want to tell anyone yet.

86
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,619
It's not for my sake. It's probably because of that car.

87
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,090
Are you all right?

88
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,200
Do you want to go out for a walk?

89
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,640
I know that we don't have a lot of time.

90
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,739
But still.

91
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,439
We at least have some time to get some fresh air.

92
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,320
Meeting your family...

93
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,689
Not just any family.

94
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Facing a family member whose face you didn't even know.

95
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,429
That can't be easy.

96
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,340
I have not been traveling through time as long as you have.

97
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:33,309
But I have a bit more experience dealing with family here.

98
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,190
It's more frightening than you think,

99
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,560
and it keeps testing you. I know all about that.

100
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,670
Meeting your mom here is one thing.

101
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,440
And you have to keep...

102
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,909
facing your father.

103
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,269
So all sorts of things happen.

104
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,409
I'm sure there's a lot going on in your mind right now.

105
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:19,690
But as for the matchbox,

106
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,159
I'm relieved it was your father who found it, not anyone else...

107
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,268
because I don't think...

108
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,600
he just let that go because of the car.

109
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:34,440
He couldn't probably explain it. But he must have gotten...

110
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,279
this feeling that made him want to trust you.

111
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,580
I'm sure of it.

112
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm not sure.

113
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,389
The principal really adores you too.

114
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:48,720
He's drawn to you.

115
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,190
For some reason, he can sense...

116
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,729
that you will be his grandson. Something like that.

117
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,029
I get that you want to comfort me.

118
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,739
But you keep missing the mark.

119
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:05,939
What?

120
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,080
You think he can sense that I'll be his grandson?

121
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,249
If that had been the case, he would have hated me.

122
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,790
He was the only family I lived with.

123
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:22,920
But he ignored me my entire life.

124
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,659
He treated me as if I were invisible.

125
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,159
How come?

126
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:31,999
I have no idea...

127
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,840
why he hated me so much.

128
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,609
But why was he your only family member?

129
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,279
Didn't you live with your father?

130
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,320
He must've been shocked after my mother left.

131
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,019
He went back to the States.

132
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,759
He continued his studies there and became a professor.

133
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,960
He lived there his whole life.

134
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,858
He came back to Korea to see me only during breaks,

135
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,659
so I only saw him about twice a year.

136
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,129
But even during those visits, he only stayed for a short while...

137
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,940
because he had some research to do.

138
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,509
He was a sweet man,

139
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,479
but I don't think he was affectionate enough...

140
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,550
that he'd want to trust me.

141
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,159
Did I share too much?

142
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,629
You must've been lonely.

143
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,470
During the times when you must've thought...

144
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,609
that no one loved you.

145
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,790
But you know,

146
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,070
I think of you fondly.

147
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,279
I think that's how I feel about you.

148
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,359
In the dream I had,

149
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,369
I went back to our time...

150
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,970
after getting the time machine fixed.

151
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:13,930
It was exactly as I had imagined.

152
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,629
"Marvel?"

153
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,269
How come your eyesight is so good?

154
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,930
They seemed happy.

155
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,800
But...

156
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,779
you weren't there.

157
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,580
I couldn't find you no matter how hard I looked.

158
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,220
You were not in that world.

159
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,420
You didn't exist.

160
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,889
You disappeared without a trace.

161
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:47,960
I kept looking for you in the dream, and then I'd wake up.

162
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
That's the nightmare I've been having.

163
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,970
I'd just think of it as a silly dream,

164
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,609
but it was so horrifying, scary, and sad...

165
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,080
that I didn't even want to mention it.

166
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,879
I mean the future without you.

167
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,659
What I want is a future where you're in it.

168
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,060
There,

169
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,930
I'd take you to my favorite restaurants,

170
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,269
walk on the paths that were newly paved,

171
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,639
and...

172
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:35,310
talk about silly things, not just scary ones.

173
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,979
I think that's what I want to do with you.

174
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,690
Is this also the wrong way to console you?

175
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:03,769
Should I...

176
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,840
just think of it as consolation?

177
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
No.

178
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,998
I thought I was the only one who came to...

179
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,040
want that kind of future.

180
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,840
So I was going to disregard it until the end.

181
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,070
We don't have much time,

182
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,550
but...

183
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,310
let's just think that it has paused.

184
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,079
There they are!

185
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,979
- They're here! - Over there!

186
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,450
(Reliable Woojung Police who are always with the people)

187
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,889
Get out!

188
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,429
Is he the real culprit?

189
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,729
- Please say a word! - Please move.

190
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,829
- That's enough. - Clear the way.

191
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,569
- Please move. - Do not push!

192
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,899
Is he the real culprit?

193
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:16,839
The police found the strings, and matchboxes...

194
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,899
were found at his place, right?

195
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,168
Why are you already drawing a conclusion?

196
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,510
He's only a suspect.

197
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:21,878
They said he was highly likely...

198
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:22,879
to be the real culprit. Right, Detective Jang?

199
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,780
And you arrested him yourself.

200
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,379
Well, that's true, but...

201
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,780
Just wait.

202
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,090
And stop writing rubbish articles that put our chief in a pickle.

203
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,618
Of course.

204
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,619
He'll now get promoted as planned.

205
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,490
He turned the crisis into an opportunity.

206
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,790
- All right, now. Clear the way! - Please make way!

207
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,959
- Please say a word! - Move!

208
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,230
Yes, that's right.

209
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,399
Yes. I think they're here.

210
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,438
- Yes, I'll wrap it up... - Take a seat.

211
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,639
- as soon as possible. - Sit down.

212
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,869
- Yes. - Sit here.

213
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,040
Min Soo.

214
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,149
So you were the culprit?

215
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:01,649
You punk.

216
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,580
Yes.

217
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,590
- That's right. - My goodness.

218
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,958
How much did he have to drink...

219
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,289
that he's confessing smoothly? He can't even get himself together.

220
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,800
He's confessing smoothly because he drank.

221
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,530
Mi Sook.

222
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,639
My sister. Where is she?

223
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,679
Hey, let him take a nap first.

224
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,449
Get his confession as soon as he comes around.

225
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,349
Let's wrap it up as quickly as we can.

226
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,378
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

227
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,449
You punk!

228
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,118
- Get it together, you punk. - Goodness.

229
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,489
I can finally go home now.

230
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,819
- Gosh. - Darn this punk.

231
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,230
- Captain. - Grab him, will you?

232
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,629
I have something to tell you.

233
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,569
We found matchboxes but not the notes.

234
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,369
He could've written them on the spot and put them in.

235
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,638
What matters here is that he kept empty matchboxes.

236
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,609
He prepared them in advance.

237
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,608
(The police will turn over a new leaf.)

238
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,580
I looked through the notebooks in Ko Min Soo's room.

239
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,019
His handwriting is completely different.

240
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,179
Are you the one examining it?

241
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,689
Besides, he wouldn't have written it like he normally does.

242
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,389
He'd have scribbled.

243
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,589
We definitely need to investigate it more.

244
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,689
Hey, Baek Dong Sik.

245
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,789
There's a witness,

246
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,260
so what's more to investigate?

247
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,129
Besides, who would be foolish like you to turn their family in?

248
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,540
We have a credible witness and evidence.

249
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,909
It's a done deal.

250
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,878
Gosh, I thought you were quite talented,

251
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,250
but ever since I beat you to it,

252
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,310
you keep barking up the wrong tree.

253
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,080
Gosh.

254
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,439
I won't disappear.

255
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,369
Let's catch the culprit,

256
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,179
make sure your mother and I are still alive in the future,

257
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
and return together.

258
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,689
And let's have fun together...

259
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,119
for a long time.

260
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,830
Grandpa!

261
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:30,699
Goodness.

262
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:33,199
- I wasn't sure because it was dark. - Goodness.

263
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:34,699
"Grandpa?"

264
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,699
Did you just call me that?

265
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,909
Grandpa called earlier.

266
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,080
Oh, right. We should go inside and call him back.

267
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,619
We'll head inside then.

268
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,649
Hold on.

269
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,990
Well... Mr. Yoon.

270
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,060
About our Soon Ae...

271
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,770
I heard she became a novelist.

272
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,770
It's something incredible, right?

273
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,109
Of course, it is.

274
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,469
It's a big achievement.

275
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,080
Right.

276
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,280
It's great news,

277
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,350
but I can't really tell anyone.

278
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm scared that people will find fault with me,

279
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,350
saying I can't be so happy about it after losing my first daughter.

280
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:30,189
But congratulations are in order, so you should celebrate it.

281
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,659
Congratulations. You must be so proud.

282
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,260
Thank you.

283
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,770
My second daughter wants to study more.

284
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,069
Maybe I should help her with that.

285
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,070
Yes!

286
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,609
Please.

287
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,050
We're going to go.

288
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:57,449
Okay. Have a good night.

289
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,929
Gosh.

(The Prime Suspect of a Serial Murder Case Arrested)

292
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:34,090
Ko Min Soo...

293
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:41,629
He must be under arrest by now.

294
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,699
If he was already caught,

295
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,800
it'd be hard to take him out now.

296
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:49,300
The police...

297
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
wouldn't let him go easily.

298
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:56,310
The witness who reported him is his family.

299
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,449
Who would doubt her?

300
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,750
They would release him...

301
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,850
only when they found a real culprit or hard evidence.

302
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:12,928
Min Soo got badly injured only a few hours...

303
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,159
before the murder.

304
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,829
- He had been perfectly gone... - Goodness.

305
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,759
- since then... - I broke my arm.

306
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,929
and reemerged completely cured.

307
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,369
- It hurts. - I don't think...

308
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Mi Sook planned it all.

309
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,679
If all of that was in her plan,

310
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:42,219
that means it was all her...

311
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,429
who hid Min Soo's condition from others...

312
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,959
right after the murder.

313
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,270
It must've been a busy night...

314
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,669
for Mi Sook.

315
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,369
It'd be nice...

316
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:02,510
if a real witness came forward, not a fake one.

317
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,109
Kim Hae Kyung.

318
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,750
She seems quite afraid.

319
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,019
If Mi Sook's novel was true,

320
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,590
she did witness something in person.

321
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,830
But we don't know how she will act differently now.

322
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,800
She might've been doubtful so far,

323
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:26,300
but she saw Min Soo arrested for real now.

(The Prime Suspect of a Serial Murder Case Arrested)

325
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,750
You all saw it by the riverside, right?

326
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,350
The red string tied around the wrist.

327
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:46,290
That was found in the room of Mi Sook's brother.

328
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,060
The newspaper said someone saw it in person too.

329
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,359
The killings.

330
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,659
- My gosh. - I feel bad for Mi Sook too.

331
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,429
She said it was horrible and terrifying as well.

332
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,368
It turns out it was all her brother.

333
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:04,340
Hey, honestly, Soon Ae is the one to be pitied, not Mi Sook.

334
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,968
She even stole Soon Ae's novel.

335
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:09,439
And her brother killed her sister.

336
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,049
Still, I feel sorry for Mi Sook.

337
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,350
Why do you feel bad for her?

338
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,600
Gosh!

339
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,600
I didn't say anything. I'm just here to get some fresh air.

340
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,209
You came to my mom's restaurant and sat down there for no reason.

341
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,780
I did tell you I didn't know anything.

342
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,080
What do you keep bothering me for?

343
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,409
Okay. I won't ask you anything.

344
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:50,280
I'm not trying to bother you.

345
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,490
Well,

346
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,589
if you're afraid of the police, just come to me.

347
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,719
You can tell me anything.

348
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,399
Oh, dear.

349
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,219
Don't talk to me.

350
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,090
I told you we were not friends.

351
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,830
You...

352
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,899
go out with Soon Ae, right?

353
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,569
Goodness.

354
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,800
No.

355
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,869
I'm not complaining.

356
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,409
Will you give it to her for me?

357
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,750
It's Soon Ae's.

358
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,119
I got it from Mr. Yoon to hand it to her myself.

359
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,159
But...

360
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,530
I think she would hate seeing me.

361
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,939
I feel like such a terrible person.

362
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,929
You can change...

363
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:42,290
from now at least.

364
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,000
If you don't want to be more terrible,

365
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,929
think of it as the last opportunity.

366
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:04,250
Opportunity?

367
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,990
You don't have to walk me home, really.

368
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:49,129
You even skipped class for me.

369
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,000
When I was discharged,

370
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,830
the doctor told me to walk around a lot.

371
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,439
I'd be bored if I did it alone, anyway.

372
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:00,740
You're going home, right?

373
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,780
Yes.

374
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:18,020
Then let's take a walk around the neighborhood and go home.

375
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,609
Did Soon Ae...

376
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,649
leave early?

377
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,820
Yes.

378
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,550
Is she suffering that much?

379
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,719
Well, her sister died.

380
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,189
The least her family wanted...

381
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:54,959
must have been to catch the culprit...

382
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,499
and make them pay...

383
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,800
for what they did, right?

384
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,868
And it came true. What's wrong?

385
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:06,139
Hey, she must still feel uneasy.

386
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:08,639
You're so clueless.

387
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,459
Shall we take another walk before we leave?

388
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,300
I skipped school, anyway,

389
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,369
so why don't I make the most of it?

390
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,770
How about the roller skating rink?

391
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,109
No, thanks.

392
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:22,310
What about the arcade, then?

393
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:23,849
Do you know Whack-A-Mole?

394
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,449
The moles look so adorable that it breaks your heart a little.

395
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,790
But you'll feel better once you whack some moles.

396
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:32,520
It's okay.

397
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,530
Then...

398
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:43,300
should I just give you a hug?

399
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,340
I can't believe her.

400
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,909
- I'm going to... - I just want to go home today.

401
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,439
My mom is alone.

402
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,149
I'll go inside now.

403
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,699
When I heard the news about Ko Min Soo's arrest,

404
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,500
my mom kept washing the dishes without saying a word.

405
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,968
She took out all the plates we had...

406
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,139
and kept washing them until I came out of the room.

407
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,980
I'm pretty sure...

408
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:30,480
she's brought out a pile of dirty laundry to wash by now.

409
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:34,990
And she's probably cleaning my room and my brother's room.

410
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,060
My mom cleans when she's distressed.

411
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,730
When I think about her,

412
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,530
I get worried and scared.

413
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,010
Fine. Give me a hug then.

414
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,389
Mom.

415
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,959
Mom?

416
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:21,030
Mom.

417
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,240
Gosh.

418
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:32,510
I took such a long nap.

419
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,609
I'm getting hungry. You know?

420
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,619
Do you want me to cook tteokbokki? It's your favorite.

421
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,790
Right. The publishing house sent you something.

422
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:43,760
They said it was an advance copy or something.

423
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,858
They said it was your book,

424
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,230
so I got curious and skimmed through a bit. Okay?

425
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,639
("Small Door" by Lee Soon Ae)

426
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,139
Your sister would be happy.

427
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,409
- Dad. - Yes.

428
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,540
- About Mr. Yoon... - Yes. What about him?

429
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,150
He's not from our village.

430
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,480
What kind of person is he?

431
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:53,429
Oh, him. He's odd.

432
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,830
In what ways?

433
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,830
So...

434
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,569
he keeps saving people.

435
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
What?

436
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:08,440
Listen. I'll tell you about the first day I met him.

437
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,609
A few of the students from my school sniffed superglue.

438
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,949
It was a pretty big incident.

439
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,009
One of them almost threw herself off the cliff.

440
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,049
Gosh. She could really have died that day.

441
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:21,089
But he quickly threw himself toward her and saved her.

442
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,759
It was really cool.

443
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,690
And one day, there was a fire in the village.

444
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:31,460
Gosh. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

445
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,129
Right. You know Dong Sik, right?

446
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,730
His kids were in that house that caught fire.

447
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:40,009
Then Mr. Yoon went in there and saved his son like before.

448
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,339
Gosh. People said he was really cool.

449
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:45,810
That's not all.

450
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,049
He springs up all over our village, saves people, and goes away.

451
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,289
Think about it. It's not every day you get to save that many people...

452
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,219
in your lifetime.

453
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,428
You rarely find yourself in situations...

454
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:02,759
where you need to save people, to begin with.

455
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:04,259
Don't you agree?

456
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:07,000
So are you saying he's odd or cool?

457
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,139
He's oddly cool.

458
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,250
What could it be?

459
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,819
We shouldn't expect any help from Kim Hae Kyung.

460
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:35,289
We can't force her to tell us the truth.

461
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,699
We must find another way.

462
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,199
Sir.

463
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,239
Mr. Yoon.

464
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:48,639
Hey.

465
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,299
I really...

466
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,339
wasn't going to tell anyone.

467
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:22,069
I know.

468
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,350
Because she asked me to keep it a secret...

469
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,489
and I wanted to protect her.

470
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,319
Is that so?

471
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:39,589
Darn it.

472
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:43,130
But I don't know what the right thing to do is now.

473
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:53,369
It was me.

474
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:57,610
That night,

475
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,850
I brought Ko Mi Sook to Ko Min Soo.

476
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,020
Is anyone there? Hey!

477
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,130
Down here!

478
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:17,159
I need help down here!

479
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:20,730
Please.

480
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,239
You're Mi Sook's friend.

481
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:29,210
Can you call her, please?

482
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:32,940
Tell her that I'm hurt!

483
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:35,080
I can't even walk.

484
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,520
Ask her to come and get me.

485
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:40,449
Please!

486
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:45,420
That crazy jerk. I should just kill him or something.

487
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,290
Just don't come out here.

488
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,830
I called you just in case.

489
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:53,630
You can just say that I never called you.

490
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,500
- Say that you didn't know. - Forget it.

491
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,400
I'll be there. Wait.

492
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,819
If my mom ever finds out,

493
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:13,020
she'll hate me for it.

494
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,730
I'm sick and tired of looking after that jerk.

495
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,830
Should I beat him up for you?

496
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,169
What?

497
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,440
He's lying down there. He can't even walk.

498
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,040
Should I go and beat him up to a pulp?

499
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,000
Be quiet.

500
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,469
Don't even breathe.

501
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,460
No. We must call the police.

502
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:28,690
We must call the police, Mi Sook.

503
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,960
I said, no.

504
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,699
This is a huge chance.

505
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,409
Come to your senses!

506
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:42,610
This isn't right.

507
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,839
A woman is dead.

508
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,009
She's already dead.

509
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:51,020
If we call the police now, do you think we can bring her back?

510
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,020
But still.

511
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,190
They should catch the culprit.

512
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,319
Catch who?

513
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:02,029
Did you see the culprit's face?

514
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,929
You didn't.

515
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,230
Then did you?

516
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,339
Did you see who it was?

517
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,040
Mi Sook.

518
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,319
Look.

519
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,719
My brother...

520
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,029
That scumbag, Ko Min Soo, did this to me.

521
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,130
So that no one could see or notice it,

522
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,330
he only hit the parts that clouldn't be seen.

523
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:20,770
Hae Kyung, I'm so scared that someone might see it.

524
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:29,880
That people might find out how pathetic my family is.

525
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,690
And how trivial I am...

526
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,249
to them.

527
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,259
I'm so afraid that people might find out.

528
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,929
Hae Kyung.

529
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:48,730
Please help me.

530
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:53,100
I can be done with Ko Min Soo with this.

531
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,710
I'm confident that I can end it.

532
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,739
Still, this isn't right.

533
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:02,909
The real culprit might be caught.

534
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:06,020
What will you do if they get caught?

535
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,130
That jerk won't be caught.

536
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,569
The culprit won't get caught, Hae Kyung.

537
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,799
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

538
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:24,159
What did Hae Kyung have to say?

539
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,529
What's wrong?

540
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,369
It wasn't Ko Mi Sook.

541
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,339
Ko Mi Sook wasn't the culprit...

542
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,610
but a witness.

543
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,380
An actual witness.

544
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,750
She wrote what she witnessed in the novel.

545
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:48,389
The culprit is a man,

546
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:52,489
and the only person who saw his face is Ko Mi Sook.

547
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:16,409
Hello.

548
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,250
Mr. Yoon.

549
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,119
Yoo Bum Ryong?

550
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,860
Why are you calling me?

551
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:29,029
Mr. Yoon.

552
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,230
Mr. Yoon, I'm so scared.

553
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,839
Speak clearly. What are you talking about?

554
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:44,339
About Soon Ae...

555
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,810
You see, Soon Ae...

556
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,449
Go on.

557
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,980
Hurry up.

558
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,790
I think something happened to Soon Ae.

559
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,560
What did you see?

560
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:06,759
When and where did you see it that you're spewing such nonsense?

561
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,039
Earlier, I left school early...

562
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,040
to go up the hill behind our village.

563
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:17,710
To return the ring to Ms. Lee Ju Young.

564
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,020
("Small Door")

565
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,960
No.

566
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,029
I heard they scattered Ms. Lee's ashes up there,

567
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,330
and I was on my way there.

568
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,069
I'll get going. Sorry.

569
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,069
I only walked past her. I'm telling you the truth.

570
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:51,279
But...

571
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:04,589
Soon Ae!

572
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,389
Soon Ae!

573
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,259
No matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find her.

574
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,830
Soon Ae!

575
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:19,239
I called Soon Ae's parents, and they said she wasn't home.

576
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,380
I even called the police,

577
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,779
but they said nothing would happen because the culprit had been caught.

578
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,350
They said she must've just gone out.

579
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:39,489
But Mr. Yoon,

580
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:42,360
I think...

581
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,529
Stop with all the nonsense, and stay where you are.

582
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,830
I'll go get you.

583
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,449
Your mother disappeared.

584
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,319
The last place she was seen...

585
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,719
was near the mountain where Lee Kyung Ae's ashes were scattered.

586
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,630
We must tell the police.

587
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,158
It'll be faster to go to Baek Hee Sub...

588
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:19,860
and go to Detective Baek Dong Sik with him.

589
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,270
Do you think you can do it?

590
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,679
I'm sure nothing happened.

591
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,659
("Small Door")

592
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,770
Baek Hee Sub.

593
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:37,940
Baek Hee Sub!

594
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,409
Baek Hee Sub!

595
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,750
- What's going on? - Soon Ae...

596
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,489
Soon Ae is...

597
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,799
Soon Ae!

598
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,339
Soon Ae.

599
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:45,509
Soon Ae!

600
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,580
(Woojung Police Station)

601
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:56,489
Hee Sub. What brings you here?

602
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,860
Help us, Uncle.

603
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,960
I think something has happened to Soon Ae.

604
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,060
Soon Ae.

605
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,469
Are you in here?

606
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,250
Soon Ae!

607
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:27,889
Are you okay?

608
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,690
You should get out of here.

609
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,290
Run.

610
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,819
Hurry up and run!

611
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,929
Darn you!

612
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,069
Lee Soon Ae, get up!

613
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:51,029
Soon Ae, it's me.

614
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,699
Mr. Yoon.

615
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,130
The criminal was chasing after me.

616
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,110
Soon Ae, do you think you can wait here?

617
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,790
Yes.

618
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,000
Soon Ae!

619
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:05,770
- Soon Ae. - Soon Ae.

620
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:08,610
Soon Ae.

621
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,239
It's okay. Everything's okay.

622
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:18,448
I thought the culprit was Ko Min Soo. What's going on?

623
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,850
Soon Ae, everything's okay.

624
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,790
Hey, you punk, come to your senses.

625
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,730
- Take them to the hospital. Hurry. - Okay.

626
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:31,000
- Let's go, guys. - Hurry.

627
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:32,600
One, two, three.

628
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,469
- I can carry her. - Okay.

629

630
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,650
(Under investigation, Do not enter)

631
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,489
Yoo Bum Ryong.

632
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,060
Bum Ryong.

633
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:18,239
Wake up, Bum Ryong. Come on. Yoo Bum Ryong!

634
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,319
But Mr. Yoon,

635
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,130
I...

636
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,799
I want to find her no matter what.

637
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:24,569
Please help me.

638
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:28,639
Earlier, when I saw her on the mountain,

639
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:31,810
Soon Ae looked at me,

640
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,179
and she had so much fear in her eyes.

641
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:43,020
I feel like I've become a horrible person.

642
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,589
Mr. Yoon.

643
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,330
Perhaps...

644
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:56,830
this could be an opportunity for me, right?

645
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,940
Don't move. Put your hands up.

646
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:49,520
Put your hands up and get down here, you punk!

649

(My Perfect Stranger)

651
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:33,719
Who is the culprit?

652
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,919
Why are you asking me?

653
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,218
Another person died.

654
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,088
A boy from your school, who was in your grade,

655
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:39,988
died in an abandoned house out of nowhere.

656
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,790
If not, Lee Soon Ae would've died.

657
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,330
Come out.

658
01:02:43,529 --> 01:02:45,658
Your ID, resume, and teaching certificate...

659
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:46,659
Everything's fake.

660
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,499
I dug into everything including your previous workplaces and addresses.

661
