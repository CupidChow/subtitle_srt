(Previously)

6
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,388
Your dear brother is asking for it.

7
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,990
Just give it to me and put an end to this.

8
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,590
Why are you talking back to me?

9
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,160
About my brother...

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,630
Do you think I'm happy about how he ended up,

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,269
or the opposite?

12
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,140
You're happy?

13
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:09,439
You know,

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,610
how one tests what triggers you.

15
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,169
What flaws you might have.

16
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:15,640
Or if you have any secret weapons she might find useful.

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,979
Until she finds out about all of them, she never attacks first.

18
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,550
I broke a bone. It hurts!

19
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:24,350
But once she figures it out,

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,059
it's the end.

21
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,360
Ko Min Soo was one of the suspects too, right?

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,429
He served time for over 30 years as the real culprit.

23
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,669
What decided his verdict was the witness.

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,770
She said she saw him murder the victim in person.

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,470
It was his sister, Ko Mi Sook.

00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,610
("Our Sweet Days of Youth")

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,149
Did you like the movie?

28
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:57,819
We should...

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,558
Oh, no. My corn went to waste. What am I going to do?

30
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,788
- Sir, are you all right? - That's not the problem.

31
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,459
- Look at your delicate body. - Yes.

32
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,160
Are you hurt?

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,198
Darn it.

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,229
Hey.

35
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:17,639
How dare you glare at him?

36
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,068
What?

37
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,179
She bumped into him. An apology is in order.

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,538
He was just standing there. You bumped into him.

39
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,310
Why are you glaring at him?

40
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,910
Can't you see his clothes are wet?

41
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,620
I didn't tell him to block the path.

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,978
A man must be able to move aside when a lady walks by.

43
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,049
How dare you talk about him like that? You don't even know him!

44
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,850
Apologize to him first and then go.

45
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:36,359
How dare you raise your voice at me, you wench?

46
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,689
Why are you making a fuss?

47
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,429
Who do you think you are? You little...

48
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,489
Hey, Jo Sam.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
What? Is that you, Yeon Woo?

50
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,400
Gosh. Hey.

51
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,000
I thought you were in the US. When did you come back?

52
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,009
Sang Sook, say hello to him.

53
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,439
His father owns the building...

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,079
Jo Sam, before that, you should apologize first.

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,539
What?

56
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,410
You yelled at her and called her a wench.

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,350
She's my girlfriend.

58
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,880
What?

59
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,419
I see.

60
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:08,889
I didn't know.

61
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,259
And he's also a good friend of mine.

62
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,859
His clothes are soaked.

63
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,769
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Sure.

65
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,470
I'm sorry. My bad.

66
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,609
Sir, I'm going to leave.

67
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,310
Okay. Bye.

68
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,079
Right?

69
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,310
- Have you been well? - Yes, of course.

70
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,180
How have you been?

71
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,889
You know, same old same old.

72
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,759
Your mother left the village the day she gave birth to you.

73
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,359
You were crying your eyes out,

74
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,060
but she left without even giving you a hug.

75
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,900
She considered you a mistake in her life,

76
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,810
so don't even be curious about her or think about her from now on.

(Jidong's Steamed Buns and Dumplings)

79
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,619
He was really odd.

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,759
(Jidong's Steamed Buns and Dumplings)

81
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,660
He just stood there and stared at me.

82
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,229
At first, I was wondering why he was staring at me.

83
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,499
Then all of a sudden, it got sad.

84
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:34,439
For some reason, it felt like something was weighing on me.

85
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,879
My heart kept pounding.

86
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,379
Are you telling me you're falling for another man?

87
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,179
I'm serious.

88
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,220
I guess there is something about him.

89
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,129
When I met him, something felt off with me too.

90
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,869
Or should I say it felt like that even before meeting him?

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,728
My father told me he wanted to introduce me to someone...

92
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:01,840
and told me his name.

93
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,070
His name is Hae Jun.

94
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,939
His name is Hae Jun?

95
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Remember?

96
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:14,309
The letter you sent me when I was in the US.

97
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,488
If we get married and have a child...

98
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:19,749
We should name him Hae Jun.

99
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,820
Is that why?

100
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,160
I strangely feel attached to him.

101
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,229
But he is odd.

102
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,249
No wonder. I never liked her from the start.

We can get acquainted now.

Gosh. Are you crazy?

110
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,570
Why did you pop the egg? Don't you know how to drink that?

111
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,038
Why does it matter to you how I drink my...

112
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,808
Wait. I'll make another one. Gosh.

113
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,039
It's fine. Wait. I said I was good.

114
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,650
I can't let you ruin the tea even before you drink it.

115
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,589
This is how you drink it. Okay?

116
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,048
- Open your mouth. - No, I'll do it myself.

117
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,118
It's okay. Just drink it. I already got it ready.

118
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,119
Make things easier for me.

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,519
- No. This is in no way easier... - Gosh. Drink it.

120
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,629
- No. - Oh, no.

121
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,700
Well, why did it fall...

122
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,749
I get the feeling that...

123
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,720
I will be coming here often.

124
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:29,950
Really?

125
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,119
So...

126
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,558
I don't want you to talk to me, touch me,

127
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,689
or interrupt me in the future.

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,059
I don't need your recommendations either.

129
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,369
Just treat me indifferently like some stranger.

130
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:48,939
Well, I don't know you anyway.

131
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,570
Okay. I'll try.

132
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,580

That's why she abandoned her own kid.

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,989
Lee Ju Young returned to the village...

185
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,889
because of Baek Yu Sub.

186
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,129
She wanted to leave with him.

187
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,869
She actually came to this village in the first place...

188
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,269
because of Baek Yu Sub.

189
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:19,670
I'm sure they were more than colleagues.

190
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,979
Then why didn't he leave with her?

191
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,779
Because a few days after that...

192
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,509
was the anniversary of his parents' deaths.

193
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
He didn't know when he'd be able to be back...

194
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,889
if he had to flee to avoid the police,

195
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,159
so he wanted to stay with his brother, Baek Hee Sub.

196
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,960
That's why he decided to hide in the village for a few days.

197
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,529
And the place they chose to hide...

198
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,529
was an abandoned house.

199
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,300
- It can't be... - It is.

200
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,379
The very abandoned house where Lee Kyung Ae was found.

201
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,450
On the day of the incident,

202
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,249
I think they tried to look for us.

203
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:06,019
Are you okay?

204
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,989
It looks like Lee Kyung Ae followed Baek Yu Sub...

205
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,529
on the day she disappeared.

206
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,249
What should we wear?

207
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,889
Anyway, the three of them became friends.

208
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,118
And Kyung Ae kept their secret.

209
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,290
I was wondering about the same thing.

210
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,259
After hearing about our story,

211
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,200
she wanted to help us in any way she could.

212
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,229
She asked us if we needed anything.

213
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:54,899
I think...

214
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,269
she was trying to bring that to us.

215
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,040
If only I didn't leave for Seoul...

216
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,609
If only we didn't miss each other,

217
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,920
I'd have been able to protect them both.

218
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,229
The biggest mystery for me...

219
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,029
was this sentence.

220
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,499
"Women who read are dangerous."

221
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,440
What on earth could this mean?

222
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,179
Why did the culprit have to choose this sentence...

223
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,109
and leave it to the victims?

224
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,059
Lee Ju Young had a book, though.

225
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,159
But...

226
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,460
it was just Lee Ju Young.

227
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,540
The culprit didn't leave this note with Lee Kyung Ae.

228
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,409
That's what I thought.

229
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,639
The reason Lee Kyung Ae went to the abandoned house that night.

230
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,149
Baek Yu Sub and Lee Ju Young.

231
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,320
The only item they said they needed.

232
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,920
What do you think that was?

233
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,220
It must've been a book.

234
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,200
That means...

235
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,710
all the victims had something in common.

236
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,269
They had books with them.

237
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,739
This could be some sort of warning.

238
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,779
But where do you think the book went?

239
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:49,550
Why wasn't it on the scene?

240
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,920
If the culprit was so mindful to write such a phrase,

241
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,790
they could've taken it.

242
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,330
Although, I'm not sure why.

243
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,579
Hae Jun. You see...

244
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,220
I know the condition we agreed to, but...

245
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,889
I know that I agreed to be in the garage only, but...

246
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,899
Why on earth are you so out of breath?

247
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,398
I'm dying here. Number two. I need to use the bathroom.

248
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,139
- Wait here. - No...

249
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,139
Yoon Young, we need to clear this up.

250
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,489
Where is it?

251
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,159
It happens sometimes.

252
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,800
I forgot that he had weak intestines.

253
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,740
This could work.

254
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,168
He works there all day,

255
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,540
so it'd be too mean if we didn't let our hero use the bathroom.

256
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,649
But why did it have to be a book?

257
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:07,149
"Women who read are dangerous."

258
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,359
And I happened to be an editor who read and published books.

259
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,730
Do you think this is all coincidental?

260
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,698
At the end of the day, my mother wanted to be a writer,

261
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,000
and Ko Mi Sook was an author too.

262
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,310
Perhaps all of this...

263
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,780
isn't just a coincidence. I keep having this thought.

264
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,719
What will you do for me?

265
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,389
What do you mean?

266
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:17,320
I mean, I'm paying for your tuition fee.

267
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,359
What will you do for me?

268
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:23,100
You stole Dad's stash for this.

269
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,530
But it's still legit money.

270
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:28,029
You little brat. I'll take it back.

271
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,668
Dad!

272
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,840
What do you want?

273
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,679
My name.

274
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,179
If you become a novelist,

275
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,050
could you mention my name...

276
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,119
somewhere in your book?

277
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,550
What is that?

278
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,918
What do you mean? It's something incredible.

279
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,059
You see, humans can live...

280
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,859
only up to 100 years, if they're lucky.

281
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,830
But books last forever.

282
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,939
So if you write my name in your book,

283
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,709
it'll tell people that there once was a girl named Lee Kyung Ae.

284
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,878
That's what lasts forever.

285
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,949
And you like that?

286
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,250
Why wouldn't I?

287
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,188
People will remember my name...

288
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:21,990
even after a thousand years. What's not to like?

289
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,830
I'll make sure to become someone really famous.

290
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:28,290
You're laughing?

291
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,070
Hey, Mr. Yoon also told me that I have what it takes.

292
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,628
They said there was a way to appear on TV...

293
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,840
even if I didn't become Miss Korea.

294
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,040
Soon Ae, when I become really famous,

295
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,408
I'll leave traces of myself...

296
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,949
here and there, literally everywhere.

297
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,379
Everyone, we're here with the first daughter...

298
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,990
of Mr. Lee Hyung Man and Ms. Park Ok Ja,

299
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:55,859
Lee Kyung Ae.

300
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,060
She has lived a fun life.

301
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,530
I'll make them say this.

302
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,230
So, make sure to add my name, okay?

303
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,069
("Small Door")

304
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,869
You're not answering me again.

305
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,439
- I'll just take that back then. - Okay, fine.

306
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,178
Do you know how many bottles of alcohol...

307
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,179
- I can get with this? - It hurts.

308
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:12,729
(Let's achieve national harmony...)

309
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,669
(through self-help, self-reliance, and cooperation.)

310
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,099
Hey, did you see the bookstore on the way?

311
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,168
I did. I can't believe Ko Mi Sook is a novelist.

312
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,770
It took me by surprise.

313
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,070
It's impressive.

314
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,209
Hey, I heard Ko Mi Sook became a novelist.

315
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,250
- Really? - Yes.

316
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,550
(Lee Soon Ae)

317
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,750
(Lee Soon Ae)

318
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:34,020
Dear Y.

319
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:36,218
Whenever I feel lonely...

320
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:37,658
I end up imagining it.

321
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,259
They're not welcome either.

322
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,260
My small secret door hidden somewhere...

323
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,699
I missed it.

324
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,070
I didn't expect it to happen at this time.

325
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,369
"Congratulations."

326
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:54,869
"A genius female high schooler novelist has been discovered."

327
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,239
"This year's new novel. This year's new novelist."

328
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,310
"She stuns the publishing industry."

329
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,649
"A 19-year-old female novelist is born."

330
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,319
"The genius girl bursts onto the literary scene."

331
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,449
"Ko Mi Sook."

332
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,389
She's the Ko Mi Sook that goes to our school?

333
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,230
Yes. The Ko Mi Sook in my class. It's true.

334
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,330
A newspaper company wants to come and interview her later.

335
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,429
They asked if they could come with the publisher and a reporter.

336
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:22,369
They can, right?

337
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,510
Should I style my hair a little?

338
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:29,208
By the way, how come she never mentioned it to us...

339
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,908
until she published the book?

340
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,109
She did a great job hiding it from us.

341
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,408
She came to me with that out of the blue,

342
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,580
which really surprised me.

343
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:57,800
("Small Door")

344
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,040
I can't believe it.

345
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,350
How...

346
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,030
(College Admissions, Literature, Notice)

350
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,540
I wanted to achieve the dream that she couldn't.

351
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,740
She said her dream was to write a novel back in the day.

352
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:39,550
Just like my dream.

353
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,419
She used to be a great literary enthusiast.

354
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,619
She was my junior in school.

355
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,089
Goodness. Then she got that talent from you.

356
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,790
- It looks like it. - No.

357
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,189
My daughter is better than me.

358
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,399
It's my first novel,

359
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,929
so I have a long way to go to be as good as her.

360
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:01,469
Still, I hope it's a special gift to her.

361
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,169
My mom's birthday is coming up soon.

- I see. - Is that so?

363
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,138
Happy Birthday.

364
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:11,609
The mother and daughter are so sweet to each other.

365
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:13,949
It's going to be the best gift.

366
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,549
You have no idea how well it was received in Seoul...

367
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,780
on the first day it came out at bookstores.

368
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,218
They're already saying that it could be one of the best sellers.

369
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,859
- Is that so? - That's great.

370
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,030
It's great news for Woojung High School as well.

371
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,100
We've never had such news since its establishment.

372
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,799
If I had known this in advance,

373
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,570
I would've had a big banner printed.

374
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,850
Ko Mi Sook.

375
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,790
We need to talk.

376
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:09,800
How could you do that?

377
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,469
Tell me. Why on earth...

378
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,980
How could you steal that?

379
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:19,780
Steal what?

380
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:21,949
What are you talking about?

381
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,280
My novel.

382
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,490
Don't be so brazen and try to lie to me too!

383
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,419
Your novel?

384
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,659
I really don't know what you're talking about.

385
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,840
Mi Sook, please.

386
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,939
You're having a rough time these days, right?

387
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,169
But you can't insist on something like this, Soon Ae.

388
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,409
You've been doing writing assignments for me.

389
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,949
So are you even confusing my work with yours?

390
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,320
I didn't know you could be this bad.

391
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,689
I won't stand this.

392
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,830
I'll tell them everything.

393
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,300
What you asked me to do.

394
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,639
Everything.

395
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,689
Why are you so annoying, Soon Ae?

396
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,359
I have to make a move, then.

397
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:44,030
What a hassle.

398
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,369
Do you...

399
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,399
have proof?

400
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,310
Your lost notebook?

401
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,840
Is there anyone who knows you wrote that novel?

402
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,020
You're helpless, anyway.

403
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,619
Just sit still.

404
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,929
Don't get in the way if you don't want to end up like your sister.

405
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:20,899
Okay?

406
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,030
I wondered why...

407
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,770
girls who like reading were all like that.

408
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,770
What?

409
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:04,240
They act like they're the main characters.

410
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:07,480
Like they are smart and know how the world works.

411
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,719
As if reading some words on paper...

412
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,889
will make them special. It makes me sick.

413
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,490
But now that I've tried it,

414
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,859
it's fun.

415
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,689
It's not too late, Soon Ae.

416
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:52,959
It's not too late to make it right.

417
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,060
Mi Sook is right.

418
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:03,199
It's my word against hers. Who will believe me?

419
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,270
My notebook is already gone,

420
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,340
and her book has already been published.

421
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,810
The only person who saw me write it...

422
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,949
was my sister.

423
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:22,689
But she is...

424
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,969
Why are you giving up without even trying?

425
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
If Mi Sook says no, is that it?

426
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,310
If Mi Sook says no,

427
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,139
everyone will say no too.

428
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,689
("Small Door")

429
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,429
If this becomes a thing,

430
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:03,760
my parents will find out too.

431
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,699
My parents...

432
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,969
won't be proud even if I become a novelist.

433
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,879
It will just make things harder for them.

434
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,250
If I give up...

435
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,889
and just let this go,

436
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:41,830
it will be as if nothing ever happened.

437
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,310
That might be better...

438
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:50,409
for everyone.

439
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,580
So...

440
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:57,980
that's how you felt when you gave up on writing.

441
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:04,389
But no.

442
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,129
Get yourself together, Lee Soon Ae.

443
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,199
Are your parents the only family you have?

444
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,369
I have my brother and my sister.

445
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,600
No!

446
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,840
Are they the only family you have?

447
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,010
Then who else?

448
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:28,649
Pretend that there are more people in your family.

449
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:30,520
Someone in your family...

450
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,750
treasures your novel the most in the world.

451
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:38,060
That someone wants her favorite novel...

452
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,189
to have your name on it, not anyone else's.

453
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,159
With the novel you wrote,

454
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,270
you can become an amazing novelist.

455
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,840
So you can read books to your heart's content.

456
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:55,639
And you can listen to all the music you want.

457
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,010
You can sip on warm coffee while you read.

458
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:03,949
Do just that. Don't give up on anything.

459
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,090
Just do what you want in life.

460
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,060
You should live your life the way you want.

461
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,730
That someone in your family could desperately be hoping for that.

462
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,129
Okay?

463
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,540
(Woojung Hospital)

464
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,409
Get in there.

465
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,699
- Talk to him. - Where are you going?

466
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,080
Soon Ae.

467
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,218
Do you know a band named Hallasan?

468
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,219
They perform at the club, Moon Night, from time to time.

469
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,960
They are known as a copycat band...

470
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,960
of Baekdoosan.

471
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,830
But I still have so much respect for them.

472
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,600
Especially the drummer.

473
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,339
One day, this drummer was...

474
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:35,940
in a major crisis.

475
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,540
What crisis?

476
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,489
Number two.

477
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,790
To die or to discharge.

478
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,529
He had to take care of the business right away.

479
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,199
Then he took a look around him when that happened.

480
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,258
It's just a show at a club in the countryside.

481
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:01,299
Stopping the show for a while wouldn't have been a big deal.

482
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,940
But for the audience,

483
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,940
he didn't go anywhere.

484
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:11,210
So he just went in his pants?

485
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,540
Yes.

486
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,279
What's the lesson of this disgusting story?

487
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:21,920
Once you start something,

488
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,989
you must see it through to the end.

489
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:39,069
That novel. That's yours.

490
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,339
Then you must protect it even if it costs your life.

491
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,710
I'm rooting for you right by your side.

492
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,380
You can't give up. Please.

493
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,889
Don't forget that I'm cheering you on.

494
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,830
You foolish girl.

495
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,940
- Mom. - Why won't I be proud of you?

496
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:15,068
- What? - You...

497
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:18,339
When your sister told me that she wanted to be a singer...

498
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,980
and participate in the beauty pageant,

499
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,380
I never encouraged her.

500
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:25,520
Do you know how much I regret that?

501
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,860
Don't feel intimidated. Show them what you're made of. Okay?

502
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,199
(Woojung General Store)

503
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,549
Let's go.

504
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:07,889
What...

505
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,960
How many people did you tell?

506
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,299
You're supposed to tell the whole town when it's bad news.

507
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,639
That way, the thief gets punished.

508
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,409
That path to the building looked quite similar...

509
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:32,479
because it was the publishing house...

510
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,790
where I was going to work in 30 years.

511
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,889
But that was the first time, going there with my mom.

512
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,009
And I saw...

513
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,239
a familiar face, sitting in the office.

514
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,549
The real novelist is here.

515
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,650
Let's talk about this thoroughly.

516
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,219
That's not true.

517
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,460
These two girls conspired together and are lying to you.

518
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,029
How are you going to fix this?

519
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,900
This is a huge problem.

520
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,068
The books have already been published.

521
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:21,269
They are being sold...

522
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,539
at every bookstore in Korea with my name and photo on them.

523
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,500
Can you be responsible for this if this becomes a scandal?

524
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:29,239
Do you have proof?

525
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:34,179
Your parents are already suffering.

526
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,850
Are you sure you want to cause trouble?

527
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:42,949
Let's talk when our lawyer gets here.

528
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,159
The culprits always ask for proof.

529
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,059
By "proof," are you asking...

530
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,460
if we have the notebook you stole from her? Then no.

531
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,069
But do you think...

532
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,199
you will only need one notebook to finish a novel?

533
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,420
This is the novel I started writing two years ago.

534
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,059
When you look through them,

535
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,229
you will see the sentences I erased after writing them halfway through.

536
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,230
I scribbled down some words,

537
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:24,429
trying to pick the right word to convey the plot and the meaning.

538
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,568
There are chapters I didn't include.

539
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:27,900
They are all in there.

540
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,069
You'll know once you read them.

541
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,669
You will. I assure you.

542
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,468
She made them up after reading my novel.

543
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:38,539
Ask me any questions. I can answer all of them.

544
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,480
I can answer everything about my novel.

545
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,350
I can answer every question.

546
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:47,119
But you can't.

547
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,350
Ko Mi Sook.

548
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,839
Hey, what are you doing?

549
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:11,710
She said I would know if I read them.

550
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:14,710
So I must.

551
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,949
And I should ask her...

552
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,350
because I have a lot of questions too.

553
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,759
Mom.

554
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,310
Yes. We plan to retrieve all the books we have sold so far.

555
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,880
The interviews with the novelist are all canceled.

556
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,480
No. We will republish the book as soon as it's ready.

557
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:52,520
I see. The plot of the novel won't change.

558
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,589
The name of the writer and the cover will change.

559
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,219
Yes.

560
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:00,360
Let's schedule an interview again then.

561
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,529
All right. Thank you.

562
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,730
On the first page of the novel written by Mom,

563
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,270
Mom asked to include this phrase.

564
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,639
"I'd like to dedicate this novel to Lee Kyung Ae,"

565
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,980
"the daughter of Lee Hyung Man and Park Ok Ja..."

566
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,210
"who live in Woojung-ri."

567
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,529
And I got to learn about her little secret.

568
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,839
I have a question.

569
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,239
In the letter to Y,

570
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,279
who is this Y?

571
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,520
Well...

572
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,889
The name...

573
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:08,130
of a friend I really want to meet later on.

574
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,040
It was...

575
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,439
the initial of the daughter...

576
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,139
she'd have in the distant future.

577
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,909
Namely, the Y of Yoon Young.

578
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,989
Thank you, Yoon Young.

579
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,159
It was all thanks to you that I got my novel back.

580
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:41,529
I'm grateful too.

581
00:42:42,389 --> 00:42:43,600
It's all thanks to you.

582
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,429
It was...

583
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,159
It was a truly happy day.

584
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,270
I don't think I've had a perfect day like that...

585
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,869
where I was so happy.

586
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,449
Mom! Please!

587
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,318
- Mom! - If you were to do something...

588
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,658
so vulgar, what's the point of reading books?

589
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,830
I should just tear them all!

590
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,790
I'm sorry, Mom!

591
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,900
A gift for me?

592
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,400
You accomplished the dream I couldn't achieve on my behalf?

593
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,699
How ridiculous.

594
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,239
It is humiliating to have a daughter like you...

595
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:03,810
who is so lacking.

596
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,139
Do you know that?

597
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,279
Mom...

598
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,920
Mom!

(Ko Mi Sook's Short Novel)

602
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,549
What are you doing out here?

603
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,819
I thought you were sound asleep.

604
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:00,630
Did you have another nightmare?

605
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,600
Can I sit next to you? I'm scared.

606
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,219
Now I feel better.

607
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,238
I thought you could sleep soundly...

608
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,839
because of the trip you took to Seoul.

609
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,710
And something nice happened too.

610
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,880
I know.

611
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:59,080
I thought I could sleep soundly too.

612
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,989
It felt so rewarding.

613
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,258
It was as if the six years of suffering under Ko Mi Sook...

614
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:09,330
were all washed away.

615
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:16,500
But I can't stop having that nightmare.

616
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,569
What kind of dream is it?

617
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,770
Are you really not going to tell me until the end?

618
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,750
I think it happened some time near those days.

619
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,219
I went back to our time on the time machine we fixed.

620
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,889
Both Mom and Dad...

621
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,190
were just as I imagined them to be.

622
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,259
They looked really happy.

623
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:48,100
What went wrong when they looked happy?

624
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,139
But...

625
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:00,949
Never mind.

626
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,350
You're cutting it off now?

627
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,750
It was just a silly dream.

628
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,659
Like a boring, meaningless, and terrible movie.

629
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,119
I see.

630
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,799
I went to see a movie recently.

631
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,869
I saw my mom there too.

632
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,179
It felt weird.

633
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:35,049
To face someone who abandoned me.

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,089
(Woojung Cinema)

635
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,790
Year 1988.

636
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,190
A year from now.

637
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,159
Someone who will leave me as soon as she gives birth to me.

638
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:55,799
Oh, this isn't...

639
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:59,869
about a dream but what actually happened, right?

640
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:02,339
Shall we just call it a dream?

641
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,850
I would've been able to find her if I wanted to.

642
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,980
It's not that big of a world anyway.

643
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,319
I could've found her at anytime even without a time machine.

644
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:20,659
I could've found out...

645
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,830
where she lived and how she was doing.

646
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,560
But I didn't.

647
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,569
I didn't look for her. Not even once.

648
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,339
It was her choice after all.

649
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:38,210
All our lives,

650
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,679
she wanted nothing to do with me.

651
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,580
That's what she wanted.

652
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,350
I think.

653
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,960
So I led a pretty decent life until then,

654
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,060
but this car brought me here.

655
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,270
Was it just an excuse?

656
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:07,000
You just wanted to see her at least once.

657
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:15,650
But now that I've seen her.

658
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,719
I'm really done with her.

659
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:20,489
I'll just...

660
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,489
think of it as a dream.

661
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,630
That's what I need to do here anyway.

662
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:32,860
Not interfering in the lives...

663
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,900
of those with whom I shouldn't interfere.

664
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,710
You see, the dream...

665
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,380
Actually,

666
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:55,589
in my dream...

667
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,630
Excuse me. Could I...

668
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,060
talk to you for a second,

669
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:07,270
Hae Jun?

670
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,569
You wanted to talk more...

671
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:14,839
with me?

672
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,409
What nonsense are you going to talk about again?

673
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:20,750
What is it?

674
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,889
Do you remember?

675
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,929
In the summer that I was 13 years old,

676
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:39,929
you first...

677
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,770
started to physically abuse me in your room.

678
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,069
But luckily,

679
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:52,440
Mom witnessed it.

680
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,520
Imagine how sad she must've felt that day.

681
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,920
She was abused by her own husband her whole life.

682
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,690
But she also had to see...

683
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:10,529
her daughter being assaulted by a jerk like you.

684
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:15,969
What are you saying, you lunatic?

685
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,369
I don't know if it was because she felt so despaired,

686
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,779
but she just turned a blind eye and walked away.

687
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,520
That's right.

688
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,429
Even after that, there were so many more occurrences.

689
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,560
I felt like I was invisible.

690
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,100
I cried out for help,

691
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:51,839
saying I was in pain,

692
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:54,839
but I was practically...

693
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,440
invisible in that house, right?

694
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,409
That's why I wanted to show her.

695
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:04,850
Mom.

696
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,119
I wanted to be visible in her eyes.

697
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,429
Is your hand okay now?

698
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,299
What?

699
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,679
You keep drinking.

700
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,960
That's why it's taking so long.

701
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,730
Are you nuts?

702
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,159
I called you ages ago!

703
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,000
Where's the umbrella?

704
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,170
It's pouring right now. Are you serious?

705
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,139
Did you bring the money?

706
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:09,179
Hey, do you think Mom will let you off if you treat me like this?

707
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,949
Hey!

708
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,819
Help me get up!

709
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,489
Easy. I said easy.

710
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,529
Gosh, seriously!

711
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,839
I said it hurt. Gosh!

712
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,739
Careful.

713
00:54:57,389 --> 00:54:58,500
What?

714
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,339
So...

715
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:08,969
does it hurt a lot?

716
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,880
How much?

717
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,230
Why does my hand keep...

718
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,549
What is it? What did you want to say to me?

719
00:55:58,119 --> 00:55:59,889
Well, this car...

720
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:04,600
At times, when I look into this car,

721
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,369
it makes me feel weird.

722
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,040
I know it doesn't make sense.

723
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,069
But I keep feeling like...

724
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,339
I'm looking at something that shouldn't be here.

725
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:25,819
No, never mind.

726
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,159
It doesn't matter. Right, it doesn't.

727
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:34,020
What are you talking about?

728
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,529
Detective Baek,

729
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,659
I have something to tell you.

730
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,139
Can you promise me...

731
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,009
that you'll keep everything I say from now on to yourself?

732
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,650
If word gets out, I might die.

733
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,589
No matter what you say,

734
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,489
I promise that you won't get hurt.

735
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,500
The incidents that happened in our village...

736
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,239
The culprit...

737
00:57:57,069 --> 00:57:58,179
I saw him.

738
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,020
I saw the crime take place.

739
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:09,119
It was my brother.

740
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,799
I heard...

741
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,270
that a series of murders took place in the village.

742
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:28,170
I also heard that the victims had...

743
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,580
the matchbox from my girlfriend's teahouse...

744
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,909
along with a note inside.

745
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,520
Is that...

746
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,319
this?

747
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,440
It wasn't intentional,

748
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,710
but when I went to the bathroom earlier,

749
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:22,589
I picked it up.

750
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,799
But why...

751
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:30,270
Why do you have something like this?

752
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,440
What?

753
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,850
Is this really yours?

754
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,319
Calm down and listen to me.

755
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,060
Who are you?

756
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,729
- What is this? - Hear me out.

757
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:58,799
Who in the world...

758
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:00,600
are you?

759
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:05,739
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

760
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,440
(My Perfect Stranger)

761
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,739
- Mr. Yoon. - Yoo Bum Ryong?

762
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,250
Mr. Yoon.

763
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:53,678
I think something happened to Soon Ae.

764
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:55,150
Come to your senses!

765
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,589
- This isn't right. - She's already dead.

766
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:01,989
Can you save them now?

767
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:11,400
The culprit won't get caught, Hae Kyung.

768
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:30,089
