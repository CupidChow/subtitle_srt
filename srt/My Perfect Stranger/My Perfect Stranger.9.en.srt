(Previously)

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,620
- Did you kill her? - No.

7
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:53,950
No, Mr. Yoon.

8
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,919
Please help me. I really didn't do it.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,590
It wasn't me!

10
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,999
- You can't be here. - Come on. It's me.

11
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,740
- No. - Let me pass through.

12
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,169
He wouldn't have been able to tie anyone up with those fingers.

13
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,178
Both victims were tied up with red strings...

14
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,179
when they were found.

15
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,439
I heard she was a commie.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,508
They might arrest me...

17
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,580
for not reporting her after seeing her twice.

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,179
Who am I?

19
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,789
And where am I?

20
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:29,890
Did I seriously travel to this far past...

21
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:31,289
This is mine.

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,729
I did everything.

23
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:36,100
just to hear you say that to me?

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,630
Everything has just gotten clearer.

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,140
To me,

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,910
from beginning to end, you were just...

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,880
a pathetic person...

28
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,440
whom I neither understood nor wanted to understand.

29
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,550
(My Perfect Stranger, Episode 9, Me in Your Darkest Night)

30
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,850
What do you mean he's not the culprit?

31
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,250
You clearly heard him confess!

32
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,130
Yes, I did.

33
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,899
I heard answers that didn't match the questions.

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,340
The question I asked him at the house started with "why."

35
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,169
What is this?

36
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,979
Why did you hide it in there?

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,638
When I asked him why he hid it there,

38
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,549
he told me it belonged to him out of the blue.

39
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:27,979
This is mine.

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,049
It was already in his room.

41
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,319
I get that he could have been flustered.

42
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,319
But why would he confess without giving an excuse,

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,759
even if he truly committed the crime?

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,589
- Honey. - Let go of me!

45
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,198
- I'm going to kill that jerk. - Honey.

46
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,258
- This won't change anything. - Gosh, don't say that.

47
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,798
- No, honey. - Let go of me!

48
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,199
- Dad, calm down. - Hey.

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,669
What's going on?

50
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,810
Mr. Baek arrested his own nephew with handcuffs.

51
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,238
That jerk killed my sister.

52
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,548
Let go of me!

53
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,948
- Gosh. - I'm going to rip his face off!

54
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,018
- Dad, you can't do that. - Calm down.

55
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,650
- Let me go. I'm going to... - No!

56
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,229
Hee Sub didn't do it.

57
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,889
He would never do that!

58
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,000
This...

59
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,769
Did you really do it?

60
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,079
How...

61
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,549
Of all people, how could you...

62
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,620
You... How could you?

63
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,060
How could you kill someone?

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,900
What do you mean?

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,470
What...

66
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,680
There's no point in playing innocent now!

67
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,579
All the evidence points to you as the culprit!

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,349
The matchbox.

69
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,489
(Women who read are dangerous.)

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,750
And the note.

71
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,270
Gosh, Hee Sub. What's all that?

72
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:34,210
Oh, this? This is nothing.

73
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,910
You should clean up your room.

74
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,479
Come out. Let's eat.

75
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:47,049
No. You've got it all wrong.

76
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,059
I didn't do it!

77
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,359
If you didn't do it,

78
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:54,160
what's this doing here?

79
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,530
Whose is this then?

80
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,359
Hee Sub came to our house last night.

81
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,900
He saved us yesterday...

82
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,830
in front of Woojung Inn.

83
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,229
The inn?

84
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,330
He came to check on me because he was worried.

85
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,739
But he was the one who got hurt.

86
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,239
Look at these cute lovebirds. Gosh.

87
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,248
So you guys are dating?

88
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:47,280
What?

89
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,580
Gosh, no. We would never...

90
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,859
I just thought she might be a bit shaken up.

91
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,330
I was only worried about Soon Ae. That's it.

92
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:01,760
I see.

93
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,530
You should go.

94
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,470
You said you needed to meet someone.

95
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,729
I'm leaving.

96
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,270
You coy little cat.

97
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,270
Hey.

98
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,809
You'd better treat my sister right.

99
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,719
Look at this. You have a cute face.

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,989
Don't go around, picking up fights. Got it?

101
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,289
Yes. I got it.

102
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:30,859
Great.

103
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:34,929
Just leave already.

104
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,470
- Come home early. - Okay.

105
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,169
Mom and Dad will scold me for this.

106
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Okay.

107
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,809
I will leave you two alone now.

108
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,379
Have a good time.

109
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,950
Here I go.

110
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,150
- Come home early. - Okay, miss.

111
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,390
Gosh. Lee Kyung Ae.

112
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,320
What's wrong with her?

113
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,409
- How's your injury? - Yes.

114
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,510
Are you okay?

115
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,939
I'm okay.

116
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,510
I can just put some doenjang on it later.

117
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,850
Since I saw that you were fine, I should get going now.

118
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,660
I have a lot of doenjang on the rooftop of my house.

119
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,200
The rooftop?

120
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,030
The rooftop of our house?

121
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,239
You two were together at that late hour?

122
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,850
Gosh.

123
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,780
What was the exact time?

124
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,119
Do you remember the exact time he left?

125
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,919
Well,

126
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,030
he said he would wait with me until Kyung Ae came back.

127
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,429
He stayed with me all night...

128
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,030
until the morning.

129
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,798
So Hee Sub can't be the culprit.

130
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,900
Does anyone else...

131
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,369
know about this?

132
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,010
No.

133
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,679
And it must stay that way...

134
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,350
from this moment on...

135
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,550
and forever.

136
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,659
Then what about Hee Sub?

137
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,290
Stop worrying about him!

138
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,290
He had just moved here!

139
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,960
Why are you calling his name as if you guys are close?

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,430
Don't you know what people gossip about your sister?

141
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,899
They're wondering why she went to that abandoned house...

142
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,440
so late at night.

143
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,869
They're saying she went there to meet guys after drinking.

144
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,609
Don't you know all the awful things they say about your sister?

145
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,878
They'll now start talking about you for staying up all night...

146
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,350
with a man on the rooftop.

147
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,690
This village is already small as it is!

148
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,618
It'll only be a matter of seconds...

149
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:15,619
before there are awful rumours about you.

150
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,029
You.

151
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,330
Are you going to make your mother put up with those rumours too?

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,560
- Dad! - If he's innocent,

153
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,700
he will be released on his own.

154
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
So...

155
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,369
no one here...

156
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,139
is allowed...

157
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,340
to bring this up ever again.

158
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,450
Mr. Yoon.

159
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,460
I know I'm asking a lot.

160
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,759
But please...

161
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,529
don't tell anyone.

162
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,149
(Period for voluntary returns of illegal weapons)

163
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,489
Gosh, come on. Look at this jerk. His mouth must be glued shut.

164
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,789
Hey. Look at this.

165
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,590
The blood splattered when you killed the victim, right?

166
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,600
Last night...

167
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,800
when you smashed Lee Kyung Ae's head in the abandoned house.

168
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:34,840
Answer me, you punk!

169
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,769
I'll interrogate him.

170
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,810
How can you interrogate your own family?

171
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:42,710
It'll be heartbreaking.

172
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,979
And it's not legally allowed either.

173
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,420
Hey, make him speak.

174
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,519
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

175
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,690
Let's go.

176
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,359
Come here.

177
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,618
(For a crimeless village)

178
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:58,690
Gosh.

179
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,700
When we were talking earlier, you said she had to see someone.

180
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,239
That night when Kyung Ae went out.

181
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:12,869
Yes.

182
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,810
But she told me it was someone really nice.

183
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,050
She said he was her saviour who saved her during the day.

184
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,159
You already knew who it was, right?

185
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:32,989
If his confession was false,

186
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,028
there could be only one reason...

187
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,060
why Baek Hee Sub made a false confession.

188
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,629
It wasn't Mom whom Dad wanted to protect.

189
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,739
Are you hurt?

190
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,040
That night.

191
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,440
The last person Lee Kyung Ae went to see.

192
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,879
Baek Yu Sub, the owner of the blue hat.

193
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,909
Dad was trying to cover up for his brother...

194
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,149
whom he had dearly cared for all his life.

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,960
It was Hee Sub before, and now, you're after Yu Sub?

196
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,559
I really appreciate you...

197
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,690
for saving Yong Woo last time,

198
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,358
but what on earth do you have against our family?

199
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,430
Don't you know there's a family going through something much worse?

200
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,570
And it's Dong Sik's job to solve that case.

201
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,269
We just want to ask him something in private.

202
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,340
You had to reach him anyway...

203
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,079
to tell him about what happened with Hee Sub.

204
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,249
I can't reach him.

205
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,249
It's been three days since he didn't return to his boarding house.

206
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,560
It happens all the time.

207
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,359
He went to a prestigious college in Seoul,

208
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,059
but he works part-time at a factory...

209
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,560
so he can take his brother with him to Seoul too.

210
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,369
Uncle Yu Sub did?

211
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,369
He cares for his younger brother dearly.

212
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,239
Despite his busy schedule,

213
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,739
he'd come here every weekend...

214
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:56,009
to see his brother.

215
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,879
I bet he barely has time to sleep at the boarding house.

216
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,019
Gosh, what a headache.

217
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,090
Do you know where his boarding house is?

218
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,118
I heard it was near his college.

219
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:12,560
It was somewhere in Sillim-dong.

220
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:14,629
Sillim-dong?

221
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,070
So Uncle was a Seoul National University student?

222
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,039
A third-year student in the Department of Korean Literature...

223
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,539
at Seoul National University.

224
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,939
She will be your student teacher for a month.

225
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,779
Her name is Lee Ju Young.

226
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,449
She's a fourth-year student at Seoul National University,

227
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,749
majoring in Korean literature.

228
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,879
They were in the same department at the same university.

229
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,060
That means he knew the first victim somehow.

230
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,028
Everyone took part in letting him hide,

231
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,560
so how could anyone doubt him?

232
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,399
Dad even got arrested on his behalf to protect him.

233
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,600
Grandfather decided to ignore the fact in case a rumour spread.

234
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:59,070
Thanks to that, Baek Yu Sub could go into hiding.

235
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,210
But still...

236
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,850
How was he not mentioned at all?

237
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,619
He was.

238
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,350
Just briefly, though.

239
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:13,749
He was brought up briefly once.

240
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,889
Stand still, you punk!

241
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,790
Hey, wake up.

242
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,460
Hey, get up.

243
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,960
Gosh. I told you to get up.

244
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,999
(Assailant Baek Hee Sub...)

245
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:29,840
Gosh.

246
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,569
He's driving me crazy.

247
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,340
Speak up, will you?

248
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Captain.

249
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:38,609
Officer Kim picked this up near the abandoned house.

250
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:40,509
- Near the abandoned house? - Yes.

251
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:42,080
Should we submit it as evidence?

252
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,379
What is it?

253
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,248
It looks like a necklace.

254
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:48,319
Try it on.

255
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,889
Well, you can just put it...

256
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,659
Hey!

257
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,369
Didn't you say he confessed earlier?

258
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,580
Hee Sub.

259
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,109
Are you okay? Hee Sub.

260
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,290
What is that?

261
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,489
Hey, Baek Dong Sik!

262
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,659
What do you think you are doing?

263
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,460
Hee Sub. Wake up.

264
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,729
This...

265
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,499
It's your brother's, right?

266
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,600
It's Yu Sub's, right?

267
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,570
Tell us the truth!

268
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,540
This is mine.

269
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,109
Gosh, what a nutcase.

270
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,540
He finally opened his mouth.

271
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,008
I let him borrow it before,

272
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,350
but it's been a while since he returned it to me.

273
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,050
It's always been mine.

274
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,820
It's not Dad's.

275
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:55,489
I'm sure of it.

276
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:00,159
Uncle didn't even let him touch it, saying it was all his.

277
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,060
Baek Hee Sub will insist that it's his.

278
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,070
And they will believe it too.

279
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,170
If things hadn't gone this way,

280
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,700
he'd have been released no matter what,

281
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,569
but we don't know how things will turn out...

282
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,570
because of his confession.

283
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:17,279
We need to find Baek Yu Sub as soon as possible.

284
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,509
We just need to find him?

285
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,249
But you said the necklace...

286
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:25,249
couldn't become circumstantial evidence for the murder.

287
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,089
Because we're not certain...

288
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,249
of the time and location at which it was dropped.

289
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,159
That's why I'll locate one in advance.

290
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,930
The lost evidence.

291
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,239
The shirt from the wardrobe...

292
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,739
could've become a much more important piece of evidence.

293
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,879
- Officer Kim. - Hey, Detective Lee.

294
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,050
Hey.

295
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,249
- How's your wife doing? - She's been well.

296
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,049
Scientific investigation wasn't a method they were familiar with,

297
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,119
- so a trivial mistake... - Salute!

298
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,369
ruined everything in an instant.

299
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,409
Gosh.

300
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,540
The contaminated evidence.

301
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,879
They couldn't reach any conclusions from that.

302
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,019
On top of that, they lost the evidence for good...

303
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,350
after the investigation was completed.

304
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,560
It completely destroyed the hope...

305
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,689
of finding the real culprit in the future.

306
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
But it'll be different this time.

307
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,969
If we can salvage that piece of evidence,

308
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,969
Baek Yu Sub won't be able to hide anywhere.

309
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:03,280
Oh, dear.

310
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,419
It's dangerous to drive with a cup in your mouth.

311
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,219
What is this?

312
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,889
So it's that one.

313
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,490
Detective Lee said he forgot.

314
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,730
He told me you should keep it safe since it's important.

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,030
Okay.

316
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:33,709
Drive safely.

317
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,080
Thanks.

318
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:47,060
I'll go find Baek Yu Sub before the result comes out.

319
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,530
His school, the factory, and the boarding house.

320
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,070
I'll look for him everywhere he could be.

321
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:57,899
To Sillim-dong, Seoul, please.

322
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Father.

323
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,040
Father!

324
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,649
Father, please open the door!

325
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,419
This isn't right.

326
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,990
Who cares what others say?

327
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,320
Hee Sub...

328
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,359
will never mention me first.

329
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,000
Father...

330
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,040
I hate myself too.

331
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,439
I had no idea what was happening to Kyung Ae.

332
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:38,280
If I had told her not to go,

333
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,719
she wouldn't have died like that.

334
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:48,520
I shouldn't have let her go.

335
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:57,330
It feels like it's all my fault.

336
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,669
So I'm disgusted at myself,

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,399
and I hate myself.

338
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,080
But still.

339
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,010
Just because...

340
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,580
Just because we lost Kyung Ae,

341
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,688
it's not right to just sit by and watch...

342
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,189
whatever happens to others.

343
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,929
It's just not right.

344
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,669
We really shouldn't do that.

345
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,490
Yoon Young, help me.

346
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,179
Where are we going now?

347
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,439
To the police station.

348
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,379
If he's still arrested, we should get to the bottom of this.

349
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:56,280
Hee Sub must be so scared alone.

350
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
We should hurry and go there.

351
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,990
Stop it.

352
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,459
It's not time for you to butt in.

353
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,530
What do you mean?

354
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,060
The adults will take care of it.

355
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,729
So if we just wait...

356
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,899
What adults?

357
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,540
The kind of adult...

358
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:21,070
who puts the cuffs on his nephew without any proof...

359
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:23,909
and lets the word get around the town?

360
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,550
You have Mr. Yoon, and I have my parents.

361
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,980
If he had those adults...

362
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,820
who would always have his back, I wouldn't do this.

363
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,020
But Hee Sub doesn't have anyone.

364
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:42,730
I have to be there for him.

365
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,469
Just sit still unless you know the truth.

366
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:48,570
Do you think the police are stupid?

367
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:51,699
It's also Hee Sub's fault...

368
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:54,039
that he's in that situation!

369
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,580
What do you know?

370
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,240
I have to go.

371
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,209
Let me go.

372
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,020
Please let go of me.

373
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:10,820
I have to go.

374
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:25,070
I must go.

375
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,840
I promised him.

376
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,879
I made a promise.

377
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,119
Are you really going to put doenjang on me?

378
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:13,419
That's what we talked about.

379
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,959
Show me the wound.

380
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,260
I think I would look funny.

381
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,199
It would stink.

382
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,230
Come on.

383
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,770
- Now! - Well...

384
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:34,810
Don't open your eyes.

385
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,040
Okay.

386
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,340
(Hoo Hoo Ointment)

387
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,250
Who puts doenjang on wounds these days, dummy?

388
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,520
Goodness.

389
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,619
You dropped...

390
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:26,929
the honorifics.

391
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,199
You don't like it?

392
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,899
I do.

393
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,850
That's why I'm scared.

394
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,949
I'm scared that you'll become...

395
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,790
too precious to me.

396
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,490
What about it?

397
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,169
I lose people easily.

398
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,939
My mom, my dad,

399
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,010
and even my big brother...

400
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:18,409
Whoever I cherish and care for,

401
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:23,050
they leave me.

402
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,600
I see.

403
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,340
Sometimes,

404
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,669
when I feel lonely and scared,

405
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,209
I imagine a small door.

406
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:56,419
A small door?

407
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,090
Yes.

408
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,389
There's a small door in my heart.

409
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,959
Behind that door,

410
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,030
there's always someone waiting for me.

411
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,409
When you're scared and lonely,

412
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,379
close your eyes and imagine a small door.

413
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,949
I'll always wait for you behind that door.

414
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:35,619
You just have to open it.

415
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:40,260
Really?

416
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:42,929
Yes.

417
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,139
Pull yourself together, Lee Soon Ae.

418
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:28,969
If you think he cares for you...

419
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:32,040
as much as you care for him, you're mistaken.

420
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,250
Who are you to say that?

421
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:41,719
Soon Ae!

422
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,888
You disappointed me.

423
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:47,129
Be disappointed as much as you want.

424
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:52,330
That would be much better for you now.

425
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,449
I saw it with my own eyes.

426
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:15,689
My parents saw it too.

427
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,888
You remember the cute guy who played the guitar so well...

428
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,560
- Yes. - on the field trip?

429
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,260
He had the cuffs on him like this.

430
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,898
He was trembling, looking fragile.

431
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,199
The one who sang "Should've Told Her?"

432
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:30,300
That guy!

433
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,469
I can't believe it.

434
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,279
He doesn't look like the type, right?

435
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,679
- I know. - My goodness.

436
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,349
- That's so scary. - Indeed.

437
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,550
- Right. He must be so scared. - Stupid.

438
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,250
He makes things complicated.

439
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,270
Your homeroom teacher can't come to school for a few days...

440
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:07,209
for personal reasons.

441
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,709
During that time, stay out of trouble,

442
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,409
focus on your studies, and...

443
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,080
Who hasn't come yet?

444
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,750
It's the murderer's seat.

445
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,020
How immature you guys are.

446
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,629
Nothing is certain for now. How could you call...

447
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,628
a friend in your class a murderer?

448
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,060
My dad said...

449
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:33,330
no one in our town would do such a thing.

450
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:35,300
But Hee Sub is a transfer.

451
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,898
He came all the way up here.

452
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,939
His uncle is a police officer.

453
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,770
But he still got arrested. Doesn't it mean something?

454
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,179
- Right. He was still taken away. - He's right.

455
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,080
- That's true. - He was still arrested.

456
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,810
- What did he do? - I know.

457
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,330
Mom.

458
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,030
- My gosh. - Mom.

459
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,569
- Mom. - Hey.

460
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,739
- Mom. - Are you okay?

461
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,809
Mom.

462
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,868
(Emergency Center)

463
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:16,339
Mom.

464
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Are you her family?

465
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,280
Are there any adults in your family?

466
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:23,449
Hold on.

467
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:27,419
(Dad)

468
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:10,699
Where have you been all day?

469
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,330
Something happened to your uncle.

470
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:19,740
What is it?

471
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:28,780
Dad...

472
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,149
chose his brother again this time.

473
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,290
It didn't matter how heartbroken Mom would be...

474
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,789
or that he was ruining his own life.

475
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,260
Once again,

476
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,889
he chose Uncle...

477
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,129
over Mom and me...

478
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,969
just like it had always been.

479
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:58,939
(Direct)

480
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:34,178
(Woojung Transportation)

481
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,020
(Intercity bus stop, ticket booth)

482
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,250
Seoul is pretty big.

483
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,929
Even when his own brother was arrested for his crime,

484
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,699
he pretended to be clueless about it and went into hiding.

485
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:55,899
It would've been weirder if it had been easier to find him.

486
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,740
We were wrong.

487
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,439
Baek Hee Sub wasn't trying to cover up...

488
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,409
the murder.

489
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,679
It was odd.

490
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,520
All those years ago even when we weren't here,

491
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,388
Baek Hee Sub became a suspect just like now.

492
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,029
Remember the shirt and the lock?

493
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,500
They said they all belonged to him, but he said he didn't kill anyone.

494
00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:29,130
He was ready to take the fall, but he said he didn't kill anyone.

495
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,940
That was because...

496
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,068
he knew there wasn't enough evidence,

497
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,170
so he wanted to avoid being charged.

498
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:37,080
No.

499
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,779
It really wasn't him.

500
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,119
I asked everyone I met there...

501
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,850
the same question.

502
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,389
"When was the last time you saw Baek Yu Sub?"

503
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,868
(Baek Yu Sub, 23 years old)

504
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,339
(Works at a leather factory on an hourly basis)

505
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:18,219
I don't know anything.

506
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,790
I can't know everything about him because we live in the same house.

507
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,460
We don't know anything.

508
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:27,989
Don't ask us.

509
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,600
That night,

510
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:36,739
I saw him getting dragged away...

511
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,900
in the front row.

512
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,639
But I couldn't do anything.

513
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,139
I couldn't even attempt to go after him.

514
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,549
He was bleeding a lot.

515
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,860
I wonder if he managed to get away when he was bleeding that much.

516
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:01,330
No one was able to get in touch with him after that day.

517
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,159
I'm so worried.

518
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,069
Half of them pretended they didn't know him.

519
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,400
But the other half told me the truth.

520
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,969
On the night of the 16th,

521
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,469
everyone saw Baek Yu Sub...

522
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,008
in the heart of Seoul at that.

523
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,580
Wait. What about my dad?

524
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,880
If Baek Yu Sub is not the culprit,

525
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,020
what will happen to my dad?

526
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,319
But...

527
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,449
that shirt will help him.

528
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,420
The police won't find what they're looking for.

529
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,060
But still.

530
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:40,730
But still...

531
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,440
All right.

532
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,350
The blood on the shirt...

533
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,380
The blood type is A.

534
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,479
Type A? Hey,

535
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,920
what were the blood types of the victims?

536
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,020
Lee Ju Young's blood type is O. Lee Kyung Ae's blood type is B.

537
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
What about this guy's blood type?

538
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:09,360
- It's O. - What?

539
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,400
What is this?

540
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:15,000
Whose blood is this then? Come on.

541
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,199
- Hello. - Hello.

542
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,339
I see that you're working hard.

543
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:23,909
Who are you?

544
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,080
We're from Seoul. We're in the force too.

545
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,980
We've already called your chief.

546
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,150
Did you not get the news?

547
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,619
I see.

548
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,460
Why did you waste your time on this? I bet this isn't even his.

549
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:40,790
Right, Hee Sub?

550
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,029
- What are you doing? - What am I doing?

551
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,199
I'm trying to catch college students who are worse than murderers.

552
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,940
Hey, Hee Sub.

553
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,779
You have to come with us now.

554
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,989
To find your brother, Baek Yu Sub.

555
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,000
Look at this guy. He was expecting us.

556
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,469
- Hey! You jerk! - Be careful.

557
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,829
- Hey. Okay. - Stop that.

558
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,968
Hey. Okay. Just let go of me! Darn it.

559
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,969
Let me just talk to them.

560
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,239
Hey, you jerks!

561
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,079
Hey, Hee Sub!

562
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,309
Hey, stop. Hee Sub!

563
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,178
- I told you to stop! - Hold on. Those jerks.

564
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,279
You jerks!

565
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:38,219
You jerks! Hee Sub!

566
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:39,889
Hee Sub!

567
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,049
Hee Sub!

568
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,560
You jerks!

569
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:47,989
(Woojung Police Station)

570
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,529
Wait for me here.

571
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,560
Dad.

572
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:01,600
Dad...

573
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,369
Baek Hee Sub...

574
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:09,909
Baek Hee Sub...

575
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,810
Baek Hee Sub...

576
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,920
Baek Hee Sub...

577
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:25,119
I brought your stuff.

578
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,389
You should just live here to make things easier on yourself.

579
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,699
Did you come to see Mom in the hospital...

580
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,659
even once?

581
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,900
- But you... - You are...

582
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,739
there with her.

583
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,310
That's why we're good.

584
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,049
We don't need you, Dad.

585
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,949
I'm sick of this.

586
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,779
Just in case...

587
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,949
Just in case you might show up late,

588
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,790
we keep waiting for you when we know you won't come.

589
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,229
I'm so sick of waiting for you!

590
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,360
I'm scared.

591
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,830
I'm scared, Hee Sub.

592
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,400
Hee Sub.

593
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,400
Let's hide.

594
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,869
Hee Sub.

595
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,210
Hee Sub, let's hide.

596
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,610
Let's hide.

597
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,489
(People's awareness to report strengthens national security.)

598
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:34,690
(Seoul W2557)

599
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,420
It keeps circling around.

600
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,230
Hee Sub...

601
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:51,869
Where is Hee Sub right now?

602
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:54,540
You jerk!

603
00:42:56,779 --> 00:42:58,009
This punk...

604
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:02,880
Hey! Move!

605
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,049
Where is Yu Sub?

606
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:46,690
Hee Sub.

607
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,230
It hurts, doesn't it?

608
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:51,500
Let's not go the harder way.

609
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:54,929
I don't know.

610
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,469
I don't know where he is!

611
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:07,909
Then I'll bring back your memory.

612
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:20,730
Murder?

613
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,529
Who? Who died?

614
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,929
How did this happen?

615
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:31,270
That shirt is mine.

616
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,770
Hee Sub knew all along...

617
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:37,009
what I did that night!

618
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,719
Hee Sub.

619
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:14,750
That night,

620
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,380
your brother ran from us...

621
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,219
and went to see you.

622
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:26,259
Right?

623
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,500
That never happened!

624
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:44,439
Gosh, Hee Sub.

625
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,210
Hee Sub. There, there.

626
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,319
Do you know where we are?

627
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,790
I bet you have no idea.

628
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:56,889
It's on a completely different level from a countryside precinct.

629
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,489
If things go wrong here,

630
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,060
you could just vanish without a trace.

631
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:13,039
You see, I am...

632
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,710
What? Yes?

633
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,509
quite ignorant,

634
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,779
so I don't know such stuff.

635
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,009
This punk...

636
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,020
Gosh, how troublesome.

637
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:27,389
You're so much trouble.

638
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,329
So? Do you remember now?

639
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,299
Do you think you can talk or not?

640
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,069
This won't do. Here we go again.

641
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,310
Yu Sub?

642
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,179
What happened?

643
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,259
- Hee Sub. - Yu Sub.

644
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,210
Hee Sub.

645
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,679
Yes.

646
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,110
What is this?

647
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:32,549
Tell me!

648
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,589
Did you go protest again?

649
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,589
Did you?

650
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:44,900
I'm sorry, Hee Sub.

651
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,569
I...

652
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:51,199
I'm sorry.

653
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,239
I told you not to put yourself in danger again!

654
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,670
I told you not to do it again!

655
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,199
Where did it go?

656
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,369
You jerk.

657
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,469
You fool!

658
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,509
Did you forget about it all?

659
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,580
Did you forget about this?

660
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:35,250
If I did,

661
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,350
I wouldn't be doing this, Hee Sub.

662
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:41,619
Dad! Mom!

663
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,589
This is bad.

664
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,189
They're shooting and killing people on the streets.

665
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,759
What? Yu Sub must be out of it.

666
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,429
It's not even summer yet, but the heat must've gotten to him.

667
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:57,399
I'm serious!

668
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,069
Come on in. Stop that nonsense.

669
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:01,709
- Ms. Baek! - What is it?

670
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,170
Ms. Baek!

671
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:05,939
You must hurry to the hospital.

672
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,080
- Why? - What are you talking about?

673
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:14,049
So many students from that college who were protesting were shot.

674
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,659
So they pushed aside the bodies on straw mats.

675
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:21,029
Doesn't Jin Sub go to that school?

676
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:23,259
- Gosh. - Goodness.

677
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,060
- Mom... - Mom...

678
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,170
Your dad and I will be right back.

679
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,600
We'll make sure to find your brother,

680
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,839
so don't ever leave the house.

681
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:38,509
Mom...

682
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,279
If anything happens...

683
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,279
Yu Sub and Hee Sub.

684
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,549
You two have to cherish each other...

685
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,690
and live happily together.

686
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:57,060
Live a good life.

687
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,529
Mom...

688
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,869
Promise me, okay?

689
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,299
- Mom! - Mom...

690
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,839
- Mom! - Mom!

691
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:10,069
- Dad! - Mom!

692
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:13,440
- Dad... - Mom!

693
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,580
How can I forget that day?

694
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:56,619
Hee Sub.

695
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:01,159
How can I forget the gunshot from that day?

696
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:03,790
Then...

697
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,659
what about the promise we made with Mom?

698
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,169
How can I go on with my life if you end up dying too?

699
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,400
Then what was I supposed to do?

700
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:14,710
You tell me.

701
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,440
Mom...

702
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,580
Dad...

703
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,949
Our brother.

704
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,420
We lost them all.

705
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,719
I feel so bitter...

706
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,420
and resentful.

707
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,190
Those feelings are firing up my heart.

708
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:40,830
So how am I supposed to live quietly, Hee Sub? How?

709
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,610
How am I supposed to live?

710
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:06,360
Why do you still hold on to them?

711
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,900
They were of no help to us.

712
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:30,750
Hurry up and take your shirt off.

713
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,949
I'm going to make sure you don't get caught.

714
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,860
- Hee Sub. - Hurry!

715
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,900
If I lose you too,

716
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:48,369
do you think I can live?

717
00:52:58,839 --> 00:52:59,940
Hee Sub.

718
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:10,889
My poor baby.

719
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:13,589
My poor little baby.

720
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:15,730
What do I do?

721
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:20,460
Yu Sub and Hee Sub.

722
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,670
You two have to cherish each other...

723
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,440
and live happily together.

724
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,739
Live a good life.

725
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,949
You have to live, no matter what. Do you understand?

726
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,190
Mother.

727
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,529
What do I do?

728
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,989
I'm the one they're looking for.

729
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,029
Please.

730
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:24,630
Please.

731
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,270
Please take me to my brother.

732
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,219
(Period for reporting suspicious people)

733
00:54:58,759 --> 00:54:59,860
Let's go inside.

734
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,400
Yoon Young.

735
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,889
(Woojung Inn)

736
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,159
Here?

737
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,100
He's in here?

738
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,699
Yes, I checked with my own eyes.

739
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,569
I'll go bring him out.

740
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:41,069
Wait.

741
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,110
I don't think that's a good idea.

742
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:45,639
I have a plan. Don't worry...

743
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:47,139
and wait here.

744
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,750
There is no good idea or plan here.

745
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,250
If something happens to Hee Sub because of me,

746
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:56,719
I don't think I'll be able to live.

747
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:58,819
If my method works...

748
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,190
and Hee Sub gets released.

749
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,860
Please...

750
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,759
take good care of him.

751
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:12,170
It's dangerous, so wait here.

752
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:25,779
(Inn Entrance)

753
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,560
Are you okay?

754
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,369
I'm okay.

755
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,080
It's only right for me...

756
00:58:37,409 --> 00:58:38,549
to be punished...

757
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:41,020
for my wrongdoings.

758
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:43,420
What did you do wrong?

759
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,319
This must have happened...

760
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,060
because...

761
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:56,130
I did something wrong.

762
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,270
If not,

763
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,810
why would something like this happen?

764
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:12,150
If not, why in the world...

765
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:16,989
would something like this happen to us?

766
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:20,960
But...

767
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,659
do you know what I did wrong?

768
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,500
What is it that we did wrong?

769
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:32,569
Do you know?

770
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,710
Who am I?

771
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,509
And where am I?

772
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:55,630
I travelled to this distant past.

773
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,429
How should I respond to your question?

774
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,310
I don't know what to do. I'm just sitting here like a fool.

775
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,650
Here...

776
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,480
on your darkest night...

777
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,589
I am.

778
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:31,460
(Inn Entrance)

779
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,150
(My Perfect Stranger)

780
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,689
You've collected all of these?

781
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:01,060
Those are the tickets for the movies I watched on my dates.

782
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,189
With Mother?

783
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,500
What was the movie we first watched together again?

784
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:06,799
"Our Sweet Days of Youth."

785
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:09,529
But I was sleeping, so I couldn't watch it.

786
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,839
Mr. Yoon.

787
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:19,710
Hello.

788
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:41,770
