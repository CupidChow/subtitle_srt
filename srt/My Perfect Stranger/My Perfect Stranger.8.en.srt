If Baek Yu Sub is the culprit,

11
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,859
we're going to see him again tomorrow night...

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,359
because he needs to kill the second victim.

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,929
What should I do now?

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,959
You'll need to find out who the second victim is.

15
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,029
Ko Min Soo was one of the suspects too, right?

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,140
At least, we'll find out tonight.

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,580
You probably can't tie any strings for the time being.

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,250
Hello?

19
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:28,890
She's dead, Mr. Yoon.

Yoo Bum Ryong?

21
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:36,759
I know that this will make no sense.

22
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,500
But it feels as if...

23
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:41,140
you came here on purpose just to save me.

24
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,600
Thank you.

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,369
Have a good life...

26
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,179
until you turn old and gray. Have a long, healthy life.

27
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:53,149
You too.

do you think people fall into the gravest danger?

33
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,620
The hope that you can correct all the wrongs.

34
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,089
The delusion that you can make all your mistakes go away...

35
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,720
as if they never happened.

36
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,680
As you become intoxicated by this sweet, pathetic pipe dream,

37
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,819
you realize at some point that...

38
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,889
no wrong in the world can be corrected.

39
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,070
But by the time you realize that,

40
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,580
you will already have been crushed by the wheel of fate.

41
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,350
What's important...

42
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,619
is the direction.

Explain this to me.

47
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,330
You must have called me here for a reason.

48
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,239
Explain why you are here at this hour.

49
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,879
Tell me what you saw...

50
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,979
and what you did.

51
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,850

52
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,320
Why can't you talk?

53
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,160
Did you kill her?

54
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,460
No.

55
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,160
No, Mr. Yoon.

56
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:38,869
Why did you kill her?

57
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,329
Why?

58
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,939
I'm sorry. Please help me.

59

61
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,839
Why did you kill her?

62
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,010
I really didn't do it. It wasn't me!

63
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,729
Hello.

64
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,169
Where's her ring?

65
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,340
Where...

66
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,320
Why doesn't she have her ring?

67
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Mr. Yoon.

68
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,460
This really doesn't mean anything.

69
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,659
I got it from her...

70
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,299
when I ran into her downtown yesterday afternoon.

71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,570
This ring has nothing to do with her death, Mr. Yoon.

72
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,140
I ran into her again, so we talked for a bit.

73
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,970
Then I left first.

74
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,780
When I came back, I found her like this.

75
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,879
Mr. Yoon, that's the truth.

76
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,020
When?

77
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:05,489
What?

78
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,020
When did you see her?

79
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,960
Yesterday afternoon.

80
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,358
If you tell anyone,

81
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,530
the police might find out that I saw her.

82
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,600
I heard she was a commie.

83
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,498
They might arrest me...

84
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,869
for not reporting her after seeing her twice.

85
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:40,720
That's what you're afraid of?

86
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,389
Yes.

87
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,060
She never left?

88
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,450
Mr. Yoon.

89
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,320

- Come on. - What on earth is going on?

93
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,628
- What happened? - Please move back.

94
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,570
- Stop pushing. - Please stop them.

95
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,738

- Goodness. - Move back.

97
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,809
- You can't be here. - Come on.

98
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,709
- Did you see that? - Hold on.

99
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,278
- Come on. Move back! - Gosh.

100
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,778
- Stop that. - That's enough.

101
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,319
- Come on. - Hey, he's going in.

102

I knew this would happen.

108
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,488
She acted up so much.

109
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,389
Even so...

110
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:41,060
No one from our village would do such a thing.

111
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:45,029

112
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,229

Do you know who the dead woman is?

115
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,840
She's from our village.

116
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
She always wore a tiny skirt...

117
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,879
and roamed around late at night after getting drunk.

118
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:05,290
She's the first daughter of Lee from the general store.

119
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,450
Is she?

120
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:27,369
Oh, gosh.

121
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,639
This can't be happening.

122

How many times must I call you when breakfast is ready?

125
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,420
You decided to sleep in when you could've helped me.

126
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,159
Is Kyung Ae still sleeping?

127
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,759
The thing is...

128
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,499
Gosh, she must've slipped out at night again.

129
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,729
What? For real?

130
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,969
She promised that she'd be back early.

131
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,139
You still don't know your sister?

132
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,340
You trusted her words and let her go?

133
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:37,079
This brat. What if she's sleeping on the street...

134
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,248

138

155

Where is Kyung Ae?

156
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,970
Why did she come so far?

157
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,769
- Why did... - Dad...

158
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,869
You know it, right?

159
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,909

169
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,639
Let me go! Bring back my daughter! You jerk!

170
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,139
- Kyung Ae... - Kyung Ae!

171
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540

172
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,908

179
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,429
- Dad... - Kyung Ae! Let's go home.

180
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,840
We must go back. Both of us.

181
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,240
To where we belong.

182
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,340
We're going back?

183
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,480
Then what about my mom?

184
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,990
What about you?

185
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,189

it will happen no matter what we do.

188
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,770
You saw it yourself too.

189
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,869
The time and place have changed, but the same person died.

190
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,439
It's not just that.

191
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,709
The abandoned house where Lee Kyung Ae was found.

192
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,740
I've never seen it before.

193
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,909
She's never died at a place like that.

194
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,580
There is no future I can change...

195
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,119
with the facts I know.

196
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,919
Everything's back to square one, and this is our end.

197
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,928
I'll do whatever it takes to fix the car,

198
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:16,300
so please wait until then.

199
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,648
I can't believe it. Let's hurry over.

200
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,948
- Where was it again? - I can't believe this has happened.

201
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,750
It has happened again.

202
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,019
Mi Sook.

203
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,119
Mi Sook!

204
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:19,389
You heard about it too?

205
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,159
Isn't it so scary?

206
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,730
I know. How can this happen?

207
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,570
What kind of psycho did this?

208
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,899
It's so horrible.

209
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,968
How could this happen in our neighborhood?

210
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:31,969
Right?

211
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,109
We can't walk around freely now. It's so scary.

212
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,409
Anyway, let's hurry over.

213
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:44,919
Why do you look so serious?

214
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,719
What?

215
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,859
Some might think you killed her.

216
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,129
Relax.

217
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,369
You're making it obvious.

218
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,709
Let's go. It's going to be fun.

219
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,679
Let's go.

220
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,280
Isn't she that girl?

221
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,350
The one who fled from Seoul after taking part in demonstrations?

222
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,629
She's not even from this village. Why did she have to die here?

223
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,730
It'll give me more headaches.

224
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,459
Things got crazy all of a sudden.

225
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,699
- Right? - Seeing how her hands are tied,

226
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,070
it must've been done by the same guy. Where did it go?

227
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,600
Whoever that jerk may be,

228
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,240
he killed two people overnight.

229
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,909
By the way, Chief.

230
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,908
You were nominated for commissioner. This won't affect that, will it?

231
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,010
Of course, it will.

232
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,209
How come no one carries around a match?

233
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:49,520
I told you to take one.

234
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,449
Wait.

235
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,649
That brat even smoked?

236
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,789
Just take that.

237
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,219
Hurry up and do it.

238
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,459
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

239
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,709
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

240
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,679
Wasn't it one of Kyung Ae's belongings as well?

241
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,480
Now that you're holding it,

242
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:21,850
why don't you take one?

243
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,189
It sounds weird.

244
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,800
"Women who read..."

245
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,199
"are dangerous."

246
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,368
What kind of lame quote was she carrying?

247
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:49,439
Whatever.

248
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,840
We need to find this lunatic quickly and close the case.

249
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,708
Anyone who came across Lee Ju Young and Lee Kyung Ae,

250
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,678
Anyone with criminal records, and any gangsters in town.

251
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,989
If there's anyone who seems fishy,

252
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,189
bring them to me.

253
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,319
Right now, punks! Move.

254
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,958
- Okay. - Hurry!

255
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,560
- We'll look for them. - I'm going this way.

256
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,929
Goodness, those fools.

257
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,500
Gosh, that idiot.

258
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,129
Oh, my.

259
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,569
- Didn't you hear me? - Yes?

260
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,769
Don't think about ditching work again.

261
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,570
Get moving, Baek Dong Sik.

262
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:20,669
Go!

263
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,850
Oh, dear. What's so fun about this?

264
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:31,218
- Oh, my. How did this happen? - I feel bad.

265
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,549
- She passed away. - How could this happen?

266
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,658
- They said she was dead. - I can't believe this.

267
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,928
- She was so young. - My goodness.

268
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:40,990
- This is tragic. - Oh, dear.

269
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,540
Yoon Young.

270
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,639
Yoon Young!

271
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,209
Mr. Yoon!

272
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,350
Nobody's home?

273
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,550
Can someone help me?

274
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,080
Can anyone please...

275
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:15,689
Somebody help me.

276
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,730
Yoon Young.

277
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,230
My sister...

278
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:29,869
She...

279
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,010
My sister...

280
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:43,219
I know.

281
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,520
I know.

282
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,590
I'm so sorry.

283
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,490
My mom is acting weird, Yoon Young.

284
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
I said it was dangerous.

285
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:17,080
I told her the world was a scary place.

286
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,250
She never listened to me.

287
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:23,760
Mom.

288
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,959
Why did she go there that late?

289
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,000
What was she doing there at that late hour?

290
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,530
She's unbelievable.

291
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,199
That stupid brat.

292
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,209
It's obvious what people are going to say.

293
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,909
I told you to stop the phone from ringing.

294
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,290
Those jerks.

295
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,859
They keep babbling about it because it's not their problem.

296
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,800
Is this just some fun gossip for them?

297
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,899
Why do they keep calling?

298
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,369
Mom.

299
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,909
Mom.

300
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,619
Mom.

301
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,719
(Congratulations on hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics.)

302
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,240
Hey.

303
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:47,669
Can I...

304
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,480
Can I ask you a question?

305
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,080
Hey.

306
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,949
Will you open the doors and see me?

307
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,429
About my grandma...

308
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,669
Do you know when and how she passed away?

309
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,039
I only know she died way before I was born.

310
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,969
I've never heard how or why she passed away.

311
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,540
Does it...

312
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,520
have something to do with what happened today?

313
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,359
If it is,

314
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,689
I want to at least save her.

315
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,129
Can you tell me what to do to save her?

316
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:52,070
I'm scared that everything went wrong because of me...

317
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,879
and that it will all end like this.

318
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,469
But I witnessed it all.

319
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,169
I've been running around to save them.

320
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:28,639
Their feelings for each other.

321
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,379
I saw them all.

322
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:36,250
It doesn't matter at all?

323
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,350
And this is it?

324
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,790
How so?

325
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,659
I can't believe this.

326
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,939
Unless we can go back to the time we haven't met,

327
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,270
it's not square one wherever we are.

328
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,889
(Congratulations on hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics.)

329
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,560
All right. Now choose if you want to move forward...

330
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,060
or step back.

331
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,000
It's up to you. What do you want to do?

332
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:27,699
Go.

333
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,169
Okay. Count again.

334
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,340
Let's...

335
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,310
go.

336
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:38,139
Five, four,

337
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,949
- three... - Two.

338
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:42,250
One.

339
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,619
Yes!

340
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,389
A bet is a bet.

341
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,320
You know how it works.

342
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,858
Here.

343
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,659
(Gimpo International Airport)

344
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:01,730
Yeon Woo!

345
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,300
- Son! - Dad!

346
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,070
Goodness, my baby.

347
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,678
Oh, dear. My son!

348
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,179
I missed you, Dad.

349
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,980
Let me see. This is nice.

350
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,148
- Is this your bag? - Yes.

351
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,479
Let's go.

352
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,449
- How have you been? - I've been good.

353
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,730
- Stop looking at me, Dad. - Come on, son.

354
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,070
I waited for three years to see your face again.

355
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,540
I only stared at you for like 30 minutes.

356
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,010
I've been so busy with school. I'm sorry.

357
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,209
Goodness. Your grades were amazing, though.

358
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,080
I guess the Yoons are indeed smart.

359
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,320
You, me,

360
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:53,320
and a teacher who I really like these days.

361
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,060
His name is Yoon Hae Jun. He's also a Yoon.

362
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,830
- Hae Jun? - Yes. Why?

363
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:03,500
I love that name.

364
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,159
Is that so?

365
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,469
I told him I'd introduce you to him when you were back.

366
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,399
He said he had something that needed fixing.

367
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,039
You're an expert in that area.

368
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,179
You're the best in Korea, aren't you?

369
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:21,850
I'm so happy.

370
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:34,159
- You jerk. Hey, get him. - Darn it.

371
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,530
Is something going on?

372
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:41,869
I'm not sure.

373
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,270
Stay in the car.

374
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:49,010
Get in.

375
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,139
- What on earth is going on? - Come here.

376
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,250
Welcome to Korea.

377
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:27,909
Is this Hae Jun's house?

378
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,070
Who are you?

379
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,240
I came by because I heard he needed my help to fix something.

380
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,449
Did I come at a bad time?

381
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:02,780
Then...

382
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:05,219
can you give this to him?

383
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,590
I'll fix anything he wants if he can solve it in five seconds.

384
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:14,629
If he can't solve the cube, I'll have to think about it.

385
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:17,500
I like smart people.

386
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,730
Then bye.

387
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,549
Just in 1 night, 2 women...

388
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,688
in their 20s were found murdered in a village in Gyeonggi Province.

389
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:42,419
The local residents are trembling with fear.

390
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,260
Here's the report from Reporter Oh In Sung.

391
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,158
Today around 6am,

392
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,928
a 22-year-old local resident, Lee, was found dead, covered in blood...

393
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:51,658
in an abandoned house...

394
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,569
located on a hill in Woojung-ri, Woojung-eup, Woojung-gun.

395
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,928
A resident who lived nearby found the body...

396
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:56,500
and reported it to the police.

397
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,398
Based on the trace...

398
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,069
of blunt force trauma to the back of her head,

399
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,980
the police suspect that she was assaulted and then murdered.

400
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,878
Again, around 6am today,

401
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,779
a 24-year-old student teacher,

402
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,349
Lee, who was working at a nearby high school...

403
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,448
was found dead by the riverside in Woojung-ri.

404
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,488
(Beauty Pageant, Miss Korea, 1987)

405
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,460
Woojung-ri was a crime-free village for five years...

406
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,279
I'm serious.

407
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,080
Once I become Miss Korea, I'll get you a mink coat.

408
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,179
I can't believe you're my daughter.

409
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,779
Gosh.

410
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,319
Do you think anyone can afford a mink coat?

411
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,489
I'm not asking you to buy me one. I said I'd get you one.

412
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,690
Stop hustling her and just quit drinking.

413
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,499
Miss Korea? My foot. Show some respect to your elder.

414
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,630
That's enough.

415
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,999
Why doesn't anyone believe in me?

416
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,369
They said I had potential for sure.

417
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,610
You're not...

418
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:10,080
involved with a bad crowd, right?

419
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:12,710
You don't know these things.

420
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:19,790
But can you help me out a little?

421
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,520
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,790
We have no money. We're flat broke.

423
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,269
- I'm going to school. - Okay.

424
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,469
I'm going to work.

425
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:44,008
- Mom. - Have a good day.

426
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,778
- Mom. - You little...

427
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:49,310
- Mom. - What is it this time?

428
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,250
Come on, Mom. I'm not joking.

429
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:56,790
- Once I become Miss Korea... - Miss Korea?

430
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,389
No. Even if I don't become Miss Korea,

431
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,130
I'll make a lot of money and buy you a mink coat. Okay?

432
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,298
What's gotten into you?

433
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:08,069
Why do you keep bringing up mink coats?

434
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:11,338
Remember that? A long time ago... Who was that?

435
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,309
Yes. Our neighbor, Seung Jin's mom. You were really jealous...

436
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,270
of her mink coat.

437
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,980
- Seung Jin's mom? - Yes.

438
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,179
You mean the family who moved away when you were nine?

439
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,279
Yes.

440
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,718
Ever since then, my dream has been to buy...

441
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,719
the same mink coat for you. Wait. No.

442
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,459
Buying you a prettier coat...

443
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,860
had been my dream.

444
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,259
I think I'm really getting close to fulfilling my dream now.

445
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,099
So you just wait,

446
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,230
Lady Ok Ja.

447
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,339
How about a kiss? It's been a while.

448
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,199
- Mom, I'm going to school. - Gosh.

449
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,440
Don't be a nuisance. Get off me.

450
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,909
- Did you get everything you need? - Yes.

451
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,639
Go.

452
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,449
What a heartless mother.

453
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
You...

454
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,889
should have hugged her.

455
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,270
You should have hugged her.

456
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,469
When you had the chance,

457
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,509
you should have hugged her to your heart's content.

458
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,389
I will now announce the next winner.

459
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,290
Here's 2nd place for Miss Daegu. Number 30, Kang Eun Ju.

460
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,299
Congratulations.

461
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,739
This makes her the third winner of our pageant.

462
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,020
Mom.

463
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,759
Mom.

464
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,270
Mom.

465
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,069
What's wrong?

466
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Where's your mom?

467
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,060
- Ok Ja! - Mom!

468
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,588
- Mom! - Mom!

469
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:51,059
- Mom! - Mom!

470
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,199
Hey, Ok Ja!

471
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,469
Mom!

472
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,770
- Ok Ja! - Where did she go?

473
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:57,600
Mom!

474
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,770
Mom!

475
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,469
Ok Ja.

476
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,400
Gosh.

477
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,290
No!

478
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,000
No, ma'am. Please.

479
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,230
Please don't do that.

480
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,639
You must hang in there.

481
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,080
I know that you're in agony.

482
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,479
But if you give up now,

483
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,679
your children, Soon Ae and Oh Bok,

484
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,580
will live...

485
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,619
without their mother...

486
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:26,460
at least for 40 years.

487
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,759
No, it will be more than that!

488
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,670
Do you think you can rest in peace...

489
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,909
knowing what you will be doing to them?

490
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,580
Your decision will affect a lot of people.

491
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,690
So please tell me...

492
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,889
that you can overcome this and get through it.

493
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,920
Please?

494
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:37,600
Be careful.

495
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,900
Ok Ja!

496
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:43,969
- Ok Ja! - Mom.

497
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,869
- Mom! - Mom!

498
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,239
- What are you doing here? - Gosh.

499
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,009
You fool!

500
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,230
- Seriously! You gave me a scare. - Mom...

501
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,860
Mom...

502
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,460
Shall we give each other a hug for a second?

503
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,869
So many things happened today.

504
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,540
So let's just...

505
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:41,819
You'll give it another try, right?

506
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:45,290
Catching the culprit...

507
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,730
and saving the third victim as well.

508
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,900
It can't be the end.

509
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,569
I don't want us to become strangers.

510
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,380
Oh, someone came looking for you.

511
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,150
He was a bit odd.

512
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:15,920
What did he say again?

513
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,219
He said he'd fix it for you if you solved it in five seconds.

514
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,830
What was that?

515
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,839
You're really going to ask him to fix it?

516
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,199
I can ask him that much.

517
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,980
We'll have to return eventually, even if it's not now.

518
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,279
Who is he?

519
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,650
Is it okay to show him the car?

520
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,690
I know how to handle him.

521
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:50,889
He's my dad.

522
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,420
I see.

523
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,330
What?

524
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,678
I thought you weren't hiding anything anymore,

525
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,880
but you were keeping the biggest secret.

526
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,379
I mean, your family was here.

527
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,489
How could you have kept it to yourself until now?

528
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,589
I was waiting for the right timing, which is now.

529
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,730
Then Principal Yoon we saw every day...

530
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,560
No wonder you share the same surname.

531
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,500
We need to count some people out.

532
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:40,770
Both of them.

533
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:43,069
Based on what I saw,

534
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:45,839
he wouldn't have been able to tie anyone up with those fingers.

535
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,219
I broke a bone. It hurts!

536
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:53,080
You probably can't tie any strings for the time being.

537
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,889
The victims.

538
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:57,618
Both victims were tied up with red strings...

539
00:45:57,619 --> 00:45:58,719
when they were found.

540
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,659
Besides his fingers,

541
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:09,500
it looked like he was injured everywhere.

542
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,199
Ko Min Soo, that is.

543
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,409
Yoo Bum Ryong wasn't afraid of being accused of the murder.

544
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,080
I heard she was a commie.

545
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:20,948
They might arrest me...

546
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,350
for not reporting her after seeing her twice.

547
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:26,549
That's what you're afraid of?

548
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:28,089
Yes.

549
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,290
Unless he was acting incredibly well...

550
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,158
It also looked like he had no idea...

551
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:34,860
there was another murder case.

552
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:45,100
(Woojung-ri Serial Murder Case Suspects)

553
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,839
I have no excuse to come up with.

554
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,949
And there's Baek Yu Sub, the real owner of the blue hat.

555
00:46:56,549 --> 00:46:58,420
There's one more person now.

556
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,350
The one who told the biggest lie.

557
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:07,730
Ko Mi Sook.

558
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:11,460
Mi Sook.

559
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,500
Now I know...

560
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:15,429
why she told such a lie.

561
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:17,339
About my brother...

562
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,440
Do you think I'm happy...

563
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,739
about how he ended up,

564
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,339
or the opposite?

565
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:27,150
Let me know if you need any help.

566
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:30,520
Because I'm still grateful for what you did.

567
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,549
She was glad about what had happened to Ko Min Soo.

568
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,089
Looking back on the things he did to me,

569
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,860
I bet he wasn't a good brother to his sister either.

570
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,230
What's important here is how much she knows.

571
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,029
How much did Ko Mi Sook know...

572
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:52,600
to lay the blame on Ko Min Soo?

573
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:54,569
And how she came to know it.

574
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,179
The circumstances surrounding the incident are important.

575
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,379
It means she knew enough details...

576
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,880
to write about it in her novel.

577
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:04,350
You're right.

578
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,350
We need to handle Baek Hee Sub first.

579
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,960
He'll be chosen as the first suspect in about 30 minutes...

580
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,389
by the police.

581
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:41,489
(Baek Dong Sik)

582
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,659
Who visits their student's home like this?

583
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,259
Where is your brother?

584
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,529
When was the last time you saw him?

585
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,400
I guess you don't know yet,

586
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,040
but my uncle is a police officer.

587
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:06,409
I know you're a teacher, but if you behave this way...

588
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,580
Your uncle will be here soon to arrest you.

589
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,850
About five minutes later.

590
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,799
What is this?

591
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,900
Why did you hide it in there?

592
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:41,509
When...

593
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:45,549
do you think people fall into the gravest danger?

594
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:48,850
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

595
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:52,489
(Two hours ago)

596
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,869
The hope that you can correct all the wrongs.

597
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:05,568
The delusion that you can make all your mistakes go away...

598
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,139
as if they never happened.

599
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,279
As you become intoxicated by this sweet, pathetic pipe dream,

600
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:15,409
you realize at some point that...

601
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:19,219
"Right."

602
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,350
"No wrong in the world can be corrected."

603
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,190
But by the time you realize that,

604
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,400
you will already have been crushed by the wheel of fate.

605
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,699
What's important...

606
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:43,610
is the direction.

607
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,940
What on earth are you talking about?

608
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,779
Stop talking nonsense, and get to the point.

609
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,150
Why did you want to see me?

610
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,219
Your vulnerable point.

611
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,360
I think I can cover it up for you.

612
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,630
What vulnerable point?

613
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,500
If you wanted to throw it away, you should've done it discreetly.

614
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:16,409
What is this? It's so foolish.

615
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,889
You want to protect someone,

616
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,630
and I want to get rid of someone.

617
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,799
I think we can be of help to each other.

618
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,440
What are you trying to pull with me?

619
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,520
What your brother did.

620
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:30,719
What a fool.

621
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,449
She doesn't even know anything.

622
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,889
I don't know what brought you here.

623
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:45,830
But this is mine.

624
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:50,869
I did everything.

625
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:08,549
- I didn't do anything. - That's enough.

626
00:53:10,049 --> 00:53:11,759
It really wasn't me.

627
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,159
Then why did you run away?

628
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,830
Why can't you believe me?

629
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:19,060
- I didn't do anything. - Why you little...

630
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,198
You better level with me.

631
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,429
Oh, my gosh.

632
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,968
It really wasn't me.

633
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:30,540
What do you mean it wasn't you?

634
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,839

(Bong Bong Teahouse)

636
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,360
This is mine.

637
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,159
I did everything.

638
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,799
Who am I?

639
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,509
And where am I?

640
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,778
Did I seriously travel...

641
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:40,949
to this far past...

642
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,250
just to hear you say that to me?

643
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,020
Everything has just gotten clearer.

644
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:55,730
To me,

645
00:54:57,529 --> 00:54:59,730
from beginning to end,

646
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,929
you were just a pathetic person...

647
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,909
whom I neither understood nor wanted to understand.

648
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,119
Oh, my goodness. My poor baby.

649
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,619
My poor little baby.

650
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:23,420
What do I do?

651
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:29,659
Make sure...

652
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,299
to come back.

653
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,869
You have to live.

654
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:39,000
You have to live no matter what. Do you understand?

655
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:45,239
Snap out of it, Baek Hee Sub. Get hold of yourself.

656
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,380
This is driving me crazy.

657
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,619
Come to your senses and look me in the eye!

658
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,690
Listen carefully.

659
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,529
This...

660
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,960
Your entire life...

661
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:07,670
and the lives of your family members depend on this.

662
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,869
If you're lying...

663
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,440
No one else knows what will happen better than I do.

664
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,739
It's none of your business, so hurry up and leave.

665
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:26,850
If you stay around, someone will get hurt.

666
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,520
Let's go.

667
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:33,920
What more is there to listen to? He confessed.

668
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:36,960
Let's let him pay for his crimes.

669
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,299
Although I don't know if that'll be possible.

670
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:43,799
Wait. Are you...

671
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,130
Uncle Dong Sik.

672
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:15,500
What I just heard...

673
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:18,199
Is it all true?

674
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,940
I'm sorry.

675
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:26,440
I'm sorry, Uncle Dong Sik.

676
00:57:39,819 --> 00:57:40,819
You...

677
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:47,900
Come with me, you punk.

678
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:49,770
Get up, you punk!

679
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,509
You keep crossing paths with me.

680
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:05,150
It won't be a good thing.

681
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:09,589
You better take note of that. Got it?

682
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:16,560
Go.

683
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,630
Move, you punk!

684
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,699
Sorry.

685
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,040
I'm sorry.

686
00:59:06,779 --> 00:59:07,779
I'm sorry.

687
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:10,009
I'm sorry.

688
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,900
You're putting others before yourself again.

689
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,310
Everything happened because of my father.

690
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,380
The reason you ended up here...

691
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:44,310
and the reason why I happened to follow you here...

692
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,089
It all might be because of that.

693
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,460
I don't even know where to start in asking for your forgiveness.

694
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:16,009
I'm not sure if this will make you feel any better,

695
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,020
but...

696
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,920
I'm not going to live a good life.

697
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,060
No.

698
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,429
I won't be able to.

699
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,770
The police officer heard my father confess this time,

700
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:40,600
so he's going to receive proper punishment.

701
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,509
And my mom will find out soon.

702
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:50,350
Then that means she won't marry him.

703
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,690
- And I'll... - Disappear.

704
01:00:57,719 --> 01:00:59,759
And that will make me feel better?

705
01:01:09,029 --> 01:01:10,029
I'm sorry,

706
01:01:11,069 --> 01:01:12,969
but that's not going to happen. I'll make sure of it.

707
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,639
Because I don't think...

708
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,880
Baek Hee Sub, your father, is the culprit.

709
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,619
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

710
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,619
(My Perfect Stranger)

711
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:06,960
Is it true?

712
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,630
How could you kill someone, you punk?

713
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,329
The question I asked earlier...

714
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,360
What is this?

715
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:13,829
Why did you hide this here?

716
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,099
When I asked him, "Why?"...

717
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,169
he suddenly responded, "This is mine."

718
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,899
That wasn't necessary because it was something in his own room.

719
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,638
I'm certain. My uncle didn't let me touch it,

720
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:22,939
saying it was his, ever since I was a kid.

721
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,540
Hee Sub, this...

722
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,639
This belongs to Yu Sub, right?

723
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,149
This is mine.

724
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,579
His brother was taken in by the police,

725
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,349
but he turned a blind eye and hid.

726
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,080
We were wrong.

727
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,989
