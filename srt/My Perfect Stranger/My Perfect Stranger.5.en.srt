Two days before the first murder.

One of the three suspects has already been arrested by the police.

7
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:52,931
And the other two suspects...

8
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:54,603
aren't showing any unusual movements.

9
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:58,472
When everything seemed to be getting more perplexing,

10
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:01,002
she arrived.

11
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:04,643
She was the first victim of the serial murder in Woojung-Ri.

12
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:06,273
It's her.

13
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:09,411
She will be your student teacher for a month.

14
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:10,882
Her name is Lee Ju Young.

15
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:12,152
- She's a fourth-year student... - Where did I...

16
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:13,352
- at Seoul National University, - see her?

17
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:15,483
What's the matter?

18
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:17,522
I just received a call from Principal Yoon.

19
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:20,222
He was supposed to meet Ms. Lee, but he can't get in touch with her.

20
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:22,563
I know this situation.

21
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,703
That day, I picked her at first sight.

22
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:33,102
My beautiful first victim.

23
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,343
Is she going to die?

24
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:37,912
How did you know that?

25
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,712
It hasn't even happened yet.

26
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,242
How did you know that, right here and right now?

30
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:55,522
Why did you say our encounter was not a coincidence?

31
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,233
If everything turns out to be true,

32
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,302
tonight...

33
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:11,873
So two nights before the death of the student teacher,

34
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:15,112
she suddenly disappeared.

35
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:18,013
Luckily, someone from the village found her.

36
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:20,913
People thought that she had simply gotten lost.

37
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:23,522
So it was just considered a small incident. But the truth was,

38
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,122
it seemed as if she was being chased by someone.

39
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,332
Do you know where...

40
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:38,703
she was found?

41
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:41,473
By the riverside.

42
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:44,973
It was close to the general store. So it should be around here.

43
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:48,443
Wait.

44
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:56,182
Ms. Lee.

45
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:03,362
- Ms. Lee. - No! It wasn't me!

46
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:31,412
Darn it.

47
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:40,992
What was that?

48
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:42,422
Were you trying to get yourself killed?

49
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:47,933
Mr. Yoon? You again?

50
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:50,332
Darn it.

51
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:52,803
Messing it up once wasn't enough?

52
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:55,303
Do you want to repeat that over and over again?

53
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:13,152
You let Ko Min Soo go?

54
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:15,292
Why?

55
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:19,792
I was just following orders.

56
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:24,232
Spoken like a responsible cop.

57
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,373
No wonder it happened. You did a shoddy job.

58
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:35,883
Let this be your only mistake.

59
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:39,013
You'd better hope this is the last mistake you make.

60
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,082
If luck isn't in our hands,

61
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,351
someone's life will be in danger again...

62
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,753
because of the jerk you released today.

63
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:50,522
Was that Ko Min Soo?

64
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,731
That jerk again.

65
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,162
You and the police have no excuses...

66
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:57,232
for whatever crime that jerk commits. You see that?

67
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:01,172
I'm well aware that releasing him was the stupidest idea!

68
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:03,303
So answer my question.

69
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,243
- Was that Ko Min Soo? - I don't know.

70
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,442
What? You don't know?

71
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:11,042
I don't know who that was or what this person tried to do.

72
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,752
Had I caught this individual, I could have found out.

73
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,922
Thanks to you, this individual got away. So I got nothing.

74
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:17,782
Even if I had known anything,

75
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:20,222
I wouldn't have shared it with an irresponsible cop.

76
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:26,162
So I truly hope that we don't run into each other again.

77
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:37,643
You...

78
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:41,113
were just lost?

79
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:43,082
Yes. I...

80
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,652
My sense of direction is bad at night.

81
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:48,552
I got scared for no reason.

82
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:50,152
No, there must have been a good reason.

83
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:53,123
Someone was there.

84
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:55,962
That someone even ran away.

85
00:06:57,123 --> 00:07:00,792
I'm not sure. I didn't even know someone was there.

86
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,263
To say that you didn't know, your reaction was quite particular.

87
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:11,613
Don't you remember?

88
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:14,172
You said it yourself that it wasn't you.

89
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:16,943
- Ms. Lee. - No! It wasn't me!

90
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,613
What did you mean by that?

91
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:23,022
Did someone blame you for something?

92
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:24,453
The jerk who ran away?

93
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,522
Do you know who that was?

94
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,323
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:35,433

I know that it's not easy to believe me,

97
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,503
but I'm trying to help you.

98
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,102
You must tell me the truth, so I can stop this.

99
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,041
If you were threatened, chased by someone,

100
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,042
or whatever this was,

101
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:48,982
you must tell me everything.

102
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:00,993

103
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,763
Thank you for looking out for me.

104
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,063
But you're truly mistaken.

105
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,703
No one chased me...

106
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:15,542
or threatened me.

107
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:19,612

Are you sure she should go home alone?

00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:32,493
Because there were three murder victims in total.

184
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,233
For over 30 years,

185
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:42,932
none of their bodies, let alone any traces, were found.

186
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,531
Even the police and the families of the victims don't know about it,

187
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:46,733
so how do you...

188
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:51,072
It may be hard to believe,

189
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:55,042
but I only told you the things that were written here.

190
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:02,781
("The People I Killed")

191
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:03,883
It's a novel...

192
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:07,192
written by Ko Mi Sook.

193
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:12,492
Ms. Ko, can you give us a spoiler...

194
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,032
for the novel you're currently writing?

195
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,003
It's sort of like a confession.

196
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,902
A confession?

197
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:23,843
The main character...

198
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:27,472
is someone who reveals the perfect crime...

199
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:30,013
someone committed 30 years ago.

200
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:33,583
They thought it was a waste to keep it to themselves...

201
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,123
their whole life.

202
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:41,551
If it was 30 years ago,

203
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,762
it must be around the timeline of this novel.

204
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:44,792
("Small Door")

205
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:47,792
I'm going to talk about myself for real this time.

206
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,603
I'm just kidding. Of course, they're all made-up.

207
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:54,733
I wrote it all there.

208
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:56,802
Of course.

209
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:58,613
You're so silly, Ms. Ko.

210
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:04,842
I was the editor in charge for Ko Mi Sook,

211
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:06,483
and I worked with her for a long time.

212
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:09,182
For Ko Mi Sook?

213
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:17,093
Thanks to that, I could read the manuscript of her novel...

214
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,932
that wasn't released.

215
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:22,902
I forgot all about it after coming here,

216
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,103
but I kept feeling this weird deja vu...

217
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,442
after seeing the student teacher.

218
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:30,772
So you reread the manuscript,

219
00:15:31,672 --> 00:15:33,572
and everything was just like the content of the novel?

220
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:39,052
I couldn't imagine that it was based on a true story.

221
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:42,022
Anyway, that's what was written in the manuscript.

222
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,353
Starting with that student teacher,

223
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:46,922
three women died.

224
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:50,192
And that the real culprit couldn't be caught until the end.

225
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:53,032
It talks about the real culprit?

226
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:55,932
The last sentence of the last paragraph on page two.

227
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:57,333
Go ahead and see for yourself.

228
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,733
"The truth wasn't revealed in the end."

229
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,902
"The one responsible for all these murders..."

230
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,503
Was me.

231
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:34,302
Even that joyful truth wasn't revealed.

232
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,633
Not having you around in this house...

233
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:10,873
is so nice.

234
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:37,202
("The People I Killed")

235
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,633
Do you really think Ko Mi Sook was behind them?

236
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:48,543
The real culprit wasn't caught in the end in real life, right?

237
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,242
He was caught.

238
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:53,211
He denied it to the end,

239
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:54,982
but we can never know what the truth is.

240
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:59,492
Right. That must be why she said such a thing.

241
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,722
She stole the story of her first novel from Mom.

242
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:05,793
And this was her actual story.

243
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:10,133
Then this could be a new piece of evidence.

244
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:13,232
We can be certain about that.

245
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:15,402
In any case, this is a novel,

246
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:17,941
and even if it's based on a true story,

247
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:20,043
she could've used her imagination to develop it further.

248
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,313
And the narrator of the novel...

249
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:26,012
We can't guarantee that she's Ko Mi Sook.

250
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:27,883
But we can't guarantee that she's not either.

251
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:30,982
You saw it too.

252
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:33,922
It even tells where the student teacher was hiding.

253
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,992
Someone who knows more than you about the cases.

254
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,363
That someone must be the culprit.

255
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,033
Since she's from the same town,

256
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,533
she could've written down the things she had heard and seen.

257
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,971
I did look into the cases,

258
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:53,373
but they were only official records.

259
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:55,383
Why do you keep saying that she's not the culprit?

260
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:58,143
Why do you keep trying to make her the culprit?

261
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:07,893
Do you want Ko Mi Sook to be the culprit?

262
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,292
You know her, so why do you...

263
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,732
That's why I'm suspicious of her.

264
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,303
The Ko Mi Sook that I know...

265
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:20,232
is more than capable of doing all of that.

266
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:26,712
What did you just say?

267
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:32,182
Are you asking me to marry you?

268
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:36,053
Sorry? When did I say that?

269
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:39,922
What? What was that about?

270
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,652
What? Marry her?

271
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:43,922
You haven't even dated her. What marriage?

272
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:45,592
You're still wet behind the ears.

273
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:47,633
That's why you made a mistake at such a young age!

274
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,001
When did you call her out to meet you alone?

275
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,032
- And at this hour! - Yoon Young!

276
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,273
What's wrong with you?

277
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:55,772
What mistake did I make? This is driving me crazy.

278
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,902
- I never said that! - Oh, my!

279
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,211
You said we should have a son and a daughter and live happily.

280
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:01,273
A son and a daughter?

281
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,242
- Soon Ae. - What's wrong with you?

282
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:06,652
Do you have a hard time understanding things?

283
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,981
When did I say we should live happily?

284
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:10,452
I said I wanted to live happily.

285
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,692
You asked me what my dream was, so I just said...

286
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:18,023
that I wanted a family of my own!

287
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:22,633
I'm sorry, but I'm already seeing a man.

288
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:24,501
So I can't accept your feelings.

289
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:25,732
- You're seeing a man? - You're seeing a man?

290
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:30,202
We're going to meet later in front of the teahouse.

291
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:31,972
There he is!

292
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:45,422
Are you saying that punk...

293
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:47,692
is your lover?

294
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,662
I thought he was her first love.

295
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:05,002
He is, and I just came to tell you that.

296
00:21:05,242 --> 00:21:06,242
Bye, then.

297
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,452
Also, I don't like flowers.

298
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:19,992
Bye.

299
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,661
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

300
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:28,662
Soon Ae.

301
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,462
Soon Ae.

302
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:40,512
You'll have to explain what I just saw.

303
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,553
I was going to tell you soon.

304
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:49,123
Is it...

305
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:51,783
your family?

306
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,093
In that earlier talk about 1 son and 1 daughter,

307
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:01,033
it looks like I'm the daughter.

308
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:06,432
You're the daughter of the suspect, Baek Hee Sub?

309
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:27,853
Gosh.

310
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:30,261
I'm so scared.

311
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:31,593
(Inn)

312
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:35,533
How could I report this?

313
00:22:38,762 --> 00:22:40,803
I can't get involved with the police.

314
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,972
I don't think I can stay here for long.

315
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:53,752
Yes.

316
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:01,722
Who on earth knows about me?

317
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:08,732
Okay.

318
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:22,343
(There is someone who is watching you.)

319
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:31,422
You must be confused.

320
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:35,722
I was quite shocked too.

321
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:39,662
It's ridiculous enough how I travelled back to 30 years ago.

322
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,833
The person who hit me is a time traveller,

323
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:44,633
and in front of his house, my mom's side of the family lives.

324
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:46,603
Goodness.

325
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,172
Why did you get into the school?

326
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:51,242
No.

327
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:54,242
Why did you do that at the teahouse?

328
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,283
Well, it's a little complicated.

329
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,422
I was at the teahouse to separate my mom and dad.

330
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:09,523
Separate who?

331
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:14,393
I just wanted to prevent my parents from meeting.

332
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:16,863
Then I got to stay there...

333
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,201
- Are you stupid? - What?

334
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:23,702
Fine. Let's say everything was a coincidence.

335
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:26,613
You got hit by a car out of the blue...

336
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:29,283
and woke up to your young parents in front of you.

337
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:32,212
And you thought of splitting them up?

338
00:24:33,212 --> 00:24:35,613
Haven't you thought about the consequences of that?

339
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:38,682
- You might not exist... - So what?

340
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:42,992
I'm sorry?

341
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,593
What about that?

342
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,033
You don't think I knew that?

343
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:59,741
On the first day I came here, you said my minor action...

344
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:01,742
could completely change someone's future.

345
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:06,283
So what?

346
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:12,323
You asked me...

347
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,762
what I was doing at the river before I got here.

348
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,662
(Police)

349
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:20,932
On that day at the river,

350
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,962
my mom abandoned us.

351
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,273
We had no right to resent her.

352
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:32,273
It might have been us...

353
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:34,672
who abandoned her first.

354
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:39,182
She only loved unrequitedly like a fool.

355
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,211
(Soon Ae)

356
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:44,822
She was naive enough to let her name be ignored.

357
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:45,992
(Soon Ae)

358
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:48,823
Maybe...

359
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,823
she realized one day...

360
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:56,202
that there were too many moments she couldn't undo.

361
00:25:56,863 --> 00:25:59,902
That it was too late.

362
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:04,073
That day at the river, I desperately wished...

363
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:07,672
that I had one chance.

364
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:14,113
"How nice would it be if I could change at least one moment?"

365
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:20,793
I might look stupid.

366
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,563
But I really don't care what happens to me.

367
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:31,062
My mom couldn't do anything...

368
00:26:31,063 --> 00:26:33,533
until she went to that river.

369
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,472
I wouldn't have endured the thought, anyway.

370
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:55,152
I'm sorry. I wasn't going to tell you all this.

371
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:56,363
Get inside.

372
00:26:57,123 --> 00:26:59,063
You better get some rest today.

373
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:05,702
Okay.

374
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:13,833
I should've asked about this.

375
00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:35,623
No way.

376
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:38,393
On that day at the river,

377
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:41,432
my mom abandoned us.

Where and when?

383
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:01,012
I saw this floating around by the riverside in this village.

384
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:04,083
I picked it up without thinking much about it.

385
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:07,823
Why was it there?

(Woojung-Ri Fishing Spot)

392
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:34,373
If this is about what I told you yesterday,

393
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:36,712
don't worry about it.

394
00:30:38,143 --> 00:30:40,053
It's my personal business,

395
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:42,783
so I will be careful not to affect what you're doing.

396
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,192
The word mom...

397
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:50,893
is not a heartrending word for me.

398
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:54,633
My mom gave birth to me...

399
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,202
and ran away without ever hugging me.

400
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:01,502
So I don't know how a mom feels.

401
00:31:02,972 --> 00:31:06,241
I don't even have a remote idea...

402
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:07,442
if her love is special or sentimental as others say.

403
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:09,682
I've never wanted to either.

404
00:31:11,113 --> 00:31:12,512
But I do know...

405
00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:16,952
that the person who is loved always knows, whoever they are.

406
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:26,832
You cared so much for your mom that you didn't care...

407
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,393
what happened to yourself.

408
00:31:29,192 --> 00:31:31,462
You don't think your mom knew that?

409
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:36,032
What do you mean...

410
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:38,303
Do you think she ended her life, knowing how much she loved you?

411
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:42,712
- What are you trying to say? - Listen carefully.

412
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:46,553
The first murder will take place tomorrow night.

413
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:48,982
And you will see an item you recognize.

414
00:31:58,162 --> 00:31:59,293
The matchbox.

415
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:11,472
And the note inside it.

(Women who read are dangerous.)

417
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:19,911
This is...

418
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:21,882
Back then, the police thought that the culprit left this note...

419
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:23,283
on purpose as the signature...

420
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,522
because the second victim...

421
00:32:26,523 --> 00:32:28,152
also had this note in possession.

422
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:30,323
It's the culprit's signature?

423
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:35,363
Then why...

424
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:38,902
Why did an item that was found at a murder scene 34 years ago...

425
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:42,633
show up at another murder scene in 2021?

426
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:45,472
Of all places,

427
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:49,883
why did it show up by the riverside where your mother died?

428
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:54,712
Are you saying...

429
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:57,823
I don't have any definitive proof.

430
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:01,692
Yes. It's possible that your mother didn't know...

431
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:04,522
how much you loved and treasured her.

432
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:06,093
But if...

433
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,932
there's a chance...

434
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:20,043
If your mother happened to see someone...

435
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:22,472
by the riverside that night...

436
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,313
And if that was the real culprit...

437
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:27,053
who was never caught 34 years ago...

438
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:32,783
Then you're making a terrible mistake.

439
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:36,793
It's unfair of you to hate yourself, and you were ready to give up.

440
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:39,762
Shouldn't you try to save your mom...

441
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:43,033
until the very last moment?

442
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:16,162
Yoon Young.

443
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:24,643
You were surprised last night, right?

444
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:26,543
Sorry.

445
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:29,881
I wasn't trying to lie to you...

446
00:34:29,882 --> 00:34:32,952
or date that guy, Baek Hee Sub.

447
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:37,983
Right.

448
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:40,492
How did I miss this?

449
00:34:41,452 --> 00:34:43,423
I would like to play with you...

450
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:46,632
for the rest of my life until I become a white-haired granny.

451
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:48,833
With love, Mom.

452
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,162
It wasn't a suicide note. It was a letter.

453
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,602
She promised me that...

454
00:34:54,603 --> 00:34:56,443
she would forever stay by my side...

455
00:34:57,673 --> 00:34:59,103
just like always.

456
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:04,313
How could I have misunderstood her intention this badly?

457
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,452
How could I...

458
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:11,083
fail to understand her until the very last moment?

459
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,722
Yoon Young.

460
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:16,362
Were you that disappointed?

461
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:21,563
I'm sorry.

462
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,531
Why do you always apologize to me?

463
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:28,632
It's me who didn't understand you.

464
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,802
No. I really didn't know either.

465
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,642
It was written on the note inside the matchbox.

466
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:36,943
He wanted to meet me at Bong Bong.

467
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:46,393
Don't worry.

468
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:49,393
I will...

469
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:52,991
protect you,

470
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:54,563
so you never have to go through a horrible thing like that.

471
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:57,403
I'll protect you no matter what.

472
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:00,572
Thank you.

473
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:04,072
But was it that horrible?

474
00:36:05,003 --> 00:36:07,773
Isn't it okay to drink some juice with him?

475
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:12,112
It's not like I'm going to marry Bum Ryong.

476
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:23,193
Ji Eun. What are they doing?

477
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:25,523
I don't know.

478
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:29,132
Our report cards are out. Maybe, Soon Ae's grades went down.

479
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:42,842
- Thank you. - Have a good day.

480
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:44,612
- Mr. Choi. - Yes.

481
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:46,781
Take it and eat it.

482
00:36:46,782 --> 00:36:47,952
- Thank you. - Sure.

483
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:50,781
- Okay. - You see,

484
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:53,122
- Yes. - my son sent this from the US.

485
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,353
From the US?

486
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,122
What do you think? Doesn't this look fancy?

487
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:57,162
- Goodness. - Right?

488
00:36:57,623 --> 00:37:00,631
It does look different. Is it because it's from the US?

489
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,761
- You can feel it too. - Thank you.

490
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,103
Then you're making a terrible mistake.

491
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:09,032
It's unfair of you to hate yourself, and you were ready to give up.

492
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:15,142
Goodness.

493
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:17,881
Oh, my. This feels amazing!

494
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,781
I didn't have to be that harsh.

495
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:22,882
I should have been nicer to her. Goodness.

496
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:25,451
- Right. - That's a huge country indeed.

497
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,923
Because it's a big country, the flowers are big too.

498
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:30,122
- The leaves are big too. Nice. - Yes.

499
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,362
- Hello. - You're here.

500
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:35,532
That's what I thought too.

501
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:38,701
By the time you have to throw this out...

502
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:40,132
Why would I throw it out?

503
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:43,003
Ms. Lee, come over here.

504
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:46,102
I'm going to give you some precious jelly.

505
00:37:46,103 --> 00:37:48,612
It flew over to Korea on a 14-hour flight. Come.

506
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:49,912
Okay.

507
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:54,012
I didn't tell anyone about last night.

508
00:37:58,382 --> 00:38:00,322
Can you grab one for me too?

509
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:02,992
Pardon?

510
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:06,123
The jelly from the US.

511
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:10,733
Sure.

512
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:14,072
Thank you.

513
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:17,841
- It's sweet, right? - It is definitely from the US.

514
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,543
Come here. All right.

515
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:22,173
- Try some of this. - Thank you.

516
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:25,841
- My grades went down. - Mine stayed the same.

517
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:28,082
- I might get scolded. - Seriously. Am I ranked last?

518
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,083
I guessed a lot of questions.

519
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:30,182
(Midterm Rankings for Seniors: Lee Soon Ae, Ko Mi Sook...)

520
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,882
- I can't believe this. - I did a good job at guessing them.

521
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:34,023
First place?

522
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:36,193
- First place. - His ranking stayed the same.

523
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:37,522
I'll go back to the classroom.

524
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,092
- This is a miracle. - Goodness.

525
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:40,193
No way.

526
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:43,503
I had no idea you were at the top of your class.

527
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:46,603
Goodness. I'm so proud of you!

528
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:49,503
How did you get first place?

529
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:54,213
- First place in the entire school! - Gosh.

530
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:56,682
First place!

531
00:38:57,813 --> 00:38:59,083
- First place! - Goodness.

532
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:01,412
- Our rankings are up. Darn it. - Gosh.

533
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:16,262
You got the highest grades!

534
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:18,103
I guessed most of them.

535
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:19,261
Hey.

536
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:20,403
Soon Ae won first place?

537
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:26,813
Of course, she's upset.

538
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,782
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.

539
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:34,782
Goodness. Seriously?

540
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:42,693
What a way to make students with bad grades feel awful.

541
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:48,833
Get out of my way.

00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:02,173
You pretended as if you bombed the exams.

543
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:06,313
That's what Lee Soon Ae does.

544
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,112
Are you that happy?

545
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:10,181
Should I put this poster on your forehead...

546
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:11,221
for everyone to see?

547
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:12,522
- That crazy... - Yoon Young.

548
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:13,952
That crazy girl. Kim Hae Kyung!

549
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:19,193
- Hey, you're in trouble - Hurry.

550
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:23,563
Kim Hae Kyung!

551
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:25,932
Get back in your classrooms.

552
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:28,031
- I hate her. - I'm so sick of her.

553
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:29,572
- What's wrong with that girl? - I know, right?

554
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:32,202
- Let's go. - I'm so sick of her.

555
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:38,313
Bring that back!

556
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:47,023
(School Regulations)

557
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:48,893
This is an interesting school.

558
00:40:50,293 --> 00:40:51,893
I guess there's only a notice for the student ranked last.

559
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:05,242
Why would she like someone like him?

560
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:09,012
What does she see in him?

561
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:17,482
(College Entrance Exam Part 1)

562
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:20,123
I didn't know I could use this math expression for this.

563
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:22,892
This is so fun.

564
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:25,293
Yoo Bum Ryong, you ranked last.

565
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:27,762
Please get a grip.

566
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:29,862
Gosh. Darn it!

567
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:33,063
This guy is such a loser! Unbelievable.

568
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:37,143
What's wrong with you?

569
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:49,112
Nothing.

570
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:51,123
Forget it.

571
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,653
I don't want to lose a friend.

572
00:41:56,793 --> 00:41:57,862
Don't tell me...

573
00:41:59,523 --> 00:42:00,932
things didn't go well last night.

574
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:03,132
The flower I gave you didn't do the trick?

575
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:08,432
What is that?

576
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:12,342
Why go through so much trouble to pick them yourself?

577
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,342
Flowers from the store are way prettier.

578
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:17,782
Gosh, seriously.

579
00:42:19,742 --> 00:42:20,882
Take it.

580
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:26,282
Women don't like such things because they're pathetic.

581
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:31,492
Is that so?

582
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:33,963
By the way,

583
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:35,261
you're really not going to tell me...

584
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,293
to whom you're confessing your feelings?

585
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:40,632
Well, I told you...

586
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:43,802
that I'd tell you if things worked out.

587
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,472
Okay. Good luck.

588
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:47,713
Thanks for this.

589
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:51,182
- Hee Sub, good luck. - Yes?

590
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:53,983
Flower, my foot.

591
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,253
Did your... What is it?

592
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:03,693
Did your girlfriend like it?

593
00:43:04,592 --> 00:43:06,023
Of course.

594
00:43:06,563 --> 00:43:08,362
She always says she doesn't like it,

595
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,202
but it actually means she likes it.

596
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:11,962
She's just being coy.

597
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:14,833
No means no. Why don't you take her word for it?

598
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:20,173
Wait. You said you'd give her just one flower.

599
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:23,782
You gave me one. Where is the other one?

600
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:26,112
Oh, that?

601
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:28,552
Well, I...

602
00:43:30,123 --> 00:43:31,923
used it well.

603
00:43:32,923 --> 00:43:34,153
Hello.

604
00:44:25,302 --> 00:44:27,213
Why do you think it's not Ko Mi SooK?

605
00:44:30,282 --> 00:44:33,512
If the culprit of the serial murder case...

606
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,213
committed a murder again 34 years later...

607
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:38,952
and caused my mom's death,

608
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:43,722
then I think there's a higher chance that Ko Mi Sook is the culprit.

609
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:45,423
That could be the case.

610
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:47,862
But what about the man...

611
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:50,562
from last night who was stalking the student teacher but fled?

612
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,563
Who could he be?

613
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:56,373
I think that's the guy I've been waiting for.

614
00:44:58,103 --> 00:44:59,302
All this time,

615
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:02,412
I waited, thinking the answer lay in the path that Ms. Lee took.

616
00:45:03,273 --> 00:45:05,643
The path Ms. Lee took the night she was murdered.

617

(Forward with our autonomy, creativity, and intelligence)

618
00:45:07,782 --> 00:45:10,522
That night, after she was done with her work,

619
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,353
she left school at 10pm.

00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,592
(Bong Bong Teahouse)

622
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:20,362
The place she headed straight to...

623
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:23,903
was Bong Bong Teahouse, the teahouse we went to last night.

624
00:45:35,643 --> 00:45:36,713
Welcome.

625
00:45:40,713 --> 00:45:44,052
She stayed there for 20 minutes, and at 10:30pm,

626
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:45,853
she left the teahouse.

627
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:49,653
Naturally, she headed to Woojung Inn next.

628
00:46:00,202 --> 00:46:03,702
But that night, Ms. Lee never made it to the inn.

(Bong Bong Teahouse)

632
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:23,221
Even if you walk slowly, it takes only three minutes...

633
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:24,293
to the inn from the teahouse.

634
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:27,293
She disappeared within that short distance.

635
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:29,963
And her body was discovered the next day.

636
00:46:30,903 --> 00:46:34,003
There were no witnesses within that short distance?

637
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:37,943
There's no one who saw whom she ran into or met.

638
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:40,912
That's why I'm planning to witness that myself.

639
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:44,443
At the same time, in the same place,

640
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:46,483
and on her path,

641
00:46:46,882 --> 00:46:48,782
I'll be right behind Ms. Lee.

642
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:52,623
Then I'll be able to run into the man in a blue hat again.

643
00:46:53,322 --> 00:46:54,393
A blue hat?

644
00:46:54,923 --> 00:46:57,293
The 20 minutes Ms. Lee spent in the teahouse.

647
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,943
They were arguing?

648
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,643
He was very suspicious,

649
00:47:19,342 --> 00:47:22,083
but the police couldn't find out who he was until the end.

650
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:26,983
But the man I was pursuing last night was wearing a blue hat.

651
00:47:34,132 --> 00:47:36,532
I'm not saying I'll leave Ko Mi Sook out completely.

652
00:47:37,162 --> 00:47:39,063
I'll keep her in mind and keep an eye on her.

653
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:40,802
But...

654
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:43,503
we can't suspect her yet.

655
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:49,112
I'll make sure to catch the culprit here the right way.

656
00:47:50,173 --> 00:47:53,753
The culprit won't be able to kill anyone...

657

but he said that on purpose so I could hear it.

00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:50,912
Mr. Yoon,

722
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:53,813
you could've died because of that woman.

723
00:52:54,612 --> 00:52:55,682
Do you know that?

724
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,382
Hey, go and get her. Don't let her get away.

725
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:02,253
- Yes, sir. Let's go. - Yes, sir. Come on.

726
00:53:21,143 --> 00:53:22,213
Darn it.

727
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,112
My foot.

728
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:35,393
Why is she so fast?

729
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:37,762
She's tiring me out. Gosh.

730
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:41,431
I swear. They said I could become Miss Korea...

731
00:53:41,432 --> 00:53:43,733
if I paid 500 dollars.

732
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:46,833
What the...

733
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:49,173
Five hundred dollars, my foot.

734
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:52,002
Even with 5,000 dollars, you could never...

735
00:53:52,003 --> 00:53:53,972
become Miss Korea, you brat.

736
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:55,912
Why not?

737
00:53:56,373 --> 00:53:57,612
Why can't I?

738
00:53:58,282 --> 00:53:59,313
Father,

739
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,682
I'm the Kim Wan Sun of Woojung-Ri. Got that?

740
00:54:02,912 --> 00:54:03,983
Don't I look like her right now?

741
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:05,523
What did you say?

742
00:54:13,162 --> 00:54:14,463
The oriental melon is laughing, you brat.

743
00:54:14,532 --> 00:54:15,733
You're so annoying.

744
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:17,732
- Oh, my gosh. - When can I catch...

745
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:18,733
the quickest bus to Seoul?

746
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:19,733
You startled me.

747
00:54:20,503 --> 00:54:21,902
It'll be here in five minutes.

748
00:54:21,903 --> 00:54:23,632
- Can I get a token? - A token?

749
00:54:24,202 --> 00:54:25,302
Hold on.

750
00:54:26,173 --> 00:54:27,643
- Gosh. - Let me see.

751
00:54:28,112 --> 00:54:29,212
Please hurry.

752
00:54:29,213 --> 00:54:31,511
Why is everyone running around all sweaty?

753
00:54:31,512 --> 00:54:32,583
What?

754
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:36,983
- Darn it. - Ms. Lee, hold on!

755
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,322
Hey, grab her!

756
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,122
How dare that weasel order me around?

757
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:44,892
- That hurts. - But I'm going to listen to her.

758
00:54:44,893 --> 00:54:45,962
- Gosh. - Let go.

759
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:47,931
Let go. Hey!

760
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:49,192
- Oh, my. - Ms. Lee.

761
00:54:49,193 --> 00:54:50,392
- Let go! - Hold on!

762
00:54:50,393 --> 00:54:51,661
- Please, Ms. Lee. - Let go!

763
00:54:51,662 --> 00:54:52,662
Please.

764
00:54:55,273 --> 00:54:57,202
I don't know why you're acting like this,

765
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:00,603
but you have to stay here tonight. All right?

766
00:55:01,112 --> 00:55:02,543
That way, we can catch the criminal.

767
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:05,313
Obviously.

768
00:55:09,612 --> 00:55:10,753
That language teacher is coming too.

769
00:55:14,592 --> 00:55:15,653
Oh, my.

770
00:55:16,722 --> 00:55:18,193
Oh, my goodness.

771
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,732
- So it was you guys. - Ms. Lee.

772
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:25,132
I knew you were watching me every night.

773
00:55:25,862 --> 00:55:27,702
It's also not a coincidence that you guys found me...

774
00:55:28,773 --> 00:55:30,003
under the bridge that night.

775
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:32,341
You planned this all from the start...

776
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,042
in order to hand me over to the police, didn't you?

777
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:35,373
There's a misunderstanding here.

778
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:38,043
Please calm down and put down that knife.

779
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:40,443
I can't trust anyone.

780
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,312
You dirty spies.

781
00:55:43,313 --> 00:55:44,653
You have to believe me.

782
00:55:45,483 --> 00:55:46,552
We're...

783
00:55:47,182 --> 00:55:48,923
trying to help you.

784
00:55:51,722 --> 00:55:52,793
What in the world?

785
00:55:57,262 --> 00:55:58,403
Let go of me!

786
00:56:00,603 --> 00:56:02,132
Ms. Lee, please!

787
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:07,673
The cops are coming, so please be quiet.

788
00:56:08,572 --> 00:56:10,882
Sir, is there a place we can hide?

789
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,813
Go inside here.

790
00:56:14,112 --> 00:56:15,112
Go ahead.

791
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,503
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

792
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:35,373
I'm fine.

793
00:56:36,373 --> 00:56:37,532
Are you?

794
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:39,342
Yes, I am.

795
00:56:43,643 --> 00:56:44,682
I'm not sure.

796
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:48,213
The bus has already left. I don't know who you're talking about.

797
00:56:49,813 --> 00:56:53,653
We just kept talking about Miss Korea here.

798
00:56:56,492 --> 00:56:57,722
Hello.

799
00:56:59,063 --> 00:57:01,592
I told you, didn't I? You can never become Miss Korea.

800
00:57:02,432 --> 00:57:05,802
Well didn't I tell you that I'm the Kim Wan Sun of Woojung-Ri?

801
00:57:11,673 --> 00:57:12,702
Let's check the inn again.

802
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:14,313
- What? Okay. - Yes, sir.

803
00:57:17,612 --> 00:57:20,483
- Gosh. - I cut it for you, you brat.

804
00:57:22,253 --> 00:57:23,253
Why did you...

805
00:57:31,623 --> 00:57:32,963
It's all because of me.

806
00:57:33,523 --> 00:57:35,992
I made a wrong judgement, which led to an unexpected issue.

807
00:57:37,903 --> 00:57:41,903
I think it'll be dangerous to send her back to the inn tonight.

808
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:46,043
You're right. We should take her somewhere safe first...

809
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:57,653
I thought I was alone.

810
00:58:00,952 --> 00:58:02,753
I was so scared.

811
00:58:04,362 --> 00:58:05,463
I'm sorry.

812
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:08,362
I'm so sorry.

813
00:58:23,043 --> 00:58:25,112
Will you be okay alone?

814
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,412
I'm just going to see his face.

815

(Bong Bong Teahouse, Coffee and Tea)

816
00:58:54,242 --> 00:58:55,643
If we're lucky,

817
00:58:57,012 --> 00:58:58,342
even without Ms. Lee,

818
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:00,611
he could appear...

819
00:59:00,612 --> 00:59:02,612
at the same location and time.

820
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:35,382
If you get lucky,

821
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:37,452
please...

822
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:39,782
get a glimpse of his face.

823
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:41,722
Because he'll become...

824
00:59:42,452 --> 00:59:45,722
the person who kills my mom in 34 years.

825
01:01:09,813 --> 01:01:10,912
Darn it.

(My Perfect Stranger)

828
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:46,212
He was one of the suspects...

829
01:01:46,213 --> 01:01:47,812
and the hidden owner of the blue cap.

830
01:01:47,813 --> 01:01:49,411
Even his movements...

831
01:01:49,412 --> 01:01:51,983
make him the prime suspect, Baek Hee Sub.

832
01:01:52,483 --> 01:01:54,753
If the owner of the blue cap is the real criminal,

833
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:56,051
that means...

834
01:01:56,052 --> 01:01:58,262
he killed her mother and his own wife.

835
01:01:58,393 --> 01:02:00,562
The blue cap is...

836
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:03,131
I know. I saw it with my own eyes.

837
01:02:03,132 --> 01:02:05,661
I never imagined he would do such a thing.

838
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:07,462
He's just one of the suspects.

839
01:02:07,463 --> 01:02:10,273
Are you saying the man with the blue cap is my father?

840
01:02:10,403 --> 01:02:11,443
What?

841
01:02:16,072 --> 01:02:17,172
No way.

(Epilogue)

843
01:02:18,313 --> 01:02:19,382
How could you...

844
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:24,112
How...

845
01:02:25,483 --> 01:02:27,722
How could you deceive everyone after doing such a thing?

846
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:31,293
Don't come near me.

847
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:36,662
Don't come near me!
