1
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,439
Mom

2
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,159
What happened?

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,239
Yiran

4
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,719
My heart...

5
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
The doctor said I only have a few days left.

6
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,799
I just hope that before I go,

7
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,319
I can see you have a happy family.

8
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,120
Mom

9
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,400
This is my boyfriend.

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,680
I've been busy with work.

11
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,439
So I haven't had a chance to tell you.

12
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,200
Enough already.

13
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,319
We both use the internet.

14
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,200
We already knew.

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,439
You know,

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,480
even if you don't want to marry Xiao Li,

17
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,200
you can't just bring home some random guy.

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
And cause a scandal.

19
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,480
Aren't you just degrading yourself?

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,719
What do you mean, "random guy"?

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,519
Uncle, I...

22
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,359
You, be quiet.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,480
This isn't your place to speak.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
Yiran, hurry up and get us some money.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Honey

26
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,280
Don't be so harsh with the child.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,079
Yiran knows what she's doing.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,599
What does she know?

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,319
Look at how sick you are now.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
Can she really come up with the money?

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
Auntie is so seriously ill,

32
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,799
why isn't she in the ICU?

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,719
Mom

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,599
Are you doing this to pressure me into marriage again?

35
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,960
Are you putting on an act for me?

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,240
What?

37
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,439
Acting

38
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,280
Why is your mind always on acting?

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,879
You go

40
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,240
Go, go act in your play

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,599
Look at you, why is your life so hard?

42
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,159
We worked so hard to raise our daughter

43
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,360
But what's the use?

44
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,680
Dad, let's talk back in the hospital room

45
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,120
No, we'll talk right here

46
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,360
Let's make things clear now

47
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,400
Give me a straight answer

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,599
Your mom is this sick

49
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,680
Are you going to pay or not?

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
And you're supposed to be a big star

51
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,919
So unfilial

52
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,919
Yeah

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,759
Her mom is so seriously ill

54
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,599
And she's so indifferent

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
Truly heartless

56
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,479
Do you not have any money?

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
If you don't have money

58
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,159
Then you should

59
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,879
Hurry up and marry someone rich

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,319
Get money to treat your mom

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,919
I think that young Mr. Li is pretty good

62
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,400
Auntie is so seriously ill

63
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,719
Why are you two still arguing here?

64
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,360
None of your business

65
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,439
We've been discovered.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,560
He's just a designated driver.

67
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,560
Can he even support you?

68
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,879
I can support him.

69
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,199
You want to support him?

70
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,439
Where would you get the money?

71
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,159
If you had money,

72
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,400
you should cure your mom's illness first.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Kid, let me tell you something.

74
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,759
As a man,

75
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,680
I can understand why you'd want to live off a woman.

76
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,280
But as your father, I advise you

77
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,039
to give up on that idea as soon as possible.

78
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,039
Dad, what are you saying?

79
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,800
Yiran,

80
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,159
it would be great if you married Li Tianhao.

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,039
You'd be a wealthy lady without any worries.

82
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
You don't have any acting jobs now anyway.

83
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm your real mother, would I ever harm you?

84
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,439
Your conscience might not harm her,

85
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,159
but your ignorance might.

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,639
Auntie,

87
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,599
what gives you the right to talk to me like that?

88
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,360
I just saw your medical scans.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,919
I didn't realize your illness was this serious.

90
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,439
Look here,

91
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:53,919
the heart,

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,599
liver, and stomach

93
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
all show shadows.

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,400
What does that mean?

95
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,960
What does this mean?

96
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,319
You—stop trying to curry favor here.

97
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
It's useless. Just be quiet, be quiet.

98
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,479
What does this mean?

99
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,639
It means you often get angry, causing your energy channels to become blocked.

100
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,240
Auntie, let me guess.

101
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,240
When you wake up in the middle of the night,

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,840
do you have a dry mouth and chest tightness?

103
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,960
And irregular heartbeat?

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,240
How did you know that?

105
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,319
I saw it from your scans.

106
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,960
You have deficiencies in both energy and blood.

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
Your heart pulse is weak.

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,759
For this kind of illness, anger is the worst thing.

109
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,480
Just imagine,

110
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,279
if, without realizing it,

111
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,040
you get angry,

112
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,920
and as a result, you still lose your mother because of it,

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,759
wouldn't that be harming her?

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,399
Is it really that serious?

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
My mom is really sick.

116
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
Your mom snores when she sleeps.

117
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,439
Are you lying to me?

118
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,600
Auntie, at a time like this,

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,959
would I lie to you?

120
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:36,959
Look,

121
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,879
after you got anxious just now,

122
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,000
didn't you get a bit of a headache?

123
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,319
My head...

124
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,240
Are you feeling dizzy?

125
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,959
Everything you said is true—my hands, my hands...

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,680
Let go, Auntie, don't worry.

127
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,759
Don't listen to his nonsense, dear.

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,839
You be quiet.

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,639
Xiaoye, how do I treat this?

130
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,399
Auntie, don't worry.

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,879
I'll prescribe you some herbal medicine.

132
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,000
Just take a few courses and you'll be fine.

133
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
But you must absolutely remember,

134
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,360
do not get angry.

135
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,920
Especially, do not pressure anyone to get married.

136
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,079
Thank you for today.

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,920
Cheers.

138
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,199
Taking the pulse

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,279
Prescribing medicine

140
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,000
How do you even know how to do these things?

141
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,879
Maybe because

142
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,279
I used to be

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,279
an old traditional Chinese doctor who helped people

144
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,839
An old Chinese doctor?

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
You saw it yourself today

146
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,959
This is my life

147
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,879
Isn't it pretty bad?

148
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,160
My parents

149
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
have never really cared about me

150
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,279
They just see me

151
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,519
as a money tree

152
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,040
and always want to control my life

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,759
I remember

154
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,319
once when I was filming

155
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,040
it was pouring rain

156
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,879
and I came down with a high fever

157
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,600
The crew told me to take a couple of days off

158
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,079
But my mom

159
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,439
was afraid I'd delay the shoot and break the contract

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,079
so she forced me to go to the set

161
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,399
I ended up fainting at the doorstep

162
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,879
My dad even thought I was faking it

163
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,759
just to slack off

164
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,360
Why am I even telling you all this?

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,759
It's all in the past now

166
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,240
Even though the lead female role was taken by someone else

167
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,240
I can start over

168
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,600
and work hard to get a new role

169
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,439
I can't talk about this anymore

170
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
If I keep talking, I'll cry

171
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,560
Let's have a drink

172
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,040
Don't go

173
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,240
Mom

174
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,120
Don't go, Mom

175
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,079
Don't leave me alone

176
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,800
I promise I'll make money for you

177
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,879
Why does something strange happen every time I get close to her

178
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,639
and strange images always appear?

179
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
Wake up.

180
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,279
Today is the eye-opening launch event.

181
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
We have to go.

182
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,840
I've already been replaced.

183
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Why should I still go?

184
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,080
I just want to give it a try.

185
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,159
Because today, there's someone

186
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,440
very important coming.

187
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,639
Alright, I'll go change.

188
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,440
And get ready.

189
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,519
Why is she still coming here?

190
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,080
Exactly.

191
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,039
Does she even have the right to be here?

192
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,759
Thank you.

193
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,639
So shameless.

194
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,600
Look over here, look here!

195
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,039
She thinks she deserves to be here?

196
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,879
Yeah.

197
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,120
Long time no see, long time no see.

198
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:10,960
It's been a while.

199
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,480
New boyfriend? Is it official?

200
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,279
Really?

201
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,440
Song Yiran.

202
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,960
Why are you here?

203
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,200
You've already been replaced.

204
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,799
Still not giving up?

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,080
I know.

206
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,600
You really, really want to be in this movie.

207
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,080
I understand how you feel.

208
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,519
But without me,

209
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,120
you can't make it happen.

210
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,320
Don't worry, Yiran.

211
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,000
With your popularity and talent,

212
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,279
the investors will make their own decisions.

213
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,600
Let me tell you now,

214
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,279
the entertainment industry is all about fame and fortune.

215
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,399
There are plenty of talented people out there.

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,799
Not everyone can be the leading lady.

217
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,559
Yeah, the entertainment industry is huge.

218
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,399
Does your Li family think they can control everything?

219
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
Well, sorry to say,

220
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,120
our Li family really does have that power.

221
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,799
You don't know President Su, do you?

222
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,080
The main investor.

223
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,360
So, do you think

224
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,679
she'll listen to me

225
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,240
or to you?

226
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,039
If you

227
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,080
agree to marry me,

228
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,039
I'll definitely put in a good word with Mr. Su.

229
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,639
The lead female role will still be yours.

230
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,240
Thank you.

231
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,480
No need.

232
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,759
Mr. Su, this way please.

233
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,279
Mr. Su.

234
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,159
Mr. Su.

235
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
The latest casting proposal—

236
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,120
Have you seen it?

237
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,759
Yue Linglong is the most suitable for the lead female role.

238
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,600
You don't need to ask me about these things.

239
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,559
You and your son can handle the details.

240
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm only responsible for the investment.

241
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,840
Thank you, Mr. Su, for your support.

242
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,720
This way, please.

243
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,840
Hello, Mr. Su.

244
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,399
I think, as a film investor,

245
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,320
what should be considered more is

246
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,559
the quality and market of the film,

247
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,919
not just the profit.

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,679
Wait, hold on.

249
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,120
Who do you think you are?

250
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,759
Are you lecturing Mr. Su?

251
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,879
Go on.

252
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,200
First,

253
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,120
a lot of promotion has already been done for the film.

254
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,080
Changing the lead at the last minute is inappropriate.

255
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,039
Your previous films have all had great reputations.

256
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,759
Casting suitability is the most important thing.

257
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,840
In terms of appearance,

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,559
Song Yiran is also more suitable.

259
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
So you mean

260
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,000
What I mean is

261
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,639
to keep Song Yiran as the female lead.

262
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,879
Maintain the original casting.

263
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,600
What do you think?

264
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,120
Who do you think you are?

265
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,080
Why should Mr. Su listen to you?

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,360
Who do you think you are?

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,240
Listen to him.

268
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,519
Switch the female lead back to Song Yiran.

269
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,399
Done.

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,679
I... I don't think Song Yiran is suitable.

271
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,559
What's your reason?

272
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,840
Look,

273
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,120
I'm only thinking about the project.

274
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,000
She's surrounded by negative news right now.

275
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,240
Plus, the contract termination issue.

276
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,120
I don't care about any of the risks.

277
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
I'll take responsibility for any consequences.

278
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,320
We'll use Song Yiran as the female lead.

279
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
Look at him again.

280
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,759
He's just a lousy driver.

281
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,799
Living off her.

282
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,399
How can we use someone like that?

283
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,840
Why should we listen to him?

284
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,799
Because I believe in him.

285
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,399
And one more thing.

286
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,559
What you just said,

287
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,480
I hope it's the last time I hear it.

288
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,559
Just you wait.

289
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,519
Thank you, President Su.

290
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
How will you thank me?

291
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,080
I'm always grateful and repay kindness.

292
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,559
However you want me to thank you, I will.

293
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,360
Come to my house at 3 p.m.

294
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:56,919
Come alone.
