1
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,519
You not only controlled Yiran,

2
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,319
but also hypnotized everyone at the scene.

3
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,640
You made them forget about this incident.

4
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,120
If Master’s death was found to be suspicious,

5
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,840
you would use Yiran to take the blame.

6
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,560
So,

7
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,359
that video is real.

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
I just don’t remember it at all.

9
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,920
Because you were controlling me.

10
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,480
You went to great lengths to stage such a big act.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
It must have been hard for you all.

12
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,000
When did you start planning all this?

13
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,560
From the moment I realized you were using Yiran as bait.

14
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,599
You made Yiran take action.

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,560
And you caused Master’s death yourself.

16
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,439
Then you arranged for someone to run me over.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,960
But you didn't expect this, did you?

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,240
I survived.

19
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,039
Actually, Mr. Li was also your puppet.

20
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,719
When we exposed him,

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,520
Let's go.

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,199
You were worried your identity would be revealed.

23
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,080
So you decided to eliminate all threats.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
It was the same with Mr. Feng.

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,840
When you found out he wasn't dead,

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
you sent San'er to the hospital to poison him.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,120
No wonder every dream felt so real.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,319
It even hurt a lot after waking up.

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,039
You claimed to be avenging the Ouyang family.

30
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,120
But in reality, you were after the four families' keys.

31
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,319
But you didn't know where Mr. Ma's key was.

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
So you staged

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,759
a fake kidnapping of yourself and Mr. Ma.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,159
Then you encouraged Mr. Ma

35
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,639
to give the key to me.

36
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,680
And then I gave it to you.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,080
It was only safe with you.

38
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,000
Then you kidnapped Yiran again.

39
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,439
Forcing me to hand the key over to you.

40
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,840
Isn't that right, Senior Sister?

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,360
You manipulated Yiran.

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,719
And manipulated San'er.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,000
They were the people I trusted most.

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,319
Did Master not choose you as the successor,

45
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,919
and that's why you hate me so much?

46
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,599
Even without you,

47
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,560
Master still wouldn't have chosen me.

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,960
He found out I was from Dongchuan.

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,599
Even though I grew up here,

50
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,360
he was still deeply prejudiced against me.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
That's why I left the mountain to go into business.

52
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,479
Senior Sister,

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,879
why did you do something so

54
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,360
disrespectful to our master and ancestors?

55
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,199
You should turn yourself in.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,840
Turn myself in?

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,840
Do you really think you can control me?

58
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,479
Lao Kai, I'll leave it to you.

59
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,879
Senior Sister.

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,279
Leaving without saying a word?

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,879
Why are you running so fast?

62
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,879
Because I'm not as busy as President Su.

63
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,439
I used to work as a bodyguard.

64
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,120
I had to work out every day.

65
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,519
It seems, Junior Brother,

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,839
you're determined to catch me.

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,519
You've betrayed your master and ancestors.

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,560
Heaven will not tolerate it.

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,240
Come on.

70
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,920
Let's settle this once and for all.

71
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,600
The four major groups are all mine now.

72
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,759
No one can stop me.

73
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,319
I know they've already taken your side.

74
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,360
But I've already taken deep control over them.

75
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,519
Only the antidote can wake them up.

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,360
If you want the antidote,

77
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,920
bring me President Ma's key in exchange.

78
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,160
It seems you know me well, Senior Sister.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Alright.

80
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,360
Where's the antidote?

81
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,079
Brother Kai

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,680
President Ye

83
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,639
What's wrong with me?

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,199
I was just at the door a moment ago.

85
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
How did I suddenly end up here?

86
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,120
Brother Kai

87
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,759
You're just like me.

88
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,439
You were also controlled by Su Mingzhu.

89
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,680
Controlled?

90
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,519
I just had a dream.

91
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,639
I even dreamed I beat up my brothers.

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,879
Brother Kai

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,279
It wasn't a dream, it was real.

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,519
The brothers all ended up in the hospital.

95
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,040
Sorry, brother.

96
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,240
It's okay, Brother Kai.

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,879
If it was really you who hit me,

98
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,240
you still couldn't beat me.

99
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,480
Lu Bing, Lu Qing

100
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,240
Even though you were controlled before,

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,000
you still broke the law.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,319
You should go to the police and turn yourselves in.

103
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,120
After everything is handled according to the law,

104
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,560
you can go anywhere you want.

105
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,959
Or you can come with me.

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,240
We’re willing to follow Brother Wuming.

107
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,240
Brother

108
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,839
So many beautiful women are following you.

109
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,079
Isn't that right, sister-in-law?

110
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,519
So many beautiful women are following him.

111
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,040
Aren't you all even happier?

112
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,959
I'm happy.

113
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:13,959
Are you happy?

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,879
Happy? Stop pretending.

115
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,639
You must be happy.

116
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,639
Brother Kai, are you happy?

117
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,360
Mr. Ma

118
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,560
You're letting your anger get the best of you.

119
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,800
Please try to relax.

120
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,439
There will definitely be a way to resolve this.

121
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,920
All four major groups have been taken over by Su Mingzhu.

122
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,120
She now controls assets worth hundreds of billions.

123
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,079
How can I possibly relax?

124
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,040
And to think I trusted her so much before.

125
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,319
I never expected this.

126
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,399
It was all a scam.

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,040
Her true identity has already been exposed.

128
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,920
How does she still dare to be so arrogant?

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,759
That's exactly what worries me the most.

130
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,680
She has offended a lot of people now.

131
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,079
She’s also afraid that the young men will seek revenge.

132
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,600
She definitely can't stay here anymore.

133
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,079
I suspect

134
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,000
her next move will be to transfer assets overseas.

135
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,920
Mr. Ma

136
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,800
You suspect she's planning to run away?

137
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,480
Yes.

138
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,480
If assets worth hundreds of billions are moved,

139
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,160
plus all the affiliated downstream companies,

140
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:15,279
at least hundreds of thousands of employees will be affected.

141
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,759
The consequences would be severe.

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,879
Look,

143
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,079
I've been sending people to investigate recently.

144
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
In the past few months, Su Mingzhu

145
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,439
has been trading frequently in the capital markets.

146
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,120
She can't just transfer this money easily.

147
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,759
It's very likely

148
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
she'll convert it into valuable assets and take them away.

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,240
Mr. Su

150
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,159
Everything has been bought.

151
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,120
A total of eight billion.

152
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,360
Store them in the warehouse first.

153
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,480
Once the key arrives,

154
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,039
send everything overseas.

155
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,799
Yes.

156
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,000
Young man,

157
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,440
My contact inside Mingzhu Group sent word.

158
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,919
Su Mingzhu is preparing to move a batch of valuable treasures

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,840
abroad.

160
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,759
Everything is ready now.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,279
We're just waiting for a key.

162
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,720
A key?

163
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:10,840
That must be

164
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,639
the key to her plan to transfer assets.

165
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,480
Mingzhu Group sent out

166
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,639
many different vehicles.

167
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,600
My men and I have marked all the vehicles.

168
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,039
I'll send you the map now.

169
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,799
Okay.

170
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,759
Bro, she's definitely moving assets.

171
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,759
These are all just decoys.

172
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
The real treasures are somewhere else.

173
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,000
Wuming,

174
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,320
how do you know that?

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,759
These routes

176
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,159
are clearly carefully planned.

177
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,840
They're meant to lure us in.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,399
Most people, when trying to hide their route,

179
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,840
will subconsciously avoid the target.

180
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,879
But experts usually overcome this instinct.

181
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,519
They deliberately design routes

182
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,279
that pass by the target.

183
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,799
This place has the most convenient access to the dock.

184
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,799
We already know

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,279
the start and end points of the maze.

186
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,240
Next, we just need to connect them.

187
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,440
It seems we're very close to the answer.

188
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,120
This route passes through all the paths.

189
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,639
But it's the only one that doesn't overlap.

190
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,279
Let's go.

191
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,679
To the end point.

192
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,759
Bro,

193
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,200
this place doesn't really look like it.

194
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,320
What valuable stuff could there be in a junkyard?

195
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,480
Think about it the other way around.

196
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
Isn't this the perfect disguise?

197
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,480
It's only a ten-minute drive from here to the dock.

198
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,879
And it's a direct expressway.

199
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,879
It fits the criteria.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,159
Junk collection!

201
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,759
Sir,

202
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,080
making a fortune, huh?

203
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,519
I'm just a junk collector.

204
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,480
How could I make a fortune?

205
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,480
Come on, let me help you.

206
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,200
Alright, alright.

207
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,039
Here.

208
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
Thanks, young man.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,600
Sir,

210
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,759
the junk in your cart looks pretty new.

211
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,639
Broken pots and bowls aren't worth much.

212
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,120
At best, you could trade them for an old phone.

213
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,000
What a coincidence.

214
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,639
I happen to have a phone here.

215
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,440
And it's brand new.

216
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
I'll trade it for your whole cart.

217
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,639
Young man, are you joking with me?

218
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,759
Don't tease an old man like me.

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,480
Alright then.

220
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,639
A Doucai Chicken Cup from the Chenghua period.

221
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,519
Auction price: 280 million.

222
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,000
The condition of this one

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
compared to the one at auction

224
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,159
is just as good.

225
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,799
Bro, this thing is worth 300 million.

226
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,600
This is probably

227
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,799
the cheapest thing on your cart.

228
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,360
Young man, how did you figure that out?

229
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,879
Your cart

230
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,000
just looks messy.

231
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,279
After all, there are so many valuable antiques.

232
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,519
And also,

233
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,279
when you came over just now,

234
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,559
you said you were collecting junk.

235
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,080
Tell me, who would sell junk to you right next to a recycling station?

236
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,759
Who would sell their junk to you?

237
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,039
If I'm not mistaken,

238
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,519
your real target is the warehouse in the back, right?

239
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,679
You're right.

240
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,720
I can take you there.

241
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,879
But once we get there,

242
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,879
you have to let this old man go.

243
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:03,720
Lead the way.

244
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,840
Kid

245
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,480
You're still too inexperienced.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,960
Do you know why I tricked you into coming here?

247
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,200
You lured me here with a warehouse full of antiques.

248
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,720
You really went all out.

249
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,240
Junior brother
