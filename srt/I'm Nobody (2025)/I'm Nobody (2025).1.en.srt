1
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,480
Once upon a time, there was a

2
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,239
world different from ours.

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,239
In this world,

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,040
there are many hidden

5
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,879
masters living in the city.

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,439
Your martial arts training is complete.

7
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,200
Go down the mountain now and inherit the sect's legacy.

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,159
This time, going down the mountain,

9
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,840
I can finally see my senior and junior sisters.

10
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,200
Do you want to play with us?

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,159
I didn't mean to shake them off.

12
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,359
It was all my right hand's doing.

13
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
My name is Ye Wuming.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,879
I'm a designated driver.

15
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,239
Three years ago, I had a car accident.

16
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,319
I lost some of my memories.

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,239
After that,

18
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,879
my right hand seemed to have a mind of its own.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
We've found Ye Wuming.

20
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,879
But he doesn't seem to remember anything.

21
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,080
It's only three kilometers.

22
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,520
Who would take such a small job?

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,879
I'll go.

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,599
Bro, it's rush hour right now.

25
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,439
If you go back and forth like this,

26
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,360
you'll miss out on the good jobs.

27
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,199
San'er, help me tidy up later.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,080
Sit down.

29
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,240
Sign the contract.

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
Let me make this clear.

31
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,719
If you don't sign the contract today,

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,639
you can't leave.

33
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,560
Mr. Li has treated you well.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,919
You're not appreciating it.

35
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,879
If you don't want to sign, that's fine.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,919
Just put your fingerprint on it.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
Come on, where's the ink pad?

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Excuse me.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,919
Who has the license plate ending in 3390?

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Who called for the designated driver?

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,840
Me.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,639
I called.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,759
She looks like that actress Song Yiran.

44
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,639
Hello.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,319
Feichi Driving Service is happy to serve you.

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,759
One of our friends

47
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,639
had a bit to drink.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,159
We'll take her home in a bit.

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,360
Let's go.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,680
Bro, then you...

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,439
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm telling you to leave.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,960
Help me.

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,560
Help me.

55
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,639
Sit down.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,159
What are you doing?

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
What are you doing?

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,879
It's nothing.

59
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,080
Are you crazy?

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,439
Are you nuts?

61
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,520
Tell him to get lost.

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm telling you to get lost, can't you hear me?

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,360
Bro, bro!

64
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,479
Let's talk this out.

65
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,400
Whoa, that's impressive.

66
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,479
Get him!

67
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,960
Go get him!

68
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,920
Could he be the legendary city master?

69
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,920
Take me home.

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,879
Building 2, Room 101.

71
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,759
I suddenly became a top master.

72
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,959
And I saved a celebrity.

73
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,680
Now I'm even taking her home alone.

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,560
Oh my god.

75
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,720
Is my life about to go on cheat mode?

76
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,319
We're here.

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,079
The celebrity's house is so unique.

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
Don't look, don't look.

79
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,319
Settle the bill.

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,079
Don't go.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,839
Don't go.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
Bro, where are you?

83
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,439
I haven't gotten any orders all night.

84
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,120
Song Yiran.

85
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,040
That last order was from Song Yiran.

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
Bro, why did you go to her house?

87
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,720
Bro.

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,319
Don't do anything illegal, bro.

89
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,639
Don't talk nonsense.

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
She asked me to.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,639
She hasn't settled the bill yet.

92
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,399
Hung up.

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,759
Such a nice back.

94
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,800
It'd be a shame not to do cupping.

95
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,199
You're awake.

96
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,720
Now that you're awake, settle the bill for me.

97
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,319
Sis.

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,839
Don't throw up on me.

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,519
Did I come home?

100
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Why am I in bed?

101
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,639
I remember I was talking to President Li about terminating the contract.

102
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,439
I remember the favor.

103
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,959
This contract—

104
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,560
I won't renew it.

105
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,480
You know what I want.

106
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,360
The bank card you wanted—

107
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,759
I've already destroyed it.

108
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,720
If the contract isn't renewed, so be it.

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,160
But you have to finish this drink.

110
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,720
Okay.

111
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,399
President Li.

112
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,519
Let's part on good terms.

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I couldn't have...

114
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,519
Thank goodness nothing happened.

115
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,839
Lao Qi,

116
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,800
Song Yiran has made me 200 million in four years.

117
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,279
If she doesn't renew her contract,

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,240
what will others think?

119
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,839
You must settle things with her tonight.

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,839
Yes, President Li.

121
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
If she doesn't sign tonight, she won't have it easy.

122
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,639
Why is someone taking a shower?

123
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,000
Bastard!

124
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,399
Who is this man?

125
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,759
Why does she keep staring at me?

126
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,159
You pervert!

127
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,039
I didn't do it on purpose.

128
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
Be gentle.

129
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,639
Who told you to spray me with pepper spray?

130
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,919
That was just a reflex.

131
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,080
It was self-defense.

132
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,440
Ye Wuming, right?

133
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,799
You took me home.

134
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,960
And I threw up all over you.

135
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,399
I apologize to you.

136
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
But I think

137
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,759
you should explain first

138
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,039
why you were in my house.

139
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,720
You drank too much and don't remember.

140
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,080
You asked me to take you home.

141
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,679
Remember to give me a five-star rating.

142
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,080
Are you okay?

143
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,799
You beat me up like this,

144
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,440
and you still want a five-star rating?

145
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,679
Didn't you spray my eyes red too?

146
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,759
One-star review

147
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
And you even filed a complaint against me

148
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,120
Wait, I saved you

149
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,840
Saved me?

150
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,399
Unbelievable

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,679
It was just a three or five kilometer ride

152
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,799
I barely made any money from it

153
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,639
When I got there, five or six people were surrounding you

154
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,080
Trying to make you sign some contract

155
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,279
Then you asked me to save you

156
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,840
I fought with them for you

157
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,600
Worked hard to get you home safely

158
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,240
Then you threw up all over me

159
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
And you didn’t even pay for the ride

160
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,919
You don’t have to sign

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Just put your fingerprint here

162
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,559
Feichi Driving Service is happy to serve you

163
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,399
Save me

164
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,840
Turns out everything he said was true

165
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,679
It’s just a complaint

166
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,200
At most, they’ll deduct some money

167
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
You definitely won’t lose your job

168
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,799
Employee number 9527, Ye Wuming

169
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,919
You have been reported

170
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,480
Involving serious misconduct such as trespassing

171
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
After platform review

172
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,159
You are suspended

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,840
So this is what you meant by “won’t lose your job”?

174
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,519
Don’t worry

175
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,159
I’ll call to withdraw the complaint right now

176
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,720
Hello

177
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,320
I want to withdraw my complaint against 9527

178
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,519
Sorry, it’s already in the system

179
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,080
The platform will use 9527 as an example

180
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,960
Publicly criticize and deal with him seriously

181
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,679
I already apologized

182
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,440
You never even acted like you were sorry

183
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:14,919
You—

184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,240
It must be President Li.

185
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,279
He wouldn't be after my life, would he?

186
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Did you offend someone?

187
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,759
Can you stay tonight?
