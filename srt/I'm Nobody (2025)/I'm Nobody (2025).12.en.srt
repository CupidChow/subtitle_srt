1
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,800
Mr. Feng

2
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,159
You called me here to talk about dealing with Ye Wuming.

3
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,080
How would I dare go against Mr. Ye?

4
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,560
He's the chairman of Wuwei Pictures.

5
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,840
If something goes wrong,

6
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,719
I couldn't bear that responsibility.

7
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Mr. Li,

8
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,599
Let's skip the probing words.

9
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
If we don't stop him,

10
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,719
in half a month,

11
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,280
Ye Wuming will officially inherit a 20 billion management fund.

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
By then,

13
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,800
neither of us will be a match for him.

14
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I heard Song Yiran has a bank card.

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,039
Mr. Li has always wanted to get it back.

16
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,840
If we don't get rid of Ye Wuming,

17
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,560
we probably won't get that card back.

18
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,680
So, Mr. Feng, you were prepared all along.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We each get what we want.

20
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,800
Just get the job done.

21
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,879
Money is not an issue.

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,039
Stop sleeping.

23
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,840
Get up.

24
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Come with me to see my parents.

25
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,199
I'll grab some clothes and go.

26
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,080
Uncle, Auntie.

27
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,439
I've missed you both so much.

28
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,080
How is it?

29
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,159
How does it feel to breathe the fresh air in Zhongnanshan?

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Don't even mention it.

31
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,919
They made me go to the deep mountains to cultivate myself.

32
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,199
I had to eat vegetarian every day.

33
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm almost turning into a wild person.

34
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,680
Daughter,

35
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,120
Your mom either practices Tai Chi every day

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,960
or meditates.

37
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,400
The only thing left is for her to hit me.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,039
I'm almost depressed.

39
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,000
Yiran,

40
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,319
Your dad and I know we were wrong this time.

41
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,360
We shouldn't have been misled by that Li Tianhao.

42
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,360
From now on, if you don't want to do something,

43
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,879
I will never force you.

44
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,719
Dad,

45
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,120
What's wrong with Mom?

46
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,319
What kind of act is she putting on today?

47
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,240
Your mom knows you signed with a new company.

48
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,039
So she's inviting President Zhao for a meal.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,599
To build a better relationship.

50
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,680
That, um, President Zhao will be here soon.

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,560
This is a family matter.

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,639
It's not appropriate for you to be here.

53
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,439
What we're going to discuss later

54
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,759
is very, very private.

55
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,719
It's really not suitable for you to be here.

56
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:14,960
Okay.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,759
Then, I'll go.

58
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,879
Go ahead, go ahead.

59
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,319
Wuming is my boyfriend.

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,920
He has to be here.

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,439
Still.

62
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,720
President Zhao will be here soon.

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
If you make him unhappy,

64
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,000
it could affect your future.

65
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,759
Exactly.

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
And President Zhao told me,

67
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,759
the boss of your new company

68
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,079
is young, handsome, and wealthy.

69
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,319
He's willing to spend a hundred million for you.

70
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,959
Aren't you moved at all?

71
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,199
Exactly.

72
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,519
It's actually not that great.

73
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,959
How can you say that?

74
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,480
I know you're jealous.

75
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,720
But do you really have what it takes?

76
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,720
But Wuming is willing to give it up for me.

77
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,439
He'd give up inheriting twenty billion.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,319
Twenty billion?

79
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,000
What twenty billion?

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,519
I bet he can't even come up with two hundred yuan.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,199
Mr. Zhao.

82
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,839
Mr. Zhao, please, have a seat.

83
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,759
Please, sit down.

84
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,480
Please, take a seat.

85
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,680
The matter isn't settled yet.

86
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,040
Serve the dishes.

87
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,000
Mr. Ye, when did you arrive?

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,399
What?

89
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,480
You came without letting us know.

90
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,639
So I could have made arrangements in advance.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,079
Mr. Ye, please take the main seat.

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,839
No need, no need.

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll just sit next to Yiran.

94
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,319
Mr. Zhao, did you mistake him for someone else?

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,959
He's Yiran's bodyguard.

96
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,879
Bodyguard? What are you saying?

97
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,680
This is our company's new boss.

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,279
Mr. Ye Wuming.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
The new boss? This...

100
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,079
He just inherited twenty billion.

101
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes, that's right.

102
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,040
Not exactly.

103
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,839
I knew it, how could that be possible?

104
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,959
That's way too exaggerated.

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,000
Twenty billion is just the initial capital.

106
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,240
There will be huge dividends later on.

107
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,439
Dividends

108
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,040
That would be tens of billions!

109
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,879
Money isn't important.

110
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,399
That's what I said.

111
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,959
The more I look at this handsome guy, the more I like him.

112
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,639
He's so handsome, and my daughter is so beautiful.

113
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,240
A perfect match, right?

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,199
Son-in-law,

115
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,959
The moment I first saw you,

116
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,480
I knew you were extraordinary.

117
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,600
You're truly outstanding among people.

118
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,079
No,

119
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,240
Like Lü Bu among men, and Red Hare among horses, yes, yes!

120
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
I'll drink first!

121
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,480
Honey, honey!

122
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,199
Hurry home and get the household registration book.

123
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,439
Let them pick an auspicious day.

124
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
To register their marriage.

125
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,079
Why wait for an auspicious day?

126
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,560
Today is a great day!

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,399
Yes, yes, hurry up!

128
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,879
We're still waiting to hold our grandchild!

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,759
Alright, alright!

130
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,000
We'll register after we finish eating.

131
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,839
Waiter, serve the dishes!

132
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Didn't expect him to be handsome and wealthy.

133
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,720
And he even knows kung fu.

134
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,079
A kung fu son-in-law.

135
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,480
Exactly.

136
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,759
A son-in-law this good,

137
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,360
he must have been outstanding since he was a child.

138
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,839
Son-in-law, where are you from?

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
Yeah, where are you from?

140
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm a local.

141
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,800
A local, a local.

142
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,360
Do you have any siblings?

143
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
What do your parents do?

144
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Where did you go to college?

145
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,639
Your parents raised you so well from a young age.

146
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,120
I don't even know who I am.

147
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,680
How can I be responsible to Yiran?

148
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,639
Yes, yes.

149
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,920
Such a good kid, right?

150
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,759
Mom.

151
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,800
Wuming.

152
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,519
Mom, what are you saying?

153
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
He hasn't agreed to be your son-in-law yet.

154
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,680
That's just a matter of time.

155
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,839
Exactly.

156
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,759
Mom, the car is here.

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,680
You all go ahead.

158
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,639
Brother, get in the car.

159
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,279
Alright, alright.

160
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:32,920
Uncle, Auntie, let's go.

161
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,560
Hurry, get in the car, let's go.

162
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,959
Remember to keep me updated.

163
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,680
Let's go.

164
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,079
My parents are just like that.

165
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,040
Don't mind them.

166
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
But,

167
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,319
what they said this time

168
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
actually made some sense.

169
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,639
Which part?

170
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,959
About the son-in-law.

171
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,480
And getting married and all that.

172
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,319
They're just urging us to get married.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,399
It's normal for them to do that.

174
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,680
Don't feel pressured.

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,199
I'm not feeling any pressure.

176
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,600
I just remembered something.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,160
I acted in a show before.

178
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,360
This one.

179
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,759
The male lead in it

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
was super romantic when he confessed to me.

181
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,920
I've seen this one.

182
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,079
The male lead's last name was Li, he died in a car accident.

183
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,639
There's another one.

184
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Another show.

185
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,399
This one.

186
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,320
When the male lead confessed to me in this one,

187
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,759
he was especially sincere.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,639
Here, let me find it for you.

189
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,879
I've seen this one too.

190
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,759
His last name was Hu.

191
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:48,879
He cheated.

192
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,080
Can you focus on the main point?

193
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,759
The main point is the proposal!

194
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,639
The proposal.

195
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,559
The proposal.

196
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,840
What's the point of proposing?

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,159
Haven't you noticed that in romance dramas,

198
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,879
they always end once the couple gets married?

199
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,559
Why?

200
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,120
Why?

201
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,200
Because after marriage, there's nothing left for the story.

202
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,200
Right?

203
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,360
Yiran

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,200
I know what you're talking about.

205
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,759
You're awake.

206
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,000
Did you sleep well last night?

207
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,480
Pretty well.

208
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,799
I made you breakfast.

209
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,919
It has your favorite.

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
Tomato and scrambled eggs.

211
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,480
Eat more.

212
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,879
What day is it today?

213
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,399
I heard that

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,480
after a man feels the warmth of home,

215
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,559
he really wants to get married.

216
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,000
I also got some beer.

217
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,200
Look at this.

218
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,799
Doesn't it look like a wedding ring?

219
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,039
No, it doesn't.

220
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,679
Don't play with that, you might cut your hand.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,279
Such a domineering boyfriend vibe.

222
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,159
No way.

223
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,240
I have to stick to the original plan.

224
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,159
Guess what else I prepared.

225
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,120
It smells so good.

226
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,759
Smell it, doesn't it smell nice?

227
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,840
It does.

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,720
It does.

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,759
This candle

230
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,759
seems a bit off.

231
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,000
I feel dizzy.

232
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,679
Could this be the legendary aphrodisiac candle?

233
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,279
Aphrodisiac candle?

234
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,320
It's so hot.

235
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,720
I'm really dizzy.

236
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,240
So dizzy.

237
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,679
Yiran

238
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,960
I feel so dizzy.

239
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,279
I-I'll get you some ice.

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,879
Just hold me, that's enough.

241
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,120
Wait a second.

242
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,559
Isn't this just a regular candle?
