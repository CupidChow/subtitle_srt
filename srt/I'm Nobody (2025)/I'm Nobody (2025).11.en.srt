1
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,640
Only you are allowed in.

2
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,480
If anyone else comes, I'll break one of her fingers.

3
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,959
Senior Sister, Mr. Ma.

4
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,040
You two wait here.

5
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,120
I'll go in alone.

6
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, alright.

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,280
Yiran.

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,159
Ye Wuming.

9
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,599
I know you're a good fighter.

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,120
If you make a move,

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
she goes down.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ding Dali, right?

13
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,239
Let Yiran go.

14
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,280
State your terms directly.

15
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,799
It's refreshing to talk to smart people.

16
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,480
Looks like this little celebrity

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,519
means a lot to you.

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,519
Get to the point.

19
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,560
Sign this contract.

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,319
Transfer the 20 billion to me.

21
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,519
Sign it, and you can take her.

22
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,879
If you don't sign,

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,640
she goes down.

24
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,800
Fine, I'll sign.

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,120
You only know I'm fighting you for 20 billion.

26
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,039
But you don't know

27
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,039
that the 20 billion was always for her.

28
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,120
20 billion.

29
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,280
Is 20 billion really not worth more than a woman?

30
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,240
20 billion.

31
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,639
With 20 billion, you can have anything.

32
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,319
Yiran.

33
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,960
Wuming

34
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,879
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

35
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,560
They're all in this together.

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,479
Miss Song, I'm truly sorry.

37
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,199
I didn't tell you the truth.

38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,400
I made you go along with this act.

39
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,439
An act?

40
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,400
This young man, for the sake of friendship,

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,280
gave up his own interests without hesitation.

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,599
Congratulations, Ye Wuming.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,159
You've passed the final test.

44
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,919
Junior brother,

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,199
this is the most important part of the test.

46
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,080
The most important quality for a successor of Baxian Sect is character.

47
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,479
You're taking over a contract worth twenty billion.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,039
If you had hesitated even a little,

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,919
the contract would have been void.

50
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,639
Mr. Feng, Mr. Zhu,

51
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,719
what do you think?

52
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,400
Ye Wuming has indeed passed everyone's test.

53
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,560
Mr. Ye,

54
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,000
we acknowledge you as the successor.

55
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,800
Greetings, Sect Leader Senior Brother.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
You call me senior brother?

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
You look much older than me.

58
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,639
I'm a Baxian Sect disciple who was lost outside.

59
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,720
Now that your identity is confirmed,

60
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,199
you are naturally the Sect Leader Senior Brother.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,959
I humbly ask for your permission to follow you.

62
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:26,879
No, no, no.

63
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,279
If you want to follow me, then do so.

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,519
But please stop calling me senior brother.

65
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,000
Uncle Ma,

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,759
when can I use that hundred million?

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,720
Anytime.

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,279
The one hundred million penalty has already been transferred.

69
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,199
Everything before this is written off.

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,480
Starting today,

71
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,600
Song Yiran has nothing to do with you anymore.

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,360
You took the money.

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,439
For an actress,

74
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,920
is it worth spending a hundred million to bail her out?

75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,319
First of all, she’s not an actress.

76
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,920
Secondly,

77
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
whether it’s worth it or not is up to me.

78
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,759
Don’t get moved just yet.

79
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,519
I haven’t agreed to take the money.

80
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,199
You made twenty billion,

81
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,079
and only take out one hundred million?

82
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,120
Are you treating me like a beggar?

83
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,399
Mr. Li,

84
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,399
Greed knows no bounds.

85
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,600
Your appetite is so big, I’m afraid it’ll be your downfall.

86
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,839
I’m not a snake.

87
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,720
And you’re not necessarily an elephant.

88
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,000
Besides,

89
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,199
you wouldn’t dare make this a big deal, would you?

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,720
Mr. Li,

91
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,639
as the largest shareholder of the company,

92
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,040
let me give you a word of advice.

93
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,399
Sometimes,

94
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
you need to learn to let go.

95
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,720
Quit while you’re ahead.

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,279
Mr. Su,

97
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,959
I’m only thinking of the company’s best interests.

98
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,959
Even though you’re the largest shareholder,

99
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
you don’t have decision-making power.

100
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,000
The risks outweigh the benefits.

101
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,079
Even if I don’t have decision-making power,

102
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,480
if I withdraw my shares from your company,

103
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,120
do you know what that would mean?

104
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,160
Tianhao,

105
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,439
prepare the contract termination.

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,720
Dad,

107
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,399
hurry up.

108
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,800
Yiran,

109
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,800
you’re free now.

110
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,199
President Ye

111
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,079
Such a big office

112
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,160
Are you comfortable sitting here?

113
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,639
It's so boring

114
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,959
I'm not someone who can sit still

115
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,360
If it weren't for signing the contract

116
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,399
I wouldn't have come here

117
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,399
Alright

118
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,600
Congratulations, Song Yiran.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,680
Starting today,

120
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,879
you are now an artist signed with Wuwei Films.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
Starting today,

122
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,839
you are my boss now.

123
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,439
Wrong.

124
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,839
It was my legal entity that signed you.

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,240
As for me personally,

126
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm still your bodyguard.

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,439
Do you really like being a bodyguard that much?

128
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,639
I like you.

129
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,399
Everyone needs a hobby, right?

130
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
But,

131
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,279
since I've officially terminated my contract with Mr. Li,

132
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,800
it seems like I don't need a bodyguard anymore.

133
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,199
That's not it.

134
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,519
Little Li may be dumb,

135
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,879
but his father is not easy to deal with.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,199
I think he was still too polite to you before.

137
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,720
He'll definitely get worse from now on.

138
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,720
Come on.

139
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,759
Think about it.

140
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,519
You used to be his signed artist.

141
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,519
You still have a bank card that could be used against him.

142
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,319
Who knows,

143
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,279
he might even try to silence you.

144
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,800
Really?

145
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,639
I'm so scared.

146
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,519
Don't worry.

147
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm a professional bodyguard.

148
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,639
I think you have a point.

149
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,559
Then I'll trouble you to keep protecting me.

150
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,000
Then I need to think about it carefully.

151
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,360
Treat me to dinner tonight.

152
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,960
We're here.

153
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,600
Right here.

154
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,440
You picked this place?

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,919
This doesn't really suit your status, President Ye.

156
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,639
As long as my stomach likes it, that's enough.

157
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
So many people here.

158
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,039
Let's hurry up.

159
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,960
The food here is really good. I come often.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
This way, please.

161
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,639
We're having a promotion right now.

162
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,399
Couple's set meal is 40% off.

163
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,679
Are you two a couple?

164
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:16,840
No.

165
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,240
You really are the boss.

166
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,399
You've got a sharp eye.

167
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,440
We are a couple.

168
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,320
We'll take that.

169
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,120
Alright.

170
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,440
One couple's set meal.

171
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,360
Aren't you being a bit too domineering?

172
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,039
That's the domineering CEO style.

173
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
Girls all like it.

174
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,120
So full of yourself.

175
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't want people to think I'm materialistic.

176
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,399
Why care what others think?

177
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,720
Just make yourself happy.

178
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,200
That's true.

179
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,039
Anyway, I just want to take on more roles.

180
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,279
So I can pay back that hundred million as soon as possible.

181
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,399
And shut people up.

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm telling you, I'm not in a hurry to pay it back.

183
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,720
Besides, you still have to pay me a salary, right?

184
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,480
Right?

185
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,240
Here you go, couple's set meal.

186
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:53,879
Thank you.

187
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,919
It looks pretty appetizing.

188
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,799
Hurry, hurry.

189
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,279
I'm not very hungry, you eat first.

190
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,399
I'm afraid someone will take pictures.

191
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,720
Of course.

192
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,639
If my fans find out

193
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,799
that I'm a meat lover,

194
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,360
my public image will collapse.

195
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,759
Have you ever thought

196
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,960
that maybe your fans actually like the real you?

197
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,480
Come on, hurry up.

198
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,960
You're really not eating?

199
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,879
No, I'm not.

200
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,559
If you won't eat, I will.

201
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,639
Is it good?

202
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,720
Guess.

203
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,879
It looks delicious.

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,919
Actors should have their own favorite foods too.

205
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,039
If those fans

206
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,799
stop liking you just because you eat meat,

207
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,519
then they only like your public persona,

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
not the real you.

209
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,279
Boss!

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,919
Why isn't the beer here yet?

211
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,799
There are too many people, I'll get it myself.

212
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,440
Healthy living, beautiful morning.

213
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,799
Isn't that a bit fake?

214
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,720
All those posts on Weibo are just personas.

215
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,919
Do you know what a persona is?

216
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,399
It's all fake, and you still believe it?

217
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
I think

218
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
people should be genuine inside and out.

219
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,200
You can't act one way online and another in real life.

220
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,120
Just think of it as me creating a character.

221
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,600
Then why not create

222
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,759
a sincere character?

223
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,120
Life wouldn't be so exhausting.

224
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,519
If those fans

225
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,240
stop liking you just because you eat meat,

226
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,960
then they only like your persona,

227
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,440
not the real you.

228
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,519
Just have a bite.

229
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,879
Wuming, thank you.

230
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,039
To you

231
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,519
for being your true self.

232
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,639
Could you two take a photo together?

233
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,320
It's to decorate the couple's wall in the shop.

234
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,639
Sure, let's take one.

235
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,279
Hurry.

236
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,200
Could you get a little closer?

237
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,320
A bit closer.

238
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,720
Okay.

239
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,480
Three

240
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,639
Two

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,639
One

242
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
Are you planning to tell me later

243
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,240
that your feet hurt and you want to swap shoes with me,

244
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,840
or that your high heels broke and you want me to carry you?

245
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,919
Who told you all this?

246
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,360
I saw it on short videos.

247
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,200
Now that you've used up all these excuses,

248
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
what am I supposed to use?

249
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,080
I just think these reasons are too cliché.

250
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Let's come up with a new one.

251
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,200
Why change it?

252
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,799
Change it.

253
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,200
So you can flirt with me.

254
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Get lost! Who wants to flirt with you?

255
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,759
I'm just joking with you.

256
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:18,799
Don't be mad.

257
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Sorry.

258
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,840
You think just saying sorry is enough?

259
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,799
You don't mean it at all.

260
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,639
That doesn't make up for my hurt feelings.

261
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,840
Then how should I make it up to you?

262
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,000
How about this:

263
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,399
There's a scene where I have to act opposite the male lead.

264
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,720
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

265
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,759
I just can't get the emotions right.

266
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,159
It's an action scene.

267
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,960
Can you help me practice while we have the chance?

268
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,360
An action scene?

269
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,399
Sure.

270
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,600
How should I help you?

271
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,399
Let me think.

272
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,080
First, close your eyes.

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,120
Stand still, don't move.

274
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
Feel the environment.

275
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,840
Are you ready?
