1
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,280
Come to my place at 3 p.m.

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
How did you know you needed to win her over?

3
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,480
Is there something going on between you two?

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,159
Let me make it clear first.

5
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,840
I really don't know her, this is my first time meeting her.

6
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,280
There's really nothing between us.

7
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,760
It's truly our first meeting.

8
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,480
What exactly does President Su want from me?

9
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,840
Could it be...

10
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,840
...the so-called unspoken rules?

11
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:45,840
President Su.

12
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,719
That smile...

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,599
Is something going to happen?

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
Judging by her expression...

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,760
Is she really going to make a move on me?

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,639
Why is it taking so long for them to come out?

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
What are they talking about?

18
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,520
Hello?

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,159
I'm not buying a house, thank you.

20
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,000
Junior apprentice.

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,439
We finally meet again.

22
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,280
President Su.

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,319
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

24
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,599
I don't know you.

25
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,439
This is the protective armguard from Master for you.

26
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,479
It can enhance your strength.

27
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,719
Do you sometimes feel...

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,759
...like you can't control yourself?

29
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,120
Yes.

30
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,280
Yes.

31
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,719
President Su, what else do you know?

32
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,439
Three years ago, you left the mountain for training.

33
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,919
Since then, there’s been no news from you.

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,759
I didn't expect it was because of amnesia.

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,159
Drop your shoulders.

36
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,319
Lower your elbows.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,560
Tuck in your chest.

38
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,479
I remember Master now.

39
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,479
The day you left,

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,000
Master also passed away.

41
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,800
But Master was perfectly fine.

42
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,439
How could he have died?

43
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,240
There are so many suspicious points about this.

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
It's very strange.

45
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,960
I must find out the cause of Master's death.

46
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,560
Junior Brother,

47
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,639
stop being a bodyguard.

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,159
Come be the vice president at my Mingzhu Group.

49
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,960
Let's investigate together.

50
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,199
I promised Song Yiran to be her bodyguard.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,960
One must keep their word.

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,479
Is she

53
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,319
very important to you?

54
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,879
I don't know.

55
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,360
Alright.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,159
Then I respect your choice.

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,599
But the vice president position

58
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,639
will always be open for you.

59
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,040
You can come anytime.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,680
Thank you for your kindness, President Su.

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,079
But

62
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,759
if you are really my Senior Sister,

63
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,600
why didn't you come to find me before?

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,720
There must be a conspiracy behind Master's death.

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,680
To ensure your and Junior Sister's safety,

66
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,439
I think we shouldn't reveal our relationship for now.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,040
Do you know what President Su said?

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,959
She said she didn't miss you.

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,480
Do you want to know?

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,759
What just happened upstairs?

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,439
I'm not that curious.

72
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,759
Alright.

73
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,600
Then I won't say.

74
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,319
Let's go.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,759
If you really want to say it,

76
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,360
then go ahead.

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,079
Ms. Su said

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,639
she's my senior.

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,519
Senior?

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
Ms. Su is your senior?

81
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,199
Yue Linglong is your junior?

82
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,000
Is your whole group having a team-building event?

83
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:28,839
No idea.

84
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:30,920
Let's go home.

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,560
Let's find a media outlet.

86
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,199
Say that Song Yiran is hiding a lover.

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
And not just one man.

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
Sis, we can buy a trending topic.

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
Sure.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,959
Buy a trending topic.

91
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
You're the smart one.

92
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,920
Song Yiran.

93
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Last time I didn't take your lead role.

94
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
This time,

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,160
don't blame me for being ruthless.

96
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,480
Senior brother,

97
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,000
I will definitely win you back.

98
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,800
Don't talk, just come with me.

99
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,839
I can't walk fast in these shoes.

100
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,759
Sorry.

101
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,800
They were just two reporters.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,279
We can't take any chances, understand?

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go.

104
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,079
They're coming out! They're coming out!

105
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,759
Hurry, hurry!

106
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,519
Take pictures, quick!

107
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,120
Song Yiran.

108
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:35,759
Song Yiran! Song Yiran!

109
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,800
Rumor has it you're keeping lovers in secret.

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,600
That you have several men.

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,279
Is it true?

112
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,519
Your public boyfriend, Ye Wuming—

113
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,639
—is he just a cover?

114
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,319
Please answer, please answer, Song Yiran!

115
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,319
Song Yiran! Song Yiran!

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,879
Please answer my question.

117
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,519
Why are you hitting people now?

118
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,639
Seriously...

119
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,319
It's not just trending online.

120
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,879
Even my home address has been exposed.

121
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,680
If it's not President Li,

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,879
then it's your junior who did it.

123
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,959
They just want to make my life miserable.

124
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,839
Looks like your place isn't safe.

125
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,560
Let's get a hotel room.

126
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,839
A hotel won't work.

127
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:13,920
Let's go to your place.

128
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,160
My place?

129
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,120
My place won't do.

130
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,639
I share it with San'er.

131
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
And it's old and shabby.

132
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,639
You definitely wouldn't be comfortable there.

133
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,240
Can you stop thinking I'm so delicate?

134
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,959
I'm used to wearing high heels.

135
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
I can even walk barefoot.

136
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,639
And isn't it better if we don't stand out?

137
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Does your house have a back door?

138
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,120
The entrance is soft and smooth.

139
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,360
One sip and you can tell it's pure grain liquor.

140
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,759
Brilliant.

141
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,600
San'er.

142
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,839
San'er.

143
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,000
Brother Wuming.

144
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
You, you...

145
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,279
Why are you back, bro?

146
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,439
Couldn't get used to living in the celebrity's mansion?

147
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,079
Is that it? You first...

148
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,399
Put your clothes on first.

149
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,439
What's wrong, bro?

150
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,160
I see you've been living in this big mansion for a while.

151
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,879
Hello.

152
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,040
Are you Ma San?

153
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,360
An idol!

154
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,439
Why, why are you here?

155
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,040
Sit, sit, sit.

157
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,120
Sit here, sit, sit, sit, sit here.

158
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,160
San'er, tidy up a bit.

159
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Bro, what's going on?

160
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,560
Why didn't you say you were bringing the goddess over to hang out?

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
Not to hang out, she's living here.

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,839
Living here?

163
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,240
So we'll be roommates from now on.

164
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,320
Roommates with a celebrity?

165
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,639
Not us, just the two of us.

166
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,200
That's fine then.

167
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,720
We can squeeze in together, just the two of us.

168
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Sorry for disturbing you.

169
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,080
I heard from Wuming

170
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,960
that you've always wanted to travel, right?

171
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,440
I don't want to...

172
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

173
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,279
You do.

174
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,399
I happen to have

175
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,879
an invitation from a foreign tour group.

176
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,559
You can go for as long as you want.

177
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,559
No, no, no.

178
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,759
No, it's not like that, this—

179
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,879
I'll make up your salary, double.

180
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,799
It's not about the money.

181
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,240
Mainly, I just really want to travel.

182
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,919
Isn't that right, bro?

183
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,519
Bro.

184
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,799
Right?

185
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,320
Isn't it?

186
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,759
I knew you liked to travel.

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,440
Let me tell you,

188
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,919
Southeast Asia is really great.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,600
The fruit is delicious.

190
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,600
It rains a lot—you like rain, don't you?

191
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,840
It's been a while since you washed, huh?

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,799
San'er, Song Yiran coming to my place is supposed to be a secret.

193
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,559
You absolutely can't tell anyone.

194
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,279
Don't worry, bro.

195
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,879
Me, I'm the kind of person

196
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,919
who keeps my mouth shut.

197
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,440
Alright.

198
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,000
Then I wish you a pleasant trip.

199
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,039
Call me when you arrive.

200
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,639
Okay.

201
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,279
Let's go, San'er.

202
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,919
We're leaving, bro.

203
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,799
Hello, Linglong.

204
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,080
Guess who's back.

205
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,679
My bro Wuming is back.

206
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,519
And he brought Song Yiran with him.

207
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,039
So about this...

208
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,279
It's complicated, sis.

209
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,440
He even knows Su Mingzhu.

210
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,799
This guy is really hiding his true abilities.

211
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,080
Looks like it's time to play a trump card.

212
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,559
Boss, who are we waiting for?

213
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:37,879
Mr. Li

214
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,960
I’ve been posing as Song Yiran’s manager.

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,879
For so many years.

216
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,279
Are you sure you want to play this trump card of mine now?

217
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,159
Do you really want to use it now?

218
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,120
Lu Bingqing

219
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,080
Originally, I shouldn’t have revealed you so soon.

220
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,080
I shouldn’t have played this ace so early.

221
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,679
But now Song Yiran wants to terminate her contract.

222
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
There’s no point in you staying hidden any longer.

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,519
This Ye Wuming is not simple.

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,960
I still haven’t figured out his background.

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,799
Don’t worry.

226
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,480
Leave it to me.

227
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,279
I’ve been a manager for so long.

228
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,279
Surrounded by nightlife every day.

229
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,559
My skills haven’t gotten rusty, have they?

230
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,120
Boss

231
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,720
You—this...

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,600
Mr. Li

233
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,919
If I had just been holding a knife,

234
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,240
you’d be dead by now.

235
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,480
Sleight of hand.

236
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,639
Alright.

237
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,480
Defeat Ye Wuming.

238
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,600
Get back the bank card from Song Yiran.

239
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,840
Bring it back to me.

240
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,120
The money will be transferred to your offshore account.

241
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,039
And one more thing.

242
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
Remember, don’t break the law.

243
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,840
I don’t want to get the police involved.

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,799
Boss, I’m leaving.

245
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,080
Beautiful.

246
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,559
Come in.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,639
How is it?

248
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,279
Looks good.

249
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,799
You adapted really quickly.

250
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,279
You tidied up so well.

251
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,120
Of course.

252
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,679
Don't treat me like

253
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,200
a helpless actress.

254
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,480
Four years ago,

255
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,080
I was just someone working hard

256
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,480
to make a living as a small-time actress.

257
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,600
So all these things

258
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,240
I had to do myself.

259
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,960
It's so dirty.

260
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,519
That's why I said,

261
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,519
I'm easy to get along with.

262
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,519
If you think

263
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,639
I'm not easygoing enough,

264
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,679
maybe you should look at your own issues.

265
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
What do you think?

266
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Me? What issues do I have?

267
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,679
Figure it out yourself.

268
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,679
I'm going to take a shower.

269
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,080
Dirty?

270
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,600
Just a little bee.

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,840
How did you get in?

272
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,840
Take a guess.

273
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,519
You sly dog, Ma San.

274
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,480
What do you want?

275
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,840
Senior brother.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,120
I came to help you get your memory back.

277
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,639
It's too late today. Let's talk tomorrow.

278
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,919
It's not late, senior brother.

279
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,879
Senior brother.

280
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,600
Are you going to choke me again?

281
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Who's going to choke you?

282
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,279
I just want to flirt with you.

283
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,759
If Yiran sees this,

284
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,039
how will I explain it?

285
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,720
I need to get her to leave quickly.

286
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,759
I don't want to talk about the past with you right now.

287
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,399
Then let's not think about the past.

288
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,360
Let's focus on the present.

289
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,679
Do you like me?

290
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,159
Guess.

291
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,039
I do.

292
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,360
Guess again.

293
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm a bit thirsty.

294
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,919
Why don't you pour me a glass of water?

295
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,240
Once this passion candle is lit,

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,080
as long as you inhale the scent,

297
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,759
it will arouse desire.

298
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,799
Drink this glass of water, then leave.

299
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,120
Senior brother.

300
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,519
When will we trim the candlewick together by the western window?

301
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
And talk about the rainy nights in Bashan?

302
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,360
Come on.
