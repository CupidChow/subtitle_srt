1
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,439
What's wrong?

2
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,879
Brother.

3
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,480
San'er, Yiran.

4
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,400
Why are you still here?

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,000
No, that's not it.

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,239
Ye Wuming, you—

7
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,640
San'er has nowhere to stay.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
He needs to stay at your place for a few days.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,239
Let me explain.

10
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,840
I'm in a hurry to attend the film festival.

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,079
Stop right there.

12
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,319
Unauthorized persons are not allowed inside.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,000
We're here to attend the film festival.

14
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,000
Where's your invitation?

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,239
Can the two of us use one invitation?

16
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,000
No, you can't.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,879
Ye—

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,560
You're just a bodyguard.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,159
Why are you trying to join the fun at this event?

20
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,480
Senior brother.

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,599
Why don't you go over there and rest for a bit?

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,560
No, I have to go in and protect Yiran.

23
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,400
You think you can just go in whenever you want?

24
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,079
Do you have this? An invitation?

25
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,439
No? Then get lost.

26
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,519
What's going on?

27
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,400
Everyone's blocking the entrance.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,319
Mr. Ma.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,239
It's nothing, just a bodyguard.

30
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,840
He insists on getting into the event.

31
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,079
Isn't that ridiculous?

32
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,159
True.

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,959
A bodyguard attending an industry event—

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,799
It's really not appropriate.

35
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,240
Contract.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,759
Young man, it was my oversight.

37
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,960
I wanted to give you one of my Ma family's companies yesterday,

38
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,280
specifically Wu Wei Film Company,

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
to show my gratitude.

40
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,240
Let's sign the papers today.

41
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,879
No, no, that's not really appropriate.

42
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,719
Mr. Ma,

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,039
are you joking?

44
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,400
Wu Wei Film is ranked among the top five in the country.

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,759
There are over a dozen signed celebrities there.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,719
You're giving it to him?

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,240
That's right, Mr. Ma.

48
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,759
Isn't that a bit much?

49
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,360
Young man, don't refuse.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,919
Once Miss Song's contract is terminated,

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,759
we'll sign her under Wu Wei Film.

52
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,639
That way, you can rest assured.

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
Let's welcome our Wu Wei Film's

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,759
new chairman, Ye Wuming, Mr. Ye.

55
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,120
Please.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,960
Mr. Ma,

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,319
he's become the chairman?

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,599
My senior really is impressive.

59
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,479
Dad,

60
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,039
that guy became the chairman.

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,080
So how do we deal with him now?

62
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,360
We originally wanted to use Mr. Ma to get rid of him.

63
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,039
But instead, we helped him rise even higher.

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,439
So, what do we do now?

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,159
Stay away from Lao Qi.

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,319
Don't associate with him.

67
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,919
With this contract,

68
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,280
we can confirm that Song Yiran took private jobs during her contract period.

69
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
She accepted outside work.

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,479
That's a serious breach of contract.

71
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,840
As long as we sue her,

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,759
we can get a huge compensation.

73
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,479
Let's see if she still dares.

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,120
Dad.

75
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,240
You're still the sly and cunning one.

76
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,280
So shrewd and calculating, so shrewd and calculating.

77
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm off.

78
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,159
Let's go.

79
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
You look really nice today, sis.

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,599
This necklace looks pretty good too.

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,360
Still.

82
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
I just remembered.

83
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,439
There was a project last year.

84
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,560
Did it not go through the company accounts?

85
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,439
That was on Mr. Li's verbal instruction.

86
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,319
A verbal instruction doesn't count.

87
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm really sorry.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,720
Your actions now constitute a breach of contract.

89
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,279
So what?

90
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,839
It wouldn't really be a big deal.

91
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,920
Given your current value,

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,079
the penalty for breach of contract isn't much.

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,319
It's just about a hundred million.

94
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,000
You should be able to afford a hundred million, right?

95
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,680
No one wants

96
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,240
the superstar they've worked so hard to nurture

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,160
to just leave like that.

98
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,879
Right?

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,680
I'll say it again:

100
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,879
Either renew the contract, or marry me.

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
Then we can pretend this never happened.

102
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,040
Mr. Ma,

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,879
how much cash does Wu Wei Films have available?

104
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,199
We have less than two hundred million right now.

105
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,120
The rest hasn't been recovered yet.

106
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,720
Then can I take out a hundred million

107
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,160
to use as Yiran's penalty for breach of contract?

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,240
I just mentioned a cough and you're already gasping.

109
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,480
A hundred million? Are you kidding?

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,079
It's your company now.

111
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,600
Of course you have the right to allocate the funds.

112
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,800
Mr. Ma,

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,800
you can't joke about something like this.

114
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,160
A joke?

115
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,480
Mr. Li,

116
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,839
do I look like I'm joking?

117
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,439
Words alone aren't enough.

118
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
The contract must be signed and the money transferred within three days.

119
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,720
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

120
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,279
Don't thank me just yet.

121
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,040
My hundred million comes with conditions.

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,839
Tomorrow, you need to come with me somewhere.

123
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,360
As long as it helps Yiran terminate the contract smoothly,

124
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,399
okay.

125
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,399
Here comes your favorite meat.

126
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,160
To be able to eat a dish personally made by you,

127
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,079
is truly an honor.

128
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,279
Listen to you.

129
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,560
Didn't Miss Song the superstar also make one herself?

130
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,560
What did you just call me?

131
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,519
Boss Ye.

132
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,759
Call me that again, let me hear it.

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
Boss Ye.

134
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,079
No.

135
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,240
It feels awkward.

136
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,600
I still prefer how you were at the beginning,

137
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,839
all rebellious and untamed.

138
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,879
Call me "little bodyguard."

139
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,319
Right.

140
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,399
Little bodyguard.

141
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,360
But now,

142
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,839
you've already been promoted from little bodyguard to Boss Ye.

143
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,160
And soon you'll be my boss too.

144
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,720
A humble girl like me wouldn't dare call you little bodyguard anymore.

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,639
Alright.

146
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,879
Then just keep a straight face and nitpick.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,279
That suits Miss Song the superstar's style perfectly.

148
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,360
Of course.

149
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,360
But your outfit really lacks style.

150
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,480
It doesn't look like something Boss Ye would wear at all.

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,879
What's wrong with my outfit?

152
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
Boss, don't you get it?

153
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,879
Real bosses are all about understated luxury.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,759
They have depth.

155
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,160
Depth, you know?

156
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,240
Boss Ye.

157
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,839
Thank you.

158
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,079
No need to be so formal.

159
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,920
Even though I'm the chairman,

160
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm still your bodyguard.

161
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,360
Protecting you is still my real job.

162
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,279
Let's try it now.

163
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,000
My tomato and scrambled eggs.

164
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Then I'll start eating.

165
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,279
You have to make it for me every day.

166
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,040
Is it good?

167
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,800
It's delicious.

168
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,399
It's delicious.

169
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,879
I knew you'd like it.

170
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,319
Let me try something else, let me try something else.

171
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
No, no, no.

172
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,639
Let me try something else, something else.

173
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,279
All the eggs are for you.

174
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,759
No.

175
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,759
This wine is good.

176
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,720
This wine is good.

177
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,639
The wine is good, the wine is good.

178
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,399
Here.

179
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,560
Uncle Ma.

180
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
I can't accept a reward without merit.

181
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,079
You're willing to offer a hundred million to help me.

182
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,839
Just tell me your conditions.

183
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,199
You'll know when you get there.

184
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,399
This matter involves much more than just a hundred million.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,680
Everyone,

186
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
please come out.

187
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,399
Mr. Ye.

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,839
We meet again.

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,840
Young man,

190
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,639
don't worry.

191
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,840
Please have a seat.

192
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
They all received help from the Baxian Sect back then.

193
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,519
They know you're the successor of the Baxian Sect.

194
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,000
They came especially to meet you.

195
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,840
Actually,

196
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,360
we are the ones who have been looking for you.

197
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
The Four Major Groups.

198
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,200
Mr. Ma

199
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,120
You asked me to come here today

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
It's probably not just to get acquainted with everyone, right?

201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,879
Eight years ago

202
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,159
all four of our families were harmed by our rivals

203
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,360
and were on the verge of bankruptcy

204
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,840
It was the Baxian Sect that stepped in

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,360
and helped us come back from the brink

206
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,039
At that time, there was only one condition

207
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,279
which was that eight years later

208
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,279
thirty percent of our wealth

209
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,759
would be donated to the Baxian Sect

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,840
to be managed by the true successor

211
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,039
to give back to society

212
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,759
Now, we've finally found the successor

213
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,000
Mr. Ma, here you go again

214
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
How many times have I told you

215
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,639
I'm not the successor

216
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,360
Besides

217
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,960
I don't remember

218
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,120
Only if you prove you're the successor

219
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,879
can I pay Song Yiran's penalty fee

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,000
We're talking about at least twenty billion in assets

221
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,879
If you can take charge

222
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
then no one will be able to trouble you anymore

223
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,360
Alright.

224
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,480
Then what if

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,519
I'm not the successor?

226
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,399
I believe you are.

227
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,120
Mr. Ma,

228
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,200
you shouldn't be so certain.

229
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,840
Over the years,

230
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,600
we've found quite a few so-called successors.

231
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,440
But in the end, they all turned out to be fake.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,639
You've seen the stone fragments too.

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,240
Only authentic Eight Immortals Boxing can do that.

234
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,600
There are countless martial arts.

235
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,720
Who can guarantee there aren't similar ones?

236
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
It's not that we don't want to keep our promise,

237
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,519
but it must be proven

238
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,480
that he is one hundred percent the successor.

239
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,559
If you want us to acknowledge him,

240
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,879
then we have to follow the rules.

241
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,799
That's right.

242
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,399
We must follow the rules.

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,399
These two are also masters of Eight Immortals Boxing.

244
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,960
They could also be successors.

245
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,919
So what you're saying is,

246
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,200
I have to compete with them?

247
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,720
Kid,

248
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,000
are you scared?

249
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,000
If you're scared, you can admit defeat.

250
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm scared.

251
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,840
I don't care if I'm the successor or not.

252
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,039
I just want Song Yiran's penalty fee.

253
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,480
I don't understand business matters.

254
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,759
But when it comes to martial arts,

255
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,600
I know a thing or two.

256
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,799
Back then, the old master said

257
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,080
that martial artists should focus on self-cultivation.

258
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,080
So, the old master

259
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,679
left behind this method of competition:

260
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,120
a balance of both intellect and martial skill.

261
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,960
Here are one hundred and fifty candles.

262
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,600
You will channel your inner energy.

263
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,919
Whoever extinguishes the candles

264
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,559
and gets closer to the last candle

265
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,759
will score higher.

266
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,120
In other words,

267
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,039
blowing out the first five rows earns sixty points.

268
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,679
The first ten rows, eighty points.

269
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,159
The last row, one hundred points.

270
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,960
Sixty-five points.

271
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,039
Ninety-one points.

272
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,559
Didn't do your best, huh?

273
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,879
You should have gotten ninety-five points.

274
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,440
What's wrong?

275
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,840
Are you scared?

276
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,440
If you can't do it, just leave.

277
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,360
That counts as your strike.

278
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,559
You didn't even extinguish a single candle.

279
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,799
Ye Wuming gets a perfect score.

280
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,080
Why?

281
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,559
He didn't put out a single candle.

282
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
He extinguished the very last one.

283
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,120
You

284
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
How did you do that?

285
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,399
I'm just setting an example.

286
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,519
This round is a demonstration of skill.

287
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,039
Is everyone convinced now?

288
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,960
Let's say he barely passed.

289
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,720
Since everyone has passed,

290
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,000
let's save some time

291
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,559
and get ready for the next round.

292
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,279
Okay.

293
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,360
This round tests the basic skills of a martial artist.

294
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,799
You will take turns using internal energy to extinguish candles from a distance.

295
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,679
The other person will listen and guess how many candles were put out.

296
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,919
The two who won the last round,

297
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,240
please take your positions.

298
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,080
Three.

299
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,080
Correct.

300
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,639
Five.

301
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,039
Correct.

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
This way of competing is boring.

303
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,120
Why don't we make it more challenging?

304
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
Let's identify directions: east, south, west, north.

305
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,480
And determine the position of the candles.

306
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,639
Sure.

307
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,279
Who goes first?

308
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,240
Since I suggested it, I'll go first.

309
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,039
All the candles on the two tables to the east are out.

310
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,159
Correct.

311
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,399
Your turn.

312
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,039
Please.

313
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,799
One at the first table on the south side

314
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,879
Two at the second table on the east side

315
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,240
The last table on the west side

316
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,519
One

317
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,279
Ye Wuming wins

318
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,080
Impossible

319
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,720
Absolutely impossible

320
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,159
Your ability to locate by sound

321
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,879
How could it reach this level

322
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,840
I was born with it

323
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,960
You're not bad either

324
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,159
Even though you cheated

325
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,720
You still have some real skills

326
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,799
How did you know

327
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,120
I guessed

328
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,720
Kid, you're really something

329
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm almost convinced

330
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
that you're a disciple of the Baxian Sect

331
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,399
But this concerns twenty billion

332
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,639
We have to be careful

333
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,679
Go back and wait for our notice

334
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,679
We'll confirm things on our end

335
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Ye Wuming

336
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
Don't think this twenty billion is so easy to get

337
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,559
Just wait

338
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,879
I'll show you how hot this money really is

339
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:47,960
Wuming

340
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,840
This test was about the basic skills of the Baxian Sect

341
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,919
Hearing and endurance were passed down by the master

342
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,799
I hope you can gain some insight from this

343
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,720
And recover some memories

344
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,639
It really did help me recover some muscle memory

345
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,720
Among the four of us

346
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,039
Mr. Feng is the wealthiest

347
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,720
And he's also the one

348
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,000
least willing to give up thirty percent of his wealth

349
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,960
He might make another move

350
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,319
Be very careful, young man

351
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,240
Understood

352
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,359
Still

353
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,000
Wuming, save me!
