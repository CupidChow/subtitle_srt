1
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Li

2
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,599
The task is complete.

3
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,400
Ye Wuming is dead.

4
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,000
I pushed him downstairs.

5
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,920
I made it look like he died from a fall.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,079
Good.

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,319
Once things quiet down,

8
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,519
and I’ve confirmed the body,

9
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
I’ll transfer the money to you.

10
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,319
Mr. Li

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,120
You’re truly impressive.

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,959
You actually managed to use public opinion

13
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,000
to make Ye Wuming look like a murder suspect.

14
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,319
Park Nanzhi had a car accident on the way to the hospital.

15
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,200
His death can’t be for nothing.

16
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,719
No one will care whether he lives or dies.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,799
Everyone only knows that Ye Wuming hit him.

18
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,760
What about the smear video of Song Yiran?

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,000
How did you manage that, Mr. Li?

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
After all, I’ve been in film and television for decades.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,000
I used montage techniques

22
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,439
to splice the video together.

23
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,959
Thirty percent truth, seventy percent fake.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,519
No one can tell the difference.

25
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,959
Brilliant.

26
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,079
It really is brilliant.

27
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,159
Mr. Li

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,960
How is it?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,159
Surprised to see me, aren't you?

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,599
You...

31
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,759
You're not dead.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,240
How could I, Wuming, possibly die?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,159
It must have been tough for you.

34
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,479
You really wanted to wipe the two of us out.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,599
Nice acting.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,879
So you were all putting on a show for me, huh?

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,439
Since we're all in the entertainment industry now,

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,199
of course we have to learn some acting skills.

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,120
Stop.

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,240
Are you okay?

41
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,919
Wuming.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,159
It's a real shame you're not an actor.

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,000
Brother Wuming.

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
You acted so well.

45
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,919
I almost want to be your agent.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,159
With my limited skills,

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,479
I can only fool Mr. Li by filming with my phone.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's hope he falls for it.

49
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,599
But how did you know

50
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,120
that Mr. Li would definitely come looking for us?

51
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,319
He's naturally suspicious.

52
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,960
He definitely wouldn't believe it so easily.

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,240
Just because you two changed.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
So we turned his own trick against him.

55
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,960
Call him.

56
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,120
Okay.

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,199
Hello, Mr. Li.

58
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,639
Let's meet up.

59
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,960
There's a surprise.

60
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,039
Let's go.

61
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,199
Let's go see him.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,800
What you just said

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,680
I've already recorded it all

64
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,520
With this testimony

65
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,039
we can prove Yiran's innocence

66
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,080
I recorded it too

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,240
There are two copies

68
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,319
Song Yiran

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
You're ungrateful

70
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,439
President Li

71
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,960
How many times have you said that line?

72
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,240
Don't you have anything new to say?

73
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,240
You know how fast my blade is

74
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,319
You know that

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,919
Brother Wuming won't let anyone leave

76
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,039
No one is leaving today

77
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,599
Isn't he your target?

78
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,680
Why are you following him?

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,439
The two of us sisters

80
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,560
Our greatest skill is shapeshifting

81
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,399
But in front of Brother Wuming

82
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,800
it's useless

83
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,160
He's someone we truly admire

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,040
and the most worthy to follow

85
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:28,920
Fine

86
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,680
I admit defeat

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,360
I give up

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,399
As long as you let me go,

89
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll clarify that you didn't kill that person.

90
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,000
And I'll admit that the incriminating video

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,079
was made by me.

92
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,759
It's too late.

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,959
If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,560
Everything you just said,

95
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,680
I can do right now.

96
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,759
So what do you want?

97
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,360
I just want you to confess and accept your punishment.

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,639
Boss Ye,

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,920
aren't you pushing your luck?

100
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,720
The rest

101
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,959
save it for the police.

102
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,319
Keep an eye on him.

103
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,519
Brother,

104
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,639
Mr. Li is already in a vegetative state.

105
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,920
The doctor said

106
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,240
there's no chance of him waking up.

107
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,279
Kai,

108
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,319
have you found out who hit him?

109
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,240
Yes, we found out.

110
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,879
It's just an ordinary office worker.

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,199
He has no connection to the Four Major Corporations.

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
From the scene,

113
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,839
it looks like a regular traffic accident.

114
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,800
How is that possible?

115
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,079
There's no way it was just a coincidence.

116
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,319
There must be a conspiracy.

117
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,560
All coincidences are carefully planned.

118
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,279
Mr. Li getting hit is definitely not simple.

119
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,319
I went to his house and company.

120
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,120
This guy took all the blame

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,680
onto himself.

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,399
He completely cleared his bastard son, Li Tianhao,

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,439
of any involvement.

124
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,279
Li Tianhao is such a coward.

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
He didn't even care about his own father and just ran away.

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,639
But don't worry, brother.

127
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Our people are still searching.

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,199
We'll dig him out sooner or later.

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,759
By the way,

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I found a USB drive

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
in his safe.

132
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I've copied everything onto it.

133
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,920
Hello, Mr. Ye Wuming.

134
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,240
By the time you see this video,

135
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,759
I should already be dead.

136
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
This drive contains all

137
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
the evidence of me slandering you and Song Yiran.

138
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,120
Of course,

139
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,120
there is also a video of me apologizing to you.

140
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,920
Having come to this point,

141
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,959
I am no longer in a position to negotiate with you.

142
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,319
However,

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,160
I still sincerely beg you to spare Tianhao.

144
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,199
Because he is no longer a threat to you.

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
This is a father's

146
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,680
final request.

147
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,240
Thank you.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,439
Although this man has done many bad things,

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
he can barely be considered a qualified father.

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,199
Forget it.

151
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,360
No need to look for Li Tianhao.

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Upload this video online.

153
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:16,959
Go ahead.

154
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Recently,

155
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,839
a video was released online

156
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,800
of an apology from Li, an executive at a film company,

157
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,879
along with evidence of slander.

158
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,439
Ye Wuming, chairman of Wuwei Pictures,

159
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,839
was cleared of murder suspicion.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,720
The public controversy surrounding actress Song Yiran

161
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,839
was also resolved.

162
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,160
The suspect, Li,

163
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,040
became comatose in a car accident

164
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
during the investigation.

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,439
The case is still under investigation.

166
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,399
The public security authorities

167
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,040
will pursue criminal responsibility according to the law.

168
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,720
No Name

169
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,360
Thank you.

170
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,240
Do we really need to say this between us?

171
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,199
The online controversy has passed now.

172
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,199
I want to make an official announcement this time.

173
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,319
To make our relationship public.

174
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:01,959
Still,

175
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,199
Although Mr. Li has been dealt with,

176
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
he was just a pawn.

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,199
The mastermind behind the scenes is still there.

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
So we should act even more discreetly.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,439
Alright, I'll listen to you.

180
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Senior Brother

181
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,639
I'm here to apologize.

182
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,839
Come in and let's talk.

183
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,080
Senior Brother

184
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,639
Sister Yiran

185
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,840
I came this time

186
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
just to apologize to you both.

187
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
I shouldn't have lost my mind.

188
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
I listened to what President Li said

189
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,279
and did those things.

190
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,720
I caused trouble for both of you.

191
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm truly sorry.

192
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
It's okay, Linglong.

193
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Actually, we should thank you too.

194
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,720
After going through all this,

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,480
it made me even more certain

196
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,559
about my feelings for Wuming.

197
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,480
Let the past stay in the past.

198
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,000
We should all look forward.

199
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,679
Don't you think?

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,559
Sister Yiran

201
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,240
You're so generous.

202
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,720
It makes me feel even worse about what I did before.

203
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,519
Junior Sister

204
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,759
Your contract with President Li

205
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,120
should be automatically terminated now.

206
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,519
If you don't mind, you can sign with me.

207
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,039
It's okay, Senior Brother.

208
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,159
I've already agreed to go with Senior Sister.

209
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:17,799
That's fine.

210
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,159
We'll definitely have a chance to work together again in the future.

211
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:25,679
That's good too.

212
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,559
We're all family.

213
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
Senior Sister will definitely help you too.

214
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,679
Then I'll get going.

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,279
I wish you both happiness.

216
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,120
Do you feel it's a pity?

217
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,159
Such a good Junior Sister,

218
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,799
and she truly cares about you.

219
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,200
What do you think?

220
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,759
Dad

221
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,200
I will definitely avenge you.

222
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,600
Yiran

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
This is the last scene.

224
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,440
You're the one driving.

225
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,480
And then,

226
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,799
the lions and tigers

227
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,960
are chasing you from behind.

228
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,399
And then,

229
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,600
as you keep driving,

230
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,759
the lights suddenly go out.

231
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,159
They go out.

232
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,919
Then you get out of the car.

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,879
You check what's going on.

234
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,879
Connect the power.

235
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:35,679
The power is connected.

236
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,759
Then, as soon as you touch the switch,

237
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,799
then you

238
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,440
get electrocuted.

239
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,519
But don't worry,

240
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,879
nothing is actually connected over there.

241
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,159
The fuse box isn't connected, it's very safe.

242
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,240
It's all fake, fake.

243
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,399
Okay, okay, I understand.

244
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,200
I understand.

245
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,480
Will this really electrocute her?

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,519
Only if Song Yiran dies

247
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,399
will it count as avenging my dad.

248
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,879
Okay.

249
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,440
Okay.

250
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,000
Alright, take a moment to get ready, okay?

251
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,399
Okay.

252
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,320
All departments, get ready.

253
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,200
We're about to start filming.

254
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,240
No problem.

255
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,159
Episode 24, Scene 12.

256
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,000
One take.

257
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,080
Three, two, one, action.

258
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,399
Okay, stop, pass.

259
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,240
One take, passed.

260
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,559
Awesome, Yiran!

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,519
Yiran.

262
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,720
Yiran.

263
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,080
Yiran.

264
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,879
Yiran.

265
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,240
Yiran.

266
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,360
Yiran.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,480
Yiran.

268
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,519
Yiran.

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,279
Dad.

270
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,759
I avenged you.
