1
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,319
My mom sent the household registration book.

2
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,159
That's good.

3
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,959
But I feel that

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,799
I've always wanted my own household registration book.

5
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,599
This household registration book is too crowded.

6
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,640
But if I have a household registration book just for myself,

7
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,959
I feel a bit scared.

8
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,359
Don't be afraid.

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Haven't I always been by your side?

10
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,079
I'm really envious that you have your own household registration book.

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,680
I don't.

12
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,640
That's easy.

13
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,120
My household registration book can take you in.

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,359
No, that won't do.

15
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,680
I don't even know who I am.

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,480
What if I was divorced before?

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,680
Or

18
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,239
Or what if I'm not fully divorced yet?

19
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,159
Then I'll wait for you.

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Still.

21
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,120
Before I recover my memory,

22
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,280
I don't dare make any promises to you.

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,759
I don't know who I am.

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
I don't know what kind of experiences I've had.

25
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,360
What if I was dangerous before?

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
What if after I recover my memory,

27
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,159
I find out that I

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,479
don't like you anymore?

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,599
I'm not afraid.

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm afraid.

31
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,080
I can't drag you down with me.

32
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,479
But I think

33
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,400
none of these are reasons.

34
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,800
Get some rest early.

35
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,759
We still have filming tomorrow.

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Wuming.

37
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,599
I will definitely help you recover your memory.

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,400
You don't seem quite yourself today, sis.

39
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,439
You must help Wuming regain his memory.

40
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,680
Of course I'll help him get his memory back.

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,479
But if he regains his memory,

42
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,240
he won't be the same Ye Wuming as he is now.

43
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,159
If he regains his memory,

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,439
he might not be like he is now,

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,680
completely belonging to me.

46
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,560
But I know

47
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,199
he's always wanted to find his former self.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,039
This matter

49
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,159
has always been important to him.

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,759
Are you asking me for help now?

51
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,759
I heard that you, Song Yiran, never ask anyone for help.

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,039
That's right.

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
I am asking you.

54
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,520
For Wuming's sake,

55
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,319
I'm willing to ask you.

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
Besides, this is something you've always wanted to do.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,360
We have the same goal.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
We can work together.

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,959
The famous Song Yiran

60
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,360
is actually asking me for help now.

61
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,879
I must be quite charming as a senior, then.

62
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,000
What should I do?

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
Now I really don't want to give my senior to you.

64
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,439
I promise you.

65
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,360
Although I'm not completely sure,

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,199
there are still some methods we can try.

67
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,399
You know,

68
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,519
I'm someone who

69
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,240
is best at making incense and sedative fragrances.

70
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,160
Ever since I met senior,

71
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,839
I've made some medicine specifically for him.

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,560
Now the choice is yours.

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,279
Do you dare to give him the medicine?

74
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,600
Why is it black?

75
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,879
Shouldn't it be colorless and tasteless?

76
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,800
That's how it was when I filmed period dramas before.

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,800
This obviously has a problem.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,240
Only a fool would drink it.

79
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,199
Back from running.

80
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:43,639
You're back.

81
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,639
I just poured you a cup on purpose.

82
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,399
Water.

83
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,519
Water.

84
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,439
I added some brown sugar.

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,879
Anyway, I poured it especially for you.

86
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,680
Go ahead and drink it.

87
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,079
Cinnabar, jujube seed.

88
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,279
Dragon's tooth, polygala.

89
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,560
And night-blooming vine.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,199
It's a calming formula.

91
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,680
But why are there some stimulating ingredients?

92
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,040
Wuming.

93
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,000
What's wrong with you?

94
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,319
Are you okay? Say something.

95
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,439
Don't scare me.

96
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,160
Where did this medicine come from?

97
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,000
Yue Linglong gave it to me.

98
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,680
She said drinking it would restore my memory.

99
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
I didn't know it would feel this bad.

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,399
Let's not try anymore. We won't try again.

101
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,319
We have to try, we have to.

102
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
This medicine is painful,

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,959
but it really works.

104
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,040
It can help me get my memory back.

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,439
Pour me another cup, hurry.

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,040
Hello?

107
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,399
Mr. Ye, did you miss me?

108
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,439
Who is this?

109
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
You don't even remember my voice?

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
But I missed you.

111
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
Let's meet up.

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,360
Another prank call.

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,279
I'm hanging up.

114
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,439
Yi Ran is next to you, isn't she?

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,959
Don't hang up yet.

116
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,360
I think I've found the truth about your master's death.

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,920
Maybe this is also

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,839
an important reason why you lost your memory.

119
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
Are you done yet?

120
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,639
Don't call again.

121
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,160
If you don't come,

122
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,160
I'll have to come to you.

123
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,000
You wouldn't want to drag Yi Ran into this, would you?

124
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,759
Your master's death

125
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,240
seems to be related to her.

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,360
Will this affect your relationship?

127
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,240
Who was that?

128
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,759
Just a prank call.

129
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:58,680
Alright.

130
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,600
I just took that medicine, and now I have a headache.

131
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,839
I'm going out for some air.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That medicine of yours—

133
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,639
Didn't you just say you wanted another dose?

134
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,639
Why do you need to go out for air again?

135
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Did that medicine

136
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,439
make you lose your mind?

137
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,159
I'm here.

138
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
Are you done playing around?

139
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,519
If you have any news, tell me.

140
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,080
Is anyone there?

141
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,240
My job is to take money and solve problems for others.

142
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,879
As long as the target is alive,

143
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,360
I can't stop for a single day.

144
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,559
That's called professional ethics.

145
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,799
So you said you have news about my master,

146
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,600
or are you lying to me?

147
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,039
You're an illegal worker.

148
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,360
Why are you working so hard?

149
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,679
The information is real.

150
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,399
It's up to you whether you believe it.

151
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,240
Speak.

152
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,559
The movie Song Yiran filmed three years ago

153
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,720
was a scam from start to finish.

154
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,240
She used filming as an excuse to go to your master's place.

155
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,480
Her real purpose was to kill your master.

156
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,840
I even saw the edited photos.

157
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,120
My master is so skilled,

158
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,240
and Yiran doesn't know martial arts.

159
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
How could that be true?

160
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,240
Looks like you don't believe me.

161
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,559
Of course I don't believe you.

162
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,039
Then guess where she is now.

163
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,240
I don't want to waste words with you.

164
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,639
Really?

165
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,039
I've dragged this out for so long,

166
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,960
it should be almost done by now.

167
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,039
If you want to save Song Yiran,

168
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,679
it's probably already too late.

169
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,399
Sorry.

170
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,919
It's already too late.

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,720
Where is she?

172
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,039
I've been her agent for three years.

173
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,759
I chose for her

174
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,519
the most merciful way to die.

175
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,639
Carbon monoxide poisoning—ever heard of it?

176
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,960
You'd better run faster.
