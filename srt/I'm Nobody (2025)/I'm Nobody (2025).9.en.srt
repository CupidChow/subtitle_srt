1
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,000
So, is she dead?

2
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,599
Of course she's fine.

3
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,439
I cut all of them.

4
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,799
Look here.

5
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,120
Look here, look here.

6
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,239
Ma San.

7
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Why is it you?

8
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,719
If I told you Brother Wuming knows all about your plan,

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,799
would you believe me?

10
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,879
He might even be right outside your door now.

11
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,360
Impossible.

12
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,759
He's still at the plaza right now.

13
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
There's no way he could find this place.

14
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,400
You can't be so sure.

15
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,520
How did you find this place?

16
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,960
You were just at the plaza a moment ago.

17
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,400
Want to know?

18
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,919
We scouted the area in advance.

19
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,960
We noticed there was wire on the ground.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,759
So we guessed

21
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,000
you wanted to stage Yiran's accidental death.

22
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,080
Since you set up such a big show,

23
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
we had to play along.

24
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,719
You thought you were watching me,

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,159
but I had already left.

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,479
Go save them, senior brother.

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
When you were on the phone with San just now,

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,199
I was in the hallway.

29
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,360
So it was easy to pinpoint your location.

30
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
So you set me up.

31
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,360
If you really want to save them,

32
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,159
then I'll just kill the hostages.

33
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,159
Honey, hurry, go!

34
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,199
Quick, quick, go!

35
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,599
Ye Wuming!

36
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,240
Uncle, Auntie.

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,960
We’ll leave first.

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,840
I’ll arrange for you.

39
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,280
Go rest in the mountains for a while.

40
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,240
Let’s go quickly.

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,719
Okay.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,759
Wuming.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,120
Thank you.

44
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,240
I can only let them leave here first.

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,199
They’re your weakness.

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,039
If there’s real danger,

47
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,080
I can only protect you, not them.

48
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,120
As a bodyguard,

49
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,639
I’m a professional.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Then let’s go.

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,800
This is the stone Ye Wuming smashed.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,080
That’s authentic Eight Immortals Fist.

53
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,960
I didn’t expect that.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,199
This kid is a successor of the Eight Immortals Sect.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,800
Tianhao.

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,439
You’ve done a great job this time.

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,680
But if he’s the descendant of that thing—

58
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,920
Wouldn’t that make things even more troublesome for us?

59
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,560
Do you remember Boss Ma?

60
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,040
That turtle guy or whatever.

61
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,879
He has a grudge against Boss Ma.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,959
Boss Ma once offered a huge reward

63
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,639
for the descendants of the Eight Immortals Sect,

64
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,680
dead or alive.

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,839
Boss Ma’s younger brother, Ma Nan,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,639
has always coveted Boss Ma’s position.

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
Let’s set up another trap.

68
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,040
Let Ye Wuming take the fall.

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,759
Go.

70
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,759
Send the videos and photos to Ma Nan.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,560
I’ll go right away.

72
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,560
Go.

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,360
I've been giving him this medicine for two months now.

74
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,160
How come my brother is still so energetic?

75
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,600
Are you sure you can handle this?

76
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,680
It's just a matter of a couple more days.

77
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,800
The effects of the medicine will soon be uncontrollable.

78
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,120
You need to hurry up and find a scapegoat.

79
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,800
Otherwise, in the next couple of days, who knows when

80
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,720
he might have an episode.

81
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:28,720
Brother.

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,360
Big brother, come here.

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,079
Are you alright?

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Getting older now,

85
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,720
my health is getting worse day by day.

86
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,560
Why aren't you at the company?

87
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,079
What are you doing here?

88
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,079
Here's the thing.

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,959
I received an email from you.

90
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,319
There was a video in it.

91
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,120
It said it was about the company's bounty.

92
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,920
Here, take a look.

93
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,879
A bounty?

94
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,079
That's authentic Baxian Fist.

95
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,879
These stones are shattered along the veins.

96
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,680
No other martial art can do that.

97
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,000
It's that guy.

98
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,199
He's Ye Wuming.

99
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,480
The one who lives off a woman.

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,319
He latched onto a female celebrity.

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,399
Song Yiran.

102
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,319
Arrange a meeting.

103
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,720
Invite Song Yiran.

104
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,399
Don't mention Ye Wuming.

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,920
So we don't alert them.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,319
Alright, brother.

107
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,120
I understand.

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
The scapegoat has been found.

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,399
It's happening today.

110
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,240
Don't worry, Mr. Nan.

111
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,839
Wuming, look.

112
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,839
Mr. Ma is definitely a senior figure in the industry.

113
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,399
He has assets worth tens of billions.

114
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,959
His company, Wuwei Film,

115
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,800
is ranked fifth among film companies.

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,399
But why did he suddenly invite me?

117
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,120
Could it be that he wants to sign me?

118
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,079
If you can sign with his company,

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,759
then even Mr. Li wouldn't dare make any rash moves.

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,040
Then I'll go change my clothes.

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,199
Hello, Mr. Li.

122
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,600
Ye Wuming has arrived.

123
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,120
Dad.

124
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,480
What should we do next?

125
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you know Ye Wuming can do acupuncture?

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,160
The poison in Mr. Ma's body

127
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,600
is specifically targeted against acupuncture.

128
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,079
Please wait a moment, both of you.

129
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,839
As long as Mr. Ma passes out at this moment,

130
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,800
and Ye Wuming tries to save him with acupuncture,

131
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,199
then he will be the murderer.

132
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,959
Welcome to my humble abode.

133
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,079
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ma.

134
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,160
Young man, please come inside.

135
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,439
Brother.

136
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,439
Brother.

137
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,199
What's wrong, brother?

138
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,600
Mr. Ma.

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,079
Sir.

140
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,639
Mr. Ma.

141
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Mr. Ma.

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,600
Doctor, call an ambulance!

143
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,439
It's already been called.

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,399
It will arrive in half an hour.

145
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,160
The ambulance will take so long to get here?

146
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,560
Won't my brother die by then?

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,079
Mr. Ma's condition is very serious right now.

148
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,360
And he can't be moved casually.

149
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,199
Then how can we get him to take action?

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,800
Because he's kind-hearted.

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Now it all depends on Ma Nan.

152
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
There's nothing we can do right now.

153
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
We can only wait for the ambulance to arrive.

154
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,639
Aren't you my brother's attending doctor?

155
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,559
If something happens to my brother, none of you are leaving.

156
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,879
Quick, let's try again.

157
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,879
I can wake him up.

158
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,480
Mr. Ma.

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
He's awake, he's awake, brother!

160
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,240
Brother.

161
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,679
Old Master Ma

162
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,399
President Ma

163
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,759
Sir! Sir!

164
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,240
President Ma has no heartbeat.

165
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,000
Ye Wuming, you murderer!

166
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,440
Ye Wuming, you killed my brother!

167
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,399
Using acupuncture?

168
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,639
That's complete nonsense.

169
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,279
You were the one who said President Ma wouldn't make it.

170
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
No one is leaving today.

171
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,279
Hello, President Li.

172
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,759
It's done.

173
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,360
According to the effects of the medicine,

174
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,200
we can declare him dead in five minutes.

175
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
President Nan really lived up to expectations.

176
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,120
Now Ye Wuming has become a murderer.

177
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,200
We've finally gotten rid of that eyesore.

178
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,919
Now that Ye is gone,

179
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,240
will Song Yiran still dare to disobey?

180
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,080
Stay calm.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,519
Things aren't settled yet.

182
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,440
Be happy.

183
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,960
Let's celebrate in five minutes.

184
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
There's no heartbeat.

185
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,639
What's the point of doing this now?

186
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,679
Ye Wuming.

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,159
I've already called the police.

188
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,519
When the police arrive soon,

189
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
I'll personally take you to the police station.

190
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,919
Come.

191
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,200
Help me up.

192
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,360
Slowly, slowly.

193
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm having a heart attack.

194
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,879
Sir,

195
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,639
You’re not having a heart attack.

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,519
You’ve been poisoned with a slow-acting toxin.

197
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,240
And it’s been at least two months.

198
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,240
I just helped reduce the effects of the poison.

199
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,320
I’ll prescribe you some medicine.

200
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,519
Take it for a month and you’ll be fine.

201
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,200
But

202
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,840
you need to be careful of those around you.

203
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,399
It seems someone doesn’t want you to live long.

204
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,600
No, Ye Wuming, who are you looking at?

205
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,919
Don’t make baseless accusations.

206
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,639
I never said it was you.

207
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
You’re the one taking it personally.

208
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,879
Sir,

209
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,639
find someone you trust

210
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,159
and have your recent medicine tested.

211
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,679
Then you’ll know everything.

212
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,600
Boss Ma, don’t worry.

213
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,919
I’ll handle this myself.

214
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
Brother, how could I ever harm you?

215
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,799
You’ve always said Baxian Sect is our enemy.

216
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,960
This guy is from Baxian Sect.

217
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,120
He must be trying to sow discord.

218
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,799
Enough!

219
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,840
I’ll settle all these scores one by one.

220
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,960
Young man,

221
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,320
help me up.

222
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:46,799
Alright.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,679
What's wrong, Dad?

224
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,720
Boss Ma was saved.

225
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
He survived.

226
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Didn't they say he was certain to die?

227
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,600
Who saved him?

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,039
Who else could it be?

229
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,600
Ye Wuming.

230
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,559
It's him again.

231
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,840
Him again.

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,200
Just you wait.

233
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,159
Boss Ma, the test results are out.

234
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,519
Please take a look.

235
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,080
Ma Nan.

236
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,720
To seize the Ma family's fortune,

237
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,000
you actually colluded with the doctor to harm me.

238
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,919
Back when the Ma family had trouble,

239
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,320
it was you who leaked the information.

240
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,039
I never expected

241
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,240
you still haven't repented to this day.

242
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
Take him to the police station.

243
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,399
Brother!

244
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,000
Let's go.

245
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,039
Young man,

246
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,320
I asked you here

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,279
just to confirm something.

248
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,759
Are you the successor of the Baxian Sect?

249
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,000
Thank you, Mr. Ma,

250
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,919
but I'm really not the successor you mentioned.

251
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,879
The Baxian Sect once saved my life.

252
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,600
If they hadn't stepped in,

253
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,559
the Four Major Groups

254
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,039
would have lost much more than just money.

255
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,919
Young man,

256
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,080
today you saved my life again.

257
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,240
Half of my Qianli Group's fortune

258
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,080
can be yours.

259
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,120
Thank you, Mr. Ma,

260
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,840
but I can't accept this money.

261
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,159
Repaying kindness is the Ma family's rule.

262
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,200
Mr. Ma,

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
thank you for your kindness,

264
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
but I don't want anything.

265
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,639
Here,

266
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,600
this is a prescription to help treat your illness.

267
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,440
Take good care of yourself.

268
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm leaving now.

269
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,440
Thank you.

270
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,279
Take care.

271
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,039
I was planning to show you around and broaden your horizons.

272
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,639
Turns out, the joke was on me.

273
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,879
You're the real guest of honor they wanted to invite.

274
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,720
Ye Wuming.

275
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,559
I didn't expect that, besides the girls liking you,

276
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,679
even among the older men,

277
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
you're quite popular.

278
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,120
Don't put it that way.

279
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,759
Mr. Ma was just being polite to me.

280
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,840
It's all because of Miss Song.

281
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,200
Alright.

282
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,799
San'er just called me.

283
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,639
All the paparazzi at our door have left.

284
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,519
Let's go home.

285
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,200
Home.

286
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
Finally back.

287
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,639
My big house.

288
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,039
I missed you so much.

289
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,200
Look at this Italian designer

290
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,840
handmade limited edition sofa.

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,279
They're back.

292
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,879
The sunlight through these floor-to-ceiling windows just feels different.

293
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,039
And this dining table.

294
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,600
It's a bit dirty.

295
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,399
Let's wash our hands.
