1
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,319
Yiran

2
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,319
Yiran

3
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,719
Mr. Li

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,480
The task is complete.

5
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,120
Song Yiran is doomed.

6
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,480
It's like this.

7
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,040
The human brain is very complex.

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

9
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,079
We still can't find the reason.

10
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,079
In this situation,

11
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,040
I suggest she recuperate in a familiar environment.

12
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,680
Thank you.

13
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,800
Brother

14
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,800
Yiran won't.

15
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,479
Shut up.

16
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,319
It's okay.

17
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,319
Yiran will definitely be fine.

18
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,039
Yiran

19
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,960
Wake up.

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,639
Brother

21
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,680
You didn't eat again.

22
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,599
You have to eat this meal today.

23
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,680
Yiran

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
I didn't protect you well.

25
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,199
I heard

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
that after a man experiences the warmth of a home,

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,599
he really wants to get married.

28
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,000
Look at this.

29
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,560
Doesn't it look like a wedding ring?

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,400
My household registration has taken you in.

31
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,000
Before I regain my memory,

32
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,199
I don't dare make any promises to you.

33
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,639
I don't know who I am.

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,479
I don't know what kind of experiences I've had.

35
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,199
What if I was dangerous before?

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,960
What if after I regain my memory,

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,199
I find that I

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,280
don't like you anymore?

39
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,639
I'm not afraid.

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,639
I can't drag you down with me.

41
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,639
But I think

42
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,560
none of these are reasons.

43
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,639
I'm sorry, Yiran.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,599
If I had another chance,

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
I definitely wouldn't pretend to be clueless with you.

46
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,919
No matter who I am,

47
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
no matter if I regain my memory or not,

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
it doesn't matter.

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
I should cherish the present

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,000
and the chance to be with you.

51
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,920
Yiran,

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
if you can hear me,

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,040
please wake up, okay?

54
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,680
Yiran,

55
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,319
Yiran, you're awake!

56
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,680
It's okay.

57
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,399
I've been with you the whole time.

58
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,279
Until you woke up.

59
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,959
Wuming.

60
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,079
I heard everything.

61
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,639
Don't cry anymore.

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
If you keep crying, your makeup will smudge.

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,040
Still.

64
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,759
Really?

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,279
Your makeup is all smudged.

66
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,040
I need to fix my makeup.

67
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,120
Okay.

68
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,480
Touch up makeup.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Touch up makeup.

70
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:15,959
Brother

71
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,839
Brother

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,639
I know Sister Yiran has woken up.

73
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,839
You're really happy, aren't you?

74
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,399
But you can't keep smiling like that all the time.

75
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,399
San'er

76
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,279
Before, I never dared let you call Yiran "sister-in-law."

77
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,560
From now on, you can call her that openly.

78
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,759
It's settled.

79
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,800
So my idol will become my sister-in-law.

80
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,160
I heard Ye Wuming took on Song Yiran's movie.

81
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,199
"Needle Hidden in Embroidery"

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,279
It will be screened and promoted in two hundred cinemas.

83
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,600
That's right.

84
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,920
This is Song Yiran's

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,879
first time playing the female lead in a movie.

86
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,319
They're taking it very seriously.

87
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,720
You definitely don't want

88
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,759
Ye Wuming and Song Yiran to become more and more successful, right?

89
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,120
Of course.

90
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,800
But they've already signed a contract with the distribution company.

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
Everything is ready.

92
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
The contract is just a piece of paper.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,560
But people are flexible.

94
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,720
Even with a contract signed,

95
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,319
things can still go wrong.

96
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,319
Mr. Feng, you mean...

97
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,560
Mr. Li,

98
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,000
what about the penalty fee?

99
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,800
I've already prepared it.

100
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,519
If money can solve it,

101
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
it's a small matter.

102
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,439
You just make the decisions.

103
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,120
I'll handle the money.

104
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,879
Only come to me if it goes over five hundred million.

105
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,759
I'm leaving.

106
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Thank you for your support, Mr. Feng.

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,279
I'm freezing to death.

108
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,040
The air conditioning just turned on and I can't stand it already.

109
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,120
Lao Qi,

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,600
pour a drink for Mr. Hu.

111
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,040
Here you go, Boss Hu.

112
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,759
Have a drink to warm up.

113
00:07:59,319 --> 00:07:59,920
Mr. Li,

114
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,120
the 200 cinemas that Mr. Ye wanted—

115
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,560
suddenly stopped, it's not appropriate.

116
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,439
Right.

117
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,959
It's about keeping our word.

118
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,199
How could we let you break the contract, Mr. Hu?

119
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,720
Lao Qi, close the door.

120
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,199
Mr. Li, Mr. Li!

121
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,160
Mr. Li!

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,680
I admit to breaching the contract.

123
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,360
I'll pay the penalty.

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
Please show some mercy.

125
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,040
What are you saying?

126
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,199
I'm asking you for a favor.

127
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,920
How could I let you suffer a loss?

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,439
Your contract is for twenty million, right?

129
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,199
Yes.

130
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,160
The penalty is thirty million.

131
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,759
I have thirty-three million in this card.

132
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,799
I just have one small request.

133
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,360
Cancel the contract on the very last day.

134
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,360
Mr. Hu

135
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,879
Black and white

136
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,519
Our contract is written very clearly

137
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,519
Now you're going back on your word

138
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,279
What does this mean?

139
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,720
I'm really sorry, Mr. Zhao

140
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,919
It's our team's fault for not doing a good job

141
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,720
Is this just not doing a good job?

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,919
Two hundred cinemas

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Now you only have five left

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,399
What's the point for me now?

145
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,240
Did Mr. Li talk to you?

146
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,120
This has nothing to do with anyone else

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,039
It's all the cinemas' own decisions

148
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,120
They don't have confidence in Song Yiran's movie

149
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,200
Whether they have confidence or not

150
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,679
Shouldn't we all follow the contract?

151
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,320
Sorry, Mr. Ye

152
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm just a minor manager

153
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,919
There's really nothing I can do

154
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,919
What do we do now?

155
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
Unless you handle the cinemas yourselves

156
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,279
But getting two hundred cinemas sorted in one day

157
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,799
Is basically impossible

158
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I'll take my leave now

159
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,720
Mr. Hu

160
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,480
Forget it

161
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,360
How about we pick a new release date?

162
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,799
No

163
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,720
The movie must premiere tomorrow

164
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,320
We've promoted for so long, suddenly pulling it

165
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,480
The market will definitely question the movie's quality

166
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,879
It'll affect your reputation and popularity

167
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,519
But there's only one day left

168
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,840
We simply don't have enough time

169
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,759
Mr. Ye, what do we do now?

170
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,480
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it

171
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,759
I have someone in mind

172
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,039
You don't have money to pay me back.

173
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,679
But you have money to drink, huh?

174
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,919
Brother Qi,

175
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I, Old Kai, am really not someone who doesn't pay his debts.

176
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,240
I've been having a tough time lately.

177
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,679
I have a bunch of brothers relying on me for food.

178
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,080
Give me one more month.

179
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,639
Do you think I'm stupid?

180
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,440
Didn't you say the same thing last month?

181
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,399
Brother Qi,

182
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,759
Everyone has tough times.

183
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,879
Are you crazy?

184
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,480
He owes me money.

185
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,200
And he's lecturing me?

186
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Drink it.

187
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,799
I'll give you another month.

188
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,519
Drink.

189
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
Drink.

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,440
Stop!

191
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,399
Brother Kai!

192
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,759
Ye... Hero Ye!

193
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,759
It's a misunderstanding.

194
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:38,919
A misunderstanding.

195
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,720
How much does he owe?

196
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,679
Five hundred thousand.

197
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,440
There's a million in this card.

198
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,360
Drink it.

199
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,080
We were just messing around.

200
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,159
Get lost.

201
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,240
Hero Ye!

202
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
The... the password?

203
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,759
Six eights.

204
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,919
Hero Ye is righteous.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,679
Ye Wuming

206
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,759
I used to always bully you.

207
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,679
Why are you helping me?

208
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,720
Kai

209
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,080
Helping you isn't for nothing.

210
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,639
There's something that maybe only you can do.

211
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,799
Of course, if you think you can't do it,

212
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,600
then just think of it as me having misjudged you.

213
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,720
Go ahead, say it.

214
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,840
What is it?

215
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,240
I don't owe you anything.

216
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,720
Sit.

217
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,120
I need you tonight

218
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,600
to handle all 200 cinemas in the city.

219
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,960
Get them to screen a movie tomorrow.

220
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,039
Don't worry.

221
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,440
Money isn't an issue.

222
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,639
It's not that I won't take it.

223
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,360
I have a lot of brothers,

224
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,279
but they're not good at negotiating.

225
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,559
There's no way we can pull this off.

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,080
I got stabbed in the back at the last minute.

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
If we go talk to them now,

228
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,480
it might go smoothly.

229
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
It shouldn't be too much trouble.

230
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,279
It'll just mean you and the guys have to make a few more trips.

231
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,080
Kai, this doesn't really take any special skills.

232
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,919
If you can't even do this,

233
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,480
then you really aren't up to it.

234
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
What does this have to do with you?

235
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,840
Bro, forget I said anything.

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,720
I'll take it.

237
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,519
Mr. Li, long time no see.

238
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,320
What brings you here, Mr. Ye?

239
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,639
Mr. Li.

240
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm here to make a bet with you.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,639
Alright.

242
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,759
I accept your bet.

243
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,120
If you lose,

244
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,799
you have to give me the shares of Wuwei Pictures

245
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,000
all of them.
