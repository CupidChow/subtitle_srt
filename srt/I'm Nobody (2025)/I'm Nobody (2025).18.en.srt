1
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,200
You

2
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,840
How did you get out?

3
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,599
Stay over there for now.

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,519
Be careful, Wuming.

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
Ye Wuming

6
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,840
As long as you protect her, you have a weakness.

7
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Today is the day you die.

8
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,920
So you’re twins.

9
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,239
How is that possible?

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,719
We sisters have trained hard for years in the dark.

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,239
How could you find us so precisely?

12
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,560
You two really do look alike.

13
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,560
Your movements and expressions,

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,080
the way you speak and your tone,

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,360
are all exactly the same.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,639
But no matter how similar two people are,

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
there are still tiny differences in their voiceprints.

18
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,360
And I happen to have excellent hearing.

19
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,360
I already figured out you were two people.

20
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,280
Hearing?

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,759
Can you really locate people by sound?

22
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,199
I stopped practicing that when I was ten.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,479
No.

24
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,039
You’re definitely not the real Ye Wuming.

25
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,080
The original Ye Wuming

26
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
was never this strong.

27
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,879
So you really do know me.

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,639
The old me really couldn’t do this.

29
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,240
Because I lost my memories of martial arts training.

30
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,520
And was distracted by three years of ordinary life.

31
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,000
But now,

32
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,719
I’ve regained it all.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
In the face of such strength,

34
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,479
we really have no chance of winning.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,919
Why do you want to kill her?

36
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,919
We have no choice, either.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
Someone paid us.

38
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,039
We took the job.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,199
Our company is extremely strict.

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,639
Once we accept a job, we have to complete it.

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,639
If Song Yiran doesn't die,

42
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,599
then we will be the ones to die.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,759
Let's go.

44
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,439
With me here,

45
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,759
you won't be able to kill her.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,039
Yes.

47
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,759
We admit defeat.

48
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,360
Goodbye.

49
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,000
Wuming.

50
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
I know we used to be close.

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
But now,

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
I can't remember anything.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
It's okay.

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Then let's get to know each other again.

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
Kai, did you remember everything?

57
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,960
I want to recreate the scene from our first meeting.

58
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,199
It has to be exactly the same.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,719
President Ye doesn't recognize anyone now.

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,120
Then, he really hits hard.

61
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,360
I'll pay you extra.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,360
If you get hurt, I'll treat you.

63
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,759
Okay, okay, bro.

64
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,599
Alright, alright.

65
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,199
Okay.

66
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,280
Okay.

67
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,400
Okay, let's go.

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
My head is spinning.

69
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,680
Hello.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
The keys are in the bag.

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,639
Hurry up and get in the car.

72
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,120
What do you mean?

73
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,199
You're the driver I called.

74
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,439
You need to take me home now.

75
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,759
I can't drive.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,560
So dizzy.

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
Remember, stick to the script.

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,720
Follow me, follow me.

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,920
Come on, come on, Kai!

80
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,600
Be careful.

81
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,120
This is my friend.

82
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,279
We're taking her home.

83
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,240
You guys?

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,199
Us.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,279
We.

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,199
Me.

87
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,279
Me.

88
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:54,839
This...

89
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
This isn't going according to the script.

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,399
No way.

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,639
I need to think of another way.

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,079
So dizzy.

93
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,199
I still can't hold on.

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,639
Why do I feel so dizzy all of a sudden?

95
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,680
Cover me up, my skirt is pretty short.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
I drank too much.

97
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,879
So dizzy.

98
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,519
I want to throw up.

99
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
So dizzy.

100
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,720
Just sit there.

101
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
You, you need to stay here.

102
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,519
You need to stand next to me.

103
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm so dizzy.

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,759
Don't go.

105
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,720
Help!

106
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,839
Save me!

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,439
What exactly are you trying to do?

108
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,439
I...

109
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,240
I just drank too much.

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,639
I'm so dizzy.

111
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,399
I'm thirsty. I want some water.

112
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,920
So thirsty...

113
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,319
Here it comes, I'm about to throw up.

114
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,279
Even though it's a bit disgusting,

115
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,399
but to get my memory back...

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
The old man left us rules to follow.

117
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,000
The successor's character must be beyond reproach.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,120
Ye Wuming is now suspected of murder.

119
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,480
This goes against the rules.

120
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,079
Mr. Feng,

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,199
Where did those slanders come from?

122
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,879
You can't possibly not know.

123
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,360
The innocent will prove themselves.

124
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
All the evidence has already been made public.

125
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Why, Mr. Feng,

126
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,160
do you insist on believing those rumors?

127
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,199
In business,

128
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,800
reputation is everything.

129
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
Public opinion matters.

130
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,360
With the current public sentiment,

131
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,439
handing over twenty billion to him so rashly

132
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,759
is too risky.

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,439
Since we're following the rules,

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,759
let's handle things by the book.

135
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
There's still one week left.

136
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,920
Unless he can prove his innocence.

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,279
The old man really misjudged you all back then.

138
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,079
Mr. Ma,

139
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,439
You can't say that.

140
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,160
Everything I do

141
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
is in accordance with the old man's rules.

142
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,040
Fine.

143
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,920
Then let's do things by the rules.

144
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,439
Mr. Li,

145
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
give them some more explosive news.

146
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Take down Song Yiran as well.

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,319
It doesn't matter if the method is old.

148
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,639
As long as it works.

149
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,120
Photos can be faked too.

150
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,439
Sit down quickly.

151
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,839
Boss, we’d like to order.

152
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,519
Coming.

153
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,639
You two again.

154
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,240
One couple’s set meal.

155
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,399
I haven’t ordered yet.

156
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,199
Then you order.

157
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,199
We’ll have a couple’s set meal.

158
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,160
Isn’t that the same?

159
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,199
No, just bring it quickly.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,839
Alright.

161
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,399
Did you remember anything?

162
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,559
No.

163
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,519
Boss, we want to take a photo.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,519
You, come stand behind me.

165
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,759
Just like in that photo.

166
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,360
Stand behind me.

167
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

168
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,480
Look, you made a gesture like this back then.

169
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,240
Yeah.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,440
Come on.

171
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,240
Yes, good.

172
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,200
One, two, three.

173
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,080
Please serve the food quickly.

174
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,759
Alright.

175
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,240
Did you remember anything?

176
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Look, it’s exactly the same.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,519
No.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,519
It’s okay.

179
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,519
Let’s go to the next place.

180
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,759
Let’s go, let’s go.

181
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,399
You forgot your bag.

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,759
My coat.

183
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,519
Right, the coat.

184
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,080
You were holding this coat back then too.

185
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,600
Come with me.

186
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,720
Here.

187
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,600
You helped me rehearse here before.

188
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,519
Do you remember?

189
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,559
Rehearse.

190
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,200
Here.

191
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,759
I said at the time,

192
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,559
How about this:

193
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,200
I have a scene with the male lead.

194
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,320
An action scene.

195
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,759
I couldn't find the right emotion to express.

196
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,960
Can you help me?

197
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,919
Practice with me.

198
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,559
Nameless

199
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,679
Do you really not remember me?

200
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,360
All the things she had me do today

201
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,960
feel so familiar.

202
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,679
You’re the driver I called.

203
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,919
Now you have to take me home.

204
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,039
Excuse me.

205
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,000
Who has the number ending in 3390?

206
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,360
You have to stay here.

207
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,799
You have to stand next to me.

208
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,080
Back then, you made a

209
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,399
peace sign.

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,320
Bro, does any of this ring a bell?

211
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,960
Then I’ll start eating.

212
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,039
You have to make it for me every day.

213
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,279
I still like how you were at the beginning,

214
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,679
so wild and untamed.

215
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,399
I remember now.

216
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,720
Still.

217
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
I’m so scared.

218
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:40,960
I...

219
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I was afraid you’d never remember again.

220
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,679
Don’t worry.

221
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,639
I remember everything now.

222
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,679
I won’t forget anything.

223
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,639
I never want to be apart from you again.

224
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,159
I want the whole world to know

225
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,399
that I'm with you.

226
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,440
I promise you.

227
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,879
But right now, I'm a murderer.

228
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,559
I can't drag you into this.

229
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,480
But I don't care at all.

230
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,879
These are all just rumors.

231
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,600
Rumors can kill without shedding blood.

232
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,480
So I have to clarify things publicly.

233
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,240
We're not a couple.

234
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,879
But I really don't care.

235
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,679
I forgot.

236
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:29,879
You're the investor.

237
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,759
For the movie to be released smoothly,

238
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,879
you need to avoid suspicion.

239
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,039
As for whether they believe it or not,

240
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
it depends on your acting skills.

241
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,879
Aren't you helping me practice my acting?
