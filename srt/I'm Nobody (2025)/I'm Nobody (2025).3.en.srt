1
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,159
Yiran

2
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,760
Is anyone there?

3
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,120
Yiran

4
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,200
Mr. Li

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,879
Is that you, Mr. Li?

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
You really hurt my feelings.

7
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,719
I was the one who made you famous.

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,280
And this is how you guard yourself against me?

9
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,239
Mr. Li

10
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
You’re still saying things like this at a time like this?

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,400
Don’t you think it’s ridiculous?

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,560
You still don’t get my sense of humor.

13
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,919
Yiran

14
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,120
The contract is right behind you.

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,280
Sign it.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,879
Let’s go back to how things were, okay?

17
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,439
I’ve already made my position very clear.

18
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,840
I won’t be renewing the contract.

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,120
Don’t be so absolute.

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,759
Everything has a price.

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
If you can’t buy it,

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
it’s just because you haven’t offered enough.

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,240
Don’t you want to hear my offer?

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,159
No need.

25
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,520
I don’t want to hear it.

26
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,319
No.

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,439
You have to.

28
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,639
Song Yiran

29
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,439
Don’t forget how you became famous.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,599
Back then, you made me famous.

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,159
But it’s been so many years.

32
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,919
I’ve also made you a lot of money.

33
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,840
I’ve already repaid your kindness long ago.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,000
I still hope we can leave things on good terms.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Let’s end it here.

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,840
If certain things get out,

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,080
it won’t be good for any of us.

38
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,080
What do you think?

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,439
Looks like I was right.

40
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,360
Do you still have that bank card?

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,560
I destroyed that bank card a long time ago.

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,319
I've said it many times already.

43
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,039
Sign the contract.

44
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,680
Then I'll believe you.

45
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,159
If you don't sign,

46
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,479
every five minutes,

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,840
the temperature here will drop by one degree.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,479
It's minus ten degrees now.

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,719
Let's see how long you can last.

50
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,680
I'll be eating hotpot

51
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,280
while keeping you company.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,680
Yiran.

53
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,400
Don't be afraid.

54
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,120
Stay calm, stay calm.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,080
There must be a way.

56
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,719
Yiran.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,080
Don't fall asleep.

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,560
Yiran.

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,479
Don't fall asleep.

60
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm full.

61
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,599
How are you two enjoying yourselves?

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
It's minus twenty-three degrees now.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Impressive, impressive.

64
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm getting sleepy.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll have Lao Qi keep an eye on you.

66
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm going to get some sleep first.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You two keep holding on.

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,560
It's already more than twenty degrees below zero.

69
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's see how much longer they can last.

70
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,800
No movement.

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,879
They didn't die, did they?

72
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,560
Are you trying to remind me of something?

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,240
I felt a powerful force.

74
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,040
Is that kid trying to break the car door?

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
He really is a handful.

76
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,040
If he can open this,

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
I'll eat noodles while standing on my head.

78
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,879
That force is called "striking the cow through the mountain."

79
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,639
Yiran

80
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,360
Yiran, you're awake.

81
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,720
You really scared me.

82
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,079
Where is this?

83
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,879
The hospital.

84
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,560
Did you forget?

85
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,319
Yesterday, the refrigerated truck.

86
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,879
You were unconscious all night.

87
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,560
The hospital.

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,199
That's not important.

89
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:18,920
Drink some hot water.

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,040
Has all my makeup come off now?

91
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,519
I need to touch up my makeup.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,839
You're barely alive and still worried about your makeup.

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Here, drink some water.

94
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,720
Is it now

95
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,319
that only you have seen me like this?

96
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,839
Big star.

97
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:38,879
It's her.

98
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,040
What are you looking at? Get the script.

99
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
There's an important scene this afternoon.

100
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,360
I need to prepare in advance.

101
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,959
No wonder you're a top star.

102
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,759
Have you had breakfast?

103
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,079
Not yet, not yet.

104
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,079
Teacher Yiran.

105
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,480
Our rest area is over here.

106
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,000
This way, this way.

107
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,639
Sister Yiran.

108
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,160
It's okay.

109
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,120
This is my agent, Lu Bingqing.

110
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,160
Sister.

111
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,879
Teacher Linglong is here.

112
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
That woman is here to stir up trouble again.

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Sister Linglong.

114
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,000
Yiran, sis

115
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,279
Being able to play sisters with you

116
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,800
you have no idea how happy I am.

117
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,240
I've also always

118
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,920
looked forward to working with Linglong, my little sister.

119
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,720
Sis, you really deserve to be number one.

120
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,240
Young, beautiful, and with a great figure.

121
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,399
You truly win everyone's admiration with your talent.

122
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,959
You're the real rising star here.

123
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,680
Look at all that collagen.

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,959
I'm honestly a bit jealous.

125
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,720
Sis, should we go touch up our makeup?

126
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,959
Yes, let's go touch up.

127
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,360
Over there.

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,800
Sis.

129
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,000
You, a TV actress,

130
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,519
who's never acted in a major film before,

131
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,079
and now you're suddenly the female lead.

132
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
You should be able to handle it, right?

133
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,680
You said you were just making a cameo,

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,120
but as soon as you joined, the second female lead was replaced.

135
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,919
Aren't you afraid people will call you a "resource actress"?

136
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,559
As if you aren't a "resource actress" yourself.

137
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,480
But now everyone knows

138
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,039
you've had a falling out with your old agency.

139
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,279
If things go wrong, you might get blacklisted.

140
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,960
That contract you signed

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,399
is basically like selling yourself, isn't it?

142
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,200
You—

143
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,279
Sorry.

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
Your skin is really nice.

145
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,080
I had to take a closer look.

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,039
Yours is even better.

147
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,360
Thank you.

148
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,159
Sit.

149
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,679
Those two seem a bit off today.

150
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,120
Aren't they getting along just fine?

151
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:02,960
Alright, alright.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Ten minutes, just ten minutes for touch-ups.

153
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,840
Director.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,120
Over there.

155
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,879
That's Yiran's newly hired bodyguard.

156
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,720
Maybe have him go hurry them up?

157
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,000
Sounds good to me.

158
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,720
I heard that young President Li, Li Tianhao,

159
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,039
is crazy about her.

160
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,559
He wants to marry her.

161
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,799
Sorry.

162
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,440
Please don't spread baseless rumors.

163
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,799
This is between the two of us; outsiders shouldn't butt in.

164
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
What's your name?

165
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,080
What are you doing?

166
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,840
Where do you live?

167
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
Are you trying to copy my address?

168
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,399
When did you come to this city?

169
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,799
That's none of your business.

170
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,960
Is your last name Ye?

171
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Senior brother, I've been looking for you for three years.

172
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,879
I finally found you.

173
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,399
Wait, is she reciting lines with me or what?

174
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,440
What lines, senior brother?

175
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm your favorite junior sister.

176
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,759
We even have a marriage engagement.

177
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,600
You haven't forgotten, have you?

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,519
I don't know you.

179
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,759
What engagement, senior brother?

180
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
You're the senior brother?

181
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,720
Linglong, little sister.

182
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,960
Your house still doesn't have internet, right?

183
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,919
Wuming is my boyfriend now.

184
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,159
Come, help me with my makeup.

185
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,240
He's that mysterious boyfriend of yours from the internet.

186
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,080
Yeah.

187
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
We're done with makeup, let's start filming.

188
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,080
They're rushing us outside.

189
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,519
Okay.

190
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,519
Hold the script for me first.

191
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,480
Sure.

192
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,919
I need to touch up my makeup too.

193
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,080
How much are they rushing us?

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,279
Director, it's only been five minutes.

195
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,399
Our two actresses here—

196
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,039
It's normal for them to touch up makeup for over forty minutes.

197
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
It's all to make your shots look good.

198
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,480
That's true.

199
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,919
Since we started filming,

200
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,039
they've never come out in less than half an hour.

201
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,039
All departments, get ready and take your positions quickly.

202
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,039
Okay, Director.

203
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,559
Ms. Linglong, Ms. Yiran.

204
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,000
You've both read the script, right?

205
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,960
For this scene,

206
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
how about we just follow the script?

207
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,279
No problem, Director.

208
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,440
I have a question.

209
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,679
I think the way the script is written now—

210
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,559
how will the relationship develop later on?

211
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,679
Well, the script can't be changed now.

212
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,720
If you can't change it,

213
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,759
then I can't act it either.

214
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,279
Isn't it explained later on?

215
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,559
The character won't fall apart.

216
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,919
I think it's fine to stick to the original.

217
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,360
Really?

218
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,200
Then, Director, let's go with the original script.

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Let's go, sis.

220
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,759
Let's go block the scene.

221
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,440
W-What's going on here?

222
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,120
I said we should stick to the script too.

223
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,559
Senior brother.

224
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,480
I'll send you the address.

225
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,799
You can come find me anytime.

226
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,279
I'll tell you everything that happened before you lost your memory.

227
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,240
I'll tell you everything.

228
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,080
You want to find Yue Linglong.

229
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,679
My biggest wish these past three years

230
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,399
has been to find out who I am.

231
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,080
She said she could help me recover my memory.

232
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,919
I understand. Go ahead.

233
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm leaving.

234
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,679
This woman is even stealing people from me now.

235
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,240
No, I have to go check it out.

236
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,240
Senior brother.

237
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,519
Sorry about that.

238
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,399
I didn't mean to embarrass you that day.

239
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,279
I really can't remember you.

240
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,360
Master said you're a martial arts prodigy.

241
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,399
You possess a natural talent.

242
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,679
The reason I called you here

243
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,639
was also to confirm something.

244
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,559
He really is my nameless senior brother.

245
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,559
Didn't you say you'd help me recover my memory?

246
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,559
How are we going to do that?

247
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,840
Go change your clothes and I'll tell you.

248
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,879
What are you doing?

249
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,600
Hurry up and follow me.

250
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,360
Didn't you say you'd help me recover my memories?

251
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,639
Why are you changing clothes here?

252
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,399
Senior Brother,

253
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,799
You used to love listening to my heartbeat.

254
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
You said my heartbeat

255
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
was even more intense than a drum set.

256
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Do you want to listen to it?

257
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:40,639
No, no, no.

258
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,480
No, that's not it.

259
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,559
You, you...

260
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,840
Are you listening to his heartbeat,

261
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,720
or are you trying to seduce him?

262
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,240
I know your career hasn't been going well lately,

263
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,639
but I didn't know you'd started a side job too.

264
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,679
There are plenty of things you don't know.

265
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,000
Senior Brother, let's continue.

266
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,639
Wait, hold on a second.

267
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,000
Why can't you use something else to listen to a heartbeat?

268
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,720
A stethoscope.

269
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,559
Exactly, surround sound.

270
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,279
It goes even better with a drum set.

271
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,240
Hurry up and listen.

272
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,440
After listening, I still have to return it to the infirmary.

273
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,960
I need to give it back.

274
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,639
Come on.

275
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,639
It's okay, Senior Brother.

276
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,200
Since you're jealous,

277
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
let's just take it slow, Senior Brother.

278
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,799
Senior Brother,

279
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,600
your amnesia is only temporary.

280
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,399
I will definitely help you remember everything.

281
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,759
What do you mean?

282
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,559
So I really lost my memory?

283
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,320
It's not that someone else is living in my body?

284
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,320
Of course.

285
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,200
And our engagement is real, too.

286
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,519
We've even done everything together.

287
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,600
What?

288
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,039
You mean...

289
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,799
We did that?

290
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,919
Of course.

291
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,320
Senior brother.

292
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,440
We used to be very much in love.

293
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,759
If it weren't for the trouble at our sect,

294
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,120
we wouldn't have been separated.

295
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,639
Aren't you just an actress?

296
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
And now you're making up something about a sect?

297
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,639
Being an actress is just my cover.

298
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,600
Actually,

299
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm your beloved junior sister.

300
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,879
Senior brother, don't worry.

301
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,759
From now on, you can sleep in my bed,

302
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,360
drive my car, and live in my house.

303
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,840
Everything I have is yours.

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,720
Including me.

305
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,399
No, no, no.

306
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,720
Let me calm down first.

307
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,519
Can I even handle hearing such bold words?

308
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,679
Of course you can't.

309
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,639
Why not?

310
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
Because he's my boyfriend.

311
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:15,759
You...

312
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,919
Yes.

313
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,080
And I'm also her bodyguard.

314
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,039
Yiran, sis

315
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,960
I can pay you the penalty for breaking the contract

316
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,200
I just want to catch up with my favorite senior

317
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,240
That's all, just reminisce a bit

318
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,320
You wouldn't fight me over a man, would you?

319
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,399
Then go ask Wuming

320
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm someone who keeps my word

321
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,480
Let's go

322
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:39,840
Senior

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,639
Senior

324
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,519
Song Yiran

325
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll definitely let you experience my sect's secret technique

326
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,679
Sister

327
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,679
Why do you look so pale?

328
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,879
Your face has gotten so thin and sunken

329
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,879
But, sister

330
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,159
I have some incense here

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Try smelling it

332
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,039
Boss
