1
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,400
Young man,

2
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,120
you're still too inexperienced.

3
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
Do you know why I tricked you into coming here?

4
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,799
You lured me here with a warehouse full of antiques.

5
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,200
You really went all out.

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Junior,

7
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,359
thank you for bringing the key.

8
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:39,879
The key?

9
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,079
The bracer on your arm is the key.

10
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,280
Senior,

11
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,200
this truckload of antiques is worth billions.

12
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,959
All for this key,

13
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,879
you really spared no expense.

14
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,480
That's nothing.

15
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,040
If you come back to Dongchuan with me,

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
all of this will be yours.

17
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,840
If you try to take these things,

18
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,319
you won't get past customs.

19
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,319
Of course I can't just ship them out directly.

20
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,400
I have to use my identity as a descendant of the Baxian Sect.

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,360
Under the guise of cultural exchange,

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,639
I'll loan them to Dongchuan for an exhibition.

23
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,800
By then,

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,039
there will be a world-shocking

25
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,159
heist of ancient treasures.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,879
At that time,

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,879
I'll be the victim.

28
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,719
Senior,

29
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,000
you've been scheming all along

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,759
to use the Baxian Sect descendant as a scapegoat.

31
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,039
So it was all to frame me.

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,120
It doesn't matter.

33
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm here now.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,520
You won't take any of these things with you.

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,360
If I can't take them,

36
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,400
I can destroy them.

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,479
If you want to take them back,

38
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,759
trade me the bracer.

39
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,039
Xuande hexagonal bowl.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,520
Two hundred million. Stop.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,319
You want this.

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,520
I recognized you on the day of the press conference.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,080
I invited you to my house

44
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,039
just to confirm

45
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,960
whether you remembered the secret of the armguard.

46
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,159
Brother,

47
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,599
this is the most important treasure of our sect.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,120
You really gave it to me.

49
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,280
How naive.

50
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,840
With the armguard,

51
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,159
I can inherit the legacy of the Eight Immortals Sect.

52
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,159
And command all martial artists in the world.

53
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,240
My Dongchuan martial arts

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,240
will surely surpass yours.

55
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,840
I told you before,

56
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,560
the armguard can enhance your strength.

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,800
Without it,

58
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,439
you can't protect the antiques.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,280
I can take the antiques back anytime.

60
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,639
Master,

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
I've practiced "striking through the mountain" until I threw up.

62
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,199
I just want to learn the most powerful punch.

63
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,240
I've already taught you.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,240
But I don't understand, Master.

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,199
When the time comes,

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
you'll understand naturally.

67
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:43,879
Master,

68
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,120
this is the punch I figured out while you were still alive.

69
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,240
The ultimate punch—

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,600
Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea!

71
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,199
San'er, call the police!

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,759
Senior Sister

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
You probably don't know this.

74
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,360
My constitution is special.

75
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,240
Since childhood, I've had a dragon vein on my arm.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,560
It can cultivate inner energy automatically.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
Master gave me this armguard.

78
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,560
It's used to seal my power.

79
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:22,959
Impossible.

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,959
Impossible.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,079
I can feel my power increasing.

82
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
That's because your training isn't enough.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,839
To me,

84
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,800
this armguard is a seal.

85
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,920
But for you,

86
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,839
it can enhance your power.

87
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,959
I've trained hard for ten years,

88
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,839
yet I can't even take half a punch from you.

89
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,480
The Eight Immortals all went through worldly hardships

90
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,079
before becoming immortals.

91
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,959
Eight Immortals Fist

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,759
also uses human emotions and desires

93
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,759
to unleash its power.

94
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,279
You have no emotions or desires.

95
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,959
You definitely can't comprehend it.

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
And my armguard,

97
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,040
no one can take it from me.

98
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,759
Senior Sister, listen carefully.

99
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,160
A mere small country

100
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,439
will never be able to understand

101
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,959
the true essence of our traditional martial arts.

102
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,240
This is the road where I was hit three years ago.

103
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,519
But I just can't remember

104
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,240
who saved me back then.

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,600
This road...

106
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
What's with this road?

107
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,480
Wake up.

108
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,519
Don't fall asleep.

109
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,879
Wake up.

110
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,360
Hang in there.

111
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,839
Don't sleep.

112
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,679
Three years ago...

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,399
Three years ago...

114
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,679
The person I saved was you, and the one who saved me was you.

115
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,039
Everyone, take a look.

116
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,320
This is what I told you about.

117
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,039
The place where I used to live.

118
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,240
What do you think?

119
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,440
Isn't it beautiful?

120
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,679
M-Master!

121
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,840
You brat.

122
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
You're not seeing things.

123
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,360
It really is me, your master.

124
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,320
Master!

125
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,720
I can't believe you're still alive, Master!

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,039
Well, here I am, back again.

127
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,200
Alright, alright.

128
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Where have you been these past three years, Master?

129
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,960
Bayinbuluke.

130
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,759
Come here.

131
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,919
Let me tell you something.

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,759
Actually,

133
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,840
I've wanted to leave the sect for a long time.

134
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,759
To travel around.

135
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,759
But your grandmaster set the rules.

136
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,600
He said the sect leader can't leave the mountain at will.

137
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,759
That made me really frustrated.

138
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,919
But it just so happened

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,559
that your senior sister Su Mingzhu got ambitious.

140
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,279
So I faked my death.

141
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,399
And went on a spontaneous journey.

142
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,879
You faked your death?

143
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,039
Do you know, these past three years,

144
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,600
how much I've missed you?

145
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,639
You brat.

146
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,320
Weren't you suffering from amnesia these three years?

147
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,279
You've only remembered me for a few days.

148
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,039
Wuming,

149
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,000
these three years have been a trial for you.

150
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,080
Starting today,

151
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,519
you are officially the leader of our Baxian Sect.

152
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,039
But I must remind you,

153
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,759
the true enemy of our Baxian Sect

154
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,600
has already returned.
