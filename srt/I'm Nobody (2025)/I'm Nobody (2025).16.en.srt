1
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,519
Has the Eight Immortals Sect really disappeared?

2
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,159
Where is everyone?

3
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,319
Director.

4
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,599
Let's film the one-against-three scene first.

5
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:09,719
It's possible.

6
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,799
But we can't find a suitable stunt double right now.

7
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,359
I'll do it.

8
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,439
Be very careful.

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,519
They're all very skilled.

10
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,719
They're here for me.

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,159
Don't worry.

12
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,000
Your boyfriend is impressive too.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,640
Get ready for the livestream.

14
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,200
Okay.

15
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,920
Boss Ye is taking the stage himself.

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,599
You three, make the most of this opportunity.

17
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,599
Director, you're right.

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,560
We can't delay the filming schedule.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,239
All three of you, go together.

20
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,319
An exciting match.

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,239
I want to start a live broadcast.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,480
The three of us lost to your master alone back then.

23
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,040
Now I want the whole world to know

24
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,920
that I will defeat the Eight Immortals Fist.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Go ahead.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,239
I thought I was just here to make a movie.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,359
Turns out, they came for me.

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,760
Without some grudges,

29
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,680
how can you make a good movie?

30
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,640
Take this!

31
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,639
Looks like they want to defeat the Eight Immortals Fist in public.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,719
Even if Ye Wuming hasn't regained his memory,

33
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,319
he's not someone just anyone can mess with.

34
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,439
These so-called experts are all show and no substance.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
Don't worry.

36
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,719
This is just a warm-up.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,759
I've already prepared something strong for them.

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,039
It can boost their fighting power tenfold.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,319
These people

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,479
won't play by the rules.

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,919
Something's not right.

42
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,919
They're acting like they've been injected with adrenaline.

43
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,520
Did they take something?

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,439
Are they cheating?

45
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,360
We're still filming.

46
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,680
Where are you going?

47
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,639
Ye Wuming, your time has come.

48
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Embrace the origin and maintain unity.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
Completely lose oneself.

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,120
Guard all directions.

51
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,839
Not a drop can leak through.

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,680
Let your heart move with your will, completely losing yourself.

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,839
This is the highest level of the Eight Immortals Fist.

54
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,480
Master.

55
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,439
You made Mr. Ye cry.

56
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,519
Mr. Ye is adding drama for himself.

57
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,439
What a bastard.

58
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,800
Why don’t you mention it’s three against one?

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,319
That’s how the script is written.

60
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,199
Listen to the director.

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Stir up the emotions.

62
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,879
Let Ye Wuming stand up again.

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,279
He’s definitely going to die.

64
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,040
Isn’t everyone misunderstanding this?

65
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,160
Of course, I also hope

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
Mr. Ye can stand up, right?

67
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,560
How about this,

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
everyone here on set,

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,959
let’s all shout for Mr. Ye to get up.

70
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,360
Ye Wuming, stand up!

71
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,360
Ye Wuming, stand up!

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,240
Stand up! Stand up!

73
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,199
Stand up!

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,839
Stand up!

75
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,040
He’s already injured, he can’t fight anymore.

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,839
Stand up! Stand up!

77
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,879
Ye Wuming, stand up!

78
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,800
Ye Wuming, stand up!

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,920
Ye Wuming, stand up!

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,680
Wuming.

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,360
Mr. Feng, Ye Wuming is awake.

82
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
Are you okay?

83
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm fine, thank you.

84
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Please step aside for now.

85
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm afraid I might hurt you.

86
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,240
Teacher Song.

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,399
Um, we're about to start filming.

88
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,959
Please take a rest for now, okay?

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,680
This way.

90
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,519
We're about to start filming.

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,319
Everyone, everyone.

92
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,160
Over here, over here.

93
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:21,800
Let's go.

94
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,639
Completely absorbed.

95
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,240
Guarding all directions.

96
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,040
Not a single drop leaks.

97
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,560
A state of selflessness.

98
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,800
His memory has returned.

99
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,759
No, I have to go check.

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,240
Stop.

101
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
Announce it to the public immediately.

102
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,800
Ye Wuming killed Park Namjik.

103
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,120
Amazing, just amazing!

104
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,120
I've never seen such an exciting fight scene.

105
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
Someone's been killed!

106
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,240
Ye Wuming killed someone!

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,879
Nurse! Nurse! Stretcher!

108
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,879
He's fine, just fainted.

109
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,120
Go, go, go! This way, hurry!

110
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,600
Senior sister.

111
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:43,839
Junior sister.

112
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
Senior brother, you remember us now.

113
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,160
That's great!

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,600
We can fulfill our engagement now.

115
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
We lost this move.

116
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,160
Not only did we fail to destroy Ye Wuming,

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,920
we even helped him regain his memory.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
If this game isn't played to the last move,

119
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,319
don't speak of victory or defeat too soon.

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,759
I just got the news.

121
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,759
Park Namjik

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,959
is dead.

123
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,519
Dead?

124
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,000
How did he die?

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,519
It doesn't matter how he died.

126
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,800
As long as we spread the news,

127
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,000
and insist on it,

128
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,720
that Ye Wuming beat him to death,

129
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,319
even if he tries to explain,

130
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,319
he won't be able to clear his name.

131
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
Spreading rumors is easy.

132
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,240
Refuting them is exhausting.

133
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,279
Mr. Feng, you're brilliant.

134
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,519
As long as he's accused of murder,

135
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,839
his character will be questioned.

136
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,759
He won't be qualified

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,279
to take over our twenty billion.

138
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,360
Wuming.

139
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,440
Who are you?

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,759
I don't know you.

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,759
Are you joking with me?

142
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,600
It's me, Yiran.

143
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,759
Yiran.

144
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,919
Senior brother, you're awake.

145
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,480
Do you still remember who I am?

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,759
Junior sister.

147
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
Senior sister.

148
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,440
Slow down.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,279
Where is this?

150
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,600
I only remember...

151
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,840
Master told me to go down the mountain for training.

152
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,440
This is a sanatorium.

153
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
The training you mentioned...

154
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
That was three years ago.

155
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,960
Three years ago?

156
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,600
Senior sister, stop joking.

157
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,519
Impossible.

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,799
Why don't I remember any of it?

159
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,159
You've lost your memory for three years.

160
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,679
You forgot everything from before.

161
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,159
We tried everything to help you regain your memory.

162
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,720
Now we've finally succeeded.

163
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,360
So...

164
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,320
So I lost my memory twice?

165
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,720
I recovered my memories from three years ago.

166
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,440
But I lost the memories from these three years.

167
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,440
It's okay.

168
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,440
Just think of it as having had a dream.

169
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,559
When you wake up, you'll still be yourself.

170
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,919
It's all right, senior brother.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,159
Those three years don't matter.

172
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,240
Yiran.

173
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:34,919
Senior sister.

174
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,519
Who is Yiran?

175
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,080
Why does this name feel both unfamiliar and familiar?

176
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,879
Yiran is an actress.

177
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,240
You probably used to hear her name a lot.

178
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,960
That's why it sounds familiar.

179
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,559
Senior brother.

180
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,039
It wasn't easy for you to regain your memory.

181
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,320
You'd better not forget me again.

182
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,519
We still have an engagement, you know.

183
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,840
Junior sister.

184
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,480
That was just Master's joke.

185
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,039
Besides, I don't want to talk about this right now.

186
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,200
Junior sister.

187
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,799
Wuming just regained his memory.

188
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,879
Let him have some peace.

189
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,840
Junior brother, get some rest.

190
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,960
We'll be here with you these days.

191
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,879
Why can't I remember her?

192
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,759
It feels like I've forgotten someone very important.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,639
Wuming.

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,120
Who are you?

195
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,519
I don't know you.

196
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,639
I'm going in now.

197
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,200
Wuming couldn't possibly forget me.

198
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,279
Before junior brother regains his memory,

199
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,720
I hope you won't disturb him.

200
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,240
If you go in, you'll only upset him.

201
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,440
It will make him suffer even more.

202
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,080
I won't let you go in.

203
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,480
Then I'll come back tomorrow.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
I'm afraid tomorrow won't work either.

205
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,279
Then the day after tomorrow.

206
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,799
Or the day after that.

207
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,759
I'll come here every day.

208
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,879
Until he's able to see me.

209
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,519
You should go back for now.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,159
If he remembers,

211
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,600
I'll let you know.

212
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,679
Senior Sister,

213
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
Why?

214
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,519
Don't worry.

215
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,840
She'll give up when she realizes it's too difficult.

216
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,360
Yiran,

217
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,360
What exactly is my relationship with her?

218
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,559
Why didn't I stop him?

219
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,480
Why did I let him take the risk?

220
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,879
Why did I never think about protecting him?

221
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,559
He's always been the one protecting me.

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Let's make this clear first.

223
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,519
I can be your bodyguard.

224
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,519
But when it comes to safety matters,

225
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,639
you have to listen to me.

226
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
They're your weakness.

227
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,519
If there's real danger,

228
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,559
I can only protect you, not them.

229
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,799
It's better to send them somewhere safe first.

230
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,200
I'm just concerned about you.

231
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,159
Being a bodyguard,

232
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:33,919
I'm a professional.

233
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,200
Hello?

234
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,559
Sorry.

235
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,879
Right now, I'm her exclusive driver.

236
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,440
You only know that I fought you for twenty billion.

237
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
But you don't know

238
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,919
that the twenty billion was always for her.

239
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,279
Yiran, you're free now.
