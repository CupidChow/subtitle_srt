1
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,640
What if there's danger again?

2
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,200
I can't let him leave.

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,560
I'm leaving.

4
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,920
Don't go.

5
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,159
Close the door first.

6
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,359
I have something to tell you.

7
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Can you not leave tonight?

8
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,920
Isn't it enough that I bought your time?

9
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,519
That's all.

10
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,159
That's it.

11
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,159
Bye.

12
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,239
Look at me.

13
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,359
I'm Song Yiran, you know.

14
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,760
A female celebrity.

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,680
So what?

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,879
So...

17
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,560
I mean,

18
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,519
The chance to spend a night with a celebrity

19
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,040
doesn't come often.

20
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,400
Are you sure you want to refuse?

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,879
I

22
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,560
Being a designated driver to me

23
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,000
actually isn't that important.

24
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,080
I actually have a lot of businesses.

25
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm involved in all kinds of fields.

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
Mainly because I'm

27
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,360
someone who's especially good at making plans.

28
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,280
So I say,

29
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,960
my time is a little bit valuable.

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,960
Dad,

31
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,159
Has Song Yiran renewed her contract?

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,840
It's fine.

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,240
I've been pursuing her for so long anyway.

34
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,759
I don't believe she can get away.

35
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,080
Hello?

36
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,439
The drone is flying over.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,439
I'm a bit of a clean freak when it comes to my eyes.

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,680
So in my house,

39
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,639
you have to wear this.

40
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,599
The pink one.

41
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,800
Even if you held a knife to me,

42
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,520
I still wouldn't wear this.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,039
It actually suits you.

44
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,439
A drone.

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,039
It must have been Mr. Li.

46
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,080
He actually hired someone to secretly film me.

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,199
Looks like someone has been secretly filming you for a long time.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,759
There.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,360
There.

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,080
There.

51
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,039
I thought it was our neighborhood property management.

52
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,080
They're so dedicated.

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
Turns out they've been secretly filming me all along.

54
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,560
You've been followed by paparazzi this whole time.

55
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,800
Do you want to secretly film the paparazzi for once?

56
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,800
So many paparazzi and bugs.

57
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,879
Your place could practically host a live broadcast.

58
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,520
No wonder Mr. Li is so fearless.

59
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,800
A woman of mine, Li Tianhao,

60
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,000
no one can take her away.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
No one can take her away.

62
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,919
I want to offer you a job.

63
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,759
I already have a job.

64
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,759
With your abilities,

65
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,120
you shouldn't just be a driver-for-hire.

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
The job I'm offering you

67
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,439
is to be my bodyguard.

68
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,159
Not interested.

69
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,960
Fifty thousand a month.

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,439
So what if you have money?

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,439
I make plenty in a month too, okay?

72
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm begging you.

73
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
Please help me, okay?

74
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,240
Help me.

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,199
Why does she seem so familiar to me?

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,120
After watching her videos,

77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,399
this feeling only gets stronger.

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,720
Even my arm guard seems to recognize her.

79
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,800
Could my amnesia be related to her?

80
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,079
Alright.

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
I agree.

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
When do I start?

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,800
No need.

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
You'll just live at my place.

85
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,680
It's a personal bodyguard position.

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,040
Personal.

87
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,000
Do you understand?

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,399
I'm just someone

89
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,000
who's not used to sleeping with others.

90
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,519
It's living together,

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,639
not sleeping together.

92
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,439
Dad

93
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,199
You really can sit still.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
That jerk is already living with Song Yiran.

95
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,199
I already heard.

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,279
Son

97
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
Stay calm.

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Do a background check.

99
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,680
Find Ye Wuming's weakness.

100
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,360
Yiran isn't yours yet.

101
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,399
Set up a trap and play along with them.

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm up.

103
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,439
That really hurt.

104
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,879
Sorry.

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
I didn't mean to.

106
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,480
I'll be honest with you.

107
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,439
I can't control my right hand.

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,839
Every morning before I even wake up,

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,120
it just gets active on its own.

110
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,279
It's President Li again.

111
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,199
Want to do something a little wild?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,480
Dad

113
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,199
Yiran

114
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
What does this mean?

115
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,120
I'd like to ask President Li,

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
what do you mean by this?

117
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,360
Are you trying to force me to renew the contract?

118
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
If I don't agree, you play dirty?

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,879
I'm being wronged.

120
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,879
I'm really being wronged.

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Am I that kind of person?

122
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,439
We didn't do this.

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,879
Did you offend someone else?

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,079
Like a sponsor or a big boss?

125
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,319
I don't have a sponsor.

126
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,600
Nor a big boss.

127
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,600
I only have one.

128
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,759
A little bodyguard.

129
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,720
Now you're a celebrity.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,040
You need to learn to keep yourself clean.

131
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,839
What will Tianhao think if you act like this?

132
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not worthy of someone like President Li.

133
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,720
Besides, I already have a boyfriend.

134
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,079
A boyfriend?

135
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,319
Who is it?

136
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,480
It's him.

137
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,759
Yeah, I'm her boyfriend.

138
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,920
You're her boyfriend?

139
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,360
You're lying.

140
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,759
You're just a lousy designated driver.

141
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,600
I heard everything clearly at home yesterday.

142
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,759
I... I heard people talking about it.

143
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,199
I'll make it official soon.

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
Just wait for it to trend on Weibo.

145
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,759
Song Yiran.

146
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,680
Screw you!

147
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,680
San'er.

148
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,199
Bro.

149
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,839
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,839
Bro, I'm sorry.

151
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
Let go of his hand.

152
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,759
I said, let go of his hand.

153
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,240
You want to save your buddy, huh?

154
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,440
Let me punch you once.

155
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,960
Don't fight back.

156
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,879
Li Tianhao, you—

157
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,080
Women shouldn't meddle in men's business.

158
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,879
Stay out of this.

159
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,360
Come on.

160
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,799
Aren't you tough?

161
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,200
Put your hand out.

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,360
Put your hand out.

163
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,919
Hold your hand steady.

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,159
If you want to tie me up in the future,

165
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,360
remember to tie both my hands and feet.

166
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,559
But it won't do you any good anyway.

167
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,080
From now on,

168
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,519
don't mess with Song Yiran again.

169
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,919
And don't mess with me or my brothers either.

170
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,240
Otherwise, this funeral wreath

171
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,360
I'll make sure each of you gets one.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,399
Let's go.

173
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,799
Hurry, hurry, you're stepping on my foot.

174
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
We ran into a tough one.

175
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,679
When have I ever been humiliated like this?

176
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,480
What should we do, Dad?

177
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,720
Ask Old Seven.

178
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,440
Seventh Brother loves asking what to do the most.

179
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,559
Brother Wuming.

180
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,399
Brother Kai.

181
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,559
Look at him, all dressed up like a big shot.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,759
You lost money on that job yesterday, right?

183
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,000
Lost big time, even lost my job.

184
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,320
I heard

185
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,559
that three-kilometer order was placed by Song Yiran.

186
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,799
It's absolutely true.

187
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,399
I lost my job because of her.

188
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,039
And she insisted I be her boyfriend.

189
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,759
I don't know why.

190
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
He says Song Yiran wants to be his girlfriend.

191
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,080
Did you hear that? I'm serious.

192
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,159
Believe it or not.

193
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,600
Bro,

194
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
how about this,

195
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,240
do you have a mirror at home?

196
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,559
If not,

197
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,080
just look at yourself in a puddle.

198
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,120
In a puddle?

199
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,120
Yeah, listen to Brother Kai.

200
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,919
That's right.

201
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,080
Wuming, have you finished all the paperwork?

202
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,080
Let's go home.

203
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,399
You know, she really does look like Song Yiran.

204
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,120
Bro, this has already trended online.

205
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,519
Let's take a photo together.

206
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,399
Wait for me, wait up.

207
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,000
Wait for me.

208
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,559
Song Yiran officially announced she's in a relationship.

209
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,559
The driver is suspected to be a decoy boyfriend.

210
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,519
I told you, it's way too fake.

211
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,120
How could anyone believe that?

212
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,039
Anyway, starting tomorrow,

213
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,159
we have to pretend to be a couple.

214
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,919
I'll give you another copy later

215
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,960
of the fake couple contract.

216
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,200
No.

217
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,039
I have no obligation to pretend to be your boyfriend.

218
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Besides,

219
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm a person with principles.

220
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,360
Ye Wuming.

221
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,879
Get this straight.

222
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,039
I'm letting you act as my boyfriend.

223
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,759
I'm actually doing you a favor.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,879
What kind of favor could you possibly do for me?

225
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,120
Bro.

226
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,879
Bro, let me tell you,

227
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,840
you're really popular right now.

228
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,000
Even Lao Kai and his group,

229
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,279
they're all jealous and envious.

230
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,120
It's not just them.

231
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
Now every guy wants

232
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,360
to be Song Yiran's boyfriend—it's such a big deal.

233
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,320
No way.

234
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,720
I absolutely can't let her find out.

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,200
A contract of servitude?

236
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,200
Yeah.

237
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,600
Sign it,

238
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,440
and you'll be selling yourself to me.

239
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,279
Are you going to sign?

240
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,320
What would you do without me?

241
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,120
Lao Qi,

242
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,679
Do you know what mistake you made?

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,440
Boss, I...

244
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,200
I didn't handle things well.

245
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,720
I...

246
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,039
I'll definitely get it right next time.

247
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,679
At this time tomorrow,

248
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,639
I want to see Song Yiran here.

249
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,120
Can you do that?

250
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:38,919
Yes.

251
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,679
And one more thing.

252
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,600
If you can't find the bank card,

253
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,759
then make her disappear.

254
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,279
Can you do that?

255
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,279
Yes.

256
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,399
This place is so remote.

257
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,600
How are we supposed to film here?

258
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,279
I don't know.

259
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,320
They told me to change to this place at the last minute.

260
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,559
There's no one here.
