1
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,519
Healthy living, beautiful morning.

2
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,920
Celebrities really are disciplined.

3
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
This is yours.

4
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,560
I'll eat this.

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,719
No.

6
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,760
Isn't that a bit fake?

7
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,680
Persona.

8
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,719
It's all just personas.

9
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,599
No, no.

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,400
Did you forget?

11
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,640
You said tomorrow you have a scene

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
where the lead actress is hungry for three days.

13
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,560
You need to experience hunger.

14
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:29,840
Oh, right.

15
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,920
That scene is really important to me.

16
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,079
The role comes first, I'll stay hungry for now.

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,640
Good evening.

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,599
Good evening.

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,599
Are you okay?

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,879
I haven't eaten all day.

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,040
I have to do well in this scene.

22
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,400
You can do it, boss.

23
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,560
Once we get through tonight,

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,719
we can have a big meal.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,359
Sit down first, let's have a feast.

26
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,239
I'll get you a glass of water.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,760
Sis,

28
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,760
why do you look so pale?

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,799
Your face looks so sunken.

30
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,680
You're not looking much better yourself.

31
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,719
Don't talk about me.

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,439
I haven't eaten all day either.

33
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,959
But sis,

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,319
I have some incense here.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,039
Smell it, quick.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,439
It'll help you feel refreshed.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
Don't collapse during the shoot later.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,280
How is it?

39
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,400
You two teachers,

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
get ready for the next scene.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,719
Get ready to run through the scene.

43
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,639
Boss.

44
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,599
Yiran.

45
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,439
Yiran.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,520
Yiran.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,319
What happened?

48
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,919
Where's the medical staff? Hurry, get the medical staff!

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
It's due to prolonged starvation.

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,560
This has caused bodily dysfunction.

51
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,719
There's also hypoglycemia.

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
Administer glucose intravenously.

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,080
She should wake up soon.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,360
She inhaled the calming incense I specially prepared.

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,199
I guarantee you'll sleep until tomorrow and still not wake up.

56
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,759
What's going on?

57
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,319
We're behind schedule again.

58
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,319
We can only use this set today.

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
It's been booked by others after today.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,439
This is the most important scene.

61
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,919
The two sisters are struggling to survive together.

62
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,439
We can't do it without either of them.

63
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
Director, I have an idea.

64
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,639
How about we change the script a bit?

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,919
Let's make it so the older sister is unconscious.

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,319
The younger sister tries desperately to save her.

67
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,000
That classic line from Yiran,

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
let me say it instead.

69
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,960
There's no other way.

70
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,000
We can only try this.

71
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,919
She worked so hard for this scene.

72
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,039
If we change it now,

73
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,000
she'll definitely be heartbroken.

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,199
Director.

75
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,039
Give me ten minutes, I can wake her up.

76
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,800
I've tried for so long and she still hasn't woken up.

77
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,599
Ten minutes? How is that possible?

78
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,599
Send her to the hospital right away.

79
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,560
If you mess around,

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong.

81
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,599
I'll give you five minutes.

82
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,759
All departments, get ready.

83
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,000
We'll shoot with the new plan.

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,599
Yiran has overexerted herself too much.

85
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,240
Even giving her medicine doesn't help.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,360
Senior, acupuncture isn't working.

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,960
Quiet.

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
Don't waste any more time.

89
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,199
Hurry and get them to the hospital.

90
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,680
Give all the lines to Linglong.

91
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,079
Awake, awake, awake!

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,120
Really awake.

93
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,879
This is amazing.

94
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,319
That's impossible.

95
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,879
They smelled my incense.

96
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,319
And woke up so quickly.

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,360
Still, really awake.

98
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,000
Awake.

99
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,000
This is incredible.

100
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:46,879
Director.

101
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,519
Director.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,839
Sorry.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,199
I just need to touch up my makeup and I can shoot.

104
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,439
No need, no need, no need.

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
You look perfect right now.

106
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,639
It fits the survival scene perfectly.

107
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,480
Let's shoot it like this.

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Let's shoot it like this, director.

109
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,639
That shot...

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,759
Get ready, get ready, get ready.

111
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,519
Ready for the actual shoot.

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,560
Move aside.

113
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,360
Here we go.

114
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,959
You can do it!

115
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,279
Okay.

116
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,120
Come on.

117
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,759
One take.

118
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,519
Three, two, one.

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,279
Action.

120
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,120
Sister.

121
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,160
Younger sister.

122
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,600
What doesn't kill us

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
makes us stronger.

124
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,199
So no matter what,

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,879
we must never give up hope.

126
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,959
Sister.

127
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,399
Stop.

128
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,120
Done.

129
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,680
Alright, alright.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Thank you, director. Thank you. Alright.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,480
Thank you for your hard work.

132
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,560
Good job, good job. Let's take a break.

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,360
Let's rest first.

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Okay, let's go eat something first.

135
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:37,920
Okay.

136
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
That was great.

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,519
Let's go, let's eat.

138
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:41,879
Let's go.

139
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,920
Yeah.

140
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,240
Thank you, teacher.

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,240
Thank you.

142
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,839
Take a break.

143
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,439
Director, how was my performance?

144
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,360
What are all these?

145
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,519
Health food.

146
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,319
You often post about them on Weibo.

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,480
They're all yours.

148
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,519
All those personas on Weibo are just for show.

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,639
Do you even know what a persona is?

150
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,240
It's all fake. You actually believe that?

151
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,279
I don't get it.

152
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,759
I'm doing this for your own good.

153
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,120
You've just recovered from a serious illness. Eat some of this.

154
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,040
Just make do with it.

155
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,279
I'm not settling for that.

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
Look at all this green food.

157
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,519
Do you think you're feeding a rabbit?

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,560
I want Kung Pao Chicken.

159
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,839
Braised pork.

160
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,839
Crayfish.

161
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,399
I suggest you think this through.

162
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,079
Someone on your right is taking your picture.

163
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,120
How do you know?

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,079
I love eating these green foods the most.

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,720
Tasty means healthy.

166
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,639
Let's quietly switch seats now.

167
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,199
Why switch seats?

168
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,480
My left side looks better on camera.

169
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,120
Aren't your left and right sides the same?

170
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,079
What do you know?

171
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,120
Different angles, lighting,

172
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,319
and even my hair.

173
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,519
The way my face looks in photos

174
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,560
is totally different.

175
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,879
Come stand next to me.

176
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,759
You need a bodyguard even when you eat?

177
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,959
Get closer.

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,279
A little closer.

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,040
Tilt your head like this.

180
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,079
Okay.

181
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,040
Let's give them a shot of us hugging and kissing.

182
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,079
Make our relationship look more real.

183
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,680
You celebrities are so fake.

184
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,639
Sorry, sorry.

185
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,000
Sit back down.

186
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Did you do that on purpose?

187
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,319
I didn't do it on purpose. Someone just...

188
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,360
You don't believe me.

189
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,600
Then let's do it again.

190
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,319
Go back.

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,000
Sit down.

192
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,240
Open your mouth.

193
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,720
Let me see.

194
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,160
That's it?

195
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,639
And you still speak up for her every day.

196
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,720
Is this really my artist?

197
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,360
Who does things like this?

198
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,519
Mr. Li, please don't be angry.

199
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,480
There must be some misunderstanding here.

200
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
I'll go talk to her again.

201
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,519
Don't worry.

202
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,279
Look.

203
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,200
They're even trying to trick me with camera angles.

204
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,960
These two have been playing me all along.

205
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,759
Still trying to pull this on me.

206
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,080
Bingqing.

207
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,799
I know you're doing this for my own good.

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,679
But dating is my personal business.

209
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,279
Besides, it hasn't affected my work.

210
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,240
Alright, alright.

211
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,639
Let's not talk about this for now.

212
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,879
We're here.

213
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
Finally, I can eat.

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,399
I think people should be genuine inside and out.

215
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,320
You can't act one way online and another in real life.

216
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,159
Those are all just official statements.

217
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,639
Besides, I'm an actor.

218
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
Just think of it as me creating a character.

219
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,159
Then why not create

220
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,240
a sincere character?

221
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,559
Life wouldn't be so exhausting.

222
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,039
Then I'll eat later.

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,159
Tell me first,

224
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
how did you notice today

225
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,519
that person was secretly taking photos?

226
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,399
I heard the sound of his camera shutter.

227
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,840
You could hear it from that far away?

228
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,879
Then when I usually

229
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,600
am alone in my bedroom...

230
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,960
Last night when you were sleeping...

231
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,679
Ye Wuming, you—

232
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm done talking to you.

233
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm going to sleep.

234
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,919
Ye Wuming.

235
00:09:59,519 --> 00:09:59,879
Boss

236
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
We still have the prop bear from your last movie.

237
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,360
Go

238
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,639
Lao Qi

239
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,440
Big Brother, I'm here, I'm here.

240
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,360
Go, go, go

241
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,639
Go, go, go

242
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,960
Let me tell you

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
I'll give you one more chance

244
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,120
I think this Song Yiran is

245
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,759
not giving up until the bitter end

246
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,279
Take some people to the set and scare her

247
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,200
Got it, Big Brother

248
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,600
I'll take care of it right away

249
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,200
Let's go

250
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,200
Today

251
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,960
Let's really scare Song Yiran

252
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,240
Mr. Li will make sure everyone is rewarded

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,120
Don't worry, bro

254
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,080
We'll definitely make her regret it

255
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,559
Ms. Song

256
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,120
Director

257
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,039
Today's scene

258
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,440
is about the female lead returning from surviving on a deserted island

259
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,919
coming to attend this party

260
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,480
While you're dancing

261
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,320
some thugs

262
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,159
will try to approach you and harm you

263
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,879
Grab your props

264
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,039
Find something handy

265
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,320
But don't worry

266
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,960
These thugs are all our stuntmen

267
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,000
You'll be very safe

268
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:56,759
Okay? Okay

269
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,759
Come on, Ms. Song, please come inside

270
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,399
Alright

271
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,120
Okay, three, two, one

272
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,759
Action

273
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,120
Extras, come in

274
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:25,759
Let's go

275
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,519
Why are you here?

276
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,000
Your posture is wrong—hold the waist.

277
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,200
Someone wants to hurt you.

278
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,039
They dare to be so blatant?

279
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,080
Don't worry, I'm here.

280
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,360
I've already called the police.

281
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,000
Continue.

282
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,840
Keep going.

283
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,360
Why can't I see the wire?

284
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,639
Okay, stop.

285
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,240
Assistant director.

286
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,279
Where are the actors? Why are they all out of frame?

287
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,840
The lead is in the frame, director.

288
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm talking about the stunt team.

289
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,559
Um...

290
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,759
They flew out.

291
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,320
Bro, how are you doing these days?

292
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,240
San'er.

293
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,840
It's a long story.

294
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,320
No way, bro.

295
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,720
You all slept together?

296
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,440
You, you, you...

297
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,279
What are you doing?

298
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,480
Can you respect my privacy, please?

299
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,919
You're my bodyguard.

300
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,600
Only I get privacy.

301
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,600
You don't.

302
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,840
Why are you still up so late? What are you doing?

303
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,320
Let me tell you...

304
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Every time I close my eyes,

305
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,159
I feel like someone wants to hurt me.

306
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,519
I need you to stay by my side and protect me.

307
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,480
You're still not out of character?

308
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,559
I'm going to take a shower.

309
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,879
Go stand guard at the door for me.

310
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,159
Don't come in.

311
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,080
Just stand here and protect me.

312
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,639
Don't stand too close.

313
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,039
But don't stand too far away either.

314
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,559
Don't go past that.

315
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Otherwise, it might bite you.

316
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,120
It fell over.

317
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,759
Should I pick it up if it falls?

318
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,480
I didn't see anything, I didn't see.

319
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,519
Didn't see.

320
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,600
Why do you still have cigarettes?

321
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm taking a shower.

322
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,320
The body wash that female celebrities use smells pretty nice.

323
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,279
What brand is it?

324
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,519
I can only hear the sound.

325
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,360
It's so frustrating not being able to see anything.

326
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,639
It fell over again.

327
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,399
I’ll prop it up again.

328
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,960
Those guys all got arrested by the police.

329
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
How many times have I told you not to break the law?

330
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,519
Don’t do things like this on your own again.

331
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,279
Mr. Li,

332
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,840
When Ye Wuming gets into a fight,

333
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,759
he’s like a wild beast.

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He’s not even the same kind as us.

335
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
We really can’t hurt him.

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,159
You’re so resourceful.

337
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,080
You’ll definitely come up with a better solution.

338
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,320
You...

339
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,320
I’ve already set up a big plan.

340
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,639
First,

341
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,240
at tomorrow’s “Eye-Opener” event,

342
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,840
during the press conference,

343
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,720
we’ll announce that the female lead

344
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,639
will be changed from Song Yiran to Yue Linglong.

345
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,639
This year,

346
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,840
the company is mainly promoting her.

347
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,919
Sorry, sis.

348
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,360
This time,

349
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,519
I’m taking your lead role.

350
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,840
Then we’ll buy a trending topic.

351
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,759
Let her get caught up in the casting controversy.

352
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,320
Her reputation will collapse.

353
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,120
The last move is the trump card.

354
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,559
Persuade her leeching parents.

355
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,279
Uncle.

356
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,080
Las Vegas.

357
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,480
You owe quite a lot in gambling debts, don't you?

358
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
I heard the interest alone is skyrocketing.

359
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,320
It's almost ten million, right?

360
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,519
It's ten million.

361
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,480
She was just replaced.

362
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,639
It's all over the internet.

363
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,639
Her career is over.

364
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,080
She has no income.

365
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,360
How are you going to pay off your gambling debts now?

366
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,399
You'd better think this through.

367
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,000
No one can betray me.

368
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,759
I want Song Yiran's career and family

369
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,360
to be ruined at the same time.
