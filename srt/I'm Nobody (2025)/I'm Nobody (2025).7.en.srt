1
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,079
Why is she here?

2
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,519
Why is it you?

3
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,120
Yiran sent a message

4
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,439
asking me to come discuss the contract termination.

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,560
Here's the contract.

6
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,439
She's taking a shower.

7
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,159
Go on in.

8
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,359
Why is she here?

9
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,519
Linglong is here too.

10
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,480
Yue Linglong is really in the way here.

11
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,040
Lu Bingqing really came at the wrong time.

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Looks like I'll have to use the sedative.

13
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,719
I need to find a way to get senior brother out of here.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,239
Then deal with her.

15
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,799
Good thing I prepared in advance.

16
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,760
Ye Wuming, what's going on?

17
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,079
Maybe the power tripped.

18
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll go check.

19
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,560
It's so dark, let's light a candle.

20
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,680
This is a special incense I prepared.

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,280
Have some water.

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,240
Do you want to smell it?

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,120
My sedative incense is starting to work.

24
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,319
It's so hot.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for coming uninvited.

26
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,639
I'm kicking you out right now.

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:46,879
Oh no.

28
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,520
Why did he come back so soon?

29
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,680
You're not allowed to hug him. What are you doing?

30
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,560
What are you doing?

31
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,159
Let go.

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
Let go. No hugging.

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,000
Be my witness.

34
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,800
I didn't do anything.

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,439
Let go.

36
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,039
Wuming.

37
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,840
What was that sound?

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,840
You two, get out quickly.

39
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,199
You.

40
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,759
Hurry.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,919
I'm talking to you.

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,240
Wuming.

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,240
Wuming.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,840
Don't come in, no matter what.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,080
What if he's prepared a surprise for me?

46
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,479
If I open the door now, won't it ruin the mood?

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,759
It smells so good.

48
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,000
It's actually quite romantic.

49
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,280
It really smells nice.

50
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,280
Senior brother, are you hot?

51
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,560
She inhaled the love-inducing smoke.

52
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,199
How did you do that?

53
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,040
Senior brother.

54
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,439
You're mine now.

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,959
Senior brother.

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,399
Senior brother.

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,279
Senior brother.

58
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,639
Candle.

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
The candle is poisonous.

60
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,439
Wuming.

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,079
Senior brother.

62
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,279
There are three beautiful women in this room.

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,079
Can you handle it?

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,199
Senior brother, I'm all wet.

65
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,759
Help me wipe it off.

66
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,959
Senior brother, do you want me to do it myself?

67
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,560
Senior brother, you're sweating so much.

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,839
Water

69
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,040
There's something wrong with this water.

70
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,759
Yiran

71
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,079
Yiran

72
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:24,839
Yiran

73
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait a second.

74
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,079
You wait a second.

75
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,480
Where did you fall?

76
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,240
Let me rub it for you.

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,439
Hold me.

78
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,839
Hug me.

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,240
Hold me.

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
It's so cold. Listen to me.

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
You're poisoned right now.

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
Stay here.

84
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,600
If you leave, I'll be all alone.

85
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,480
Mint leaves can control the effects of the drug.

86
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,160
Yiran

87
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,000
Yiran

88
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,480
Here, eat this.

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
Body shifting technique

90
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
Let this be a lesson for you today.

91
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,839
Next time, I'll take your life.

92
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,439
Wuming, what happened to me just now?

93
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,560
You were just affected by the Bewitching Incense.

94
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,759
You're fine now.

95
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,079
Your injury

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,720
It's just a superficial wound.

97
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,720
Let me take a look.

98
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,399
Does it hurt?

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,680
Don't mess with Song Yiran again.

100
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,040
Otherwise, this funeral wreath

101
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,199
I'll make sure each of you gets one.

102
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,240
Since I was little

103
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,040
No one has ever protected me like this.

104
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,560
Ye Wuming

105
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,399
You're the first.

106
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:44,799
No.

107
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,559
Where is Yue Linglong?

108
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,679
Get lost.

109
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,320
It hurts.

110
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,000
Yiran, let me explain.

111
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,600
Yiran.

112
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,000
He actually pushed me away.

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Ye Wuming, oh Ye Wuming.

114
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,799
Even when you're in pain, you still remember to dodge.

115
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,360
Senior brother.

116
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,120
Sister Yiran has left.

117
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,200
Shall we continue?

118
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,279
Senior Brother

119
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,039
Song Yiran

120
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,399
How dare you steal my Senior Brother

121
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,639
Then I'll take everything from you

122
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,200
Why are you looking for me

123
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,600
You want Song Yiran

124
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,159
I want Ye Wuming

125
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,879
Let's break them up

126
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Each gets what they want

127
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,759
A win-win

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,240
You just want to hurt Song Yiran

129
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,080
I'm the first to refuse

130
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I won't work with you

131
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,320
Think about it

132
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,840
Song Yiran, who is so high above

133
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,159
Why would she care about you

134
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,840
Only when she falls to the ground

135
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,159
Will she even look at you

136
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,000
If you don't do something

137
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,600
Your father will

138
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,399
Then she'll only suffer more

139
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,120
I believe in young President Li

140
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,840
He should make her happy

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,000
Tell me more

142
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,240
During tomorrow's commercial shoot

143
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,080
I'll arrange a little accident

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,080
You just need to have someone ready

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,960
Just film it from the side

146
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,039
I'll have my own use for the video

147
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,799
You'd better not mess this up

148
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,720
The script has a fight scene between me and Yue Linglong.

149
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,159
Why didn’t anyone tell me in advance?

150
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,639
Let me take a look.

151
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,200
If something unusual happens, there must be something fishy.

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,679
If they really have a scheme,

153
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,639
I’m worried you might be in danger.

154
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,679
Really.

155
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,759
But there are rules on set.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,360
You can only wait for me outside.

157
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,559
Go up first.

158
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,960
I have a way to sneak in.

159
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,559
Okay.

160
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,559
Look how chubby you are.

161
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,720
Look how skinny you are.

162
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,960
Handsome one, I want the handsome one.

163
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,080
Director.

164
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,840
Am I okay for this?

165
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,399
Yes, you’re the one.

166
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,679
Let’s go.

167
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,159
Alright.

168
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,000
Go change your clothes.

169
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,159
Sister.

170
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,360
I think our moves are still not smooth enough.

171
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,399
How about we practice one more time?

172
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,679
Sure, let’s do it.

173
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,639
Sister.

174
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,120
Did you not eat? (You’re so weak.)

175
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,519
That punch looked way too fake.

176
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:31,960
Let’s do it again.

177
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
Sister, why are you hitting me?

178
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,159
Anyone? Come on, come on!

179
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,440
I’m not filming anymore—over here, over here!

180
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,399
Bro

181
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,799
Got it on camera

182
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,679
It's a video

183
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,919
Clear, super clear

184
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,440
How do we edit this?

185
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,000
Relax, I know how to do this

186
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,720
Just trim the beginning and end

187
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,919
Like this one

188
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,879
Song Yiran acting like a diva

189
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,960
Beating up Yue Linglong on set

190
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,960
Isn't that bad?

191
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,879
Or we could call it "Top Diva Actresses"

192
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,919
The first one is actually her

193
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,159
You kid

194
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
Acting like a diva, yelling at the director, hitting co-stars

195
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,879
But I'm a good girl

196
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,919
That's good

197
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,600
Trim the beginning and end, take it out of context

198
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,200
You two are pretty creative

199
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,159
Cut

200
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,279
I... I can't beat him

201
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,639
The card was stolen

202
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,399
How did Ye Wuming get in?

203
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,559
How would I know?

204
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,240
You

205
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,879
Didn't you say nothing could go wrong?

206
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,919
I said nothing could go wrong

207
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,440
If we followed my plan

208
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,600
But now the plan has changed

209
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,399
Do you know this is my last chance?

210
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,159
And now you're telling me the plan changed

211
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,759
Are you a child?

212
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,679
All you do is shirk responsibility when something happens

213
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,480
If you hadn't let Ye Wuming in

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,840
How could we have messed up?

215
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,639
So now you're blaming me?

216
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,879
No.

217
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,159
Think about it yourself.

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,720
Alright.

219
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,720
I've got plenty of ways.

220
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,519
Just waiting for you.

221
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,519
Go, go to the bathroom.

222
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,279
Go to the bathroom.

223
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,399
All you do is go to the bathroom all day.

224
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,399
Come here, let me tell you something.

225
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,480
In a bit, punch this and break it.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,440
It's fine.

227
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,639
It's foam, it's fake.

228
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:20,720
Alright?

229
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,120
Okay.

230
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,720
Any problems?

231
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,399
No problem.

232
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:22,840
Good.

233
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,519
Come, come over here.

234
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,360
Props, stick this stone together for me.

235
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Wipe the floor.

236
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,679
Hurry up.

237
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,279
I'll go, I'll go.

238
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,120
What are you doing?

239
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,559
Costume, costume.

240
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Let's see if this granite is harder

241
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,879
or your fist is harder.

242
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,000
You think you can break it from a distance?

243
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,000
You'll ruin your hand.

244
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,720
Move this.

245
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,279
Alright, alright, alright.

246
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,080
Coming, coming, coming.

247
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,639
Move it over there.

248
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,279
Careful, okay, okay.

249
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,200
Alright, three, two, one, go.

250
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,759
Are you okay? Are you okay?

251
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,919
I'm fine, I'm fine.

252
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,200
Come on, wipe your sweat, wipe your sweat.

253
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:14,960
Fix it up, fix it up.

254
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,720
Sis, did you not eat or something?

255
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,759
That punch was way too fake.

256
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,360
Do it again.

257
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,000
I know her plan now.

258
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,399
I've already thought it through.

259
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,559
We just need to get in touch—come on, come on.

260
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,399
Listen to me.

261
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,159
We need to contact them in advance.

262
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:36,960
Get in the car, get in.

263
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,360
Let me tell you.

264
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
We need to make the most of our time today.

265
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,720
What's this?

266
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,919
All the edited videos that slandered you.

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,679
They're all here.

268
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,200
This is the only copy.

269
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,679
I deleted all the rest.

270
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,639
You can't recover them even if you try.

271
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,799
How did you get them?

272
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,720
I grabbed them when I was doing a cameo.

273
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,159
That's impressive.

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Let's go.

275
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,480
Bro.

276
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,240
Who are you?

277
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,120
Who are you calling "bro"?

278
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,639
It's me, San'er, bro.

279
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,679
No, no, no.

280
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,120
Sit down, sit down.

281
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,320
Brother,

282
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,960
On this trip abroad,

283
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,440
I was almost taken by those telecom fraud gangs.

284
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,480
I almost couldn't make it back, brother.

285
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,000
Let me pour you a glass of water.

286
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
Here, have some water.

287
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,600
I can do it myself.

288
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:23,879
Don't move.

289
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,879
Let me ask you,

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,720
Why does Yue Linglong have the key to our house?

291
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,759
Brother, I don't know Yue Linglong.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,639
Do you know her or not?

293
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,480
Do you really know her or not?

294
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,159
Do you know her or not? Do you?

295
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:30,840
Brother, do I know her or not?

296
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,279
This really isn't my fault, brother.

297
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
She was the one who approached me.

298
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,840
She's your junior and a big star.

299
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,360
So I...

300
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,919
Come on, I'll take you back.

301
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,440
Let's go.

302
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,919
Go, go, go.

303
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,440
Mainly, she just gave me too much.

304
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,799
I don't even want to work hard anymore.

305
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,360
But I lost it all on this trip.

306
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,159
Brother.

307
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,320
Brother, I swear, okay?

308
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,600
From now on, I won't have anything to do with her.

309
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,240
San'er,

310
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,279
I know you want to make it up to me.

311
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,879
So I want you to keep being a spy for Yue Linglong.

312
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,559
At the same time, you have to be a spy for Song Yiran too.

313
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,759
A double agent.

314
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,799
Brother, wait a second.

315
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,159
Brother.

316
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,159
Double the salary, plus double the salary.

317
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,240
Brother, when do I start?

318
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,639
Hello

319
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,440
Ye Wuming

320
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,799
If you want to know the truth about your master's death

321
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,320
come to the second floor of the Night City Bar
