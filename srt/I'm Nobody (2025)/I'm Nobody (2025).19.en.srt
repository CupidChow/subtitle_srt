1
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,200
President Su

2
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,359
Sister Linglong

3
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,959
Brother Wuming forced me to do this.

4
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,359
Baxian Sect is a place that teaches traditional culture

5
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,319
and martial arts.

6
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,799
My master adopted me.

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,719
I had never left the mountain before the car accident.

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,239
We used to practice here.

9
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,719
We did acupuncture up there.

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,000
I didn't expect your master to be in such a great place.

11
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,599
This place is really nice.

12
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,599
Thinking about it now,

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,239
my master did so much for me.

14
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,879
I didn't even get to see him one last time.

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,239
You miss your master so much.

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,120
He must have treated you very well.

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,799
Of course.

18
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,480
Just like how you treat me.

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
You want to kill me every day.

20
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,120
Master, you were really tough on me.

21
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,719
So after all the harsh training from my master,

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,199
I learned a special skill.

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,000
My right hand can automatically block all damage.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,080
So that's how it is.

25
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,039
Then you must be very grateful to your master.

26
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,159
Yeah.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,840
So as soon as I learned it, I went to repay him.

28
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,879
How did you repay him?

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,800
Master, don't you feel refreshed?

30
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,360
Refreshed, my ass.

31
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,960
Hurry, hurry and pull it out for me.

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,639
Quickly!

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,159
I... I...

34
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,960
You little brat!

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,319
Just watch, I'll break your legs!

36
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
That's not gratitude, that's revenge.

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,199
But right now,

38
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,360
even if I wanted to get back at him,

39
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,280
I can't find him anymore.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,240
The day I left the mountain,

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
Master told me to cut off my long hair

42
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,360
and start over.

43
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,759
That was the last thing I heard.

44
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,159
Master left.

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,199
My brothers and sisters are scattered everywhere.

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,960
Everything is gone.

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
Who says so?

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
You still have me.

49
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,560
That's right.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,280
I still have you.

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
And now, you're all I have left.

52
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,280
Since you've remembered,

53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,360
can you tell me now

54
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,919
what's hidden under this armguard?

55
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,079
What secret is it hiding?

56
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,680
I can't tell you that.

57
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,279
It's a secret of our sect.

58
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,879
So you still don't care about me.

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,240
You won't even share your secrets with me.

60
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,000
Come here.

61
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:30,959
Don't worry.

62
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,759
You'll find out in the future.

63
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,360
Director Li called me here so suddenly

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
Is there something important?

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,319
I had my subordinate edit a video

66
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,920
Please take a look

67
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,560
That's right

68
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,519
It's a video exposing Song Yiran

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,240
On the day she wanted to terminate her contract

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,399
I was already prepared

71
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,480
I deliberately had Tian Hao stir things up

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,199
It was all to gather material

73
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,319
Now

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,279
It's finally finished

75
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,639
So why did you call me here?

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,480
Ye Wuming has regained his memory

77
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,959
He should have been with you

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,399
But Song Yiran took him away

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,959
You must really hate her, right?

80
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,199
I don't hate her

81
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,199
I just want to get my senior brother back

82
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,120
That's perfect then

83
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,920
You get your senior brother back

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,079
And I get my Song Yiran back

85
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,040
We each get what we want

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,279
Alright

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,160
Come

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
Let's toast with tea instead of wine

89
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,360
May everything go smoothly

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,600
Look ahead.

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Stop.

92
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,360
Props, come here.

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
Thank you for your hard work, Teacher Song.

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,439
Thank you.

95
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,480
That "thank you" you just said

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,759
was so gentle.

97
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,759
It was like you were being sweet to me.

98
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,399
Now you're whispering so close to me

99
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,319
It's even more like flirting, like we're a couple.

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,560
Well, I can't help it.

101
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,920
I just like you.

102
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,160
I want to be closer to you.

103
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,319
What should I do?

104
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,120
Don't be so cheesy.

105
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,759
Number one on trending, Song Yiran.

106
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,600
Keep your voice down.

107
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,399
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

108
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:44,920
Come here, come here, come here.

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,319
What's going on? What's going on?

110
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,000
Look at this.

111
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,160
This is big news.

112
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,079
Bro, your wife is trending.

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,920
Scandal.

114
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:54,920
What's going on?

115
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,560
Bro, look.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,839
The popular actress Song Yiran is actually like this.

117
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,360
Disloyal, unfilial, heartless, and unrighteous.

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
This is pure slander.

119
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
It hit the trending list just half an hour after being posted.

120
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,439
This was definitely premeditated.

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,439
Take it down, quickly!

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,519
It's too late, bro.

123
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
It's already got tens of millions of views.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,480
President Ye.

125
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Look at this situation.

126
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,160
It's escalating too quickly.

127
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,240
Three investors saw the negative news about Yiran.

128
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,439
Plus, you’re still a murder suspect.

129
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,920
They've decided to halt filming.

130
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,560
Filming can only resume after the PR crisis is resolved.

131
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,600
Only then can we continue shooting.

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,519
What if we can't resolve it?

133
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,160
Then the movie will be scrapped.

134
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,360
Or they'll replace the lead actress.

135
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,439
Then half of the footage we've shot will be wasted.

136
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,639
The loss will be huge.

137
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,759
President Li really went to a lot of trouble.

138
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,839
It seems that ever since I first turned him down,

139
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,839
he started making plans.

140
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,319
It's fine.

141
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,759
I'll go find Junior Sister Linglong

142
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,839
and ask her to help clarify things.

143
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,519
No need to look for her.

144
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,480
The reason they managed to smear me this time

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,759
is really thanks to her.

146
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,120
Looks like she knew it was a setup from the start.

147
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,680
She might even be the one who set it up.

148
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,079
After all, the person she hates most right now is me.

149
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,199
That day on set,

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,480
Song Yiran suddenly slapped me.

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,439
I had no idea what was happening.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All this time,

153
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,319
she's always been suppressing me like this.

154
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,199
Just because she's more famous,

155
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,720
does that mean she can act like this?

156
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,959
Just because she's a well-known celebrity,

157
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,120
does she get to use her influence to bully newcomers?

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,680
Not only that,

159
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,160
she even stole my fiancé.

160
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,279
What should we do, Director?

161
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,560
We have to stop work for now.

162
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,639
Tell everyone to pack up.

163
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,320
Stop work.

164
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,279
Let's wrap it up, everyone.

165
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,519
Come on, pack up your things.

166
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,080
Hurry up.

167
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Wait a moment.

168
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,919
Director.

169
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,399
Keep the crew calm for now.

170
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,919
I'll handle the funding issue.

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,360
Senior Sister

172
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,519
Mr. Ma

173
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,320
Mr. Ma

174
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,600
I want to apply to the group for 300 million.

175
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,240
Young man

176
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,080
I've already reported to the board.

177
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,200
But the board has already given up on this film.

178
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,679
Even if the investors don't pull out,

179
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,919
the negative news about Yiran keeps spreading.

180
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,720
Even if it's finished, it can't be released.

181
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,559
Do you really think Yiran is that kind of person?

182
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,879
Of course I don't believe it.

183
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,320
But just us alone can't change public opinion.

184
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,519
There must be something Mr. Feng is doing behind the scenes.

185
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
It's all to make you

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,360
and those around you look worse and worse.

187
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,039
Then they'll question your character.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,679
That way, they can refuse to let you take over that 20 billion.

189
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,919
Junior Brother

190
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,240
Let's talk about this back home.

191
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,159
No.

192
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,960
I've already looked into it.

193
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,600
President Li has been colluding with President Feng and the others for a long time.

194
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,759
Senior, I understand what you mean.

195
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,360
Mingzhu Group doesn't have to invest.

196
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Just consider the money as a loan from me.

197
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,960
It's not that I don't want to help you.

198
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,720
This is a trap.

199
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,279
Do you really have to jump into it?

200
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Cut your losses while you can.

201
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,720
There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

202
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,759
No.

203
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,840
This film is too important to Yiran.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,039
It's just too important.

205
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,879
I can't just stand by and watch it

206
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,919
get ruined like this.

207
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,679
A film isn't about personal feelings.

208
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,759
I can't convince the board.

209
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,279
Besides, I've already talked to several investment firms.

210
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,320
I've already asked around.

211
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,000
Their demands are very clear.

212
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,159
Either Song Yiran proves her innocence,

213
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,879
or we replace Song Yiran.

214
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,600
Alright.

215
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,279
Then I'll prove her innocence.

216
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,919
Mr. Li

217
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,480
Ye Wuming is just too formidable.

218
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,600
I want more money.

219
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,120
Will more money even help?

220
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,919
I've already given you plenty of chances.

221
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,240
You simply can't kill him.

222
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,360
So now I've changed my strategy.

223
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I've already pretended to submit to him.

224
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,600
And I've set up a trap specifically for him.

225
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
He's doomed this time.

226
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,120
Then I'll give you one more chance.

227
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,639
If you can kill Ye Wuming,

228
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,879
I'll still pay you the previous reward.

229
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,399
And I'll give you extra money.

230
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,240
Wait.

231
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,159
Why?

232
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,600
Why do I never get to finish what I'm saying

233
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,480
before you leave?

234
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,120
Mr. Li, is there anything else you want to say?

235
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,039
Don't move.

236
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,559
Stand still, don't move.

237
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,759
Don't move.

238
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,840
Mr. Han

239
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,639
Song Yiran is definitely not a problem.

240
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,559
This matter will be settled soon.

241
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,320
Mr. Ye

242
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,919
Then let's talk after things have calmed down.

243
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,039
But the movie has to be finished now.

244
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,840
How about this:

245
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,639
I can increase your investment share.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,679
But I don't want my money to go to waste either.

247
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,480
Right?

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,919
Sorry, Mr. Ye.

249
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,039
Brother Wuming, Brother Wuming!

250
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,200
People from the company are here.

251
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,279
They want to kill me.

252
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,159
Ye Wuming, you've been tricked.
