1
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,400
Senior Sister

2
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:14,879
I'm here.

3
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,200
Stop hiding.

4
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,120
Ye Wuming

5
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,159
You really came.

6
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,040
You've got guts.

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,400
When a friend is in trouble, I can't just stand by.

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,799
Go ahead, name your terms.

9
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,159
I've told you before.

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
Our Ouyang family came back this time

11
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,480
to take over the Four Major Groups.

12
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,799
You can go after the Four Major Groups,

13
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,040
but why drag me into this?

14
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,719
You're the successor of the Baxian Sect.

15
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,959
To take the Four Major Groups,

16
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,239
thirty percent of the wealth

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,239
is owed to our Ouyang family.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,840
No one else can take it.

19
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,040
You keep talking about the Ouyang family,

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,519
but I've looked into it.

21
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,680
All the evidence that you're from the Ouyang family

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,439
is fake.

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,439
Who are you really?

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,280
You even investigated me?

25
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,040
I really underestimated you.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,920
If you want to save them, it's simple.

27
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,359
Do you dare to watch this video to the end?

28
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't say I didn't warn you.

29
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,120
Before you open it,

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,960
be ready to face a harsh reality.

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,120
Haven't you always wanted to investigate

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,719
the truth behind your master's death?

33
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,439
This is it.

34
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,879
Nowadays, AI forgery technology

35
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,680
is really this convincing?

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,319
I would never stoop to such a low trick as forgery.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,639
Three years ago, Song Yiran clearly went to the sect.

38
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,520
But she claimed she was traveling.

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,639
If nothing happened,

40
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,120
why would she lie?

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I've finished watching the video.

42
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,319
I have to take the person with me.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,560
You can take the person.

44
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,879
The video is yours.

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,039
We...

46
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,280
Thank you, young man.

47
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,599
You've saved me again.

48
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,400
Old Ma, no need to be so polite with me.

49
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,560
Let's go.

50
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,360
Junior brother,

51
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,560
I don't think keeping the key in the safe

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,479
is safe enough.

53
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,159
You should keep it instead.

54
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,400
Also,

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,280
about Master,

56
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,879
talk to Song Yiran first.

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,639
We'll meet up later.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,759
I'll talk to her alone.

59
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,919
Let's go find Mr. Feng first.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,159
See if he can wake up.

61
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:40,879
Let's go.

62
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,400
Okay.

63
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,400
Mr. Feng, how are you feeling?

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
Where am I?

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
Don't worry.

66
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,639
You are currently receiving treatment at the hospital.

67
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,800
Do you remember what happened last night?

68
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,599
I remember.

69
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,000
I saw him with my own eyes.

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
I remember.

71
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,000
That's not good.

72
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,600
Alright, get some rest.

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,319
Junior brother.

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,560
This is my key.

75
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm entrusting it to you.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,639
Yes, little brother.

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Now, only keeping it with you

78
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,360
is the safest option.

79
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,240
Alright.

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,040
I'll take it.

81
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,079
Mr. Feng.

82
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,920
Mr. Feng doesn't look quite right.

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,240
We arrived a bit too late.

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,279
Ma San.

85
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,399
Has Wuming returned?

86
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,079
Okay.

87
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,680
Okay.

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,240
You're back.

89
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:46,759
Don't move.

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,399
I have something to tell you.

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
What scene is this from?

92
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,399
Why don't I remember this?

93
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,519
This isn't from a film.

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,759
It's real.

95
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,120
August 15th, three years ago.

96
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,079
Three years ago.

97
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,120
I went traveling that day.

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
Song Yiran clearly went to the sect three years ago.

99
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,920
But she says she went traveling.

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,879
If it didn't happen,

101
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,399
why would she lie?

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,560
There wasn't any filming at that time.

103
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,000
And who is this elderly man?

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,040
He's my master.

105
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,439
Your master?

106
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,600
I've met your master.

107
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
Yesterday, when you wrapped up filming,

108
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,839
this photo popped up on your phone.

109
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,639
Three years ago, you were at my sect.

110
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,920
Impossible.

111
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,040
I have no memory of that at all.

112
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,439
I went traveling that day.

113
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,279
I have photos from that time, I'll find them for you.

114
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,680
That's strange.

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Where are my travel photos from then?

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
I remember posting them on my Moments.

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,279
No need to look.

118
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,040
Wuming.

119
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
You don't think

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,560
I killed your master, do you?

121
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
How could I do something like that?

122
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,120
I don't want to hear your explanation.

123
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,040
I'll investigate this myself.

124
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:40,839
Wuming.

125
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Finally caught you.

126
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,879
Mister Mystery Man.

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,279
You didn't really think that Yi Ran and I

128
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,240
actually had a falling out, did you?

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,559
We staged this whole act on purpose

130
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,159
just to lure you out.

131
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
You wanted to capture Yi Ran to threaten me

132
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
for those two keys.

133
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,519
So you were prepared all along.

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,879
Fine.

135
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Hand over the keys.

136
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
I'll let her go.

137
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,159
No.

138
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,360
Then I'll make sure you never have peace.

139
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,320
Do you really think you can get away?

140
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,360
Ma San.

141
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,960
Why is it him?

142
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,559
Brother

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
I was just sleeping, I swear.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,480
Ma San, stop pretending.

145
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,639
Who are you really?

146
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,159
I...

147
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,039
No wonder every time the mysterious person shows up,

148
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,919
you're never around.

149
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,240
So it was you all along.

150
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,399
Brother, I really was just sleeping in bed.

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,639
I know.

152
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,720
Because you were being controlled.

153
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,840
Who was controlling me?

154
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,399
Of course, it was our Su Mingzhu.

155
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,240
President Su

156
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,200
Senior Sister

157
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,840
Your puppet technique is truly masterful.

158
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,639
Even an ordinary person like San'er

159
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,679
can be turned into an expert.

160
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,039
If I'm not mistaken,

161
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,919
the bell in your hand—

162
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
No, what are you talking about?

163
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,279
Just now, luring San'er to attack you

164
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,200
was to force you to reveal your technique.

165
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,519
To expose your weakness.

166
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,480
We planned this whole act

167
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,399
just to draw you out.

168
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,840
The one pulling all the strings behind the scenes.

169
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Even though you gave San'er a voice changer,

170
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,080
the first time I met the mysterious person,

171
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,679
I recognized his voice.

172
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,320
Every time the mysterious person was present,

173
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,000
you were secretly controlling things.

174
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,759
San'er was your puppet.

175
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,519
San'er

176
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,960
I'm already here.

177
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,519
There's no need to hide anymore.

178
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,080
How scary.

179
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,039
I actually became a puppet.

180
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,399
Senior sister.

181
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,600
Actually, you come from Dongchuan.

182
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,000
You were gifted since childhood.

183
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,759
Since you were little, in our sect,

184
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,000
you were the fastest to learn martial arts.

185
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,000
But Master gave the successor's position to me.

186
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,960
So you hated me.

187
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,559
And hated Master.

188
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,799
Later, you went down the mountain to do business.

189
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,440
Master supported you greatly.

190
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,360
The condition was that you hand over thirty percent of your wealth

191
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,399
to the successor to manage.

192
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,960
Of course, you didn't agree.

193
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,240
So three years ago,

194
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,759
you pretended to arrange people

195
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,039
to film at the mountain gate,

196
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,159
but actually lured Song Yiran

197
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,759
to make her cause Master's death.

198
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,320
In a moment, Master, just stand here and don't move.

199
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
Yiran, you'll stand over here in a moment.

200
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,960
Then, walk around Master in a circle.

201
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,399
Then move to this spot.

202
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,039
Then take the sword and stab at the teacher.

203
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,159
And dodge here.

204
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,679
Okay, that's it.

205
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,279
Alright?

206
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,879
Okay, got it.

207
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,240
Alright, let's get ready to shoot.

208
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,120
Come on.

209
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,039
Come on, get ready for the actual take.

210
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,720
Action.
