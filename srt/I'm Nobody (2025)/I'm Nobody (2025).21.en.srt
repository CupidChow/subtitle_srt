1
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,040
Yiran

2
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Stop

3
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,719
How is that possible?

4
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,560
You think you can just leave after attempted murder?

5
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,439
Do you take me for a fool?

6
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,959
How could Song Yiran not be dead?

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,040
San'er

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,599
I'm going to kill you

9
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,040
Get out of the way

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,519
The police will be here soon

11
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,319
That's enough to lock him up for seven or eight years

12
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,359
Let's go

13
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,039
President Ye, Yiran

14
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,840
Sorry about today

15
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,360
It was our oversight

16
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,520
Why don't you take a rest today?

17
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,599
Let's shoot again tomorrow

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
No need, Director

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
I've prepared for this scene

20
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,879
for a long time

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,879
I can do it now

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,919
Really? That's great

23
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,159
All departments, get ready

24
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:23,800
Change the scene

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,360
Let's shoot the next scene

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,080
Move faster, hurry up

28
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,759
We're about to start

29
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,759
Even the director is getting anxious

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,240
Is the set ready?

31
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,680
It's ready, Director

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,639
Right away, right away

33
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,439
It'll be ready soon

34
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,400
Start the wind

35
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,319
President Ye

36
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,080
Why don't you go rest over by the director?

37
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,599
I'm still your bodyguard on set.

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
Alright, suit yourself.

39
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,360
Bro

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,479
Um...

41
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,719
The informant said

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,800
President Feng's side is making intense preparations.

43
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,439
They're getting ready for a high-end business war to take us down.

44
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,960
President Feng is extremely cunning.

45
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,080
What should we do?

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,879
I'll meet him myself.

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,960
Ye Wuming handled the troublesome investors.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,120
He even became a big shot in the industry.

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,680
He's at the peak of his fame right now.

50
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
The higher you stand,

51
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,800
the harder you fall.

52
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,280
We need to completely surround and attack him.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,800
Spend a billion, two billion—

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,719
We must destroy Ye Wuming's company.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
To eliminate future threats.

56
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,000
Mr. Feng

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
No need to go through all that trouble.

58
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,400
Just give me the money.

59
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,360
I'll close the company and change its name.

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,520
It's a win-win for both of us.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,599
Mr. Ye, you have quite the nerve.

62
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,520
You actually came here in person.

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,919
It's rare for me to come here.

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,199
I heard someone at the door saying they wanted to get rid of me.

65
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
Mr. Ye, you must have misheard.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,199
There's an echo in this room.

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,560
It's normal to mishear things.

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,400
Mr. Feng, you're still as cautious as ever.

69
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,360
You won't even admit to the smallest things.

70
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,919
Our business has grown so big

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
because we've always been careful.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,560
I wonder if you've ever heard this saying.

73
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,680
Even the wisest can make mistakes.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,920
You think you can order Mr. Li around as you please.

75
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,279
But in reality, people like him don't trust anyone.

76
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,120
Every time he meets with you,

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,639
he brings hidden recording devices.

78
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,120
Everything about your transactions

79
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,040
has been recorded.

80
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,240
You're only seeing the surface here.

81
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,959
What you don't know is,

82
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,480
every minute here is thoroughly checked.

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,879
Signals are blocked the entire time.

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,480
Everyone who comes in is strictly inspected.

85
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,160
Alright.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,199
Then listen to this.

87
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,519
You definitely don't want

88
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,680
Ye Wuming and Song Yiran to become more and more successful, right?

89
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,480
If money can solve it,

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,519
it's a small matter.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
You just make the decisions.

92
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,120
I'll just provide the money.

93
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,480
Come talk to me only if it exceeds 500 million.

94
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,639
Their movie is eye-opening.

95
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,959
It's about to start filming too.

96
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,720
It'll be even harder to deal with them after this.

97
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,720
Don't worry.

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,480
Someone will take action on their own.

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,759
They'll handle this problem openly and directly.

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,759
Always hunting wild geese,

101
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,480
but in the end, the goose pecks you.

102
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,800
Got tricked by that guy named Li.

103
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,160
If you want to use a vicious dog,

104
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,639
you'd better be ready to get bitten in return.

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,839
Let it bite, then.

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,279
Losing a bit of flesh

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
isn't a big deal.

108
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,360
No one can threaten me.

109
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,319
Since you're here today,

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,720
don't think about leaving.

111
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,399
But why do I feel

112
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,000
that no one can stop me?

113
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,680
Do it.

114
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,160
Do it.

115
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,639
I've taken care of everyone.

116
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,040
Otherwise, how could I have gotten in?

117
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,759
Sit.

118
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,160
Then I'll trouble you both tonight.

119
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,319
Come with me to sign the papers at Mr. Su's place.

120
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,120
Okay, I'm heading out now.

121
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,279
That's strange.

122
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,160
Mr. Zhu is usually more proactive than anyone.

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,079
Why is he late today?

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,600
Brother.

125
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,319
Mr. Zhu has become a vegetable, just like Mr. Li.

126
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,959
This is surveillance footage sent by our people.

127
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,279
Something's not right.

128
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
They're stealing Mr. Zhu's key.

129
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,680
This is the Ouyang family.

130
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,480
Their so-called "Ghost Flash" is said to be unavoidable.

131
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,120
Even cameras can't capture his movements.

132
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,639
The Ouyang family.

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,680
That's right.

134
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,639
The Ouyang family specializes in stealth and assassination.

135
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,759
Back then,

136
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,040
after their leader was defeated by your master,

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,240
they withdrew from the underworld.

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,079
We thought they'd disappear for good.

139
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,199
But now they've shown up again.

140
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,480
And they've mastered the Ghost Flash.

141
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:27,879
San'er.

142
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,680
I'll go charge it.

143
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,199
As soon as they returned, they stole Mr. Zhu's key.

144
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,439
They're trying to seize the wealth of our four major groups.

145
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,000
San'er.

146
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,560
Let me take a look.

147
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,319
San'er.

148
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:50,759
San'er.

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,160
San'er.

150
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,680
Mr. Feng.

151
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,079
Ye Wuming.

152
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,759
Back then, our Ouyang family

153
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,040
admitted defeat to your master, fair and square.

154
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,480
But these petty people kicked us while we were down.

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,959
The Ouyang family won't let a single one of them go.

156
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,160
I advise you not to meddle in other people's business.

157
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,240
The four great families

158
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,679
won't leave a single one behind.

159
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,000
The key

160
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,799
I'll take it first.

161
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,519
He's been poisoned.

162
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,279
I need to save him quickly.

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,799
Junior brother

164
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,000
Will I be the next one?

165
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
Senior sister, don't worry.

166
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
Tomorrow, I'll arrange for someone to protect you.

167
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Brother, it's turned on.

168
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,159
Okay, stop.

169
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,559
It's a wrap! It's a wrap! It's a wrap!

170
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,159
Congratulations on finishing!

171
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations!

172
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,120
Thank you.

173
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,639
Thank you.

174
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,080
One, two, three.

175
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
Congratulations on finishing!

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
Take a photo of just me and the director.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay, okay.

178
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,080
Come on.

179
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,039
Alright.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,919
Still, thank you for your hard work.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Thank you for your hard work, Director.

182
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,799
Let's work together again next time.

183
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,720
The day you left,

184
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,480
Master also passed away.

185
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,320
She went to your master's place under the pretense of filming.

186
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,759
Her real purpose was to kill your master.

187
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,519
What are you looking at?

188
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,639
You've been to my master's place?

189
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,919
No, I haven't. What's wrong?

190
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,440
It's nothing.

191
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,879
Brother.

192
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,240
Kai ran into trouble.

193
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,559
Boss Ma and Boss Su are missing too.

194
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,639
Let's go.

195
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,080
Let's go.

196
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,639
Brother, Dali.

197
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,120
Come.

198
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,440
How is it?

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,799
President Ye,

200
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,759
that mysterious person has come again.

201
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,919
Even when we all went together,

202
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,519
we still weren't a match.

203
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,559
Senior brother,

204
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,720
that person's strength is too great.

205
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,480
We had no power to fight back.

206
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,559
Brother, look over there.

207
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,639
There's an address on it.

208
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,240
No. 88, Jinxiao East Road.

209
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,320
Brother,

210
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,960
it's an abandoned factory.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,679
The person must be there.

212
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,000
Wuming,

213
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,480
this clue was left so obviously.

214
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,799
I'm worried it's a trap set on purpose.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
Even if we know it's a trap,

216
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,519
we still have to go.
