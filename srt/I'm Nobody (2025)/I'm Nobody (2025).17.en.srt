1
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,640
Come on, everyone, keep up.

2
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,439
Everyone, keep up.

3
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,879
Everyone, take a good look.

4
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,319
This is Ye Wuming, the one who killed the master of Nanzheng.

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,200
Everyone,

6
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm reporting this at great risk.

7
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,120
I might be in danger.

8
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,760
If I don't show up in the next few days,

9
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,000
please call the police for me.

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Everyone, listen to me.

11
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,120
Let me give you a grand introduction.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,040
This person here

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,560
is the famous Ye Wuming, President Ye.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,599
He used filming a movie as an excuse

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,959
to beat a friend of Nanzheng to death.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,719
And now he can still

17
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,519
sit here like nothing happened.

18
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,920
Who will speak up for the deceased?

19
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,719
Impossible.

20
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,640
I used soft force, it couldn't have hurt anyone.

21
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,439
This is soft force?

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
One punch sent him flying over ten meters.

23
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,200
Everyone, record this well.

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,359
Look, his internal organs were knocked out.

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,040
Guys,

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,359
You can't judge a book by its cover.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,799
Look at how handsome he is,

28
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,400
who would have thought

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,359
he's actually a vicious villain.

30
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,719
If I really wanted to kill him,

31
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,760
it wouldn't have to be so complicated.

32
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,719
Did you see that?

33
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,560
The murderer is threatening us.

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Everyone, take a good look.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Stop!

36
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,359
Who allowed you to come in?

37
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,280
Mr. Su.

38
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,599
You came here today—

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,519
You're not here to cover up for the murderer, are you?

40
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,000
Li Tianhao, stop trying to confuse right and wrong.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,039
Park Nanzhi died on the way to the hospital

42
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,080
in a car accident.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,800
The coroner has already issued a report.

44
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,680
It has nothing to do with Senior Ye Wuming.

45
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,039
You expect anyone to believe that?

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,599
How come I heard

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,080
that the fake car accident was staged by you

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
to cover up the truth?

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,879
That's right.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,400
Don't use these questionable things

51
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,159
to fool us.

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,000
We want the truth.

53
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,120
Yes, we want the truth.

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,479
Show us the truth.

55
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,199
Fine.

56
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,560
I'll give you the truth.

57
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,680
These are photos from the accident scene,

58
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,759
and the hospital's vital sign records upon admission,

59
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,639
as well as the coroner's autopsy report.

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,319
These pieces of evidence are enough to show

61
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,520
that Park Nanzhi's death

62
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,280
has no direct connection to Ye Wuming.

63
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,400
Aren't you all here for the truth?

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,360
Go ahead, record it.

65
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,400
Get closer with your camera.

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,879
What are you filming for?

67
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,479
Besides,

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
it's so easy for you to fake evidence.

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,479
If Ye Wuming hadn't injured Park Namjik,

70
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,199
how would Park Namjik have ended up in the hospital?

71
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm sure

72
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
Ye Wuming is directly connected to Park Namjik's death.

73
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,599
Am I right, everyone?

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,479
Yes, that's right.

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,240
I think you people are just here to cause trouble.

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,759
You want the truth, right?

77
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,919
I already called the police before I came.

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,680
Just you wait.

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,840
Notify the lawyer.

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
Every single one of you spreading rumors and slander,

81
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,039
will be sued.

82
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,560
Sorry, junior.

83
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,560
It was my oversight.

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,840
I let them bother you.

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,400
That person just now,

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,080
do I have a grudge against him?

87
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,560
You mean that tall guy?

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,919
Of course you do.

89
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,400
It's all because of Song Yiran.

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,479
Junior brother,

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,120
about this matter,

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,360
they are deliberately trying to frame and slander you.

93
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
No matter what you say,

94
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,680
they won't believe you.

95
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,080
Don't let it weigh on your mind.

96
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,560
The innocent will always be clear; you don't need to worry about them.

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,159
I understand, senior sister.

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I know my limits.

99
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,120
I know.

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,000
That's good.

101
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll publish this evidence online.

102
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,280
As for you, just focus on your recovery.

103
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,159
I've already bought this sanatorium.

104
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,120
The security has also been replaced with our people.

105
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,039
From now on,

106
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,439
this kind of thing won't happen again.

107
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,520
Every single person spreading rumors and slander,

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,919
will be sued.

109
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,199
There were too many people at the scene back then.

110
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,040
Ye Wuming was cleared of suspicion.

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,360
We couldn't frame him successfully.

112
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,120
Now we can only mix truth with lies.

113
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,120
There are two opinions online right now.

114
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,000
Some say he brought honor to the country.

115
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,439
Others are calling for a life for a life.

116
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,519
Let them argue about it.

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Only when there's debate does it get attention.

118
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,279
This time, Mr. Li,

119
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,800
you did a good job.

120
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,959
It's all thanks to your strategic planning, Mr. Feng.

121
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,399
Next,

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,079
how do you want to stir things up, Mr. Feng?

123
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,959
Su Mingzhu will definitely make the evidence public.

124
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,079
But people only like to hear gossip.

125
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,920
As long as we blow things up before she exposes it,

126
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,079
make the situation big,

127
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,959
no one will care about the truth.

128
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,600
Spending a fortune just to make a beauty smile.

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Fighting fiercely to steal someone's love.

130
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,600
Pretending to have amnesia to cover up the truth about the murder.

131
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,240
Pretending to have amnesia.

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,519
It's refreshing to talk to smart people.

133
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,959
You're still the clever one, Mr. Feng.

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,600
Using public opinion to destroy someone mentally.

135
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,279
I'll find someone right now

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,879
to write this press release.

137
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,959
Come in.

138
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,639
Senior Brother.

139
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,120
Junior Sister.

140
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,800
It's time to take your medicine.

141
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Why are you dressed like this?

142
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,480
Master will be angry if he sees you.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,959
Why are you making it sound so scary?

144
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,040
I picked this out especially.

145
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,279
So, do you like it?

146
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,759
I'm really nervous too, Senior Brother.

147
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,120
My heart is beating really fast right now.

148
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,240
Do you want to feel it?

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,319
Stop messing around. Go back to sleep.

150
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,279
Just feel it and see.

151
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,199
Junior Sister, stop fooling around with me.

152
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,800
Master taught you martial arts

153
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,160
not so you could avoid romance.

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,240
We already have a marriage arrangement.

155
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,920
We'll end up together sooner or later.

156
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,319
Master was just joking about that.

157
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,839
Don't bring this up again.

158
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
How could that be a joke?

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,279
A teacher for a day is like a father for life.

160
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,040
Master wants us to be together

161
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,720
because he thinks we're a good match.

162
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,319
Senior Brother, you wouldn't go against Master's wishes, would you?

163
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,199
Senior Brother.

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,519
Come on.

165
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
But in my heart,

166
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,639
you've always been like a younger sister.

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,199
Then let your little sister give you a hug.

168
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,199
Song... Song Yiran.

169
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,399
What did you say?

170
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,720
Junior Brother

171
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,040
Senior Sister

172
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,079
Right now, the internet is flooded with news

173
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,639
all saying you're suspected of murder.

174
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,600
They all claim it was an on-set accident.

175
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
An international friend was sent to the ICU.

176
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,399
They even released some

177
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
maliciously edited videos.

178
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,319
They don't mention the car accident at all.

179
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,160
Senior Sister

180
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Those self-defense materials are useless.

181
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,240
They've had little effect.

182
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,879
The legal team has also responded to their rumors

183
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,879
by sending lawyer's letters.

184
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,959
But it hasn't helped much.

185
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,279
They're taking things out of context.

186
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,560
Even if they're caught,

187
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
they'll just say the reports are incomplete

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,240
and didn't follow up on the aftermath.

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,439
It doesn't affect the spread at all.

190
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,639
Looks like they're targeting me.

191
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,399
It's okay.

192
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,120
I think we should stay put for now.

193
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,319
They'll show their true colors sooner or later.

194
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,600
So just stay here and rest easy.

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,639
Don't go out these days.

196
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,759
Wait until they come out into the open.

197
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,240
Okay.

198
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,240
I'll head out now.

199
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,199
Get some rest early.

200
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,519
Get up.

201
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,639
Senior Brother.

202
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,759
Why are you so insensitive?

203
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,199
Senior Brother, come a little closer.

204
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,000
Junior Sister, Junior Sister.

205
00:07:59,399 --> 00:07:59,839
Yes, yes.

206
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,839
Don't move.

207
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,120
Junior Sister.

208
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,720
Junior Sister, I said no.

209
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,720
Why not?

210
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:10,879
Alright.

211
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,160
Senior Brother.

212
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,920
Junior Sister.

213
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,319
Senior Brother.

214
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,480
Wait a moment, Junior Sister.

215
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,519
Have you made enough of a fuss?

216
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,680
Stop messing around.

217
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,079
Go back to sleep.

218
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,320
Get some rest early.

219
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
I thought you had already let it go.

220
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,519
Senior lost his memory before.

221
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,159
I gave my blessings to him and Yiran.

222
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,480
Now his memory has returned.

223
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,919
Why shouldn't I give it a try?

224
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,360
I've already lost once.

225
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,440
I can't lose again.

226
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,759
Only those who lack confidence are afraid to lose.

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,679
Senior sister.

228
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,639
I know you like him too.

229
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,480
Why do you say that?

230
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,120
Then why won't you let him see Song Yiran?

231
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,279
You clearly know that seeing her now

232
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,039
is when it's easiest for him to regain his memory.

233
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,159
Besides,

234
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,879
I've never seen you care about someone this much.

235
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,639
Do you like him?

236
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Yes.

237
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,399
Senior sister.

238
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,600
It's me who is engaged to senior.

239
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,039
That was just a joke Master made before.

240
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,840
You're the only one who took it seriously.

241
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,639
Master doesn't joke about things like that.

242
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,159
Our engagement is real.

243
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,559
Hello

244
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,519
Yiran

245
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,879
They said Wuming can't see you

246
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,919
They're lying to you

247
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,919
These days are when he

248
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,200
is most likely to regain his memory

249
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,919
Ma San, how do you know that?

250
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,240
I just overheard it at the sanatorium

251
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,600
Sis, you need to think of something quickly

252
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,320
Otherwise, Wuming will really forget you

253
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,720
Then I'll go over now

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,519
Sis

255
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,559
There are a lot of people guarding the entrance

256
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,519
You can't get in

257
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Maybe you should think of another way

258
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,159
Okay, I got it

259
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,200
Taste can trigger people's earliest memories

260
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,039
Brother

261
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,200
Try this tomato and scrambled eggs

262
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,039
Brother

263
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,159
So, does it remind you of anything?

264
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,919
It tastes terrible

265
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
Thanks for your hard work, Kai

266
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,200
Actually

267
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,120
You don't have to make it so tense every time

268
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,639
It's fine

269
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,159
Mr. Ye gave instructions

270
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,399
When he's not around

271
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,480
we're supposed to protect you

272
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,679
So he was behind the scenes

273
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,559
quietly doing so much for me

274
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,039
This is an alarm

275
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,080
Press this if anything happens

276
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,399
We'll be nearby

277
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,639
Thank you, Kai

278
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,720
I'll head back now

279
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,360
But this taste is very familiar.

280
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,159
I must have eaten it somewhere before.

281
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
All of this was made by Sister Yiran herself.

282
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,600
It wasn't easy for me to bring it in.

283
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,559
Yiran.

284
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,720
Song Yiran.

285
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,720
Yes, yes, that's right.

286
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,080
That name sounds familiar too.

287
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
But I really can't remember.

288
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,440
It's okay, bro.

289
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,000
It doesn't matter if you can't remember.

290
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,159
We can always get to know each other again.

291
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,960
You two can as well.

292
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,679
Sister Yiran.

293
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,759
I'm not someone who likes to beat around the bush.

294
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,879
Tell me where that bank card is.

295
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,399
I can spare your life.

296
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,759
That bank card...

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
I really have destroyed it.

298
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,320
Then there's nothing I can do.

299
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,759
You could have used it to buy your life.

300
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,559
When the enemy is strong and I'm weak,

301
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,679
the first thing is to block the opponent's line of sight.

302
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,320
After the power is cut,

303
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,399
the attacker will guard the main door right away.

304
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,440
To prevent you from escaping.

305
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,159
Find a place to hide.

306
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,639
Make sure not to make any noise.

307
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,720
Try to find a way to call for help.

308
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,480
You want to call the police, right?

309
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,879
You really underestimate me.

310
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,159
I've already blocked the signal here.

311
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,440
Remember,

312
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,559
no matter how the other side tries to lure you out,

313
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,720
never come out.

314
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,080
Three years ago, you killed Ye Wuming's master.

315
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,039
He'll find out sooner or later.

316
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,679
I didn't kill his master.

317
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,480
I didn't kill his master.

318
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,279
So you were here all along.

319
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,159
Then go explain it to him.

320
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
See if he believes you.

321
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,240
I believe you.

322
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
It's okay now, Yiran.

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,480
Yiran.

324
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,679
I'm here.

325
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,320
Wuming.

326
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,960
Sister Yiran.

327
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,720
You don't know how good I am at imitating, do you?

328
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,639
Yiran, come here.

329
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Let big brother take good care of you.

330
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,679
I suggest you hand over your bank card quickly.

331
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,279
Or else, on your pretty little face,

332
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,879
I'll carve a flower.

333
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,279
I advise you not to do that.

334
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,159
Wuming.

335
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,559
Weren't you at the hospital?

336
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,639
Surprised I got away, aren't you?

337
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,879
Let's go.

338
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,799
You...

339
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,480
How did you get out?
