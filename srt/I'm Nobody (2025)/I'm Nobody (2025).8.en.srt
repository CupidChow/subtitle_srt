1
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,599
That dance just now was performed especially for you.

2
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,280
I didn't come here to watch you dance.

3
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,879
Then let's go somewhere else.

4
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,959
You've been pretending to be an agent for so many years.

5
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,319
Looks like you're a good actor too.

6
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,799
Being an agent is just one of my hobbies.

7
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:44,959
What?

8
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,599
Are you curious about me now?

9
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,959
I don't want to waste words with you.

10
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,879
About my master's death—

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,879
What do you know about it?

12
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,959
You want to know?

13
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:58,959
Drink this.

14
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,360
Talk.

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
What do you know?

16
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,479
Don't rush.

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,599
Drink with me until I'm happy.

18
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,560
Then I'll tell you.

19
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,919
I heard people with amnesia shouldn't drink.

20
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,520
Drinking too much can mess up your brain.

21
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,560
Find an excuse to get him drunk.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Make him tell the truth after drinking.

23
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,319
Where did Ye Wuming really go?

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,439
Ma San, are you going to talk or not?

25
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,639
Fine, I'll look for him myself.

26
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,759
Sis, sis, sis!

27
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,319
Sis!

28
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,520
Sis!

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,960
Brother Wuming told me.

30
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,439
It's very dangerous outside.

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,479
You shouldn't go anywhere.

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,439
It's dangerous.

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,400
Payment of ten thousand yuan received.

34
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,280
What are you doing, sis?

35
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,240
Am I, Ma San, the kind of person who loves money?

36
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,680
I wouldn't betray my brother for ten thousand yuan.

37
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,360
I wouldn't sell out my brother.

38
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,319
You know that, sis.

39
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,080
Payment of fifty thousand yuan received.

40
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,360
Second floor of Night City Bar.

41
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,879
The woman he's dating is your agent.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,759
Lu Bingqing.

43
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,680
Let's go.

44
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,879
Sis.

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,120
Sis, I'll navigate for you. Sis!

46
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,719
Here.

47
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,080
This wine...

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,960
Tastes pretty good.

49
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,520
It's just not strong enough.

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Seventy-five percent.

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
That's not strong?

52
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,319
Don't drink too much.

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
You still haven't told me what happened with Master.

54
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
You can't drink too much.

55
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,759
How can he drink so much?

56
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,279
Good thing I came prepared.

57
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,480
What are you doing?

58
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,160
Hurry back!

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,759
You still haven't told me what happened.

60
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,160
Where were we just now?

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,639
Come on, let's keep drinking.

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,839
Why does she seem like a different person?

63
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,600
Take it.

64
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,439
Cheers.

65
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Aren't people with amnesia not supposed to drink much?

66
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,920
How would I know?

67
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,879
The more I drink this, the more awake I feel.

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,759
Did you give me fake alcohol?

69
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,000
Impossible.

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,560
With fake alcohol, you'd get drunk even faster.

71
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,319
Hurry back!

72
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,439
You still haven't told me what happened.

73
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,199
Hurry up.

74
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,959
Why did I just see two of you over there?

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,480
You're drunk, aren't you?

76
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,920
You're seeing double.

77
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
Here, have some water.

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,959
Since I can't outdrink you,

79
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,639
I'll have to use my hands instead.

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,839
If I say I'm just defending myself, would you believe me?

81
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,600
Bingqing

82
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,120
I didn't expect you could drink so much.

83
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,199
Sister

84
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,519
There are plenty of things you don't know.

85
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,560
You used to pretend it was all for my own good.

86
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,240
Now you don't even bother pretending.

87
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,920
Wake up, sister.

88
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,519
All the friendships in showbiz are fake.

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,040
Whoever takes it seriously loses.

90
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Sis, there must be some misunderstanding here.

91
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,439
Get lost.

92
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,319
Alright.

93
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,079
Yiran

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,439
Sister

95
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
You two aren't even married.

96
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,000
We're competing fairly.

97
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,079
I couldn't tell.

98
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,040
My boyfriend is so popular at the company?

99
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,000
That's nice.

100
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,360
Had enough to drink? If so, let's go home.

101
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,160
Go home.

102
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,160
Ye Wuming

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm getting more and more interested in you.

104
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,079
I went to find her.

105
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,959
Because I have something important to ask her.

106
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,120
She's been my agent for so many years.

107
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,839
What could she know that I don't?

108
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,480
This is really something only she can do.

109
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,399
Then tell me,

110
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,560
what is it that only she can do?

111
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
She can dance.

112
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,279
Dance.

113
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,200
So, how is it? Does it look good?

114
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,759
I think Lu Bingqing

115
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,759
she's not as good as you, not as good as you.

116
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,159
Why are you saying it so slowly?

117
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,200
Are you planning to dance for others in this outfit?

118
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,120
Of course.

119
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,519
Doesn't it look good?

120
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
It's a game character.

121
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,399
It's a favorite among otakus.

122
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,919
Who told you all otakus like this?

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,799
Besides, this is too revealing.

124
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:10,799
No way.

125
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,960
I think it's fine.

126
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,720
You—

127
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,600
How is it fine?

128
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,399
Your waist and legs are all exposed.

129
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,200
Someone's coming.

130
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,000
This doesn't look good.

131
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
Cover up.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,519
They're here.

133
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:29,919
Bro.

134
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,240
I suspect there's something wrong with Lu Bingqing.

135
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,799
Let me tell you about it.

136
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,720
No, no, no.

137
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
I know, let's go.

138
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,279
Why won't you even let me in?

139
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,159
I've got something to do here, San'er.

140
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,159
Ma San.

141
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,639
Does it look good?

142
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,279
It looks good.

143
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,519
Wuming said it doesn't look good.

144
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,240
Bro.

145
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
I like it.

146
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,159
You, every day, you like everything.

147
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,679
Let's go.

148
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Bro.

149
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,159
I told you it looks good, right?

150
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,120
Is there even a debate about this outfit?

151
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,639
Are you jealous?

152
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,480
I...

153
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,919
According to the contract, you're my girlfriend.

154
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,200
So I have every right to be jealous.

155
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,639
You still have the nerve to come back?

156
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,200
It's partly my fault too.

157
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,080
I underestimated how much he could drink.

158
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,919
Song Yiran is not a simple woman.

159
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,639
She must have kept that bank card.

160
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,200
Are you finally going to get tough?

161
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,600
Even though she terminated the contract,

162
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,159
her business deals

163
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,759
still have ten days before they expire.

164
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,679
She needs to be taught a lesson.

165
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,080
As long as, within these ten days,

166
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
something happens to her,

167
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,120
the company can get a huge compensation.

168
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,159
I want five million.

169
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,279
I'll give you ten million.

170
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,879
And capture Ye Wuming too.

171
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,919
Ye Wuming is too formidable.

172
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,480
Add another five million.

173
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,159
No problem.

174
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
My people

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,960
have already found Song Yiran's parents.

176
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,759
After it's done,

177
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,679
I'll give you another two million.

178
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,559
Wait.

179
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,559
Let me finish.

180
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,600
They will cooperate with your actions.

181
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Nice.

182
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,360
Song Yiran

183
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,000
Your parents are in my hands.

184
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,679
Do you want them to live?

185
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,120
What do you really want?

186
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
This afternoon at three o'clock.

187
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,600
Come to the eastern suburb for instructions.

188
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,240
As for Ye Wuming,

189
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,120
wait at the western plaza.

190
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,840
And one more thing,

191
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,360
You can't call the police.

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm here.

193
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,039
If you want to save her parents,

194
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,120
stay here and wait quietly.

195
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,320
Trying to lure me away, huh?

196
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,559
That's right.

197
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
But if you dare to leave,

198
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,279
her parents will die immediately.

199
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,720
Watch him. Don't let him leave.

200
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,480
Keep moving forward.

201
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,840
Do you see that door?

202
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
Your parents are inside.

203
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,559
Hurry up.

204
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,679
Pull up the wire.
