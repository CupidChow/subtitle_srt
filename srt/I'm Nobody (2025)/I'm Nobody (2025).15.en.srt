1
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,200
Mr. Li

2
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,959
I'm here to make a bet with you.

3
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,840
Looking for me?

4
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,640
What are we betting on?

5
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,040
If tomorrow, "Needle in the Embroidery"

6
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,079
can have preview screenings in 200 theaters across the city,

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,560
then all the shares of the film will belong to me.

8
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,120
And I'll have nothing more to do with you.

9
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:18,680
Brother

10
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,040
You only have five theaters under your control right now.

11
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,079
You think you can secure 200 theaters in one night?

12
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,439
Mr. Li, you—

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,120
I'm talking to you.

14
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,359
Alright.

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,560
I accept your bet.

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,159
If you win,

17
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,799
I'll give you all my shares of "Needle in the Embroidery."

18
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,760
All of them.

19
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,799
But if you lose,

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,359
her new film "Eye-Opener"

21
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,000
all the shares you have in Wuwei Pictures

22
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,879
you have to give them all to me.

23
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,400
Deal.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,680
Brother Kai, Brother Kai, Brother Kai

25
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,280
Brother Kai

26
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,799
You guys go over there.

27
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,879
We'll go this way.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Okay.

29
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,120
Boss Ye

30
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,719
Have some tea.

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,319
Manager Li, how did it go?

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
No problem, no problem.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,560
Boss Ye is really loaded now.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,319
He thinks money can buy everything.

35
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,680
But reality is often very cruel.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,879
Money isn't all-powerful.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,879
It can't buy off every theater manager

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,240
out there.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
I don't lack money at all.

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,520
Take your money and get lost.

41
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't try to threaten or bribe me.

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,240
I won't agree to it.

43
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,960
How many are left on this side?

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,800
There are two left.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Let's hurry up.

46
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,800
Bro,

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
this probably isn't your wife, right?

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,360
What should we do, Dad?

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,360
They've already closed deals with 164 theaters.

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Go make some arrangements.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,719
Find twenty

52
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,759
theater managers who are close to us.

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
Make sure they don't give in, no matter what.

54
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,319
Got it.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,120
Boss Ye, have some tea.

56
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,960
It's nine o'clock.

57
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,280
No rush.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,719
The theater doesn't open until ten.

59
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,840
It's so early in the morning.

60
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,199
Let's not bother others.

61
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,639
There are 204 theaters in the whole city.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
Our family alone controls twenty of them.

63
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,000
You're bound to lose.

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,719
Young man,

65
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,080
do you know why you're losing?

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,000
I'd like to hear the details.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,080
You're too arrogant and showy.

68
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,680
You only see the surface.

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,360
We're betting on 200 theaters.

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,920
As long as I control a small portion of them,

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,759
you won't achieve your goal.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,040
You should know,

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,959
ruining something

74
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,639
is easier than accomplishing something.

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,959
It's much easier.

76
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,160
No wonder you're Mr. Li.

77
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,879
Even something so despicable

78
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,360
you can make sound so dignified.

79
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,839
A loss is a loss.

80
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,439
Why so much nonsense?

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,279
Lao Qi,

82
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,680
bring the contract.

83
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,600
You're so sure of yourselves.

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,920
Aren't you afraid I'll make a comeback?

85
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,240
You think this is a novel?

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,519
A comeback, really?

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
How are you so sure

88
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,519
there are only 204 theaters in our city?

89
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,279
Who are you people?

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
Manager Zhang, right?

91
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,439
Yes.

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,040
We're here to invest and save your business.

93
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,879
You really came to our aid in our time of need.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,720
Our thirty public welfare cinemas

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,040
were about to close down.

96
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,279
With this funding

97
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,920
we can reopen right away.

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,399
The movie that's about to be screened

99
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,439
I'll arrange it immediately.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,519
I'll sign right now.

101
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,600
Please take a look.

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,160
Not very good.

103
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:45,879
Today,

104
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
214 cinemas in our city

105
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
officially held preview screenings.

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,079
The film starring the famous actress Song Yiran

107
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,279
"Needle Hidden in Embroidery"

108
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,879
The audience was very enthusiastic.

109
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,279
Tickets sold out instantly.

110
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,680
It caused a huge sensation.

111
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,079
This move brought things back to life.

112
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,800
It's quite clever.

113
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
President Li has such a good reputation in the industry.

114
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,399
I believe

115
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,040
he will definitely keep his promise.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,439
Good tea.

117
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
Who does he think he is?

118
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,560
You should be asking me what to do.

119
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,360
What should I do?

120
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,759
How would I know what to do?

121
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,040
Kai, you really have hidden talents.

122
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,439
It's all thanks to Mr. Ye's arrangements.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,439
I just help out by running errands with the guys.

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,879
Mr. Ye.

125
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,519
Thanks for your hard work, Kai.

126
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,399
I've already transferred the money.

127
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
Bring the guys tonight.

128
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,279
Second floor of Wenjun Hotel.

129
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:55,959
I'll take care of it.

130
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,759
No need.

131
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,279
I don't want to owe you.

132
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,480
You don't have to say that to me.

133
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,800
I just think

134
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,279
Kai, you're so capable.

135
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,879
It's a waste for you to be a driver.

136
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,279
I like being a driver.

137
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,879
It's a free job.

138
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,199
Our Wu Wei Films

139
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,120
is missing a marketing director.

140
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,399
Annual salary of one million plus commission.

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Think about it, Kai.

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,399
You just can't stop pretending.

143
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,560
One million.

144
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
Brother Kai.

145
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
This one million.

146
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
How many driving gigs would we have to do for that?

147
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,720
This money isn't just enough for you to live on.

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,360
It could support all of us brothers.

149
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,959
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

150
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,800
Brother Kai, don't be mad.

151
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,959
Back then,

152
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,519
I taught you all these life lessons.

153
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,079
Do you all remember?

154
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,519
Back then, you taught us.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,480
How could we bow and scrape to the powerful?

156
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,279
It would only make us unhappy.

157
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,360
The marketing director position

158
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,560
has been vacant for a while.

159
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,959
A lot of work can't move forward.

160
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,480
Do you think we should hire someone?

161
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,439
No rush.

162
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,959
The person should be here soon.

163
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:18,959
Here.

164
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,279
Come with me.

165
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,319
I'll take you guys to be white-collar workers.

166
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,079
Let's go.

167
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,759
Brother Kai

168
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,439
Call him President Ye

169
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,399
President Ye

170
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,399
President Ye

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,919
I was wrong before

172
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,480
From now on, I'll follow you

173
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,600
The past is the past

174
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,320
Now we're all good brothers

175
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,519
Let's make money together

176
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,320
Come on

177
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,840
Brother Kai

178
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
We used to be in the same business

179
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,879
From now on, we're colleagues

180
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,759
President Ye is impressive

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,799
I admire you

182
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,960
Who do you think you are, Ma San?

183
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,919
Brother Kai, you can't say that

184
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,120
This is President Ma's company

185
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,279
President Ma's last name is Ma

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
My last name is Ma too

187
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,600
Doesn't that make you think of anything?

188
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,720
To tell you the truth, brother

189
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm President Ma's dri

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
ver

191
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
What are you thinking, Brother Kai?

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm the driver, of course

193
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,399
Mr. Feng, you’re here.

194
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Ye Wuming’s film company

195
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,120
is thriving right now.

196
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
It’s getting better and better.

197
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,759
His movie is really eye-opening.

198
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,279
It’s about to start filming soon.

199
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,240
After this,

200
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,480
he’ll be even harder to deal with.

201
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,440
Don’t worry.

202
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
Someone will take action on their own.

203
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,240
They’ll solve this problem openly.

204
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,120
He’s at the peak of his success now.

205
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,679
Who would be willing to act at a time like this?

206
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,919
His enemies.

207
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,799
A deep-seated grudge.

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,159
Enemies who cannot coexist.

209
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,240
One general’s success comes at the cost of countless lives.

210
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,080
Ye Wuming’s master

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,440
was Zhang Tiansi, the last head of the Eight Immortals Fist.

212
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,519
Back when Zhang Tiansi traveled around,

213
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
he defeated many top fighters both at home and abroad.

214
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,799
Some of those experts couldn’t bear the humiliation and committed suicide.

215
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,559
Tell me,

216
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,399
isn’t that an irreconcilable enmity?

217
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,480
It is.

218
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,480
All those disciples and followers are waiting for revenge.

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,279
Who would have thought?

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,519
Zhang Tiansi died three years ago.

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,159
Ye Wuming is Zhang Tiansi’s true successor.

222
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,080
This irreconcilable hatred

223
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,080
naturally falls on him now.

224
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,200
Brilliant.

225
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,879
Once they find out,

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,039
they’ll definitely seek revenge on Ye Wuming.

227
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,879
There are many things

228
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,399
you don’t need to do yourself.

229
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,320
You have to learn

230
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,240
to use others to do your dirty work.

231
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,399
Use others to do your dirty work.

232
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,720
They’re here.

233
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,279
These are the three masters Mr. Feng mentioned.

234
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,480
Why are they dressed so strangely?

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,000
The Eight Immortals Fist belongs to our Nanzheng Kingdom.

236
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,399
I want to take it back myself.

237
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,480
I must use the blood of the Eight Immortals Fist successor

238
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,759
to wash away the shame Zhang Tiansi brought us.

239
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,759
I have only one purpose for coming here.

240
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,399
To kill Ye Wuming.

241
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,080
Or be killed by Ye Wuming.

242
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,200
Yiran, Yiran.

243
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,080
Yiran.

244
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,799
Stop acting.

245
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,840
It's too fake.

246
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,639
Get up.

247
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,600
I prepared for this for a long time.

248
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,480
Why didn't you give me mouth-to-mouth?

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,879
The props are wrong.

250
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,120
We should have used a rope.

251
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,159
Doing mouth-to-mouth with a knife stuck in makes you die faster.

252
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,240
Really.

253
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
That's what it says in the script.

254
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,080
How could they lie like that?

255
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,440
Yiran.

256
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
Don't play this kind of joke on me again.

257
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,600
Wuming.

258
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,960
Don't be mad.

259
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,960
I just wanted you to give me mouth-to-mouth.

260
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:23,879
I'll listen to you.

261
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,879
Today's scene,

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,879
is an important one.

263
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,440
It's about the male lead

264
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,759
being attacked by three top fighters.

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
After a fierce battle,

266
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,840
he manages to escape.

267
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,799
Understand?

268
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,960
Okay.

269
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,840
Mr. Li, sorry to keep you waiting.

270
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,679
Um,

271
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,519
Didn't you say three top fighters would be here today?

272
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,759
These three

273
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,080
are the top martial artists in the world.

274
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,279
As a co-producer,

275
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,679
it wasn't easy for me to get them here.

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,960
This is great.

277
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,679
Alright.

278
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,399
Let's clear the set and get ready to shoot.

279
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,480
Okay, let's go.

280
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,399
All departments, get ready.

281
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,919
Three, two, one.

282
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,120
Bro, are you okay?

283
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,639
Director! Director!

284
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,799
He's not okay, Director.

285
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,799
Take him to the hospital! Take him to the hospital!

286
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,440
Get another stunt double.

287
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,200
Okay, got it.

288
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,679
This is obviously wasting time.

289
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
Is there anyone else who can fight?

290
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,960
Don't we even have a suitable stunt double?

291
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,399
Can we keep filming?

292
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,120
If not, let's wrap it up.

293
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,399
There's no one left.

294
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Say something!

295
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,519
Can you get someone out here?

296
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll do it.

297
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,279
Be careful, junior.

298
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,519
Bastard, you hit so hard.

299
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
No, isn't this just obviously wasting time?

300
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,080
He's like a paper doll.

301
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,000
Time is money, Boss Ye.

302
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,639
Don't you agree?

303
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,840
I thought the Eight Immortals Fist

304
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,039
was supposed to be amazing.

305
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,480
Turns out it's all just useless fancy moves.

306
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,480
Has the Eight Immortals Sect died out?

307
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,720
Where is he?

308
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,279
I'll do it.
