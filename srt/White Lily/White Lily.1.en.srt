1
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,552
Teacher.

2
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,215
You're drinking again?

3
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:14,072
- Haruka.
- Yes.

4
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:18,463
Please, the back!

5
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,744
Yes!

6
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:52,476
Thanks, keep working.

7
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:59,440
Today's programme is a party
by the sponsor, right?

8
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:00,879
Right.

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,059
Although it is quite boring,
but at least I've to show up.

10
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:11,690
If possible, please show up
during lesson sometime.

11
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,021
The students will be very happy.

12
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,568
You can handle it all by yourself, right?

13
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:21,113
They're only amateurs.

14
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:24,392
When will you come back?

15
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:28,146
I will come back later, you sleep first.

16
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:30,286
Yes.

17
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:47,010
Haruka.

18
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,394
Your right hand is
exerting too much force.

19
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,135
Use auxiliary feeling.

20
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,138
This is your bad habit.

21
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:02,945
Sorry... thanks a lot!

22
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,195
Bye!

23
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:09,941
Oh, please take care!

24
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:51,908
- Mrs. Suzuki.
- Yes.

25
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,674
- Any problem with the thickness?
- Yes.

26
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,437
Please pay more attention
to the overall balance.

27
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:58,698
Yes.

28
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,583
- Haruka.
- Yes.

29
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:03,528
Can you examine it for me?

30
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,887
<i>Mrs. Saito, you use too much force,</i>

31
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:13,062
just gently extended it.

32
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,915
Let me show you.

33
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,992
Well, like this...

34
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:29,500
Extend it evenly, then
you have a beautiful outcome.

35
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,605
Oh, it has already started?

36
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:34,711
Ah, so late!

37
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:36,899
Remote control! The remote control!

38
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,507
In recent years more and more
people began to learn pottery.

39
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,105
Right.

40
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:44,832
There is a saying in the pottery world,

41
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,615
“Pinching takes three years,
while molding takes eight years. “

42
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:52,101
Teacher Tokiko is terrible.

43
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:53,514
And many people say,

44
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:57,458
“Pottery is simpler than imagined. "

45
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,988
Recently people of all ages learn it,

46
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:03,256
and pottery is especially
welcomed by young women.

47
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:04,452
I See.

48
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,241
Just like teacher lnui had said,

49
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:08,016
at first many women only want
to try the experience,

50
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,606
and become students...

51
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,542
'DD-

52
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:05,618
would like to drink some more.

53
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,243
Welcome home!

54
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,195
I'm home.

55
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:20,232
This is sale representative, Kao.

56
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,807
What is it?

57
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:29,255
I thought you would like to have dinner...

58
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:32,180
I told you I would come back later,

59
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:35,715
so probably I would have dinner
before returning home, right?

60
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:37,992
Sorry-

61
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:40,646
But it looks delicious.

62
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,070
Just help yourself if you're hungry.

63
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,039
Tasty, fast!"

64
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:55,491
Let's go.

65
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:03,728
Come here.

66
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:52,793
I'm coming.

67
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:17,690
You don't have to see me off.

68
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:20,770
I just come to lock the door.

69
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:39,152
Today's blaze is not strong enough.

70
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,850
So...

71
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,759
sorry to trouble you.

72
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,470
Yes.

73
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,510
Teacher.

74
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:05,106
Teacher.

75
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:19,766
Finger or tongue,

76
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,836
what would you prefer'?

77
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:29,212
You decide it...

78
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,788
Don't look!

79
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:08,157
Teacher.

80
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:02,127
It feels...

81
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,332
terrific!

82
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,803
So...

83
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,643
goodnight!

84
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,809
Good morning.

85
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,633
- Morning.
- Coffee please.

86
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,345
Teacher.

87
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,422
What?

88
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:53,651
I think you should you drink less.

89
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:56,167
I just want to drink.

90
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,332
It's no good for health.

91
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:02,132
It's so tasty!

92
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,523
You...

93
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,541
have interest in pottery?

94
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,924
Ah, no.

95
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,229
Want to learn?

96
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:56,295
Don't exaggerate,

97
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:59,793
he will stay here for a month.

98
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:02,666
<i>I'm Satoru Nikaido.</i>

99
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,005
Mr. Nikaido.

100
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,169
Do you know him?

101
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,206
He's the son of teacher Nikaido.

102
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,571
<i>Satoru:</i>

103
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:15,298
left home after quarreling with
his father when he finished high school.

104
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:17,777
You said you want to
inherit your father's skill.

105
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,299
What are you doing lately?

106
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,744
Playing music with friends,

107
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,146
nothing special!

108
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,535
It makes your father at ease.

109
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,093
Nothing.

110
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,279
Let me see...

111
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:42,601
very nice...

112
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:45,553
fingers of a ceramist!

113
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:47,262
Fingers?

114
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,603
Right!

115
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:51,856
Slender fingers are the best,

116
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:54,854
like this.

117
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:00,698
Washbasin's here,

118
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:03,423
after jiggering, put the excess clay here...

119
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:04,771
How big?

120
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,677
Like that,

121
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:09,190
keep the clay here for next time...

122
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:10,316
NO,

123
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:12,572
I want to know your age.

124
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:14,130
Why do you ask?

125
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:15,869
I know, you're 281

126
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,043
25

127
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:19,881
Really, we're at the same age,

128
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,821
I'm also 25.

129
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,934
I think you're older than me.

130
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,938
I don't mean you're old,
I just think you're more mature.

131
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:31,605
Satoru.

132
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:34,923
I find it, this is for you.

133
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,520
Work clothes?

134
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,855
Put it on!

135
00:21:38,986 --> 00:21:40,832
Here?

136
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,488
No need to be shy, you're a boy!

137
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,257
Wow!

138
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:09,461
You've got a good figure!

139
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:11,882
Don't embarrass me!

140
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,590
His fingers are terrific.

141
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:58,397
It's so exciting.

142
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,970
Here.

143
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,618
So tasty!

144
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:39,580
Mr. Nikaido, where are you staying tonight?

145
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,180
Business Inn in front of the station.

146
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:46,226
Why? Staying here with us will be fine.

147
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:49,410
Haruka, prepare a quilt.

148
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:52,421
Yes.

149
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:57,057
I've suddenly changed to live here...

150
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:58,854
Really?

151
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:01,314
Why should I lie to you?

152
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:03,546
I'm worrying about you,

153
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:07,993
and you're replying not very often lately.

154
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:09,471
Is that so?

155
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,937
I'm sorry.

156
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:13,159
Hey, Satoru.

157
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,422
What?

158
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:17,570
Do you find me annoying?

159
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,418
No, not at all.

160
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,370
Really?

161
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:25,894
If you find me annoying then tell me.

162
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,958
I don't think you are annoying.

163
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:31,574
What's up?

164
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,570
Bye, talk to you next time!

165
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,769
Satoru.

166
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:07,988
What?

167
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,585
You've been here,

168
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:12,975
do you remember?

169
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,917
Are you ok?

170
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:20,358
Teacher'?

171
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:22,070
What?

172
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:24,678
I have a girlfriend.

173
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:30,409
Does having a girlfriend
have anything to do with this?

174
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,807
It's really lovely, so cute!

175
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:49,992
Come here.

176
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,901
Touch me, use these fingers.

177
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:58,291
Teacher'?

178
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,770
Oh, good morning.

179
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,493
Good morning, Haruka.

180
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,574
Good morning.

181
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:06,970
Let me do that.

182
00:29:07,003 --> 00:29:10,184
It's ok, I'll handle it.

183
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,301
I'm sorry.

184
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,740
Ok.

185
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:30,763
Ok.

186
00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:38,629
Last night was a joyous evening.

187
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,978
Teacher, that was...

188
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:46,646
She wouldn't mind at all,

189
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:50,004
because she accepts everything I do.

190
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,695
You've promised me, right?

191
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:56,646
Yes.

192
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:02,188
What's today's programme?

193
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:05,841
Yes.

194
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:14,458
Interview with Gotou at 11,

195
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:17,233
broadcast recording at 2,

196
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:20,831
and dining with Ninomiya
at night is canceled.

197
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:22,396
By the way,

198
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,766
have you got the dress cleaned?

199
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,711
Yes, it has been put into the wardrobe.

200
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:07,216
Do you have a boyfriend?

201
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,169
Why do you ask?

202
00:31:10,198 --> 00:31:11,737
Not for any reason.

203
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:13,501
NO,

204
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,942
I don't have any boyfriend.

205
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:19,721
Are you satisfied with the answer?

206
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:23,218
You don't have any boyfriend...

207
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:24,903
and then...

208
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,726
What then?

209
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,256
You may as well ask me.

210
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:31,124
Do you have a girlfriend?

211
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:33,201
Yes.

212
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:35,921
Although I have a girlfriend...

213
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:40,123
I may change it to Haruka.

214
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,142
Stop joking!

215
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:47,140
You are a strange woman.

216
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:52,795
It's only because we have
different values at things.

217
00:31:55,722 --> 00:31:59,131
What's your relation with teacher?

218
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:01,106
What you do mean?

219
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:05,841
I think there's a limit
for accepting everything.

220
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,701
Anyway, teacher is terrible.

221
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,771
A woman who is so determined on TV,

222
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:16,215
would make such a sound,

223
00:32:17,277 --> 00:32:20,264
and asked me to give her more.

224
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:26,424
Hey, what's the problem?

225
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:29,279
Don't get carried away!

226
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:31,258
Sooner or later you'll be thrown away.

227
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,179
So, you like teacher.

228
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:39,726
Have you ever been thrown away by man?

229
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:42,920
- No.
- But you like woman?

230
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,361
Because she's teacher.

231
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:52,588
I don't like woman,
I only like teacher.

232
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,950
What's wrong, she's wet all over!

233
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:11,661
Get inside, you may catch cold easily!

234
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:12,451
Come on!

235
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:14,822
Tokiko, please take care of her.

236
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,573
Where do you live?

237
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:38,195
We have to contact your parents.

238
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:40,285
Please wait!

239
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:44,846
What happened?

240
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:47,451
Would you mind telling me?

241
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:56,740
It's ok even if you don't say a word.

242
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,763
Anyway»

243
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:01,547
would you like to try some pottery?

244
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:03,121
Well?

245
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:06,566
We are running a pottery workshop here.

246
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,388
Right, Kosuke?

247
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,366
Well, she will be your first student.

248
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:16,873
You don't need any special skill,

249
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,133
just concentrate on talking to the clay.

250
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,936
Talking to the clay?

251
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:26,313
That's right!

252
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:31,107
Open your heart, use your fingers,

253
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:35,046
honestly speak with your heart.

254
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:08,320
Right?

255
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:11,547
Relax your shoulders,

256
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:15,099
you have a completely
different outcome, right?

257
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:25,006
I don't know what happened to you,

258
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:27,864
and you don't have to tell me.

259
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,558
But...

260
00:35:30,474 --> 00:35:33,428
Please believe me,

261
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:38,123
otherwise you can't discover your potential.

262
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:40,185
How's that?

263
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:41,216
Very tasty!

264
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,561
That's great!

265
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:45,917
I have prepared a lot,
you two can have some more.

266
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:51,752
Tokiko's burger is super delicious!

267
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:52,725
Thanks a lot!

268
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:54,530
That's my fiance,

269
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:56,807
doesn't has any problem
at kneading and broiling.

270
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:04,017
- And also soup.
- That's great!

271
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:04,811
Yummy!

272
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:12,321
Teacher, we can't let
Mr. Nikaido stay here.

273
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,187
Why do you say that?

274
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:17,822
He's got a girlfriend.

275
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:19,541
So?

276
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:22,086
It doesn't matter, right?

277
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,496
In short,

278
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:27,792
he's impossible to slay here,
please make him leave.

279
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:32,611
What are you talking about?

280
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,239
Teacher.

281
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:39,016
What happen to you?

282
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:42,061
Don't get obsessed with such a guy.

283
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,606
Teacher.

284
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:54,779
Please look here!
Please look at me!

285
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,291
I'm feeling...

286
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,143
frightened!

287
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,577
I'm scared...

288
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:19,055
that teacher will change back again.

289
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:22,162
What should I do?

290
00:37:23,322 --> 00:37:24,360
So...

291
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,856
Don't go beyond the rules.

292
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,639
Bath water,

293
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:52,849
got it prepared?

294
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:33,079
Right, that's it!

295
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:37,739
Your heart has opened!

296
00:38:37,766 --> 00:38:39,146
Yes I

297
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:44,087
Kosuke is returning home,
we'll show him this.

298
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:45,830
Yes I

299
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:49,521
Yeah, he's returning.

300
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:52,381
He probably has forgotten
to bring the key.

301
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,812
It happens all the time!

302
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:03,024
I'm a Kanagawa's police.

303
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,229
Excuse me, are you Madam lnui, please?

304
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,099
Yes.

305
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,547
Do you know Kosuke Nishino?

306
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,487
Yes.

307
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:17,016
Mr. Nishino was sent to
hospital in emergency,

308
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:21,448
he passed <i>away</i> not long ago.

309
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,457
Teacher, you should at least take some...

310
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:12,479
Teacher'?

311
00:40:23,743 --> 00:40:25,567
Teacher.

312
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:30,815
Look here.

313
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:33,749
Look at me!

314
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:18,614
Haruka.

315
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:27,570
'DD-

316
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:29,980
I'm here.

317
00:41:30,016 --> 00:41:33,196
I'm right here by your side,

318
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,298
and in the future,

319
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,498
as long as it takes.

320
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:49,378
I won't let you be lonely.

321
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,763
I will accept everything of teacher.

322
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:02,912
Really?

323
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,801
I promise.

324
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:30,267
What happens?

325
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:34,400
Don't stop!

326
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:03,287
Satoru?

327
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:04,442
What?

328
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:06,480
You wear the same clothes as yesterday.

329
00:43:06,513 --> 00:43:09,500
This? It's more convenient.

330
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,298
You are big boy.

331
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,885
If you don't have any clothes to change,
I'll buy you some.

332
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:14,853
Really?

333
00:43:14,886 --> 00:43:16,425
I'll choose with you.

334
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,532
That's great!

335
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,208
Teacher, it's about time to leave.

336
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:38,376
Please...

337
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:41,630
are you coming to learn pottery?

338
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:44,527
Oh, no!

339
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:48,047
What, have I told you
to wait outside the entrance?

340
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,496
I just want to see you earlier.

341
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:53,161
This is the girlfriend I told you before.

342
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:55,019
Hi!

343
00:43:55,406 --> 00:43:56,774
Hello!

344
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:01,152
Excuse me, can you help me
cleaning my room?

345
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:02,938
It's full of bad smell of alcohol.

346
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:09,184
Don't you have to practice?

347
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:14,576
Please don't tell teacher about it.

348
00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:15,915
Please!

349
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,205
Satoru.

350
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:18,556
Bus's coming...

351
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:19,878
Please!

352
00:44:27,356 --> 00:44:31,403
Why do you have to live there?

353
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:33,680
You raise the matter again.

354
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:36,390
The girl is lovely,

355
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:39,925
she sure is your cup of tea.

356
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:43,019
And also the Teacher on TV,

357
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:45,247
is also very pretty.

358
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:47,625
Please give me peace.

359
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,278
Don't exert too much force there,

360
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:16,027
as if you are caressing an important person.

361
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,367
Mrs. Kimura, important person.

362
00:46:19,745 --> 00:46:21,911
Must be your husband!

363
00:46:21,939 --> 00:46:26,112
I have not touched my
husband for many years.

364
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:32,304
What are you coming here for?

365
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:35,644
Get out of here if don't want to learn!

366
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:40,682
Hey, Haruka.

367
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,692
You asked why we are here.

368
00:46:43,688 --> 00:46:45,729
We come here just for fun.

369
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,701
At this age,

370
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,170
we never expect to become a ceramist,

371
00:46:52,203 --> 00:46:53,924
and it's also impossible.

372
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:56,799
We are only trying to have fun,

373
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:59,013
isn't it allowed?

374
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:05,614
The way Haruka conducts a class,

375
00:47:06,947 --> 00:47:09,661
to be honest, is very boring.

376
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,882
What do you really want?

377
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:38,109
I'm sorry.

378
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,079
How many times have I told you,

379
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,087
everybody is only learning for fun.

380
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:45,636
Just teach them to enjoy
the joy of pottery will be fine.

381
00:47:45,668 --> 00:47:47,891
- But...
- There's no but I

382
00:47:57,754 --> 00:47:59,430
What's wrong with you?

383
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:02,968
Lately you've been acting strange.

384
00:48:06,378 --> 00:48:07,894
I'm sorry.

385
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:12,205
I'm tired of hearing sorry.

386
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:20,304
Satoru.

387
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:26,157
Starting tomorrow, I'll hand
over the workshop to you.

388
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:30,026
everybody

389
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:33,629
seems to like you.

390
00:48:53,986 --> 00:48:55,845
Don't take it personally,

391
00:48:57,363 --> 00:49:00,921
teacher is not serious about that.

392
00:49:01,794 --> 00:49:03,401
However,

393
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,668
you're so terrible that
you still like these words,

394
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,432
and never hate her.

395
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:13,547
Because I promised

396
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,293
to stay by her side.

397
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:23,885
It's only me,

398
00:49:26,598 --> 00:49:29,312
she couldn't live without me.

399
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,984
Teacher is a good person,

400
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,076
she's always taking care of me.

401
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:47,101
<i>She's a very great 9"'!-</i>

402
00:49:51,494 --> 00:49:53,010
I'm accepting it all.

403
00:49:56,141 --> 00:50:00,485
I was excluded in school or at home.

404
00:50:06,022 --> 00:50:09,020
This is the only place I belong to.

405
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:12,677
I don't think so.

406
00:50:13,183 --> 00:50:15,440
What do you know?

407
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:20,199
In fact,

408
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:25,283
teacher has changed completely.

409
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,878
But that's all my fault!

410
00:50:32,983 --> 00:50:36,220
It's all because of me!

411
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:39,478
You...

412
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:43,172
really like teacher?

413
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:49,264
You think you are constrained by teacher,

414
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:51,963
but actually I think you're constraining her.

415
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:39,695
Hey!

416
00:51:40,522 --> 00:51:43,407
Why only alcohol-free?

417
00:51:44,546 --> 00:51:46,222
Sorry!

418
00:51:47,877 --> 00:51:49,427
Forget it!

419
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,961
Talking to you is useless.

420
00:51:59,441 --> 00:52:01,356
Satoru,

421
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:04,723
can you help me buying
some alcohol drink?

422
00:52:04,756 --> 00:52:05,623
Of course.

423
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:07,594
Thanks!

424
00:52:15,584 --> 00:52:18,332
Who's it?
At this time of the day?

425
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:31,685
It's you!

426
00:52:33,118 --> 00:52:35,238
Please give Satoru back to me.

427
00:52:35,265 --> 00:52:36,565
What?

428
00:52:37,105 --> 00:52:39,111
It's you...

429
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,198
who cheat Satoru.

430
00:52:41,234 --> 00:52:42,945
What are you saying...

431
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:44,221
Satoru.

432
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:47,549
It's me!

433
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,792
Let's come home together.

434
00:52:51,953 --> 00:52:53,252
Akane?

435
00:52:53,418 --> 00:52:54,957
What are you doing here?

436
00:52:54,989 --> 00:52:57,680
You didn't reply the message,

437
00:52:57,713 --> 00:52:59,731
nor answered the phone.

438
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,895
I wonder what's happening,

439
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,847
and I want to find out the reason.

440
00:53:04,272 --> 00:53:05,822
Now I understand,

441
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,246
you're forced

442
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:11,446
to do something.

443
00:53:11,576 --> 00:53:13,275
Actually you want to see me,

444
00:53:13,308 --> 00:53:15,349
but you can't,

445
00:53:15,385 --> 00:53:17,461
I think that's it, right?

446
00:53:18,593 --> 00:53:19,778
I am really sorry.

447
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:21,054
It's okay now,

448
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:22,905
let's go home together.

449
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:25,443
What a troublesome woman!

450
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:33,143
You...

451
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:36,646
really love Satoru?

452
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:41,855
Or you're only satisfying yourself?

453
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,143
In fact you're pitying yourself,

454
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,631
intoxicate yourself in misery, right?

455
00:53:56,168 --> 00:53:57,798
Satoru.

456
00:54:09,602 --> 00:54:12,133
Well,

457
00:54:12,254 --> 00:54:15,070
I'm taking a bath.

458
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,340
I'm sorry to disturb everyone.

459
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:24,801
<i>I'm...</i>

460
00:54:27,658 --> 00:54:30,748
just like her.

461
00:54:32,471 --> 00:54:36,279
Pitying myself,

462
00:54:37,247 --> 00:54:39,288
intoxicate myself in misery,

463
00:54:40,071 --> 00:54:42,647
or submerge myself in grief.

464
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:44,867
Haruka.

465
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:50,396
I think...

466
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:54,255
you should leave here.

467
00:55:12,723 --> 00:55:16,166
You hate me so?

468
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,902
'DD-

469
00:55:20,544 --> 00:55:22,950
I can't betray teacher.

470
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:29,393
You've got to think for yourself.

471
00:55:31,457 --> 00:55:32,859
Me?

472
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:35,248
My own feeling?

473
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:02,604
Sorry-

474
00:56:02,796 --> 00:56:04,711
Am I disturbing you?

475
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:06,952
Teacher.

476
00:56:08,085 --> 00:56:10,479
So while I'm not around,

477
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,369
you both are enjoying this.

478
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:20,563
Teacher!

479
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,851
No, it's not like that!

480
00:56:24,878 --> 00:56:27,785
Obviously you're betraying me.

481
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:30,792
No, it's not like that!

482
00:56:30,823 --> 00:56:32,876
That's a misunderstanding.

483
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:34,614
That's enough.

484
00:56:35,214 --> 00:56:38,771
You both get out of here, now!

485
00:56:40,755 --> 00:56:42,271
I don't want to.

486
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:46,738
Please let me stay.

487
00:56:50,071 --> 00:56:51,782
Teacher...

488
00:56:52,778 --> 00:56:55,309
is my whole life.

489
00:56:56,431 --> 00:57:00,376
I want to stay with teacher forever, please!

490
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:25,878
In that case,

491
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:32,431
continue on what you've started.

492
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,392
What?

493
00:57:38,911 --> 00:57:42,240
What were you planning to do?

494
00:57:44,698 --> 00:57:46,682
Do it here before me.

495
00:57:58,154 --> 00:57:59,818
You have said,

496
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:04,639
you'd accept everything of me, right?

497
00:58:11,106 --> 00:58:13,044
Didn't you promised me that?

498
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:17,669
Teacher.

499
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,530
Satoru,

500
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:25,288
flows

501
00:58:26,685 --> 00:58:27,904
make it with her.

502
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:31,440
- We ain't that...
- Haruka,

503
00:58:32,973 --> 00:58:35,127
you ask him for it.

504
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:10,353
Please take me.

505
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:15,999
I can't hear it.

506
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:21,344
Please take me, please.

507
00:59:21,737 --> 00:59:23,561
No, don't!

508
00:59:28,507 --> 00:59:30,513
Ok,

509
00:59:31,796 --> 00:59:34,669
take off your clothes now.

510
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:15,718
Stop it.

511
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:18,489
Why do you stop?

512
01:01:14,497 --> 01:01:16,822
Look!

513
01:01:18,537 --> 01:01:21,661
What a beautiful body!

514
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:29,521
'DD-

515
01:01:30,297 --> 01:01:32,680
love it.

516
01:01:45,057 --> 01:01:47,269
This girl

517
01:01:48,526 --> 01:01:51,889
has only made it with me.

518
01:02:17,774 --> 01:02:19,826
Indeed,

519
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:24,023
it's so wet!

520
01:02:25,988 --> 01:02:28,667
You say I'm your everything,

521
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:32,788
in the end you want a man.

522
01:02:36,402 --> 01:02:38,249
No, it's not like that.

523
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:48,829
So, what's it like?

524
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:53,636
I only want teacher,

525
01:02:55,263 --> 01:02:57,167
just teacher alone.

526
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:02,413
So let me see your determination.

527
01:03:13,616 --> 01:03:15,508
Is it a good idea?

528
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:21,054
Hurry up!

529
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:24,264
Don't keep a woman waiting!

530
01:04:22,189 --> 01:04:23,865
Teacher...

531
01:04:25,126 --> 01:04:26,893
teacher.

532
01:05:34,605 --> 01:05:36,007
What's wrong?

533
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:41,494
This is weird.

534
01:05:41,785 --> 01:05:44,179
It softens!

535
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:47,015
It's no good!

536
01:05:53,807 --> 01:05:55,244
In that case,

537
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:58,960
I'll make it hard again.

538
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,046
Teacher, please stop.

539
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:38,983
Look,

540
01:06:39,732 --> 01:06:42,286
does it get hard?

541
01:06:46,177 --> 01:06:47,876
Haruka,

542
01:06:49,164 --> 01:06:50,852
use your mouth.

543
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,959
No.

544
01:06:56,986 --> 01:06:59,118
Come on!

545
01:07:00,137 --> 01:07:02,030
Teacher, please don't!

546
01:07:02,209 --> 01:07:03,999
- Come on!
- Don't!

547
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:05,382
Come on!

548
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,236
That's right!

549
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:30,562
That's great!

550
01:07:31,864 --> 01:07:33,278
Right!

551
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,000
That's right!

552
01:07:41,652 --> 01:07:43,032
What are you doing?

553
01:07:43,488 --> 01:07:44,902
Akane...

554
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:49,078
Satoru.

555
01:07:49,404 --> 01:07:51,832
What are you doing with that girl?

556
01:07:54,847 --> 01:07:56,477
It's really queer!

557
01:07:57,847 --> 01:07:59,683
All of you are crazy!

558
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,032
Go back!

559
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:05,440
Satoru.

560
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:07,143
Look here.

561
01:08:08,258 --> 01:08:09,923
Look at me.

562
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:13,721
I'm prettier!

563
01:08:14,444 --> 01:08:15,608
Stop it!

564
01:08:16,246 --> 01:08:19,119
It's disgusting, let me go!

565
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:27,589
I"..-

566
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:29,927
die for you!

567
01:08:34,372 --> 01:08:35,877
Stop this!

568
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:47,774
What a troublesome woman.

569
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,539
Die if you want to.

570
01:08:55,085 --> 01:08:57,810
You don't realise the meaning of death!

571
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:22,425
Haruka.

572
01:09:27,811 --> 01:09:29,567
Haruka!

573
01:09:34,293 --> 01:09:36,106
Haruka!

574
01:10:32,883 --> 01:10:34,616
Haruka.

575
01:10:39,825 --> 01:10:41,648
It's been a long time.

576
01:11:45,261 --> 01:11:47,188
Teacher.

577
01:11:48,574 --> 01:11:50,501
Please look here.

578
01:11:58,201 --> 01:11:59,467
Look at me.

579
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:05,244
Look here, look at me!

580
01:12:23,354 --> 01:12:25,589
Please make me feel good.

581
01:12:27,105 --> 01:12:28,895
Thank you!

582
01:14:40,627 --> 01:14:42,382
Look at me.

583
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:45,029
Take a good look at me.

584
01:16:43,507 --> 01:16:44,944
So,

585
01:16:47,735 --> 01:16:49,925
are you coming back?

586
01:16:57,429 --> 01:16:59,550
Ever since you went away,

587
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:01,540
this home,

588
01:17:02,144 --> 01:17:04,538
is filled with emptiness.

589
01:17:21,575 --> 01:17:23,160
The rain...

590
01:17:23,702 --> 01:17:25,856
seems to have stopped.

591
01:17:31,053 --> 01:17:32,421
Teacher.

592
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,688
Thanks a lot!
