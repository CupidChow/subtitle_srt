1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,882
(This episode contains scenes of school violence)

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,592
(This may cause discomfort to some viewers)

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,393
People become afraid when they lose trust

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,064
Or will you lose trust after becoming afraid?

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,025
Whatever the reason

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,609
I hope to see changes

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,822
Do you really think this plan will work in Korea?

8
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,785
Korea is no longer a collection of scattered backward villages

9
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,580
The current level is different from the past

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,291
Level?

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,127
Do you know what Korea is like now?

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,381
You can get drugs anytime, anywhere if you want.

13
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,467
It used to be a drug-free country

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,597
And half of the country's population
They already know how to use guns.

15
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,349
That's the country where it's easiest to implement the plan.

16
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,268
Easiest?

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,728
That's right

18
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,522
South Koreans are in a psychological crisis

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,526
The whole society is full of contradictions

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,987
They just need someone to help them pull the trigger

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,162
"Beyond the Gun"

22
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,960
Waiting

23
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,259
Bro, you called me?

24
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,969
Yeah, sit over there.

25
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,638
Um

26
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,228
Just ten thousand

27
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,318
You bastard!

28
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,779
Are you dealing with guns?

29
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,739
No

30
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,199
are you sure?

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,159
What's wrong? Why are you suddenly

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:01:59,911
Pick up the gun?

33
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,373
You think it's ridiculous too, right?

34
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,415
Me too

35
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,335
A cop I know suddenly came over.

36
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,045
Asked me if I touched the gun

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,506
I'm so fucking speechless

38
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,590
Cop?

39
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,467
This is just crazy, right?

40
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,387
I thought so too.
But he handed me this

41
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,228
Who is this?

42
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,230
How would I know?

43
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,901
Didn't you ask this before?
Do I know your brothers?

44
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,072
I don't know your brothers at all
That's why I asked you

45
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,950
He... he is not my little brother

46
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,495
Tell me honestly so that there won't be any trouble in the future

47
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,708
Why would I lie to you, brother?

48
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,673
Are you sure he isn't?

49
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,176
right

50
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,762
OK!

51
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,724
Oh, damn, I worried for nothing.

52
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,226
That cop is not an ordinary person

53
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,896
Got it, go away.

54
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,793
We were discovered

55
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,546
Find the gun as soon as possible

56
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,924
What did that guy say, brother?

57
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,051
He said he was not his younger brother

58
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,427
He said no?

59
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,889
Wow, this bastard is actually lying

60
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,952
- Hey, ouch
-OMG

61
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,411
Oh my god, why is the floor so slippery?

62
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,664
We are having dinner in Guizhen.
I'm so sorry, what should I do?

63
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,416
Hey, candid photographer

64
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,836
Your life will be ruined soon.

65
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,798
Stay tuned

66
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,639
This bastard is really

67
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,102
Hello!

68
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,019
Stop it!

69
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,605
What's going on?

70
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,232
Oh, teacher.

71
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,401
The floor here is too slippery

72
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,362
Why don't you be more careful?
How could it become like this?

73
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,280
Are you okay?

74
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,533
Teacher, do you think I'm okay?

75
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,119
Hey, what's your attitude?
The teacher is asking because he is worried about you...

76
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,621
This stinky boy

77
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,081
Hey, I'm talking to you!

78
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,542
Um?

79
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,961
Hey Park Kyu Jin!

80
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,673
What are you doing, little brat?
Why don’t you come over to me?

81
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,174
Hey Jin Pei, wait for me

82
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,467
Hey, the zero-point retard is here

83
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,613
As the investigation deepened
New addresses are beginning to emerge

84
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,533
elder brother

85
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,076
Look at this

86
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,371
These address books have the same number of rows.

87
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,915
That means there are as many guns as there are addresses.

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,085
How many contacts do we have now?

89
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,587
More than 20

90
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,214
well

91
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,718
So there are at least hundreds of weapons.
It has been sent to all parts of Korea.

92
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,362
(Are you looking for that address book?)

93
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,418
(certainly)

94
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,010

95
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,851
(Okay, if you need it, come find Wenbai
I’m bored anyway)

96
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:49,367
Boss, the patrolman
I have been investigating your background recently.

97
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,369
Should we get rid of him quietly?

98
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,787
Leave him alone

99
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,498
I have something else to confirm.

100
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:56,958
knew

101
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,752
It's time for you to leave

102
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,132
good

103
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,510
Then let's go meet some friends.

104
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,489
Everything is ready

105
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,809
Heard

106
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,312
You scolded Sung Joon to his face.

107
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,522
Throwing a chair?

108
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,440
so what?

109
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,610
Aren't you afraid?

110
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,488
He will get worse later.

111
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,574
You are also a waste
I endure it every day, so I get bullied.

112
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,659
You are really amazing

113
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,372
Your fist is also very hard

114
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,667
ah

115
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,462
- I'm so sorry I...
-It doesn't matter

116
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,590
I know your mind best, don't I?

117
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,592
Thank you, Kui Jin

118
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,345
So what I mean is

119
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,930
If you are also frustrated and annoyed

120
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,140
Whether it's using fists or cursing

121
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,768
Always try to do something, don't just sit there and wait for death

122
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,394
Can I?

123
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,355
Hey you bastard!

124
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:48,861

You bastard

126

-What's going on?
- It's so fucking funny.

127
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,741
- Take a good photo quickly
- You're good at fighting.

128
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,332
Hey, get out of the way, you bastard.

129
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,250

Come here, motherfucker!

132
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,091
You bastard

133
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,929
You bastards!

00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,977
-Is this it?
-What?

136
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,978
Wow, really.

gun!

140
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,555
Get out of the way!

141
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,865
Isn't that an airgun bullet?

142
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,450
It's an airgun bullet.

143
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,201
I thought it was true

144
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,119
Who did it?

145
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,963
Where? Fuck!

146

You guys are a bunch of street thugs.

147

How dare you cause trouble?

Wow, it’s hot!

Excuse me

154
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,815
Can you teach me how to use a gun?

155
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,943
Hold your breath

Mom, I'm not a child anymore, don't do this

00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,881
I mean, when did you grow so tall?

175
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,384
I failed to fulfill my responsibilities as a mother.

176
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,849
Mom, how have you failed in your duties?

177
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,185

No one seems to be able to enter the warehouse yet

190
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,974
It's really depressing.

191
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,311
That's not it

192
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,270
(The pattern is incorrect)

193
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,230
Not this one either

194
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,900
Oh shit!

195
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,445
Hey, since you brought your phone with you
Shouldn't you give me the password?

196
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,071
sorry

197
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,740
Sorry ass you bastards!

198
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,325
A bunch of bastards

199
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,663
(No caller ID)

200
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,584
Hello

201
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,419
Hello

202
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,839
"Hello?" Who is this guy?

203
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,883
Why do you have to speak English? Damn it.

204
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,718
What's wrong, brother?

205
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,097
Are you... a foreigner?

206
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,183
Can you speak English?

207
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,852
A little bit of English

208
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,979
Yes, I'll go now.

209
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,857
Box? What box?

210
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,359
“Red label”?

211
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,194
Hey, go find the box with the red label.

212
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,197
Brother, all the cartons here are taped.

213
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,953
There are a lot of red labels.

214
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,874
Wow, President Kim, that bastard

215
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,668
What on earth is he hiding?

216
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,878
What? Damn it.

217
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,923
How did this get here?

218
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,842
Did you find the gun?

219
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,221
Is this a real gun?

220
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,265
If you want to know
Just shoot yourself in the head.

221
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,811
Don't be like this. I believe you.

222
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,648
Where do all the guns reported in the news come from?

223
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,732
OMG

224
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,484
But

225
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,279
Because you killed President Kim
Now the guns are piled there.

226
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,240
President Kim is gone

227
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,159
This makes it difficult for me.

228
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,705
But the funny thing is

229
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,583
Someone is trying to find those guns.

230
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,503
Who? Who's looking for these guns?

231
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,130
Gu Zhengwan?

232
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,047
Gu Zhengwan?

233
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,174
How do you know Gu Jung Man?

234
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,846
I'm not sure what Gu Jung-man wants to do

235
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,432
Think about it from your own perspective.

236
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,018
With these guns

237
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,311
What would you like to do?

238
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,190
Hello?

239
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,818
damn it

240
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,266
We have found sufficient evidence.

241
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,353
Then we'll execute it right away

242
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,031
Dear seniors,

00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,075
Hello

244
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,703
Could you please just remember one thing?

245
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,706
Can I take a photo after delivering the package?

246
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,211
Be sure to take photos
Then send us the photos

247
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,837
We can remit the money to you.

248
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,714
-Okay?

00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,174

00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,018
Okay, take it.

253
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,397
The goods are ready

254
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,566
Yeah?

255
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,987
It's great that Korea has so many delivery options.

256
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,288
Come back early today

257
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,457
I will buy you your favorite meat

258
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,055
Didn’t you say that you are not a child anymore?

259
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,182
When I say I'm going to buy you some meat, you become so gentle

260
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,936
-I'll be back
-Um

261
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,365

Headed to the school with a gun

262
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,536

Nine years old

264
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166

Yes

266
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,420
How are they doing?

267
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,422
I just watched from a distance for a while

268
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,093
Why?

269
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,678
If they don't remember me

270
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,555
I feel so miserable.

271
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,268
All right

272
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,814

Is Kyung-sook okay?

288
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,412
Well, thanks to you

289
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,456
Where is the address book?

290
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,752
Give

291
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,172
I usually don't trust others.

292
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,592
But I think I can trust Patrolman Li.

293
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,640
But there is one thing I am worried about.

294
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:08,976
here

295
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,271
There is also a high school student

296
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,733
Don't you want to go and have a look?

297
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,447
Keep a close eye on Xu Yongdong before he comes.

298
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,824
I know.

299
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,499
Did that guy Yongdong fall into the manhole cover when he was buying bread?

300
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,584
Hello

301
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,920
I'll finish it.

302
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,047
-Oh shit
- This guy doesn't carry cigarettes every day

303
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,842
Hey, just buy some for yourself, you little brat

304
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,345
What's wrong?

305
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,264
Still angry?

306
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,390
Fucking Turtle Town

307
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,060
The head teacher always stares at him
I can't do anything to him now.

308
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,689
Hey, you better be careful at this time.
If you're not careful, you'll be doomed.

309
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,150
I just feel ashamed, you idiot

310
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,777
Who locked the door?

311
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,112
Goodbye, teacher

312
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,115
-Hey, how do you get to the bathroom?
- Teacher, I need to go to the bathroom.

313
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,241
Hey, pull it.

314
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,492
I said I needed to go to the bathroom.

315
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,119
What's wrong?

316
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,829
Teacher, he did it!

317
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,830
What's going on?

318
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,416
- It seems to be locked from the outside
-How come?

319
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,417
Wasn’t it locked by the teacher?

320
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,418
These little bastards

321
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,086
Who did this?

322
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,046
Break it!

323
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,589
Is it funny?

324
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,682
Hey Park Kyu Jin!

325
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,894
What happened to the monitor?

326
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,438
The head teacher asked you to go to the Academic Affairs Office, so go and have a look

327
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,739
How should I teach this bastard a lesson?

328
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,990
Hello

329
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,951
How about that?

330
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,912
Damn, it's so dirty

331
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,872
-What is it?
-Oh shit

332
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,790
Hello

333
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,958
Go get the bag from Turtle Town.

334
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,586
Yes, sir!

335
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:08,929
Hey bro

336
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,515
Why don't you answer the phone? Where are you now?

337
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,808
I'm looking for a gun.

338
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,267
Go to Zhengyi High School now

339
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,145

341
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,030

I'm not sure what his name is

351
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,887
