1
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,432
Now we are simultaneously arresting President Kim.

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,058
and gun confiscation operations

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,104
Me and the SWAT team
Arrested Gu Jung-man and President Kim at the nightclub

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,356
Senior Li Dao will raid the hardware store mall

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,525
Confiscate all guns

6
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,404
But the hardware store on the shopping street
Call the SWAT team in.

7
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,489
Isn't it enough to use more to control less?

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,242
There are too many risk factors in doing this.

9
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,786
As you can see around the hardware store shopping street
There are large apartment complexes

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,330
Dense commercial areas even have subway stations

11
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,959
Citizens are already anxious about guns

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,544
If a large-scale gunfight breaks out

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,172
It may cause greater confusion

14
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,259
You should also know about this action

15
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,679
Must be more secretive and quick

16
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,474
But Kong Shihao actually cooperated so well
Is he trustworthy?

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,976
Is that guy planning something?

18
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,352
I expected it too

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,689
As long as I catch Kong Se-ho and Gu Jung-man in the nightclub

20
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,567
Senior Li Dao will immediately enter the hardware store shopping street

21
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,944
I will first confiscate the guns that Zhengwan has obtained.

22
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,405
Then look for evidence related to President Jin

23
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,034
Okay, bring President Jin here before tomorrow

24
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:41,101
(Gyeonginse Police Station)

25
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:46,106
"Beyond the Gun"

26
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,441
- Oh my god, here
- Come on, oh my god.

27
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,818
- Is everything loaded?
-Um

28
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,404
Keep up with them

29
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,375
Everyone is in place before Gu Zhengwan arrives

30
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,022
Hey bro

31
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,609
We are all ready, but Gu Zhengwan has not arrived yet.

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,486
I'll contact you when he arrives.

33
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,530
(Yakham Tourist Hotel)

34
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,908
What are these guys doing? What's taking so long?

35
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,671
How are your fingers?

36
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,593
Of course I also applied hand cream, it's so soft

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,680
You put on this dress
Go and have a long-awaited chat with Minister Kong

38
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,765
Please say hello to him for me too.

39
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,642
I'll say hello to him for you.

40
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,227
Definitely

41
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,263
What the fuck is going on?

42
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,223
Hello!

43
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,309
How about this thing?

44
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,603
Isn’t it amazing?

45
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,777
Wait a moment

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,696
Wait a minute, Zheng Wan, listen to me, Zheng Wan!

47
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,567
Gu Zhengwan's vehicle has arrived.

48
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,319
Already out

49
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,948
Everyone, check your guns and bulletproof vests.

50
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,491
Cheer up

51
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,249
Are you okay?

52
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,587
if

53
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,965
I can get out alive

54
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,968
I'll treat you to a big meal

55
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,553
What if not?

56
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,554
What if not?

57
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,350
Then let Zheng Wan treat you to a meal. I am leaving now.

58
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:13,896
goodbye

59
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,915
Oh come in

60
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,470
Nice to meet you, Minister Kong, you stinky bastard

61
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,639
Didn't you ask me to give you my finger?

62
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,974
Here, bye.

63
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,771
Oh shit

64
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,522
You stabbed me in the back

65
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,900
Now you are being tricked by Zheng Wan again

66
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,485
Isn't it funny? Huh?

67
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,865
Shooting inside

68
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,909
SWAT team begins to enter

69
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,371
Two people in a group will start the internal search from the first floor

70
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,883
Fuck you bastard!

71
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,011
Damn, you scared me. Why are you shouting?

72
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,471
Big Brother

73
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,057
Did you get your fingers?

74
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,351
Where are you?

75
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,144
It doesn't matter where I am

76
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,147
Did your meeting with President Kim go smoothly?

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,318
I don't know what a "money tree" is.

78
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,865
But during this time you ordered me to work and owed me money
I want it back

79
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,283
What?

80
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,743
Oh, I'm sorry.

81
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,371
And those cigars are made in Cuba

82
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,042
To be honest, it really doesn't suit you.

83
00:06:59,043 --> 00:06:59,877
Gu Zhengwan

84
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,880
You actually backstabbed me?

85
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,305
That told me to believe him
What about the bastard who ended up looking for the police behind your back?

86
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
Hey you bastard!

87
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,331
let's go

88
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,794
Oh shit

89
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,386
Stop shooting, asshole.

90
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,058
Let's die together you bastard

91
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,463
What? This isn't Gu Jung Man

92
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,173
Isn’t this President Kim?

93
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,345
What did you say? What do you mean? Where is Gu Jung-man?

94
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,804
perhaps

95
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,473
Did he go that way?

96
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,141
Got it, I'll go check it out

97
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,715
Wait for me to give you a signal

98
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,759
Waiting for the signal

99
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,526
How is big brother?

100
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,986
Come and have a look

101
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,535
Bro, what the fuck is this?

102
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,706
These are your retirement funds, to be divided equally among you.

103
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,207
Let's live like everyone else.

104
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,209
Buy a suit to wear too!

105
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,592
Wow, there is more!

106
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,511
Take your share, you little bastard.

107
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,512
- This child
-OK

108
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,765
- It's dangerous here, leave now
-yes

109
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,747
Big Brother

110
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,458
The cops rushed in murderously.

111
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,126
OK

112
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,462
You guys come here soon

113
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,663
-Hello, is there a fire?
- Fire? No

114
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,914
I'll go to the car and come back.

115
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,807
Seungkyung goes to confirm

116
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,266
Is that a cop?

117
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,268
If there is a fight, I will go in first

118
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,229
The rest of the team will reunite after backup arrives.

119
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,857
Hey, collect it quickly!

120
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,734
-Hey Bao Bao!
-Give it to me!

121
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,820
-Set it here
- Put it in

122
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,226
Oh shit

123
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,206
Go fast

124
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,112
Shooting at hardware store

125
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,072
If you find the suspect, please shoot him.

126
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,535
Keep driving!

127
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,330
-hurry up!
-knew

128
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,058
Changsoo!

129
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,726
Are you still alive?

130
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,062
Chang Soo

131
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,688
Chang Soo

132
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,325
Junhao

133
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,702
Junhao, we have to go, wake up!

134
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,213
Hmm? Junho

135
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,048
Wake up

136
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,537
Gu Zhengwan's location has been confirmed and he will be arrested immediately.

137
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,977
Recent shooting incidents
All firearms used

138
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,439
All from criminal organizations arrested today

139
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,942
The police said they would do everything they could

140
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,069
Find out the guns that have not been confiscated

141
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,324
Illegal gun circulation
The police caught everything...

142
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,578
Alas, it ended so dully?

143
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,290
It's Jack calling. You should pick up the phone.

144
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,632
The gun was confiscated and is now in the hands of the police.

145
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,718
If South Korean intelligence starts snooping around...

146
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,219
Do you understand my concern?

147
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,973
I don't want the situation to become so chaotic.

148
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,810
You know what? If the CIA finds out
What will be the result?

149
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,563
It's not just South Korea that's in danger

150
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,525
Our business is over! Got it?

151
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,487
We won't let this happen.
We'll take care of it

152
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,449
Take care of everything and go home

153
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,851
You want

154
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,937
Want to see it for yourself?

155
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,378
she

156
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,547
Is she your daughter?

157
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,384
she…

158
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,435
She is not my daughter.

159
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,854
Um?

160
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,148
Not my daughter

161
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,192
I know it's hard to do this

162
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,529
But could you please confirm again?

163
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,511
Not my daughter

164
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,778
(My daughter)

165
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,955
(My daughter)

166
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,751
Please

167
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,963
Just answer the phone once, okay?

168
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,258
My daughter brought her bland lunch box again

169
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,510
I didn't ask you to come.

170
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,928
This is health food

171
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,429
You must eat it all.

172
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,806
Got it

173
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,936
She had to move out and live on her own
Talk about needing a "work-life balance" or something like that

174
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,356
But she not only borrowed money from the bank
I also paid a bonus.

175
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,733
-Oh, really.
- Hmm? Who is this?

176
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,945
Oh, isn't this my daughter?

177
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,738
Didn’t Dad tell you to figure it out first?

178
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,865
I have inquired and contacted
But I can't get in touch with you

179
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,700
That's why I came here.

180
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,828
- The police station is not a detective agency
- Never mind.

181
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
Dad's phone call

182
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,252
Just take it again, Shirong.

183
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,741
- OK, I know.
-Um?

184
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,452
- Captain, are you here?
-Well, why are you here?

185
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,871
There is something I need to confirm.

186
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,788
Oh really?

187
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,804
Recently, there has been a lot of trouble because of the gun issue.

188
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,098
You have to take care of yourself too.

189
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,016
Thanks

190
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,228
Take care, Officer

191
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,438
- Contact me later
-Oh well

192
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,565
- Be careful on the road
-Okay, I'm leaving.

193
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,581
welcome

194
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,547
Hey, Sergeant Lee

195
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,716
haven't seen you for a long time

196
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,551
Are you still alive?

197
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,552
how have you been?

198
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,349
Can’t feed you?

199
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,850
Don’t you think it’s not very nice?

200
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,895
We have fought side by side on the battlefield for so long

201
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:33,273
But you only come to me when you need me
It's so sad.

202
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,904
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

203
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,284
If I'm sorry
You should have treated me to a meal before asking me for help.

204
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,204
Forget it, you are not that kind of person. Let me see.

205
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,375
Wow what is this?

206
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,087
It was found among the guns seized at the scene.

207
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,799
This is the latest global positioning system.

208
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,135
This is amazing. This thing also has eavesdropping function?

209
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,099
So it's eavesdropping now too?

210
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,101
No

211
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,438
This chip can only track location

212
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,692
Wait, there are no other devices?

213
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,197
There seems to be no other device

214
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,199
so

215
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,911
This can only track the location

216
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,914
Auxiliary equipment is required for eavesdropping

217
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,377
Assistive device?

218
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,546
Think about it carefully

219
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,799
There must be something else in those guns.

220
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,650
In recent years, a large number of illegal guns

221
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,903
is spreading in areas of civil war and war

222
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,324
The CIA's findings show
The mastermind behind this series of events

223
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,954
The International Rifle Federation
IRU

224
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,291
This large organization
Mainly engaged in trading activities in the black market

225
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:18,170
And will provide
Countries or groups that purchase weapons

226
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,049
Illegal sale and circulation of weapons

227
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,720
In addition, they will also report to the American political circle

228
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,805
and massive lobbying by multinational corporations

229
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,351
Therefore, no one dares to touch them easily.

230
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,270
This is the "two-color eye"

231
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,314
It is known that this person is

232
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,818
Planning and managing the promotion of firearms in South Korea

233
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,028
Chief Person in Charge

234
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,697
How much is currently flowing into South Korea?

235
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,992
Currently, it is estimated that there are about 30,000

236
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,953
What? Thirty thousand?

237
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,247
Before the Liu Zhengtai and Quan Yuancheng incident

238
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
I have never actually used express delivery.

239
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,586
We are tracking
Where and how these guns are kept

240
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,546
and how they spread

241
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,340
But this information is hard to come by

242
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,844
Even if they smuggle guns in
Without express delivery

243
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,099
What method is used?
Sending so many guns everywhere?

244
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,330
So you are here

245
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:39,960
Hello!

246
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,796
Who told you to leave the nurse's station without my permission?

247
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,841
sorry

248
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,176
My shift is over.

249
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,514
I haven't been home this week.

250
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,433
So I wanted to get some clean socks.

251
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,770
Just wash it and put it on again

252
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,481
Have you thrown reason out the window?

253
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,984
It's all because of you that I'm being scolded now

254
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,194
Get out now

255
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,780
Clean the drip pole and trolley

256
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,993
Everything you do makes people so angry

257
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,872
If your brain isn't working well, do more physical work!

258
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,458
Nurse Yoo-jin, shall we go?

259
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,460
damn it

260
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,045
Just looking at that face makes me mad

261
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,963
Really

262
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:08,965
Coming?

263
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,765
If everyone had a gun
What will become of South Korea?

264
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,683
What?

265
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,435
Aren't you curious?

266
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,813
What do you mean…

267
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,780
The most infuriating and humiliating

268
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,907
After all, we are still human

269
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,743
Selfish and rude person

270
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,829
But if you have a gun

271
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,749
They will undergo strange changes.

272
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,252
so

273
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,506
Do you mean to change the world with guns?

274
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,343
This is actually impossible...

275
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,476
Do you know the true power of this gun?

276
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,021
I just need

277
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,858
Gently pull the trigger on this 5mm

278
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,989
The sound of gunfire will soon be heard 500 meters away

279
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,950
Create fear in people's hearts

280
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,912
And no matter what method

281
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,623
It will cause people to react

282
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,585
But if there is more than one person

283
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,130
But what would happen if a hundred people opened fire?

284
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
Or a thousand people?

285
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,639
Or ten thousand people?

286
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,769
A moment...

287
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,608
And unconsciously

288
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,527
This fear will become the new order

289
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,294
South Korea is a country that is easily influenced by emotions
To get close to people here

290
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,297
We must first let those

291
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,759
People with grievances shoot

292
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,470
Let everyone resonate with this anger

293
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,725
So you only need to do one thing

294
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,437
Take good photos

295
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,773
Let everyone see clearly

296
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,650
The power of this gun

297
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,739
Who are you?

298
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,205
It doesn't matter who you and I are.

299
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,251
What's important is what I do next

300
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:58,134
The world will change forever

301
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,606
If I guessed correctly

302
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,777
Every gun should have this chip installed

303
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,405
So they can continue to monitor everyone.

304
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,492
If you say this

305
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,704
What exactly is that assistive device?

306
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,714
-Hey bro
-Yeah, it's me

307
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,718
The suspects in the shooting
Is there anything else in common besides the address book?

308
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,013
Nothing else except the phone being hacked.

309
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,390
cell phone…

310
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:57,360
This is the team leader.
My superior when I was in the army was Patrolman Li Dao

311
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,780
Patrolman Lee Dao

312
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,616
After determining the target location, IRU

313
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,036
Will leave bullets at the target location to announce the start

314
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,957
This is a signal to raze it to the ground with guns.

315
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,875
senior

316
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,335
Before the Exam Wing shooting

317
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,380
Bullets were found in a nearby attic.

318
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,674
Do you remember that incident?

319
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,301
senior!

320
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,598
He has these?

321
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,558
It must be the bullets that were not declared.

322
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,685
What was the deceased's occupation?

323
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,520
The deceased had a criminal record

324
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,980
Twenty or thirty years ago

325
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,732
The child who was once thrown into the baby box

326
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,234
Sold to foreign brokers

327
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,157
Who are you?

328
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,700
haven't seen you for a long time

329
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,870
Um?

330
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,830
Huh?

331
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,582
I ask you who you are!

332
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,423
You really haven't changed at all.

333
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,844
Make a good fortune

334
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,722
I'll look at AB type...

335
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,265
Hello!

336
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,184
Hello, it's you!

337
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,560
Come over here

338
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,562
Um

339
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,405
It turns out that the bullet that Patrolman Li Dao found in the attic

340
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,368
He intends to
A signal to raze to the ground the country that abandoned them

341
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,085
He will express his intentions in any way.

342
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,422
There must be a reason for deliberately approaching Patrolman Li Dao.

343
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,176
I don't know about the others

344
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,058
This was found from the guns of Gu Zhengwan's gang.

345
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,437
All guns sent out have tracking devices hidden in them.

346
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,150
So they use this
To grasp the location of the man holding the gun?

347
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,235
I think so

348
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,195
This is the latest positioning instrument

349
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,907
As long as the auxiliary device is installed
After activation, it can not only monitor but also eavesdrop.

350
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,452
How about we reverse-trace the device?

351
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,620
Reverse tracking?

352
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,621
You should also know

353
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,707
If we look at the chips in confiscated guns

354
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,418
You may find that they all have common signals

355
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,130
Then the signal originates from
Maybe it's their base.

356
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,507
Maybe it is like this

357
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,135
Um what?

358
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,553
-Um?
-What?

359
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,680
-What's going on?
-That is...

360
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,806
-Confirm the following screen
-Two-color eyes

361
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,724
-What?
-Who is it?

362
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,354
-Quickly check the hacker's intrusion method
-yes

363
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,856
Check the server

364
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,773
Yes I know

365
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,985
Many people are using mobile phones
So it's hard to determine

366
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,238
Tracking location

367
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,954
Team leader, it seems that someone here also has a gun

368
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,498
Immediately put your hands on your head and stand up from your seat.

369
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,417
Get up quickly!

370
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,628
Go to the back

371
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,796
Don't touch anything.

372
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,797
Put your hands on your head

373
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,342
OK, please move to the wall.

374
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,676
how?

375
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,347
You haven't seen me for a long time. Are you happy?

376
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,059
I know

377
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,145
You'll find those chips soon.

378
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,440
but

379
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,527
It doesn't matter now.

380
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,782
A gun was found

381
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,285
The Gun

382
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,539
Do you think she's the only one who has it?

383
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,461
Many people in Korea want guns

384
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,297
Everywhere

385
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,634

No. 27 Baizhou Road

389
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,436
I just

390
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,939
I wonder what you would do.

391
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,362
Make a decision quickly

392
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,366

This is the ninth death of the victim.

Despite the victims' cries of

398
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,433
The authorities have only introduced unrealistic countermeasures

399
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,767
Caused dissatisfaction among people

400
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,564
Victims ask authorities
Severe penalties for fraudsters

401
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:45,982
While protecting the victims...

You start talking nonsense as soon as you come in?

426
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,600
Hey, get out now.

427
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,186

428
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,855

Uncle, who are you?

435
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,473
You have squeezed the hard-earned money of the common people.

436
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,977
But I don't feel any guilt

437
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,236

00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,879
I just identified my daughter's body.

443
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,092

So what do you want from us?

447
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,643
Did we kill the person?

448
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,604
It wasn't us who killed him.

Did your daughter ask you to do this?

455
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,914
If you don't want to leave with your dead daughter

456
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,834

What the fuck you crazy bastard

466
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,861
Even if someone dies...

467
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,696
Don't fucking shoot!

468
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,199
You don't feel any guilt at all.

469
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,869
There's really no hope.

470
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,747
