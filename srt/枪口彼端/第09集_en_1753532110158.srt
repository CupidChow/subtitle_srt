1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,888
(Daomyeon Police Station, Gyeonginse Police Station)

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,611
You said you didn't want to pick up a gun again.

3
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,115
Why become a police officer?

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,036
Even without a gun

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,748
There are also many ways to protect everyone

6
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,878
Okay

7
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,213
Welcome

8
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,840
Director, let's go in.

9
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,842
Go in

10
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,637
This is Patrolman Seo Jae-hee

11
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,766
-Guardian An Zhiyuan and Superintendent Wu Dahan
-Hello

12
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,771
"Beyond the Gun"

13
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,855
I told you to get out

14
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,817
Oh, I've lost interest in drinking.

15
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,904
Your daughter's death

16
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,698
What does it have to do with us?

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,826
I just identified my daughter's body.

18
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,538
Don't insult my daughter's death.

19
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,040
What the fuck are you talking about?

20
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,501
Get this guy out of here, damn.

21
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,044
So what do you want from us?

22
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,670
What? What do you want us to do?

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,548
Hmm? What do you want from us?
Did we kill the person?

24
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,384
Why are you here?

25
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,719
Did I kill that person?

26
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,763
What do you want us to do?

27
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,808
Apologize to my daughter's portrait

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,437
Apologize? Fuck it.
Did your daughter call you like this?

29
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,649
If you don't want to leave with your dead daughter

30
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,985
Just shut up and get out of here you asshole

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,487
Who is this uncle?

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,488
Damn it, why don’t you get out of here?

33
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,989
Don't worry about it.

34
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,990
- Walk fast
- It's so annoying

35
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,908
Really

36
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,077
Get out of here you bastard

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,339
Where are you going!

38
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,926
damn it

39
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,554
What the fuck you crazy bastard

40
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,180
Even if someone dies

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,434
You don't feel any guilt at all.

42
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,522
There's really no hope.

43
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,732
Please forgive me.

44
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,067
Please spare me.

45
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:31,985
Spare me

46
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,361
What?

47
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,530
Please... please forgive me

48
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,282
-Please
-President

49
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,117
Save me just this once.

50
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,702
I…

51
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,412
Please save me once.

52
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,413
President

53
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,248
Save me once.

54
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,625
Please save me

55
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,043
I beg you

56
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,212
My daughter also begged you

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,092
Why didn't you save her?

58
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,220
Fucking bastard!

59
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,722
Go away, damn.

60
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,489
there…

61
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,074
There's a madman over there with a gun!

62
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,492
Have a gun

63
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,790
That lunatic has a gun.

64
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,890
Oh shit

65
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,479
Please forgive me.

66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,694
Put down the gun!

67
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,698
Please put down your gun!

68
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,833
Please help...help me

69
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,751
Put down the gun!

70
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,421
Please forgive me this time.

71
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,929
But reporter Wang
How do you know chaos is going to happen here?

72
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,848
You don't need to know this, just take good pictures

73
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,896
Hey, shoot there

74
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,986
(A shooting occurred at a bar in Gyeongin City
Police confront suspect)

75
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,532
Please wait a moment

76
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,495
I am Patrolman Li Dao from Daoming Police Station.

77
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,039
I will convince him.

78
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,712
Li Dao

79
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,091
Director

80
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,011
Don't come near me

81
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,232
You know better than anyone that even this

82
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,277
Shirong will not come back alive.

83
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,078
Put down your gun

84
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,957
Yeah, I thought I knew this best.

85
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,757
Catch these bad guys and put them in jail

86
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,469
Then they will be arrested again and imprisoned until they spend the rest of their lives in prison.

87
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,766
It's like redressing the victim.

88
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,228
You've always done this.

89
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,027
wrong

90
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,404
Actually, I don't understand at all

91
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,785
I really don't understand anything

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,794
I finally see the reality now

93
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,713
What the fuck are you doing?

94
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,051
Don't just watch the fun, save me.

95
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,143
Don't Shoot

96
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,105
This is the boundary between the law and us

97
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,817
The law is too far away from us.

98
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,197
sorry

99
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,283
I have made up my mind now

100
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,620
Don't be fooled by these feelings

101
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,248
The first time I picked up a gun

102
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,626
What did you say to me at that time?

103
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,463
Do you remember?

104
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,340
Li Dao

105
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,928
Uncle I

106
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,805
There are other elders

107
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,391
Definitely

108
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,226
Punish that bastard

109
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,228
my mom

110
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,188
dad

111
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,983
And my brother died so tragically

112
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,694
And that person

113
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,571
But he ate the bread with relish

114
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,906
How can this be?

115
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,828
Yes, you are absolutely right, but

116
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,165
If you shoot now

117
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,712
The bad guy got away with it easily.

118
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,840
That kind of bad guy

119
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,717
Should be sent to prison

120
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,928
A lifetime of punishment

121
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,430
wrong

122
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,641
I have to shoot.

123
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,228
This makes it feel more pleasurable

124
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,523
Don't be fooled by these feelings, they are all fake

125
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,235
The pleasure is only temporary

126
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,031
Kill the bad guys

127
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,203
It's a good thing

128
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,541
If that guy dies

129
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,127
What does your future hold?

130
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,923
Your life is totally ruined.

131
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,761
So just trust me this time.

132
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,095
I promise

133
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,348
I will prove it to you

134
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,309
This is the right approach

135
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,644
So Li Dao

136
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,066
Please put the gun down.

137
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,573
In the end, except for sending him to prison
I can't do anything

138
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,368
What does that matter?

139
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,249
Because of the director, I was able to save my life

140
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,086
If even the director gets into trouble

141
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,839
How am I going to survive?

142
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,970
Back to the point
Aren’t you going to take the promotion exam this time too?

143
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,306
I am very comfortable with my current job.
Why get promoted?

144
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,724
no

145
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:25,064
You have age, strength, experience and ability
Tall and handsome

146
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,692
He could have been the sheriff.

147
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,196
You finally put the gun down.

148
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,157
Now this kind of thing keeps happening.

149
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,165
Don't always be in the limelight and do things like this, okay?

150
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,169
I don't want to see you get hurt.

151
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,380
Whether it is body or mind

152
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,966
Please

153
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,136
Gun

154
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,722
Give it to me

155
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,405
Li Dao

156
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
Such a painful thing

157
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,998
How did you endure it at such a young age?

158
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,463
Thanks to you, Director.

159
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,677
(Exclusive report: Police are in a standoff with the suspect)

160
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,350
This is not the result I want to see.

161
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,545
Stand here and take pictures here

162
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,762
Hey Li Dao

163
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,359
Li Dao!

164
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,542
Li Dao

165
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,299
Sorry...

166
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,594
Director!

167
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,120
Well done

168
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,331
Well done

169
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,963
It is the elders who are sorry for you

170
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,676
Sorry, Lee Dao

171
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,445
- Let's go down
-Um?

172
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,490
How can that guy go down with a gun in his hand?

173
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,952
Hey you loser, give me the camera

174
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,328
Oh shit

175
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,563
Remember so far
How many people have died at your hands?

176
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,774
how?

177
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,945
When being a mercenary, there is no distinction between children and adults.
You will shoot without hesitation.

178
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,699
But now

179
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,785
You will kill some people

180
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,163
Save others

181
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,210
Is this what you consider justice?

182
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,424
Because you can't tell the boundaries.

183
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,801
That's how things will turn out.

184
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,225
It's disgusting.

185
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,645
Li Dao

186
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,904
but

187
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,991
At least you're interesting.

188
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,375
Let's wait and see

189
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,420
When you open your eyes
You will enter a whole new world

190
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646

The Republic of Korea is no longer a "gun-free country"

Not enough to control the situation

No, it's too early to say that now.

243
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,367
You still say this after seeing the situation on the scene?

244
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,703
The most important thing now is to understand the exact situation

245

Considering the defendant
The crime was committed under the influence of alcohol

246
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,917
It was a first offense and he showed remorse.

247

"Guns should be allowed"

296

More than half of the people support

You still dare to firmly oppose?

Even if there are no guns in this country
Some people dare to use knives in broad daylight

Can carry guns in schools, hospitals, and kindergartens

316
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,971
So the school teachers and the hospital doctors

317
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,055
You have to carry a gun too.

318

The one who incited everyone to shoot

322
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,396
He should be arrested and put in jail immediately.

People will be afraid and won't dare to take out their guns.

So get everything done before leaving get off work today

343
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,673
but

344
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,842
That's too much.

345
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,761
I have to work the night shift today.

346
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,638
So what if I’m on night shift?

347
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,806
Are you talking back to me?

348
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,768
Besides, is this too much work?

349
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,895
It's because you are inefficient that you have to work so hard

350
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,523
Good to know

351
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,728

352
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,272
How come we meet so frequently?

353
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,316
It must be very boring.

354
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,278
Hey, you're here for the same reason as everyone else.

355
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,655
So just cover your mouth?

356
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,409
The world is changing

357
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,452
You want to stand aside and watch?

358
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,246
We need to change too.

359
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,249
Unless you want to be shot like Minister Kong

360
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,250
Is this a funeral?

361
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,418
how?

362
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,920
Why is the atmosphere so serious?

363
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,548
Aren't you here to buy guns?
If not, I'll leave.

364
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,551

How dare this brat come here...

367
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,149
This country still attaches so much importance to age

368
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,568
What? Why are you so surprised?

369
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,862
Haven't you ever seen someone die before?

370
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,073
Well, now that we have finished watching the excitement
