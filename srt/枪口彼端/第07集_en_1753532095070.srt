00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,718
(This may cause discomfort to some viewers)

3
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,396
Is this the person?

4
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,566
Could you please confirm the other address?

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,859
Okay, tell me.

00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,663
Hmm?

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,875
The address you mentioned has this person

11
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,050
I checked it.

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,843
The address you gave me has this person in it

13
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,137
Oh, I see.

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,664
Oh, really.
You should be happy to see someone.

15
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,673
"Beyond the Gun"

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,698
Is everyone okay?

17
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,283
Are you all okay?

18
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,244
No one was hurt, right?

19
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,578
-Yes
-Yes

20
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,914
Looks like everyone is okay.

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,459
So lucky. Please take the kids out with you.

22
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,377
yes

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,865
Hey, wait a minute.

24
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,742
Hey, Kuijin, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,748
sorry

26
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,003
Sorry, Kuijin

27
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,841
Wait a moment

28
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,104
Although I don't know

29
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,400
What have you been through?

30
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,530
But what you have to do now

31
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,828
It will only hurt you in the end

32
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,748
Don't pretend to understand me

33
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,212
It's too late now

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
It's not too late

35
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,678
If you could tell me about this time

36
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,389
What have you been through?

37
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,729
I should be able to help you

38
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,324
I just want to hear your story

39
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,120
real

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,837
But first

41
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,383
You have to put that gun down.

42
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,052
We can talk

43
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,641
You can, right?

44
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:02,969
That guy

45
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,018
What a jerk.

46
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,854
You have endured for so long

47
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,024
It's really amazing. Kuizhen, you did a great job.

48
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,702
It's amazing that you've endured this long.

49
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,039
here you go

50
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,808
I told you my kid is in there!

51
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,435
I'll explain it later.

52
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,899
Chengjun!

53
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,402
-Oops, what happened?
-Sungjun!

54
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,445
Chengjun, wake up!

55
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,530
-It's mom, look at me.
- It's Daddy, Daddy

56
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,949
What is going on?

57
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,413
Chengjun, cheer up!
Don’t you recognize your parents?

58
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,125
Sung Joon is the dad

59
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,670
Auntie, please don't push me. I'm in danger now.

60
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,971
Kui Town!

61
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,931
Excuse me

62
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:34,143
I am his mother...I am his mother

63
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,771
Kuizhen, let me go

64
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,689
- You can't go in.
- I said I'm his mother

65
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,317
What happened to Kuizhen? Why are you standing there?

66
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,362
Kuizhen, you didn't do anything wrong. Say you didn't do anything wrong.

67
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,448
Hurry up and say you don't have Kuizhen

68
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,701
No, Kuizhen, what should I do!

69
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,121
Kuizhen, why did you get in the police car?

70
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,625
Kuizhen: No, don’t go up!

71
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,253
Kui Town!

72
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,384
Detective Xu

73
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,136
Well, tell me.

74
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,849
The arrest is ready.
All personnel are in place. Do we need to launch a surprise attack?

75
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,725
Wait a moment at your respective locations

76
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,540
Don't worry

77
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,542
I will take you to find Quan Yuancheng

78
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,002
Wait and don't move

79
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,674
Caught

80
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,802
There was only a piece of paper and some bullets inside

81
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,138
Where is that address book now?

82
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:54,974
I threw it away

83
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,269
Those who got the gun

84
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,357
For those people
Guns may be the real justice and a force

85
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,985
There's a high school student here.

86
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,696
Don't you want to go and have a look?

87
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,615
Children nowadays have to hand in their cell phones to school

88
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,579
(Detective Seo of Gyeonginse Police Station)

89
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,331
(Wen Bai was arrested after the incident)

90
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,586
Brother, are you ready to catch me now?

91
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,007
Go grab him now.

92
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,966
knew

93
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,385
Group Two Move!

94
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,188
What?

95
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,272
Where did he go?

96
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,816
Hey where did that guy go?

97
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,529
-Did no one see him?
- I haven't seen it.

98
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,615
- Block the front and side doors first
-Okay, got it, let's go.

99
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,866
Control all entrances and exits

100
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,368
You three come here!

101
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,039
senior

102
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,293
Dongyue Industry just sent
Wenbai's identity investigation data

103
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,754
He is not the same person as the Wen Bai we know

104
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,472
(Dongjin Apartment)

105
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,389
（Subscriber address directory）

106
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,765
(Li Dao)

107
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,683
The so-called Republic of Korea

108
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,895
The title of "gun-free country" has become tarnished

109
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,023
Citizens are concerned about the ongoing terrorist incidents.
Feeling increasingly uneasy...

110
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,399
Unfortunately

111
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,653
Following the recent
After the shooting incident

112
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,280
This time even in high school…

113
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,950
A convenience store in Gyeonggi Province this morning
An armed robbery occurred

114
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,204
The incident happened around 2 a.m.
A convenience store...

115
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,792
The sources of the guns currently in circulation
And the forces behind it are talking about it...

116
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,001
Continuous shooting incidents

117
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,712
As a result, citizens have been asking the government for relevant countermeasures...

118
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,089
Where did the guns come from?

119
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,507
Did you find the source of the gun?

120
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,841
Is it really related to a criminal organization?

121
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,593
-What are the measures to deal with shooting incidents?
-Director

122
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,470
How many more shootings do you think will happen?

123
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,388
Are there any guns out there?

124
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,723
People are worried

125
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,017
Are there more guns?

126
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,646
Or do you not know about this either?

127
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,856
Please do not speculate or make assumptions

128
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,192
Please trust the police and wait patiently

129
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,157
Oh, here he comes.

130
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,118
-Ouch!
-Hello

131
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,373
I got a call from the police today.

132
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,376
Although we are not law-abiding people

133
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,713
But if you want to make a living in Korea

134
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,299
There is one thing you absolutely cannot touch.

135
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,552
That's the gun

136
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,178
Isn’t this better?

137
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,472
What era is it now?

138
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,768
How long can you survive with a knife?
Now is the era of globalization

139
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,605
Violence, fraud, drugs and even murder
Can be settled in court

140
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,233
But not guns

141
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,819
Because the military will intervene

142
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,862
That's right

143
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,782
The moment I picked up the gun
We will be beaten to death like dogs

144
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,832
Damn, if I take a wrong step
I'm going to go all in on my own.

145
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,169
What about the guns in the warehouse?

146
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:49,852
Hello

147
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,148
Call the "Fake Officer"

148
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,357
yes

149
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,610
Is this reasonable?

150
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,904
There are so many people at the scene
You actually let that guy get away?

151
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,363
Are you all blind?

152
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,201
Find that guy immediately, no matter what method you use.
Let him sit in front of me

153
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,995
No matter how many
All the guns in the address book must be confiscated.

154
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,707
If there is another shooting incident,

155
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,584
Did you know that both you and I will be fired?

156
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,836
- It's the Director.
- It's the Director.

157
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,344
Li Dao

158
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,720
You will resume your job from today.

159
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,598
I will take all the responsibilities and join the investigation team.

160
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,187
(Call from Kong Shihao)

161
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,364
Fuck

162
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,282
Damn, I'm really anxious.

163
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,628
Give

164
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,340
This is a real gun

165
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,884
Don't come over here, I'm going to shoot you.

166
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,844
real

167
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,139
Fuck, don't shoot.

168
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,231
Where did this gun come from?

169
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,443
ah

170
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,738
That meth dealer, President Kim
He said he would sell me his nightclub at a low price

171
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,198
So I bought it.

172
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,034
Then I found these in the basement warehouse.

173
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,121
Where is that guy called President Jin now?

174
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,708
I have no idea

175
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,959
When you find these

176
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,961
I even wondered if he was deliberately framing me?

177
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,170
I want to catch him and kill him myself

178
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,256
I couldn't find him at all.

179
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,967
Oh wait a minute

180
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,760
You expect me to believe you?

181
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,345
Ouch, wait a minute.

182
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,597
Hey, look at this.

183
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,390
Check this out

184
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,187
Oh fuck

185
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,398
There is a guy named Gu Zhengwan

186
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,109
Work under me and run errands for me

187
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,862
The guy that Patrolman Li is looking for

188
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,655
It was Gu Zhengwan's subordinate.

189
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,950
I don't know how he knew.

190
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,453
But he's been to the warehouse of the nightclub

191
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,204
And wandering around in front of a warehouse with guns

192
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,415
What are they doing?

193
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,043
He must be looking for a gun.

194
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,669
Do you understand?

195
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,636
Why would you confess all this to me?

196
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,556
There are guns in my business!

197
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,227
The gun is pointed at my head
How could I just sit there and do nothing?

198
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,190
I will help you 100%

199
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,441
So Patrolman Lee

200
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,611
Please don't involve me in such a complicated matter.

201
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,447
I have nothing to do with these guns.

202
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,283
I'm just an innocent citizen.

203
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,452
Okay?

204
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,916
I said, didn’t you take them all away last time?

205
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,293
We? You mean the police?

206
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,756
They all showed their police IDs.
I handed it all over, why are you still bothering me?

207
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,092
-Hello
-Um

208
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,803
Is there anyone else coming here besides us?

209
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,888
No, we are responsible here.

210
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,182
I don't care. You guys can do whatever you want.

211
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,644
We've never been here before.

212
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,771
-Didn't you give it to me?
- So...

213
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,897
- I already gave it to you.
-Wait

214
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
Damn, I'm really going crazy

215
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,194
You have already taken it, what else do you want me to take?

216
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,239
Now this is no joke
If you lie, it will be really bad.

217
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,156
Give us the guns now.

218
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,866
I'm going crazy, damn it.

219
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,909
Forget it, just go.

220
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,786
No sir, you didn't give us a minute to wait.

221
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,538
Sir, wait a moment. Hello, sir!

222
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,961
How many guns were found?

223
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,339
About half of the contacts in the address book have been confiscated.

224
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,257
Only half?

225
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,468
What if a madman starts shooting randomly tomorrow?

226
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,137
sorry

227
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,098
I will mobilize all manpower to find these guns as soon as possible.

228
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,934
What about the guys who stole guns by claiming to be cops?

229
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,894
We are also doing our best...

230
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,607
From now on
The Joint Investigation Headquarters is in charge of this case.

231
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,402
Pass all the investigation materials to them.
Stop caring about it.

232
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,903
Director

233
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,495
(Joint Investigation Headquarters)

234
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,918
The Ministry of Health and Welfare has designated a regional designated hospital

235
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,047
A guide to dealing with gun patients was issued

236
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,049
In response to this, the medical community, centered around local hospitals…

237
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,219
I've heard that eating food made with flour will make your stomach uncomfortable.
I bought some bread again.

238
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,262
Thanks

239
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,765
Are you so stupid that you can't understand what people say?

240
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,603
Graduated from a second-rate university and worked in a university hospital
At least you have to be good at something.

241
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,188
Isn’t it?

242
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,105
yes

243
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,358
How many times do I have to tell her before she understands?

244
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,277
Is he trying to show off that he graduated from a reputable university?

245
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,240
Head Nurse
I'll order your favorite mango shaved ice later.

246
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,283
You have a good eye.

247
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,915
But the head nurse
I'm signing up for a private trainer starting next week.

248
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,666
Can you please not assign me to work the night shift for the time being?

249
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,169
You didn't work much night shift last month, did you?

250
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,213
Head nurse, please

251
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,214
Really

252
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,258
Got it, I'll adjust your working hours

253
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,095
Anyway, there are people working night shifts.

254
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,515
Oh, thank you, head nurse.

255
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,184
I'll order shaved ice now.

256
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,814
I heard that many people now shop in overseas online shopping malls.

257
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,942
Spending sprees on counterfeit guns or accessories

258
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,568
We should also start a public discussion

259
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,363
Is it allowed to use guns?

260
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,115
What are you talking about?

261
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,450
South Korea is a country with the highest security.

262
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,661
How can we openly discuss whether to allow the use of firearms?

263
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,205
So this is a hidden problem.

264
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,998
We have to legislate, institutionalize, and systematize

265
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:45,916
Let this question...

266
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,293
What to do now
Can't draw conclusions right now

267
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,338
In view of the current
Several unprecedented gun-related shootings

268
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,382
If any of you in the audience

269
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,842
Someone has a gun

270
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,263
Please report the case to the nearest police station as soon as possible.

271
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,807
(Fentanyl)

272
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,688
I heard that Kong Shihao is assisting the police in their investigation.

273
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,569
The guns that had been delivered by courier began to move

274
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,696
It has also been confirmed in other regions
Situations where guns are used

275
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,407
What is Gu Zhengwan doing?

276
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,743
He seems to have only got half of the gun so far.

277
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,121
Only half?

278
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,377
The incident has become so serious
Shouldn't something happen now?

279
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,755
We sent it so they could shoot.

280
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,759
Whether it's fighting each other for guns or fighting the police

281
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,138
We have to do something, right?

282
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,522
Do you like it?

283
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,982
This isn't a toy.

284
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,360
This is not a toy, don't play with it, you bastard

285
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,781
Didn't you serve in the army?

286
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,162
Are you fucking crazy?

287
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,541
Wait isn't it?

288
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,876
Oh my god, so handsome.

289
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,504
Ah, I'll say it again. My mouth hurts from saying it.

290
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,424
Why are you so suspicious?

291
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,262
We are the best money launderers in this area. Yes.

292
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:26,266
In stock? Ouch!
Don’t you know that “spot equals cash”?

293
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,353
No matter how dirty the money is, we can wash it

294
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,356
I'll wash it for you, don't worry.
Can you just send it directly?

295
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,779
Ouch

296
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,033
Bro, isn't that a cigar?

297
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,576
Oh, this is the gift I received.

298
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,080
It is said that cigars are a symbol of gentlemanliness and fashion.

299
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,041
What's it like in Cuba?

300
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,629
-Is it suitable for me?
-Yeah, it's cool.

301
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,467
Come take a sip, huh?

302
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,479
Hey you bumpkin
Who smokes a cigar like this?

303
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,397
For You

304
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,402
It's time for us to get rid of the rusticity.

305
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,445
Speaking of this

306
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,365
I have an important matter to deal with this time.

307
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,783
Try your best again.

308
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,328
Big things mean...

309
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,877
I plan to take over all of President Kim's business locations.

310
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
Um?

311
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,465
President Kim?

312
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,385
Yes, it's the President Kim that you and I both know.

313
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,720
I have to sort it out this time.

314
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,972
Hello, President Jin, from across the ocean

315
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,099
Got some new stuff to sell.

316
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,393
It is said to be a "money tree".

317
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,979
But President Kim's place seems too big.

318
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,439
This is the command given to me above.

319
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,524
The two of us just need to deal with President Kim.

320
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,611
Our Gu Zhengwan is an expert in handling this kind of thing.

321
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,822
Um, brother.

322
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,366
After this event

323
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,535
Can you give it to me and my brothers?

324
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,747
A separate business location?

325
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,584
well

326
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,545
Your words are really sad.

327
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,466
If this succeeds
Do you think I'll just give you a place?

328
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,594
Should we do it or not?

329
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,638
Yes I can

330
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,848
That's right!

331
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,516
We are

332
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:36,563
You are the only one I can trust.

333
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,481
Hey give me

334
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,623
Brother, why do you think so much?

335
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,001
Anyway, we have guns, so we can just wipe them out.

336
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,420
Did you know?

337
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,424
Lions also wait for their chance to catch rabbits.

338
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,054
It's not because of lack of strength but to avoid mistakes

339
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,724
Wait until the time comes

340
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,560
I want to solve them all at once

341
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,815
How many times do I have to tell you?

342
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,234
Gu Zhengwan is the only one
Someone who knows where President Kim is

343
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,487
-are you sure?
- Of course what the fuck...

344
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,745
If you don't believe me
Then go ask Gu Jung-man yourself.

345
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,707
Are all these in President Jin’s hands?

346
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,251
Yes

347
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:44,339
So far
Are the guns used in the case all circulated by President Kim?

348
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,925
-Disguised as a courier?
-Yes, that's right.

349
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,387
Where is that bastard President Kim?

350
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,722
The current location of President Kim cannot be confirmed

351
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,726
If we can use Koo Jung-man and Minister Kong
Find the missing President Kim

352
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,981
We can find out the real forces that are spreading guns

353
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,192
Very good, quickly formulate a battle plan

354
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,279
Share the investigation status with the Joint Investigation Headquarters

355
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,030
Yes I know

356
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,657
Please sign it

357
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,288
Hello

358
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,457
I clearly told you to stop interfering

359
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,958
Director

360
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,252
Guns continue to spread

361
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,297
There are gunshots everywhere in Seoul

362
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,340
Today alone, three incidents occurred.

363
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,885
Our job is to find those guns as quickly as possible.

364
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,845
Stop this from happening.

365
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,896
(Name in Chinese and English in the identity investigation report)

366
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,939
This is also the person who spread the guns in the hands of Patrolman Li Dao.

367
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,360
Director, please focus on finding this guy.

368
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,822
at the same time
We'll definitely try to find more guns.

369
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,865
This guy's tail

370
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,784
He will definitely be caught.

371
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,416
Headquarters Notice

375
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,092
Repeat again

376
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,304
We have clues
A suspect was found posing as a police officer...

377
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,139
(My daughter)

378
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,729
Your call was not answered

379
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,023
Please call again later

380
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,402
(Real estate, sales, leasing)

381
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,662
dad

382
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,413
Could you please help me?

383
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,999
Huh? What's wrong?

384
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,628
Can’t I get Dad’s pension in advance?

385
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,382
Are you crazy, girl?

386
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,260
-Why do you do such an abnormal thing...
-Can't you help me?

387
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:54,928
President!

388
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,305
Then go to the police station and report the case.

389
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,974
-President
-What?

390
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,559
Please help me

391
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,603
Without that money I would be dead.

392
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,897
President, I beg you, please.

393
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,815
Let go of me

394
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,067
That money is the result of my father's hard work all his life.

395
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,820
-Accumulated pension
- I told you to sue me.

396
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,199
President, please help me just this once.

397
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,118
Minister Kong is here

398
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,828
Why the hell is he here?

399
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,371
-Take it away!
-Hide it now, fuck!

400
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,289
Oh shit!

401
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,249
Hey, hurry up.

402
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,417
It's over, damn.

403
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,085
hurry up

404
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,504
hurry up

405
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,140
Hello

406
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,482
We are Gu Zhengwan

407
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,442
Hello, Brother

408
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,445
What's going on? What's the atmosphere?

409
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,951
What are you doing?
Why are you out of breath?

410
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,370
Um?

411
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,539
We were just cleaning the room.

412
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,088
Hey, this building is already so rotten
Just live wherever you want

413
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,301
Is this the first time your brothers are seeing me?

414
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,553
Hello, Brother

415
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,013
Oh, okay.

416
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,390
Sit down, bro.

417
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,812
I saw a famous bakery on the way here

418
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:10,814
Oh ok

419
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,697
Thanks

420
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,533
Didn't you ask me before
Do you know the names of your brothers?

421
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,076
Um?

422
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,496
I've always been concerned about this matter.

423
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,291
I guess there are about 20 people.
So buying this much should be enough, right?

424
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,294
Yes, that's enough.

425
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,839
Hey, let me share it with you.

426
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,258
Just ten thousand

427
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,803
can we talk?

428
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,057
Can you please step aside for a moment?

429
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,477
We will enjoy it

430
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,729
Oh, you're welcome.

431
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,792
Just ten thousand

432
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,794
yes

433
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,589
I miss President Kim a lot lately.

434
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,467
How is he?

435
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,803
It should still be buried underground, right?

436
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:30,268
Why are you suddenly mentioning President Kim?
Isn't it very clear to me, brother?

437
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,854
yes

438
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,524
I do know

439
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,456
Ding ding

440
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,042
This is President Kim's cell phone.

441
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:59,172
These idiots just took the phone without asking for the password

442
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:03,927
All his clients are here
But I can't get cash

443
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,053
Oh but

444
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,097
I don't know the password

445
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,349
I know

446
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,145
But we can definitely unlock the code

447
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,105
Me?

448
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,574
Go chop off all ten of President Kim's fingers

449
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,495
After all, you know his location.

450
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,333
The sooner the better

451
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,213
Before his fingers completely rot

452
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,637
I tried it out.

453
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,223
Gu Jung-man must have hidden President Kim

454
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,101
I asked him to come to the club tomorrow so you are ready

455
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,688
Don't forget to exclude me.
"A fake police officer"

456
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,067
Oh fuck

457
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,869
Hey, Jung-Wan

458
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,581
What did that bastard Minister Kong say? Huh?

459
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,044
Why are you staring at me? It's really depressing.

460
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,303
President Jin, do you believe me?

461
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,638
Hey, why are you so scary all of a sudden?

462
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,349
Of course I believe what that guy said?

463
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,477
He told me to cut off your fingers

464
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,521
All ten

465
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:12,972
let's go

466
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,850
let's go

467
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,125
It's the eldest brother

468
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,671
Gu Jung-man is here to look for President Kim's finger

469
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,511
OK, I understand. You keep an eye on him.

470
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:52,971
OK, got it.

471
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,185
Wow, if I was buried in a place like this
No one will ever find you again.

472
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,898
He is looking for President Kim's finger

473
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,417
What are those guys doing?

474
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,836
That is to say

475
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,424
Big Brother
But why do you care so much about Gu Jung Man?

476
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,513
If you're worried, I can get rid of him quietly.

477
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,141
you?

478
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,355
You don’t know what advantages Gu Zhengwan has?

479
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,524
What other advantages does this kid have?

480
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:50,820
Gu Zhengwan really loves his younger brothers

481
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,285
Give me

482
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,371
Forget it, just smoke your local cigarettes

483
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,331
-Give me the photo
-yes

484
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,048
As expected

485
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,509
No one can handle the aftermath better than us.

486
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,596
How come you are so awesome?

487
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,598
This is labor fee.

488
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,768
Thank you. If I have money, I can do anything.

489
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,686
After all, there are still many younger brothers to take care of.

490
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,105
So even though he has been doing this for more than ten years

491
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,691
The number of younger brothers has not decreased
On the contrary, more and more

492
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,320
Having said that
They are just a bunch of useless errand boys.

493
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,033
That’s the problem

494
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,578
Do you know that useless garbage?

495
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,998
There are guns everywhere outside now

496
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,169
If a face is unfamiliar
A man whose name you can't remember is running towards you with a gun

497
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,797
Can you bear it?

498
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:53,841
so

499
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,179
We need to use the help of the police to get rid of Gu Zhengwan

500
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,517
But if Gu Zhengwan
Tell the police what happened during this time...

501
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,643
When did I say

502
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,187
Will you hand him over alive?

503
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,316
Look at it

504
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,486
What is my plan?

505
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,954
-Is everything installed?
-Um

506
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,719
Gu Zhengwan was digging the ground early in the morning.
Now we are setting off again

507
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,119
It's the eldest brother

508
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,957
These guys are in the bathhouse now.

509
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,500
bathhouse?

510
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,006
Taking a shower after digging graves is a common activity for those guys.

511
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,717
Keep a close eye on them and wait for Gu Jung Man to leave.

512
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,051
You go to his office.

513
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,095
I'll go over after I finish my work here.

514
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,894
Hey you bastards!

515
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,021
Why don't you get out of here?

516
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,032
Fucking bunch of trash

517
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,994
Hey, Director Kong is still waiting for President Kim's finger.

518
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,329
Go now

519
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,081
Just ten thousand

520
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,501
Turn on the hot water before you go.

521
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,846
Hey, move your head away so I can see that thing.

522
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:09,852
Look at that bastard's little thing.
This idiot mother

523
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,492
(Yakham Tourist Hotel)

524
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,286
What are these guys doing? What's taking so long?

525
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,249
But this doesn't look like an ordinary bathhouse.

526
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,543
Are these guys kidding us?

527
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,588
Senior Gu Zhengwan is there

528
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:45,930
Detective Xu

529
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,349
Gu Jung Man is going to the nightclub now

530
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,864
(Gu Zhengwan:
I am leading President Kim’s finger over there.)

531
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,953
Already out

532
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,789
Everyone, check your guns and bulletproof vests.

533
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,542
There is a possibility of a shooting.
So be on high alert

534
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,717
Cheer up

535
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,111
Oh come in

536
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,582
What's wrong?

537
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,918
Nice to meet you

538
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,838
Minister Kong, you stinky bastard

539
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,632
Didn't you ask me to give you my finger?

540
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,555
so

541
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,391
Are you going to chop off my fingers?

00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,352
No

543
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,438
I don't use knives anymore.

544
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,607
so what?

545
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,610
Just go there with your ten fingers.

546
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,780
I'll give you a gun

547
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,623
Gu Zhengwan, this bastard

548
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,962
What the fuck is going on?

549
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,548
Hello!

550
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,178
How about this thing?

551
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,514
Isn’t it amazing?
