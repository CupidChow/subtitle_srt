1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,095
Don't move, you bastard!

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,763
We are now arresting you on suspicion of murder.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,681
Let go, bastard!

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,307
You have the right to hire a lawyer

5
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,268
You can remain silent

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,561
You bunch of bastards!

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,813
…speech can be used against you in court…

8
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,732
Let go!

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,992
My mom and dad

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,871
And my brother, please save them.

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,421
Hey, hurry up!

12
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,721
Hey, are you all ready?
Where is Detective Zhao’s victim’s statement?

13
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,556
is ready

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,350
Why are you still wearing bloody clothes?

15
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,437
Oh, there are reporters everywhere
Cheer me up, everyone.

16
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,439
Yes, I know

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,861
Where's my uncle?

18
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,323
I'll take you to the hospital right away

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,325
Would you please sit here for a while?

20
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,368
alright

21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,349
Detective Zhao!

22
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,851
The kid had a gun in his hand!

23
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,313
Lee said goodbye!

24
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,190
No, don't move.

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,317
Li Dao

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,235
-Hello
-Lee Dao

27
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,362
Can you look at me?

28
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,738
Hit

29
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,739
Shut up asshole!

30
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,451
What are you waiting for?

31
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,369
Li Dao!

32
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,121
Hit

33
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,462
"Beyond the Gun"

34
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,257
Suspected shooting incident occurred at Rongcheng Examination Institute

35
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,176
All police officers in the area are requested to go out immediately

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,804
Repeat again
Suspected shooting incident occurred at Rongcheng Examination Institute

37
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,721
Please all the people in the area...

38
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,280
-How are you?
- Please save me

39
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,877
Hello, Officer Kim, wait a minute.

40
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,464
-Where is the criminal?
-Inside

41
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,382
Let's go

42
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,223
Go inside

43
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,732
My life

44
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,987
At least the ending is good

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,364
The people over there

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,283
Put down your guns and put your hands up!

47
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,872
Coming?

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,957
Don't move!

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,835
Ah, this gun

50
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,047
It's easier to use than I thought.

51
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,716
It's very handy

52
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,259
Put down your guns and put your hands up!

53
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,637
But it is said that the police's gun

54
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,807
The first shot must be a blank

55
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,309
What?

56
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,991
Get out!

57
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,368
Get out!

58
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,997
Don't rescue them

59
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,499
These people are scumbags

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,670
A police officer was shot
All police officers entering the scene must be fully armed

61
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,755
The prisoner is currently armed with a machine gun

62
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,092
-Well?
-How are you?

63
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,635
-Um
-How are the people inside?

64
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,512
They are too scared to come out now.

65
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,516
Come out you bastards!

66
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,143
- Wait here
-What?

67
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,229
-Did you think I wouldn't be able to find you if you hid?
-senior!

68
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,814
Um?

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,782
So,
Why did you ignore what others said before?

70
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,912
If both parties can abide by the rules
This won't happen anymore.

71
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,791
This is all caused by you

72
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,044
Is what I'm asking difficult to do? Huh?

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,718
Don't touch other people's side dishes

74
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,887
Don't talk loudly in public places

75
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,807
Is it that difficult?

76
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,521
Don't hold out any hope.

77
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,190
There's no such thing as hope here.

78
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,947
You and I are living in the gutter.

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,825
Kill Everyone

80
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,536
You will be free

81
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,254
Wait, I'll find them all.

82
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,850
Found it!

83
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,103
Please spare me!

84
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,524
Now listen to me carefully.

85
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,401
That guy is holding an M4

86
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,570
After changing the magazine, he fired three shots.
So there are 27 rounds left.

87
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,658
24 rounds

88
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,786
I'll attract his attention and waste his bullets

89
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,287
You guys should save people at this time.

90
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,206
If you are not a senior, what would you do?

91
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,376
Don't worry, my current goal is
Do you understand that saving one person is saving one?

92
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,755
(All lights)

93
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,842
What the fuck?

94
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,719
(Dining room)

95
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,162
Oh shit

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,166
damn it!

97
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:47,967
Come out to me

98
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,510
This way

99
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,527
Damn it, I said don’t save these people!

100
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,996
Come in quickly!

101
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,044
Why…

102
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,399
Thanks

103
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,861
Traffic control is required near the scene

104
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,779
Don't take pictures!

105
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,697
- Please mobilize backup personnel quickly
-Yes, I understand.

106
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,910
Director, please look here!

107
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,869
Director!

108
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,672
-Where's the surveillance video?
- That's right

109
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,967
The computer storing the documents is broken so it is difficult to get them.

110
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,760
Where are the witnesses?

111
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,263
They're not ready to take statements yet.
It may take a while

112
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,014
It's crazy

113
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,310
- Check out the tags here!
-Okay, wait a moment.

114
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,236
Please check out room 308 too!

115
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,422
Let's end here.

116
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,425
Yes, I understand.

117
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,818
Reminds me of a while ago
It's time to prepare for the police exam at the Examination Yuan

118
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,529
I live in a room like this too.

119
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,032
Almost got mental illness

120
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,333
Nowadays, the beds in the examination hall
Are they all held together with plywood?

121
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,419
How is that possible? It's not a coffin.

122
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,259
senior!

123
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,597
Patrolman Zhang

124
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,308
Have you ever seen anything like this in your life?

125
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,770
Director, we found some more guns here.

126
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,812
What?

127
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,442
The identification has been completed and you can confirm it yourself

128
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,944
They're all automatic rifles, right?

129
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,657
Contact the military immediately and ask them to send experts.

130
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,158
It's the Director

131
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,244
Hey, go make a call...

132
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,421
Hello!

133
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,256
I asked you to call a specialist.

134
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,969
Patrolman Li before becoming a police officer
Spent a long time in the military

135
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,932
Then when the experts arrived
Explain everything you know

136
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,687
Why else would he be there?

137
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,940
If you don't understand, don't move around and stay away

138
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,982
That's not the case.

139
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:34,985
Let me explain

140
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:37,965
Let me explain

141
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,177
This was during the Vietnam War

142
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,096
U.S. Special Forces Reconnaissance Group
Mainly used XM177E2

143
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,057
This was the main product of the former Soviet Union.

144
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,561
AK-47
7.62mm Kalashnikov automatic rifle

145
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,687
And this

146
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,941
It debuted in 1964
German MP5 submachine gun

147
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,694
It is the iconic gun of anti-terrorist forces around the world

148
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,695
The last one

149
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,616
It is the MK18 MOD1 American special warfare standard rifle

150
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,534
It is a modernized version of the M4.

151
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,412
Widely used by US special forces

152
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,876
That is to say, these
Guns used in foreign conflict areas and wars

153
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,545
Now come to our country

154
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,632
And he even appeared in the Examination Yuan?

155
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,675
Yes

156
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,803
The bigger problem is

157
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,306
Wasn't it at a suicide scene?
Were dozens of bullets found?

158
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,850
You mean those bullets found in the ceiling?

159
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,060
right

160
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,479
What happened to that case, which is still under investigation?

161
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,400
The bullets found there

162
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,778
And the guns here

163
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,281
is fully compatible

164
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,456
These two cases

165
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,252
I think there seems to be a connection

166
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,712
Hello

167
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,340
This matter is of great importance

168
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,678
First, let everyone keep the information confidential, especially the journalists.

169
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,595
-yes
-yes

170
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,472
Clean this place up too.

171
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,026
I'm so hungry.

172
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,778
When will he come out?

173
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,321
Is it tasty?

174
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,574
Today's breaking news: A certain examination center in Gyeongin City

175
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,868
- An indiscriminate shooting occurred
-Fuck, look, bro.

176
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,910
Caused social shock

177
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,540
The police arrested him on the spot
The suspect Liu, who currently lives in the examination center

178
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,041
Hello, is this America?

179
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,253
What the hell has become of the Republic of Korea?
It's really disturbing.

180
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,754
-Yeah, bro.
-Don't be so exaggerated.

181
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,631
Fuck

182
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,757
Wow, there's still a gunfight going on.

183
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,426
Fuck, this is too much.

184
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,267
Come in and see what's going on.

185
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,351
Yes I know

186
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,067
Stand up straight you bastard!

187
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,530
Let go of you damn bastards!
Let me go, you bastard!

188
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,489
Don't move!

189
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,908
Long Jiu, you bastard

190
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,869
Hey Dragon Nine fuck

191
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,245
Hello, Minister Kong!

192
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,580
Shihao

193
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,416
Bastard Shihao, you bastard!

194
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,045
Save me, you little bastard! Huh?

195
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,755
Let’s talk, shall we?

196
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,965
Come inside and have a drink with me...

197
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,091
Ouch

198
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,261
I'm going to stop drinking starting today.
Because I want to live a few more years.

199
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,305
-Shihao
- So if you can talk to me nicely

200
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,182
How nice it would be if you just let me have this place

201
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,600
Let’s go in and talk now!

202
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,268
Um?

203
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,104
Hey fuck you!

204
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,398
Let go of me you bastards!

205
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:42,942
damn it

206
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,407
Oh, thank you for your hard work.

207
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,618
- Go back and rest.
-yes

208
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,037
-Long Jiu
-yes

209
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,706
I'll hand this over to you once I've sorted out the shares.

210
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,916
yes

211
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,212
- Let's go, take good care of him.
-yes

212
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,339
Hey you fucking bastard!

213
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,841
Minister Kong, you traitor!

214
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,261
Hey you bastard!
Let me go you bastards!

215
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,349
You bastards

216
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,063
Put on your gloves and get ready

217
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,190
Just ten thousand

218
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,115
-Goodbye.
-let's go

219
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,035
Let's go

220
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,620
-Hello
-Hello

221
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,038
one two three

222
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,002
- This is going to be difficult.
-Hey, errand boy

223
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,713
Clean it up quickly

224
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,007
I got a little dirty today.

225
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,927
Damn, you should have come out earlier.

226
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,055
Damn, you came out so late.
Then he told us to deal with it quickly.

227
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,056
I told you not to get excited.

228
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,475
A bunch of useless errand boys

229
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,352
Damn, you look at me like that.

230
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,656
Is he crazy? Who ordered it for him?

231
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,701
Is this a Chinese restaurant?

232
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,618
Um?

233
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,287
He said he would help with the investigation if he was given some noodles with soybean paste

234
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,456
- The squad leader is here, clean it up quickly
-sorry

235
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,294
Hello

236
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,504
What are you doing?

237
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,132
Where did you get the gun?

238
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,217
gun?

239
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,643
I can say

240
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,147
But please help me get that person over here.

241
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,945
We meet again

242
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
Why did you ask to see me?

243
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,785
I was so excited at the time that I didn't think too much about it.

244
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,663
But when you grabbed my face and threw me against the wall

245
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,124
I felt it

246
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,003
“This guy is amazing”

247
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,299
He and those rubbish in the examination hall
Not a level person at all.

248
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,139
Um?

249
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,308
What the hell is this? I...

250
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,813
If you have any questions, just ask me and I'll tell you everything.

251
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,318
Hey, turn up the volume.

252
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,533
Where did you get the gun?

253
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,243
Received via courier

254
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,537
Who sent it?

255
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,164
I have no idea

256
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,042
That guy is talking nonsense again.

257
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,086
An unknown person

258
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,755
Why would they mail you a package?

259
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,423
Or a gun?

260
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,968
Well, I don't know why.

261
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,181
Maybe it’s because I want it so badly?

262
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,100
Should I give him some medicine?

263
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,229
I don't know about this either.

264
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,565
Mr. Liu Zhengtai

265
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,278
Now is not the time to joke

266
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,988
Mr. Policeman, it's me

267
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,700
It's all true.

268
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,751
Have you ever used a gun before?

269
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,422
“Long-range, short-range, medium-range”

270
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,340
Used in service

271
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,016
Was the gun hidden under the bed also delivered by courier?

272
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,145
It's funny

273
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,400
I clearly said
Just a working gun.

274
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,445
But why were so many horrible guns sent?

275
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,074
I'm going to get angry again when I think about it

276
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,623
Mr. Liu Zhengtai

277
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,627
Do you know how many people died because of you?

278
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,130
If you feel even a little guilty towards those people

279
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,383
Then answer all my questions truthfully.

280
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:20,969
"Guilt"?

281
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,600
Do those assholes feel guilty about me?

282
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,897
Those guys don't follow the law.
Not following the rules and not following common sense

283
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,732
Fuck it

284
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,151
For whatever reason

285
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,737
There is no reason to shoot people.

286
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,031
These words shouldn't come out of your mouth!

287
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,577
Just like the police catch bad guys and lock them up.

288
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,913
I'm also dealing with those scumbags.

289
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,374
Because how many people will be saved from harm in my future?

290
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,668
Kill 20 scumbags in the exam hall

291
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,628
Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of people will be safe

292
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,630
So why do you say this to me?

293
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,429
What I do is no different than what you do.

294
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,516
I did the same thing as you.

295
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,646
Do you think it's the same?

296
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,440
Why don't you admit it?

297
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,238
If I prove that I am a true righteous person

298
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,490
Will you admit it?

299
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,665
There's more to guns than just these

300
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,626
What does this mean?

301
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,256
There are still a lot of people with guns outside.

302
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,674
What is your basis?

303
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,764
Um?

304
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,893
Because I saw

305
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,479
What did you see?

306
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,819
People who want guns

307
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,988
So who is it?

308
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,286
That has to be found out by the tax collectors.

309
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,373
That kid is playing dumb with us now.

310
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,834
He has a history of mental illness

311
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,587
I might try to be clever by using the excuse of mental weakness.

312
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,630
But we still have to investigate.

313
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,091
Something more serious might happen.

314
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,301
What to investigate?

315
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,802
Express mail...

316
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,221
Gun? Express gun?

317
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,726
Brother, you don't really believe what that guy said, do you?

318
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,313
If he actually received the package, he would definitely pay for it.

319
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,274
But the guy's account balance is only 530,000 won

320
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,651
The transaction details are also very clear and you don’t even need a card

321
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,569
Look

322
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:47,407
Who would send a gun that expensive to someone like that for free?

323
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,451
This is where we're going to investigate.

324
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,162
Who is it?
What's the reason for doing that?

325
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,706
Why do you want to kill people?

326
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,957
What was the motive for the crime?

327
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:07,928
Please say a few words!

328
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,849
Captain, I just want to ask one thing.

329
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,726
- I'm busy now
-Later

330
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,439
Is this a gun? Are there more guns?

331
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,528
The case is still under investigation
I can't tell you too much information

332
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,030
Why are you so tight-lipped?

333
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,658
I saw more guns.

334
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,577
Is it smuggled? Or self-assembled? Is it?

335
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,537
Let's go quickly

336
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,540
Then I will write my own report based on this photo.

337
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,709
As a journalist, you should write reports based on facts.

338
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,129
Instead of writing a novel, you should write it. I really...

339
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,340
Because you didn't tell me the truth

340
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,134
Even if I'm writing a novel, I have to write something.

341
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,846
Squad leader!

342
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,102
oops

343
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,938
Ouch

344
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,357
Today's meal is really good.

345
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,652
yesterday

346
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,821
It's said it's going to rain heavily

347
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
I'm still worried.

348
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,660
The sun is so bright

349
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,830
Mommy's not cold at all

350
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,211
Eat more, son.

351
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,715
Mom, I will do my best today.

352
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,100
(Listening to the Voice of My Dead Son)

353
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,185
(Apology! Risk outsourcing is prohibited)

354
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,651
People say someone died in this house.
So no one rents it.

355
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,571
- I'm really going crazy
-yes

356
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,033
What are you looking for?

357
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,702
Oh, we need to check here.

358
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,037
So you are saying

359
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,456
No one came to see him or deliver a package?

360
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,460
What express delivery?
I never saw any family or friends come to see him

361
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,383
Thanks

362
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,644
senior

363
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,815
What are you looking at? So serious

364
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,652
The examination hall is over there.

365
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,282
It will really be like what the guy from the Examination Yuan said.
Are there more guns out there?

366
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,452
I hope that's just the ramblings of a madman.

367
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,706
I hope so too

368
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,751
There should be absolutely no

369
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,420
Guns

370
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,437
Damn, these aren't that good.

371
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:10,694
None of them sold.

372
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,529
Would you buy it if you were in my shoes?

373
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,573
Hello!

374
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,033
Does this picture interest you?

375
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,787
Damn, are you going to keep taking crappy photos like this?

376
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,664
-Hey, Yongdong is here.
-Hey, here he comes

377
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,499
Ouch, he can't breathe.

378
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,417
hurry up

379
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,419
-hurry up!
-Run faster!

380
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,337
-hurry up!
- He's almost dead.

381
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,965
- Hey, run faster.
-Run faster

382
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,842
-Run faster
-Run

383
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,802
Run faster, damn!

384
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,803
What are you doing?

385
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,597
Oops, sorry.

386
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,017
Are you acting, little pig?

387
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,185
It's all here

388
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,103
Hello

389
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,567
stand up

390
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,030
Always "cowardly"

391
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,576
I asked you to open ten accounts for me before

392
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,453
Why hasn’t it been done yet?

393
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,498
Sorry, I'll go now.

394
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,666
I'll go open it right away

395
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,297
I said if you buy this I won't bother you anymore

396
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,715
knew

397
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,759
I will try my best

398
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,596
I will try my best

399
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,770
let's go

400
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,855
-Fuck you asshole
-Ouch

401
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,691
Hey, work hard.
Otherwise we'll go to your mom's little restaurant.

402
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,026
I smell like your mom's cooking.

403
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,986
- Damn, it stinks.
-Keep trying, okay?

404
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,945
Oh, you rubbish.

405
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,489
Hey, let's go to the Internet cafe

406
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,532
Come on, Turtle Town!

407
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,250
Sorry, Kuijin

408
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,420
I will run faster next time.

409
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:57,967
Wipe the blood.

410
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,308
Thanks

411
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,855
These puppies

412
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,190
Don't move

413
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,026
Otherwise, I'll be beaten again.

414
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,739
I feel like I'm suffocating.

415
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,666
I feel like I'm suffocating.

416
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,921
Is it him?

417
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,715
I know it's embarrassing but I still cover my face

418
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,383
That's right

419
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,927
How could such people live in our community?

420
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,053
It's so unlucky.

421
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:42,971
That's right

422
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,978
Fucking bitch

423
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,694
Give me two packs of Marlboro Red

424
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,867
Please take off your mask and give me your ID card.

425
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,204
Damn aunt

426
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,207
Do you think I look like a high school student?

427
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,502
No, it's not like that.

428
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,172
Give me the cigarette now, damn!

429
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,134
Did I do something wrong? I'm here to buy something.

430
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,929
Why is everyone looking at me like that? Damn it

431
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,060
I really want to kill them all.

432
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,357
Fucking real

433
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,199
Why are you blocking other people's roads?

434
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,827
Once you’ve ordered a courier, pick it up right away!

435
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,580
What's the damn bastard's name?

436
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:52,916
Park Kyung-ja

437
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,627
Excuse me, is this Park Kyung-ja's home?

438
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,003
My mother will be back soon.

439
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,463
- Please come in
-Oh well

440
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,050
It seems to be a courier package from my aunt.
Need help?

441
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,427
No, it's okay, come in quickly

442
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,641
What the hell? It's a gun.

443
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,686
Who would send something like this?

444
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,028
What a bunch of fucking lunatics.

445
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,157
Wait

446
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,493
K1 and K2 have been sent.

447
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,032
Okay, let's go.

448
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,707
Hey, come down quickly

449
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,126
-alright
-OK

450
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,879
Just ten thousand!

451
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,673
Jung Man Ah Gu Jung Man

452
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,300
Zheng Wan

453
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,845
Forgive me, Jung-Wan

454
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,431
Don't keep calling my name

455
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,018
This is my job. I can't help it.

456
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,646
I know you're good at your job.

457
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,317
You are a smart man, right?

458
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,569
A smart guy like you

459
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,447
How long will I have to stop running errands for Kong Shihao?

460
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,659
Didn't Kong Shihao say that after you kill me

461
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,412
Will you be given that business location?

462
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,165
He will actually give Long Jiu

463
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,545
He won't give it to you, absolutely not.

464
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,463
President Kim

465
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,757
I don't like to hear this.

466
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,217
Hey, bury it quickly.

467
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,260
-OK
- Do it quickly

468
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,638
We have to get out of here before dawn.

469
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,848
We have known each other for ten years.

470
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,392
I will worship you well

471
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:20,021
If you spare me
I will tell you a useful news

472
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,814
People who are asked to provide information usually have nothing to say.

473
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,899
Zheng Wan

474
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,321
I can help you take over the organization.

475
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,201
I have a gun, I have a gun.

476
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,787
I have a gun, boy.

477
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,081
Zheng Wan

478
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,543
Big Brother

479
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,879
Just bury him before sunrise.

480
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,465
If Minister Kong knew that President Kim was still alive

481
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,758
We're all gonna be screwed.

482
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,677
Zheng Wan, please believe me, okay?

483
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,095
I'll take over for you, okay?

484
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,431
What kind of gun is that? Are you kidding me?

485
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,643
What else is there to think about?

486
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,478
Can you please think about it carefully?

487
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,063
- Assuming you do have a gun
-Yes.

488
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,232
How could we possibly defeat that organization with just a gun?

489
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,317
Minister Kong has so many people around him.

490
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,653
No, there are not just one gun, there are a hundred.

491
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,570
There are more than one hundred

492
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,280
No, there are a hundred.

493
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,908
Damn, do you think we are fools?

494
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,826
Hey, wait a minute.

495
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,452
Oh shit

496
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,162
What's your name?

497
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,124
-Big Brother
-Why haven't you reported your work yet?

498
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,375
Oh shit

499
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,877
We just finished cleaning and were about to call you.

500
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,422
-Big Brother
-Um

501
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,259
After this is over, the one you promised...

502
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,678
What promise? Oh, that one?

503
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,722
I'm busy. Let's talk when you come back.

504
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,519
Minister Kong didn’t respond, right?

505
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,605
I told you he wouldn't give it to you.

506
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,403
damn it

507
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,658
Zheng Wan

508
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,619
The beating was really harsh.

509
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,080
What should I do? Bury it quickly?

510
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,415
-bring it on
-yes

511
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,876
I have to work faster. I'm freezing.

512
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,295
- Buried soon
-yes

513
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,811
Fuck you asshole.

514
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,858
Hello?

515
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,569
I am the supervisor. Where are you now?

516
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,448
Damn the guy who's watching me 24 hours a day

517
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,866
You don’t even know where I am?

518
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,620
That is to say
Why did you go somewhere different from your usual route?

519
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,746
Why go to the mountains?

520
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:47,210
Because you're taking my breath away
So I come to get some fresh air

521
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,462
Hello

522
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,881
I also ask you one thing

523
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:56,969
Where are you hiding to spy on me?

524
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,472
Tell me where are you?

525
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,391
There is no comment on this matter

526
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,976
“No comment”

527
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,978
I'm dead, bastard

528
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,534
(Warning: This is a military operation zone)

529
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,327
(No unauthorized entry or photography allowed)

530
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,496
The shooter is ready to start shooting

531
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,354
My strength is still strong.

532
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,231
Soldier ready to shoot

533
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,276
The shooter is ready to start shooting

534
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,503
Tribute to the predecessors

535
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,720
The gun declaration list I requested earlier...

536
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,637
Here

537
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,224
-Lee Dao
-yes

538
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,895
Have you requested the customs to provide a customs clearance list?

539
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,064
I'm a little worried about me, so I want to confirm

540
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,150
Hard work is good

541
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,110
But leave the criminal department's affairs to them.

542
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,196
Everyone has their own area of jurisdiction.

543
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,032
I know I will

544
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,658
You decide

545
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,951
-Yes, thank you.
-Um

546
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,460
(Customs clearance list)

547
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,377
(firearms)

548
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,926
Why don't you answer the phone?
Huh? Why are you here so late?

549
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,512
I wanted to make sure everything was safe so I'm a little late

550
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,640
You should have called earlier.

551
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,600
- Damn you brat
- This is a photo of President Kim

552
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,730
Oh, you take really good photos.

553
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,236
Is there anything that our Zheng Wan is not good at?

554
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,446
for you

555
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,367
hurry up

556
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,206
damn it

557
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,504
-Hey, Jung-Wan
-yes

558
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,421
Isn’t this place nice?

559
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,798
Yes, big brother

560
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,217
Big brother...

561
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,719
Now here

562
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,223
Just leave it to me and my little brothers, okay?

563
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,516
What are you talking about, kid?

564
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,477
This place will be handed over to Long Jiu for management

565
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,897
-ah?
- You're exaggerating, damn.

566
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,441
Hey, believe me, this information is true.

567
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,359
impossible

568
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,741
damn it

569
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,743
(Locked)

570
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,246
What's wrong?

571
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,250
You promised us last time

572
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,585
Will let us take over a business location

573
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:23,217
Hey, Zheng Wan, look here.
Is this really suitable for you?

574
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,347
Big Brother

575
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,517
My brothers really tried their best.

576
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:36,022
Kill people and interrogate people as you command.

577
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,441
- Cleaning up the mess...
-Oh shit

578
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,777
If you have something to say, just say it. Don't be so long-winded.

579
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,116
Please give us a chance to live like human beings.

580
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,367
"Looks like a human being"

581
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,329
So what were you before?

582
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,751
Aren’t we just a bunch of obedient dogs?

583
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,504
What?

584
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,049
"dog"?

585
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,562
You guys
Why is it so sad to talk?

586
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,272
Ruined my mood.

587
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,401
I know, you bastard.
I'll take care of you when the time comes.

588
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,944
Be more patient

589
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,905
Okay?

590
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,576
Big brother, please

591
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,163
Do you know the names of my brothers?

592
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,500
Who else should I know besides you?

593
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,211
Having said that
But they are also people who work for Big Brother

594
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,756
If you could remember their names
I'd be very grateful.

595
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,673
Got it

596
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,176
Take these

597
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,262
Go buy some delicious food with my friends
Then take a bath in the sauna

598
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,639
You stink so bad.

599
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,516
Thank you, bro

600
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,811
Hello

601
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,521
Throw this away when you leave.

602
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,523
I don't want to be haunted by President Kim's ghost

603
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,400
- You bastard
-it hurts

604
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,235
-damn it
- Damn it.

605
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,696
-It hurts! You bastard!
-Oh brother, this bastard...

606
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,865
He's here

607
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,409
Here it comes

608
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,869
Brother, is this ours now?

609
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,914
Bro, what is this?

610
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,832
You don't look well.

611
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,334
here

612
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,254
From now on, Long Jiu and his men will be in charge

613
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,296
Damn this bastard!

614
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,257
Damn this bastard Kong Shihao

615
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,092
-Why?
-Yutai

616
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,803
Have you looked inside?

617
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,179
There is a warehouse inside

618
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,722
But the door is locked

619
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,976
That President Jin is going to die anyway.

620
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,811
Who knows if he is just making up stories to fool us?

621
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,231
- Hey Changsu
-yes

622
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,567
Do you know the Examination Yuan mentioned in the news?

623
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,818
Go there and see if there is anything

624
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,695
Yutai, follow me.

625
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,488
Let's go!

626
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,115
Guys

627
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,619
Let's take a bath together.

628
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,829
Go eat something delicious

629
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,874
You guys have worked hard. I'm sorry.

630
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,209
Why do you say that, brother?

631
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,003
- No, it's okay.
-elder brother

632
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:04,920
-elder brother
-let's go

633
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,509
What's wrong with you, brother?

634
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,846
Really, why is this happening? Really, brother.

635
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,640
Do you know where President Kim's car is?

636
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,850
Um, what's wrong?

637
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,768
Let's go and see

638
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,939
"Guzhen has your mother's ID card
Come here quickly."

639

640
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,110
Boss, please give me an egg roll

641
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,404
Okay, another egg roll.

644
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,213
My son suddenly has something to say

645
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,673
Are you so slow?

646
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,051
Just give me 50,000 won

647
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,553
Fifty thousand won?

648
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,598
Why do you suddenly want money?

649
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,225
What's going on?

650
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,603
No, nothing happened

651
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,230
Just give some money.

652
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,858
Must it be now?

653
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,278
Well, it would be great if you could give it to me now.

654
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,114
sorry

655
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,074
Oh, what is there to be sorry about?

656
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,243

660
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,679
Mom, I have to go.

661
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,097
Well, go ahead.

662
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,644

665
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,712
Did I bring what I wanted?

666
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,430
What are you doing?

667
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,274
Turtle Town you damn bastard

668
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,568
Do you want to die?

669
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,570
That one actually...

670
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,998
Are you turning a deaf ear to my words?

671
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,626
no
I can't get my mom's ID card so quickly...

672
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,336
Then steal her wallet, asshole

673
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,555
I'm really sorry.

674
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,811
You want to use my mother's ID card to borrow money from a loan shark?

675
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,441
But my mother works really hard.

676
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,028
I'll take some more erotic photos

677
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,868
Is your mother's work hard?
What does it have to do with me?

678
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,663
that…

679
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,498
Is it necessary to tell me this?

680
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,333
No

681
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,335
Then I'll ask again

682
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,004
Can I get my ID card tomorrow?

683
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,637
Can or can’t?

684
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,643
I'm asking you can or can't you? You fucking bastard

685
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,229
sorry

686
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,273
You're such a jerk.

687
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,525
Hey, kick this bastard to death

688
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,612

Open

695
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,228
Get out of the way

696
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,949
What the fuck?

697
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,505
elder brother

698
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,592
This is really not okay. We have to be more cautious.

699
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,763
Really, don't go too far.

700
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,848
What are you going to do with the gun?

701
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,727
If a problem occurs
The two of us are really screwed!

702
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,063
Then you have to continue
Are you going to live your life according to Minister Kong's mood?

703
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,857
Yutai

704
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,485
That bastard won't give us a chance.

705
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,029
“Wait a little longer and it will be available soon.”

706
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,989
Damn, all day long, just talk but no action

707
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,868
You and I

708
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,578
Our little brothers

709
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,624
That guy is just playing with our hopes.

710
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,459
What to do then?

711
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,088
-Oh shit
-Continue living like this?

712
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,140
Yutai

713
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:35,978
My brother

714
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,858
Think of this as an opportunity

715
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,795
Where did you get the gun?

716
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,839
Received via courier

717
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,257
An unknown person

718
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,176
Why would they mail you a package?

719
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,094
Or a gun?

720
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,143
Have you received a package from an unknown source?

721
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,686
No, I don't know.

722
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,735
What time does express delivery from Jingren usually arrive?

723
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,570
Between 2 and 4 p.m.

724
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,488
Have you seen him around here?

725
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,489
No

726
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,742
What day of the week is the collection day for recyclables?

727
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,493
Tuesday and Thursday

728
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,753
Hey, look carefully above.

729
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,925
Really, this can't be a lie, right?

730
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,885
He said it's here

731
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,970
Wait a moment

732
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,139
Not this fucking

733
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,766
I am a police officer

734
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,935
What's going on?

735
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,437
ah

736
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,941
We want to sell paper boxes to make some pocket money

737
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:04,900
Any questions?

738
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,401
- Really
- That's what I mean

739
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,445
Didn’t you see the cordon behind?

740
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,115
This is a crime scene, you can't just come in.

741
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,116
I can't understand English

742
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,952
- you idiot
-Thank you for your hard work and loyalty

743
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,129
(Garbage classification and recycling station)

744
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,314
Hey, monitor.

745
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,025
What Liu Zhengtai said before

746
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,319
I think you don't need to care that they are all lies

747
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,862
Um?

748
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,365
I just checked the records of various express delivery companies.

749
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,701
No delivery record at all

750
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,705
He has never received a package in the past three years.

751
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,124
He always says weird things.

752
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,251
It is said that everyone has a "trigger" in their heart.

753
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,129
I'm afraid it's hard to get any information out of him.

754
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,257
Anyway, we are checking the surveillance video at the scene.

755
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,883
There is also a driving recorder

756
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,593
If I find anything, I'll call you.

757
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,387
OK, I got it.

758
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,472
perhaps…

759
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,767
Ok, if you need help

760
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,228
Please feel free to contact me

761
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,480
Well, thank you for your hard work.

762
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,660
(Liu Zhengtai Rongcheng 5-21)

763
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,437
License plate number 23S 2549
Is this the car that Quan Yuancheng took?

764
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,563
Come a little closer

765
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:07,898
elder brother

766
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,358
Liu Zhengtai did receive the package, I confirmed it

767
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,071
But there is a man named Quan Yuancheng in our area.
I seem to have received the same package.

768
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,697
Hmm? Jeon Won-sung?

769
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,407
We are chasing that guy.

770
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,952
Brother, we are almost catching up. I will call you later.

771
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,746
Um

772
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,254
Hey Jeon Won-sung! Come out now, you bastard!

773
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,172
Quan Yuancheng

774
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:40,847
Hey, get off the bus!

775
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,016
Come on, damn.

776
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,519
What are you doing? Get out of the way.

777
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:49,106
Why wouldn't you stop me?
I didn't do anything wrong

778
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,400
Driver, have you ever driven this person before?

779
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,404
This person just got off the car

780
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,283
senior!

781
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,245
This is Quan Yuancheng's electronic anklet and mobile phone.

782
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,077
Who are you?

783
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,536
it hurts

784
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,122
Wait a moment

785
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,208
My name is Wen Bai

786
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,793
Literary and Vernacular

787
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,711
what are you doing here?

788
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,088
Oh no.

789
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,466
I'm here to get something.

790
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:22,926
Get the package
