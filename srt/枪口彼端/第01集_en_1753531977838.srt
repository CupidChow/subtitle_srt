Oh, I'm really going crazy. I'm so unlucky this early in the morning.

My car wasn't moving, how could you hit it?

28
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,120
You look ahead when you drive.

29

How on earth do you drive?

-fine

Calm down, both of you.

Contact each other and let the insurance company accept the case first

37
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,934
Then drive away, okay?

38
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,978

Ah, finally alive.

101
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,840
The test results are much worse than last time.

102
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,634
During this time, I felt

103
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,222
There's always a fight here and there

104
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,599
I'm always trying to tell you what to do here

105
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,226
But reason is suppressing emotion

106
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,395
So I am confused

107
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,690
You haven't taken much medicine during this period, right?

108
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:25,027

That's the tenth year.

Emotional life such as anxiety, obsession, depression

112
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,794
It's just that their control and solution methods are different.

113
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,964
Does that mean I'm normal too?

114
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,300
As long as here

115
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,801
No control here

116
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,597
Then it's OK

117
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:01,189
Everyone has a trigger in their heart.

118
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,859
But a person with a healthy mentality

119
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,945
I will never pull the trigger.

120
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,869
And for you, Chint
Medication can help you avoid pulling that trigger

121
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,834
Everyone has a trigger.

122
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
Oh, so many people came.

123
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,218
Why is there so much conflict in this country?

124
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,970
It's really simple

125
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,806
Such a large scale
Someone must be fueling the conflict, right?

126
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,978
It seems you still don't understand

127
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,275
No matter if it is the outside world that is fueling the conflict
Or what does it matter if the workers volunteer?

128
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,903
It's an opportunity for us to make money.

129
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,280
Just be grateful and take pictures

130
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,992
Reporter Wang, how can you say that?

131
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,412
Today's world conflicts are opportunities to make money

132
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,123
Film the protest at ten times the scale

133
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,085
Workers stand up for their rights!

134
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,462
Rise up!

135
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,715
Because this is our job.

136

How could you delay renting for ten months?

138
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,185
How can I make a living?

139
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,186
Not coming out?

140
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,438
Okay, I can't bear it today.

141
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,401
Ouch!

142
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,860
Why does it smell so bad?

143
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,949
A bunch of bill reminders

144
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,909
Ouch, so much garbage

145
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,954
I really shouldn't have rented this place out.

146
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,913
It is really…

147
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,921
What's the condition of the body?

148
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,799
There seems to be no sign of external intrusion.

149
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,426
Yes, there is no sign of homicide.

150
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,052
Judging from the marks on the neck

151
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,637
It's probably just suicide.

152
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,806
OK

153
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,642

154
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,768
Um?

155
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,686
What is this?

156
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,271
What?

157
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,946
What's going on?

158
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,076

Why are you here?

163
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,334
We found this on the street.

164
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
Yeah?

165
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,758
-Children, wait a minute.
-Um?

166
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,384
- Come get one.
-Wow

167
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,969

Hey, each person can only take one.

170
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,098
-Take one
- It's okay, take more

171
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,309
- It's okay to take two or three
-Thanks

172
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,935
-alright
-Thanks

00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,062
Li Dao

174
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,939
Don't give it away casually. This is all bought with taxes.

175
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,108
Director, you eat more.

176
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,070
People of our age
If your blood sugar drops, you will go into shock.

177
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,655
Would you like one then?

178
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,864
Oh really?

179
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,492
Oh, it’s time for me to have lunch too, right?

180
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,876
- Um, what's wrong?
-elder brother

181
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,421
I have something urgent to do now.
Can you come over here for a moment?

182
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,805
-He has these?
-Um

183
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,350
I've been a police officer for so many years.
This is the first time I've seen this happen.

184
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,144
I immediately contacted my brother

185
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,021
Because I thought you might know something.

186
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,274
You're an expert in this area.

187
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:34,902
How does it look?

188
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,116
It must be the bullets that were not declared.

189
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,576
Except bullets

190
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,662
-No other findings?
-Um

191
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,998
Was it stolen from the army while serving?

192
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,380
Not sure especially with this bullet

193
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,173
Only a few people in the army can use it.

194
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,634
So it is difficult for ordinary people to get in touch with

195
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,054
What was the deceased's occupation?

196
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,182
I heard he was just a homeless person.

197
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,685
Unemployed?

198
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,769
Um

199
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,276
He has several previous convictions.

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,486
Just got out of prison

201
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,282
The house was inspected and there was nothing special.

202
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,830
Oh, in the army
Even if one shell is missing, the whole thing will be in chaos.

203
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,666
Now there's a bunch of bullets.

204
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,213
What are you doing?

205
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,674
What did you find?

206
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,770
Wow what is all this?

207
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,865
(Faith, Hope, Love Rongcheng Examination Yuan)

208
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,455
A bunch of poor guys
Why do you keep asking me to do this? Damn it.

209
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,707
Ouch

210
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,589
Are you done with it?

211
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,049
Yes

212
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,366
Please be quiet.

213
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,537
Please let me study hard.

214
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,914
Oh, brother, I can't hold on any longer.

215
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,418
Do you like this?

216
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,551
(Liu Zhengtai)

217
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,223
I've never seen this before.

218
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,936
A bunch of bullets raining down from the ceiling? Huh?

219
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,355
Even in the movies, it's not realistic.

220
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,360
That bastard
Where did you get these bullets?

221
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,406
I don't know either. Anyway, Detective Xu is investigating.
The truth will come out

222
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,701
Okay, just shut up and wait.

223
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,371
Don't come forward just because you know it.

224
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,125
“Ignorance is bliss, knowledge is a burden”
Do you know this sentence?

225
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,839
Back to the point
Aren’t you going to take the promotion exam this time too?

226
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,134
I am very comfortable with my current job.
Why get promoted?

227
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,179
I'm the one who makes me uncomfortable.
Seeing you like this makes me feel uncomfortable

228
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:50,931
no

229
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,518
Your age, strength, qualifications and abilities

230
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,897
He could have been the sheriff.

231
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,733
Others are working hard to get promoted.

232
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,359
Ouch

233
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,155
Disobedient subordinates and a daughter who worries me

234
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,241
There is no one who makes me feel at ease.

235
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,035
What happened to Shirong?

236
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,871
She had to move out and live on her own

237
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,832
Say it's necessary
"Work-life balance" or something like that

238
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,792
Isn’t it time for Shirong to become independent?

239
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,710
Um?

240
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,713
Are you on Shirong's side now?

241
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,259
She spent all the money she had saved with great difficulty.

242
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,596
I wouldn't say that if I just paid the monthly rent.

243
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,266
But she not only borrowed money from the bank
I also paid a bonus.

244
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,021
She has found a work-life balance.
I'm not balanced at all.

245
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,317
Come here, Li Dao, this is my daughter's car

246
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,903
- I can have another drink
- Don't drink today.

247
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,406
You can't keep borrowing money like this, little girl.

248
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,283
Really

249
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,869
Shirong, I heard that you moved out?

250
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,828
Um

251
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,455
I am very happy

252
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,541
In the past, the commuting time to and from get off work was two hours.

253
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,088
It's only 30 minutes away now
And it's a newly built house, which is great

254
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,839
What do you need for your new home?

255
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:10,094
TV, sofa, refrigerator?

256
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,053
That's all.

257
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,638
Take your dad home.

258
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,847
I'm leaving now

259
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,182
- Then I'm leaving
-Um

260
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,100
Let's go

261
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,367
Li Dao please answer

262
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,869
All members are isolated and must retreat!

263
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,498
No, there are still survivors at the scene.

264
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,875
Retreat first. This is the order. Retreat quickly!

265
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,211
Sergeant Lee!

266
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,630
Bullets are flying from all directions

267
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,257
Please save me, Sergeant Lee

268
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,300

270
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,013
Oh, your grades are good.

271
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,223
The physique is also good.

272
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,851
A Taekwondo master?

273
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,438
After graduating from the Sports Academy
I joined the Marines and got out!

274
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,439
oh

275
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,983
What a talent!

276
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,361
Thank you for being loyal!

277
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,739
Good loyalty, let's get along well.

278
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,869
Who is the senior who trained me?

279
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,704
Oh train your seniors

280
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,540
Oh there behind you

281
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,590
Are you an administrative soldier?

282
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,092
What?

283
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:38,390
I saw that you were typing very seriously just now.

284
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,602
Police work also involves a lot of paperwork

285
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,938
Patrolman Zhang, you will soon become proficient

286
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,565
But…

287
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,860
I'm not suited to paperwork.

288
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,403
What about me

289
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,449
Whenever I see bad guys, I'll arrest them.

290
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:59,203
If it's a serious case, just shoot and solve it.

291

Then he was promoted directly to the Wide Area Search Team.

292
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,833
You can tell at a glance
Am I suitable for the job there?

293
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,502
yes

You can't do this here.

299
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,574
I didn't break any laws.

300
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,410
Because someone complained.

301
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,455

No

We don't mind at all

307

We have to report the assembly.

They report her for obstructing business every hour.

I know, you've said it so many times.

363
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,067
And room 306

364
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,820
There's always a woman's moaning sound coming from there

365
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,613
He seems to have brought his girlfriend here.

366
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,365
elder brother

367
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,284
How can you enjoy such a good thing alone?

368
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,952
You should call me immediately.

369
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,787
Outsiders are not allowed to enter here.

370
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,458
Once the rules are set, they must be followed

371
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,293
Why doesn't anyone follow the rules?

372
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,212
Brother, please help me

373
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,383
Don't stay in your room all day reading

374
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,928
Go out and get some sun and fresh air

375
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,972
Why are you always so unreasonable?

376
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,600
This will turn into waste.
Completely unfit for society

377
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,226
Finally, he became a madman with paranoia.

378
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,771
Are you ignoring me?

379
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,107
My advice to you goes in one ear and out the other.

380
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,694
I know, you should go study.

381
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,946
Let's go, let's go

382
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,741
(General Affairs Office, please knock on the door)

383
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,122
What is the brat doing?

384
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,332
What a fucking idiot.

385
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:04,925
What are you doing?

386
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,469
I am the tenant of room 307

387
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,723
You can't smoke in the room because of the smoke.

388
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,101
That's why I left the door open for ventilation.

389
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,855
This will spread the smoke to the next room.

390
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,274
This is a no smoking area

391
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,360
This is a rule that everyone should abide by.

392
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,611
You fucking bastard

393
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,407
What regulations are you talking about?

394
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,826
You fuck

395
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,744
You wrote this, right?

396
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,541
Do you think I'm a bastard who stole your side dish?

397
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,502
I just want to tell you guys...

398
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,962
Shut your stinky mouth

399
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,844
Try posting this kind of stuff again.

400
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,679
I will really kill you

401
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,018
(Please do not touch other people's side dishes)

402
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,854
If you understand, get the fuck out of here, you bastard.

403
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,905
Fuck it

404
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,062
Damn you lunatic, be quiet

405
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,401
No, you crazy guy.

406
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,989
Hold on, you lunatic.

407
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,550
To endure

408
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,637
To endure

409
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,975
Is there no one?

410
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,478
Who is it?

411
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,568
Hello, is this Park Kyung-ja's home?

412
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,152
Park Kyung…

413
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,906
Ah, my mother went to the supermarket.

414
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,827
Have you installed a water purifier recently?
I'm here for my first maintenance.

415
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,287
Come in

416
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,957
Excuse me

417
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:27,919
Inside

418
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,186
Are there any inconveniences during use?

419
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,439
No

420
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,274
I like it very much

421
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,192
Totally my style

422
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,988
If you need a device to process ice drinks
Please tell me

423
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,117
I will give you a special offer

424
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,626
"Special offer"?

425
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,267
Any special offers?

426
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,853
Ah, scared me

427
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,942
Yes there are lots of different freebies...

428
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,570
Ah Freebies

429
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,202
Want a cold drink?

430
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,954
No thanks

431
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,238
You are not married yet?

432
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,574
No, I've been married for a while.

433
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,454
She's a married woman.

434
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,666
It seems you are not married yet.

435
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,628
I have to find a good woman to marry quickly.

436
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,906
You don't feel okay?

437
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,324
What?

438
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,494
I don't quite understand what you mean

439
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,872
I'm talking about marriage.

440
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,962
I just said some useless words

441
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,590
I'll get it done for you as soon as possible.

442
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,096
Let's finish it quickly.

443
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm going out to smoke a cigarette

444
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,734
Are you leaving?

445
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,757
Is Quan Yuancheng at home?

446
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,552
What are you doing?

447
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,221
Oh, we are the police.

448
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,141
I want to check your electronic anklet.
The signal just now was very unstable

449
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,143
Are you free?

450
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,521
I'm not free

451
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,231
If you don't have time...

452
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,442
This guest's filter has been replaced

453
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,735
Goodbye then.

454
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,861
Ms. Gao Zhiying

455
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,030
Come again next time

456
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,450
Next time I will switch to a device that can process ice drinks.

457
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,757
Could you give me a quick look inside?

458
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,716
Good to know

459
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,228
Scare me

460
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,234
Are you okay?

461
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,570
Thank you so much just now

462
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,155
Did anything happen in there?

463
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,283
I saw his electronic anklet.

464
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,369
I'm scared

465
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,705
Next time you visit

466
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,583
Why not search the sex offender list first?

467
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,966
Senior, I'm going to check his shackles.

468
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,969
Okay, I'll go look around first.

469
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,529
Mr. Quan Yuancheng, where are your family members?

470
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,864
What's wrong with me living alone?

471
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,116
Are you going to help me find a woman?

472
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,746
Um

473
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,415
So who is Park Kyung-ja?

474
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,044
What happened to my mother?

475
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,171
But you just said you live alone

476
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,800
Hey, are you provoking me?
Are you kidding?

477
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,805
Wearing this thing
Who can live with their real name?

478
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,974
Fucking real

479
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,476
Wow, I was shocked.

480
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,189
Why are you suddenly so angry?

481
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,780
What the hell are you talking about?

482
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,368
Please don't curse.

483
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,497
I just scolded you, you damn cop, what do you want?

484
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,749
Fucking asshole

485
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,294
OK, I know. Just put your feet out.

486
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,088
I'll confirm and leave.

487
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,006
bring it on

488
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,383
foot!

489
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,386
Okay, my feet

490
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,720
Whatever you want

491
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,146
Your name is Zhang Zhengwei

492
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,696
Are Zhengwei's parents still alive?

493
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,323
Enough

494
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,458
How's the signal now?

495
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,377
There seems to be nothing unusual

496
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,297
The connector and the back have been checked.
No scratches

497
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,383
Yes

498
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,719
What should Zhengwei do?

499
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,767
How sad your parents must be.

500
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,901
Damn, let me go

501
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,701
Is there any problem?

502
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,286
ah

503
00:33:59,162 --> 00:33:59,996
Yes

504
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,457
There is no problem with the device

505
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,835
Fuck it

506
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,172
Why are you all doing this to me?

507
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,507
let's go

508
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,553
Hello!

509
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,221
You two, don't go.

510
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,850
No matter how big a crime I committed

511
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,853
I have human rights too! Human rights!

512
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,025
Why are you police officers always like this?
Takes my breath away! Huh?

513
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,529
If you ignore my human rights
This has been suppressing me.

514
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,615
I won't give up.

515
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,207
You wear that because you respect human rights.

516
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,377
Do you understand?

517
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,846
Fuck respect

518
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,640
"respect"?

519
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,726
Actually said respect

520
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,487
Sorry, senior.

521
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,701
Don't feel sorry
Remember this when you go out to do things.

522
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,663
Treat petitioners and victims with care

523
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,873
Use the law to confront criminals

524
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,877
I will keep in mind what you said, senior.

525
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,964
Patrolman Zhang

526
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,800
-Um?
-Don't just keep it in mind

527
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,552
Get it out after you get back to the police station.

528
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,345
Korean bold font size 11

529
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,057
Ok font size 11

530
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,480
Another shooting incident

531
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,983
Reports of shooting inside elementary school

532
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,818
At least 15 people have been killed...

533
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,530
It's still called a developed country?
Why are there shootings every day? It's fucking scary

534
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,447
well

535
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,785
Damn, so
Our country is suitable for living, isn’t it?

536
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,038
Now we are connecting with our on-site reporter Pei Xiuxian...

537
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,333
What a fucking shit
Hell, North Korea has no guns, which is a blessing in disguise.

538
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,545
Hey, is there anyone among the three of us who can't shoot?

539
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,754
They all served in the military.

540
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,424
Hey, don't say such unrealistic things. Look at this.

541
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,093
Bitcoin fell again

542
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,262
Fuck are you still doing Bitcoin?

543
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,222
- You are sick, little brat
- I don't even have a loan limit...

544
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,030
- This kid I...
- Really

545
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,198
Hey fuck...

546
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,284
Local police believe the incident…

547
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,702
(No drinking, smoking, or shouting)

548
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,996
To enhance the safety of schools and communities

549
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,706
Additional measures are being considered

550
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,124
This shooting incident...

551
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,210
I was scared. What on earth is this bastard doing?

552
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,880
One blank round equals more than four live rounds!

553
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,218
-Can I trust you?
-senior

554
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,761
(Lounge, Armory)

555
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:06,474
I am from the Central Police College
The only one among the 313th class who got full marks for shooting skills

556
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,060
OK, I understand. Please fill in the form.

557
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,561
(Weapons and ammunition out of warehouse book)

558
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,570
But doesn’t Senior Li patrol with a gun?

559
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,282
Patrolman Li said he would rather use a stun gun

560
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,951
Oh, is that so?

561
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,370
Well, although the chances of you using a gun are very small

562
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,330
But it's better to be careful just in case, you know?

563
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,539
I understand

564
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,624
Go ahead.

565
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,926
What a peaceful and beautiful night.

566
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,595
I'm lucky to be on duty...

567
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,055
Come here, you little bastard.

568
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,015
What is "calm"?

569
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,517
Don’t you know that police officers can’t say that?

570
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,726
-Take it back!
- Take Back

571
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,936
- Quick Pah
-Pah, pah, pah

572
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,188
What should I do with you, you little brat?

573
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,648
-Hey, Lee Do
-Um?

574
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,316
Don't you want to educate your deputy?

575
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,110
Oh, you stinky boy

576
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,027
Patrolman Zhang

577
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:39,942
Please don't do this again.

578
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,610
Oh, brother

579
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,572
I'm going to drive you crazy

580
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:46,991
Please

581
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,633
Damn, there are people here!

582
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,136
What? Didn't you say that no one lives next door?

583
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,056
So what? It's more exciting.

584
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,557
Excuse me

585
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,435
Can we please understand each other?

586
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,687
Fuck you you fucking bastard

587
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,647
Do you want to do it too?

588
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,900
If you are too horny, just masturbate yourself

589
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,403
When others are talking
Just listen to me, asshole

590
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,995
That's why life is so hard

591
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,669
Feed Emergency Services

592
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,505
Here... gun

593
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,757
There's a gun here

594
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,092
What? A gun?

595
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,470
Hello?

596
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,514
I just heard a gunshot.

597
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,641
-Where are you?
- Police please hurry up...

598
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,725
Hello, have you called the police?

599
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,773
I asked you if you called the police

600
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,483
Tell me now

601
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,610
Hello!

602
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,363
You didn't listen to me and called the police again, didn't you?

603
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,078
Caller, you said you heard gunshots?

604
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,454
Call the police?

605
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,582
Can you hear me?

606
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,337
You ignore me at this time?

607
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,260
Did anyone call the police?

608
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,137
May I ask who you are, sir?

609
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,847
Don't call me sir.

610
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,764
good

611
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,143
I am a civil servant candidate
I applied for the ninth level tax officer exam.

612
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,811
-gentlemen?
-Level 7 is too difficult

613
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,728
gentlemen?

614
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,814
I was going to call the police too.

615
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,607
But they

616
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,026
But he keeps ignoring me

617
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,361
Where are you, please?

618
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,571
Rongcheng Examination Institute

619
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,488
Become famous?

620
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,406

621
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,991

The third floor of the karaoke hall at the intersection next to the viaduct

623
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,079
But it's no use coming now.

624
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,460
Because I pulled the trigger

625
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,550
How many times have I told you this?
If you want to do anything, go to a small hotel.

626
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,178
This place is also poorly soundproofed.

627
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,977
Please spare my life.

628
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,021
Please

629
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,863
You're such a jerk

630
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,407
How much does a small hotel cost?

631
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,786
I bring you such a beautiful girlfriend every day
Come to such a dirty place

632
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,878
I don't know either.

633
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,132
It's all because of you

634

00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:56,972

Yeah, everything is fine.

645
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,916
Oh my…

Why?

652
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,957
You don't even take me seriously when I talk to you

653
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,417
Why haven’t you come yet?

654

elder brother

658
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,891
You are the general affairs manager, why don’t you manage it well?

659
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,207
Listen to me carefully!

660
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,846
