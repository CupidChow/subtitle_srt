00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,134
One last warning for you to put down your gun

2
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,053
OK, I know. I know.

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,512
is here

4
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,430
The gun is here

5
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,432
Squad leader, are you okay?

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,227
Yes, squad leader, it's okay.

7
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,771
One last warning, put down your gun.

8
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,110
Wow

9
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,404
Wow, seriously I'm speechless.

10
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,156
Isn’t this amazing?

11
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,991
How did you even think of going in there?

12
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,909
elder brother

13
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,328
What can't I do to fill my stomach?

14
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,622
What's the fuss?

15
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,666
You are still so ambitious.

16
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,252
- But brother
-Um?

17
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,046
Have you ever seen a gun like this in real life?

18
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,215
No, why do you ask?

19
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,301
A gun is not an ordinary weapon.

20
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,679
And what happened at the Examination Yuan

21
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,724
There must be something behind this.

22
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,437
Hey, then you should come up with more exclusive news.

23
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,397
What if I get it?

24
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,901
You bring the scoop.
I'll arrange a formal position for you, okay?

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,487
You don't have to freelance anymore.
Give you an office with a great view

26
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,114
An office with a great view?

27
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,699
The awesome kind, eh?

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,909
Keep your word?

29
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,036
Awesome, ok?

30
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,040
Office with a great view

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,927

The suspect Quan Mou who cut off the electronic anklet and escaped

34
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,148
Go to Gyeonginse Police Station

35
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,235
Shooting in police station
A horrific shooting

36
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,988
The suspect may have taken advantage of the fact that there were fewer people on duty at night.

37
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,990
The situation where the housekeeping staff are not fully armed

38
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,158
-So take action
-That's amazing.

39
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,869
In the process of suppression

40
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,038
Suspect shot dead by police

41
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,082
This has caused another controversy

42
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,129

00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,714

00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,184
(Gyeongin West Police Station)

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,692
The gun was taken from the evidence room.

46
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,155
Where did so many bullets come from?

47
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,283
There are absolutely no bullets on the evidence list.

48
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,621
Wen Bai who went to the scene with you

49
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,539
Was it he who gave you the bullet?

50
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,542
You said you met at the suspect's home?

51
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:12,877
Yes

52
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,545
But why would you go there?

53
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,424
I've explained it to him before.

54
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,010
Where on earth did he go?

55
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,054
Who have you explained this to?

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,265
All right

57
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,434
Then I will tell you the truth from beginning to end

58
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,479
Mr. Wen Bai said
The bullet I was going to use to call the police

59
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,148
It was taken away by you, Patrolman Li Dao

60
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,609
Patrolman Li Dao and Mr. Wen Bai

61
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,778
What is the relationship between you two?

62
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,406
We met by chance

63
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,782
Because it was an emergency

64
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,035
He gave me some help

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,463
Explain yourself how you subdued Jeon Won-sung.

66
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,466
After Jeon Won-sung shot his supervisor

67
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,387
Lost my rationality and planned to continue committing crimes

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,015
Accordingly

69
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,435
I think we need to take action as soon as possible

70
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,604
No matter how blatantly shooting

71
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,565
Isn’t that too much?

72
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,154
I looked at Patrolman Li's records.

73
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,033
High-risk conflict areas that others avoid

74
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,535
Instead, you volunteered to go?

75
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,582
Your official records say
You have sniped 99 people in total.

76
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,712
As of today, the number has become 100.

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,634
Why bring this up?

78
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,306
Just tell the truth

79
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,312
All you want to do is shoot them all, right?

80
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,274
Please be respectful

81
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,444
I asked this
Because we have good reason to doubt

82
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,454
Hello, Patrolman Lee

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,123
Why are you here? Come out now

84
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,251
Director, we are still investigating him.

85
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,420
Investigate the stinky boy

86
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,423
Did he use the gun in accordance with procedures and regulations?

87
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,633
Further investigation is needed

88
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,134
Didn't you watch the surveillance?

89
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,346
Because of him, more than 30 police officers saved their lives.

90
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,181
He was the only one who rushed in to save people.

91
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,517
What can you do in that situation?

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,312
For whatever reason
He did use illegal live ammunition

93
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,023
We have to refer him to the disciplinary committee.

94
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,441
Please

95
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,487
The policeman performed his duty and you want to punish him
Then start with me

96
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,864
Okay? I'm his superior.

97
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,324
It's my instructions.

98
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,784
I am the person in charge

99
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,993
I'm the one in charge, damn!

100
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,080
Catch a tough guy and make him take the blame? Don't even think about it

101
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,998
If you want to punish me, start with me, you little brat!

102
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,501
If the bullet flies
The first ones to run away are guys like you.

103
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,253
How dare you... Damn it

104
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,338
Come out quickly!

105
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,549
(Interrogation room)

106
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,595
sorry

107
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,347
What do you have to apologize for?

108
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,976
Now let us handle it and you can go and have a rest.

109
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,728
Lift your head, boy.

110
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:35,997
Li Dao

111
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,040
-Director
-Thanks a lot

112
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,131
Patrolman Li Dao, what happened to yesterday’s murderer?

113
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,591
Don't you think this is excessive repression?

114
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,968
-Nothing to say. No comment.
-Where did you get your gun?

115
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,519
Why are you here?

116
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,319
From the time you graduate from primary school until the time you graduate from university

117
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,490
Various shooting competitions, military enlistment
Overseas dispatch, police examination

118
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,783
When have I been absent?

119
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,704
Is there?

120
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,040
No

121
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,667
But why do you always make me sad?

122
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,212
Is this how you repay me?

123
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,507
As long as people are consistent, it will be fine.

124
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,051
Oh, I really can't even say a nice word.

125
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,848
Is Shirong okay?

126
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,475
Take a look

127
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,311
Every time you get into trouble you change the subject

128
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,272
Do you have time to worry about others now?

129
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,234
Don't worry about Shirong, just worry about yourself.

130
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,116
How are you?

131
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,410
Well what can I do?

132
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,664
I know you're strong, I didn't ask that.

133
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,292
I mean is it okay for you to pick up a gun again?

134
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,464
Don't always be in the limelight and do things like this, okay?

135
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,592
I don't want to see you get hurt.

136
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,303
Whether it is body or mind

137
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,139
Is it appropriate for the police to say this?

138
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,142
I'm almost 60 years old, who cares what I say?

139
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,227
I say whatever I want to say

140
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,688
I just didn't tell you, little bastard.

141
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,651
I heard that when you took the gun
Do you know how nervous I am?

142
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,028
You really don't understand the ways of the world.

143
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,969
Your official records say
You have sniped 99 people in total.

144
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,972
As of today, the number has become 100.

145
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,809
All you want to do is shoot them all, right?

146
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,947
Don't be afraid, little bastard.

147
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,324
Hey, that little pig is coming.

148
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,743
Why is this bastard so arrogant?

149
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,289
Xu Yongdong

150
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,083
Do you want to try bullying?

151
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,544
Feed Turtle Town

152
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,348
Hurry up and bring your mother's ID card

153
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,392
You bastard

154
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,982
I confirmed it.

155
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,068
(Disciplinary notice: suspension for three months)

156
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,319
No, but this is also...

157
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,447
I know.

158
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,035
Wow, three months suspension?

159
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,454
Are you crazy?

160
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,956
Oh, this is too much.

161
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,418
The seniors saved so many lives.

162
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,130
Li Dao is here

163
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,104
Patrolman Zhang

164
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,899
The guy who escaped from Quan Yuancheng's house
Have you confirmed your identity?

165
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,318
Oh, senior, that is...

166
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,154
Li Dao, you can't do any work now

167
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,826
Really, you guys are going too far.

168
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,454
Patrolman Li didn't say what he wanted to do.

169
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,040
Just asking, isn't it?

170
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,377
Everyone has questions in their mind, right?

171
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,922
Not that one

172
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,133
I also wanted to ask about this matter.

173
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,594
Patrolman Zhang, please report that matter to me.

174
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,847
Then I will report the situation to the director.

175
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,100
To the guy who escaped from Jeon Won-sung's house
Have you confirmed your identity?

176
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,309
No!

177
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,853
No? You kid

178
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,980
If you don't want to be suspended too
Just tell me honestly

179
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,606
Oh, he ran away.

180
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,235
What's the meaning?
Didn’t I tell you to come over right away?

181
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,112
Patrolman Li said he asked you to come over right away!

182
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,364
- I went there immediately
-but?

183
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,075
But I found out there were other people

184
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,579
Please help me check the license plate number and movement route

185
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,667
Tell me the license plate number and movement route
Just tell me

186
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,587
Yes, that car is a fake vehicle.

187
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,133
Then the license plate number is 15 or 23 or something?

188
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,346
"15N 2335"?

189
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,056
Yes, this is it

190
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,975
- Wait, move aside.
-yes

191
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,772
etc.

192
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,401
No matter how I look at it, I think this person is Zhao Yutai

193
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,154
Really? Yes, I think so too.

194
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,157
Who is Jo Woo-tae?

195
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,117
A jerk.

196
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,162
I used to cause trouble in this area.

197
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,083
But didn’t that guy just get out of jail recently?

198
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,003
I learned not long ago
He was doing odd jobs for Minister Kong's public business premises.

199
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,254
Always lingering

200
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,425
You mean Minister Kong?
Are you referring to Kong Shihao from the Pfizer gang?

201
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,302
Oh, that's right.

202
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,304
In the past, you and Detective Xu

203
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,473
Didn’t we investigate Minister Kong together?

204
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,850
That's Kong Shihao

205
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,646
I'll take a look

206
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,858
"Kong Shihao's fortune today"

207
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,403
"The forgotten enemy returns to you

208
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,364
Be careful no matter what.”

209
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,824
damn it

210
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,077
Ouch, that scared me.

211
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,119
(A fake police officer)

212
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,746
The fortune is pretty good.

213
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,542
Annoying guy

214
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,795
Oh, Detective Xu, it's me.
Can you tell me where Kong Shihao is now?

215
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,754
Bro, now you...

216
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,506
I won't do anything, I just want to confirm.

217
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,300
- I'll contact you if anything happens
-All right

218
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,971
Oh, that guy named Wen Bai.
I checked the records and the background is clean.

219
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,889
-Yeah?
-Um

220
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,060
Good to know
First of all, please tell me Kong Shihao's location as soon as possible.

221
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,231
Seniors give you

222
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,693
Thanks

223
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,987
- I have a request.
-Um

224
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,115
Could you help me research this person in more detail?

225
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,286
I will find out all the information.

226
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,829
- Be careful on the road
-Um

227
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,381
"Winter Moon Industry Wenbai"

228
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,769
Who is it?

229
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,646
Who are you?

230
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,983
Is Mr. Kong Shihao in there?

231
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,192
Is my eldest brother your friend?

232
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,360
No, go away.

233
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,405
There's a strange policeman running here and being arrogant...

234
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,324
Mr. Kong Shihao

235
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,496
Damn today's horoscope

236
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,165
How dare you, a lunatic, come here?

237
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,292
Hey, get out of the way.

238
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,712
Do you guys want to die? Get out of the way!

239
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,714
Get out of the way, you little bastard.

240
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,883
Don't make things worse, get out of the way!

241
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,555
Oh shit

242
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,770
Your eyes are really murderous.

243
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,439
Patrolman Lee

244
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,401
You should be concerned about the security situation in your area.
Why are you here?

245
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,989
Mr. Kong Shihao

246
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,326
Have you handled a gun recently?

247
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,410
gun?

248
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,998
gun?

249
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,792
no

250
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,878
What nonsense are you talking about when you suddenly barge in?

251
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,381
Answer me

252
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,551
Have you ever touched a gun?

253
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,930
Damn, are you shot in the head?

254
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,307
Do you see those are guns?

255
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,479
Hey, has any of you ever touched a gun...

256
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,399
Does even a toy gun count?

257
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,900
No!

258
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,529
Did you hear that?

259
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,164
Do you know this person?

260
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,127
Unknown

261
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,841
I heard it was under your command.
Someone who works at a place of business?

262
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,927
There are more than one or two people working under me.

263
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,430
How can I possibly know everyone?

264
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,224
Do you really not know?

265
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,480
About the gun
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

266
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,107
I don't know anything

267
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,443
Nothing to say

268
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,032
So from now on
I will look for relevant evidence one by one

269
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,326
If there is any evidence

270
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,080
Proof that Mr. Kong Shihao had touched a gun

271
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,876
You know what the consequences will be?

272
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,923
Alas, even if we do things without considering the consequences

273
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,093
I can't possibly do such a suicidal act.

274
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,354
You must keep this promise

275
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,151
After all, I have clearly warned you

276
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,458
Who is this guy?

277
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,335
Never seen this guy.

278
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,427
(Winter Moon Industry)

279
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,389
Please confirm
Does this person work here?

280
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,642
(Wen Bai, Technical Sales Representative of Dongyue Industry)

281
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,561
Sorry, we can't confirm it for you right away.

282
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,272
Military supply enterprises have special requirements even if there are official documents

283
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,358
It also takes a while to provide personal information

284
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,779
Senior, I have confirmed Wen Bai's address.

285
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,197
He lives in Dongjin Apartment

286
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,499
Hello?

287
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,042
It's me

288
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,460
What's wrong?

289
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:49,920
Do you have time?

290
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,965
Time? I have it.

291
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,882
Can we chat?

292
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,198
Hey, stand up again.

293
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,999
Wow

294
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,252
It's not even drugs.
But the gun was disguised as a courier?

295
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,171
What the hell is wrong with me?

296
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,381
how?

297
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,925
How safe is it to do this without arousing suspicion?

298
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,760
Those guys are smart.

299
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,847
Have you ever seen Koreans stealing other people’s express deliveries?

300
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,473
This is the national rule of the Republic of Korea.

301
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,767
Can you tell me more about that group of people?

302
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,896
I don't know

303
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,774
But they are really awesome.

304
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,735
How many guns are there?

305
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,154
A lot

306
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,615
About ten trucks?

307
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,699
Ten trucks?

308
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,868
Yeah but we just take it back

309
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,411
About half a truckload, right?

310
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,496
-How did you contact them?
-What's your name?

311
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,207
Oh, it's called "telegram", that's it.

312
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,167
But they only contact me when they want to.

313
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,126
Give me your phone

314
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,046
My phone was taken away by Kong Shihao

315
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,256
I don't even have games to play when I'm bored, bastard

316
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,177
Hello, have you checked the warehouse?

317
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,845
The door is locked

318
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,432
Well, that means Kong Shihao hasn't confirmed the warehouse yet.

319
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,100
Where is the address book?

320
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,770
Be careful before confirming.

321
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,772
The last time they went to the examination center

322
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,523
I also encountered a cop

323
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,441
Hello

324
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,361
There is a police officer present

325
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,404
This means that there must be a gun in the address book.

326
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,490
-Um?
-damn it

327
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh, you guys are so depressing.

328
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,707
(Brother Shihao)

329
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,875
Fucking asshole

330
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,211
Kong Shihao, this bastard
Why did I call you?

331
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,717
Zheng Wan

332
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,470
Your call was not answered

333
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,056
Please call again later...

334
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,851
Damn bastard

335
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,818
What? No.
Why did Minister Kong call you?

336
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,028
Damn, did he find out?

337
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,154
Hey, Jung-Wan

338
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,782
What are you still hesitating about?

339
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,326
Luckily I hid one for you.

340
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,996
Hey, what if someday
Kong Shihao found a gun in the warehouse

341
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,455
We're all screwed.

342
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,625
Hey, hurry up!

343
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,794
The early bird catches the worm

344
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,300
us

345
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,344
Go find a gun

346
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,555
-Yes.
-Oh shit

347
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,390
Go find them all.

348
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,850
Don't leave any behind

349
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,561
Hey, find them all out quickly!

350
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,896
- Act fast
-Fuck, let's go.

351
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,481
Hey, hurry up, little bastards.

352
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,858
Go fast

353
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,067
Hey, let's go!

354
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,694
-let's go!
-yes

355
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,695
Okay, let’s go!

356
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,539
Oh, today's meal is really good.

357
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,169
Oh, it must be delicious.

358
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,425
(Listening to the Voice of My Dead Son)

359
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,885
(Apology! Risk outsourcing is prohibited)

360
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,266
President, please talk to me.

361
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,227
Hey, haven't you dealt with that guy yet?

362
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,148
I just want to chat why is it so hard?

363
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,498
Ouch, why is the floor so slippery?

364
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,125
- Ouch, are you okay?
- Ouch, damn.

365
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,836
This guy always eats lunch with his head

366
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,837
Looks delicious.

367
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,209
Hey Turtle Town, aren't you answering the phone?

368
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,420
Is it okay for us to go to your mother's little restaurant?

369
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,463
Do you want your mother to die like your father?

370
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,548
Do you want to be an orphan?

371
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,925
-That kid has no father?
- Don't you know? You idiot.

372
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,885
So our Park Gu Jin is a waste.

373
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,387
It's pitiful for a mother to have a child like you.

374
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,222
-Why don't you reply?
- Are you crazy, asshole?

375
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,598
Come to school and try it, you're dead.

376
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,891
You idiot

377
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,562
Oh shit

378
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,367
Excuse me, do you live in No. 1311?

379
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,216
You're here? Do you want something to eat?

380
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,770
What do you do at Winter Moon Industries?

381
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,360
I develop and test bullets every day

382
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,530
Did you know?

383
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,993
Gun-free Republic of Korea
It is the largest exporter of bullets.

384
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,329
Isn’t it ironic?

385
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,754
What are you going to do when you get the gun?

386
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,008
This

387
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,344
I don't want to say

388
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,316
All right

389
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,238
I have cancer and I only have six months left

390
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,740
Maybe even shorter

391
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,285
Don't you believe me?

392
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,166
look

393
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,294
I had three surgeries in total.

394
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,965
It has spread everywhere with the blood.

395
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,510
Seoul first

396
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,597
Then Busan

397
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,725
From Busan to Gwangju

398
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,064
Cancer

399
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,526
Oh, it really is

400
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,903
It hurts so much

401
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,323
so

402
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,160
I was going to kill myself with a bang

403
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,252
But you only have bullets.

404
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,713
Where did the bullet come from?

405
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,968
I want to check the Internet to see if there are any privately made guns.
To end one's own life

406
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,137
But suddenly I found a strange website

407
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,889
Said he could give me a gun for free

408
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,309
So I thought
It doesn't matter if you get fooled, just click it.

409
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,811
(Click here if you want a gun)

410
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,982
After two or three days, a courier arrived.

411
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,235
But what pissed me off was that there were no guns in there.

412
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,906
Just a piece of paper and some bullets

413
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,036
Go to that website again

414
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,582
I think so too.

415
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,295
But no search results

416
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,506
The website is gone

417
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,216
(Unable to connect to the website, please try again)

418
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,887
So I looked at the address book in the courier.

419
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,724
It records
The address of people like me who ordered guns

420
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,270
So I just picked a place

421
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,772
Going to buy a gun

422
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,693
Where is that address book now?

423
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,529
I threw it away

424
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,323
I threw it away

425
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,950
Do you think I will believe it?

426
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,703
Oh, but I have a good memory.

427
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,329
All are recorded here

428
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,249
So that's it

429
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,962
Since you have such a good memory

430
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,923
Then put the address book in your mind

431
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,053
Write it all here

432
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,015
I know.

433
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:04,284
(No. 1 Daoming Road, Dongan District, Jingren City)

434
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:09,873
What's wrong?

435
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,583
Are you sure these addresses are correct?

436
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,210
Um

437
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,674
Hello!

438
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,843
Where are you going? Damn it.

439
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,264
(Aunt)

440
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,892
The number you dialed was not answered. Please wait for the beep...

441
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,689
oops

442
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,984
What is going on here?

443
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,696
-well
-President

444
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,823
How long should I hide from them?

445
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,492
Look here, President!

446
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,285
Is it that hard to clean up this gang?

447
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,413
Because their actions are not illegal.
I'll clean it up asap.

448
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,461
-Oh shit
- I'm sorry, Mr. President

449
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,588
You drive well.

450
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,964
Sorry she jumped out.

451
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,634
President, please get off the car

452
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,552
Let’s talk

453
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,054
Who is that?

454
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,056
Auntie, are you crazy? Damn it

455
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,892
Who do you think you are?
Dare to act wild here? Get out of the way!

456
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,520
Is it that difficult to apologize?

457
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,605
Let’s talk!

458
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,606
what to do?

459
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,983
What else can I do? Keep driving.

460
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,027
-Keep going?
-Do you want me to drive it?

461
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,904
Open it, you bastard.

462
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,324
I told you to keep driving!

463
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,161
Hey why did you stop?

464
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,747
-Auntie please...
- Open up the useless garbage for me

465
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:37,961
Let’s go!

466
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,674
What is she trying to get? What a crazy bitch.

467
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,926
-gun?
-Um?

468
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,344
President

469
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,137
Hey, look at that crazy bitch.

470
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,194
What's this?

471
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,085
(No. 1 Daoming Road, Dong'an District, Jingren City, Wu Jingshu)

472
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,430
-I’m sorry, President!
-Chiung

473
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,932
-Chi-hyung feed Ji-hyung!
-President

474
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,687
Do you know Hwang Min-joo?

475
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,607
Who is Huang Minzhou? Who?
I don't know at all!

476
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,327
have no idea?

477
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,078
How could I not know?

478
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,872
How could that be?

479
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,750
How could you not know Hwang Min Joo?

480
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,835
you…

481
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,046
How could you be like this?

482
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,800
Really, I really don’t know who Hwang Min Joo is!

483
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,219
He was your employee.

484
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:12,889
you

485
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,974
To save money

486
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,727
Forcing my son to work overtime

487
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,565
His body was cut in two.

488
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,401
I

489
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,446
I've been shouting so much that my voice is almost hoarse.

490
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,951
That's ridiculous.

491
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,287
How insignificant are we?

492
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,709
You even
You don’t even know the name of my dead son?

493
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:48,257
Please forgive me, really.
Please forgive me just this once.

494
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,887
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

495
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,766
Please spare me.

496
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,646
Don't apologize to me

497
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,776
Go apologize to my son.

498
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,712
Aunt, why don’t you answer the phone?

499
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,797
Patrolman Lee

500
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,176
I today

501
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,762
Finally heard the apology

502
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,143
I've been shouting for several days.

503
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,770
He seemed not to hear

504
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,231
As soon as I picked up the gun

505
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,568
That sentence came out easily.

506
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,278
aunt

507
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,696
Yes I know

508
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,074
I shouldn't do this

509
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,827
Now

510
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,163
I've heard the apology.

511
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,458
I have to pay for this.

512
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,461
Patrolman Lee Dao

513
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,463
Just let me

514
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,089
at last

515
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,718
Prepare a meal for my son.

516
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,109
Minjoo, eat more

517
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,112
Today mom

518
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,865
Finally heard an apology

519
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:38,951
Mom

520
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,625
I may not be able to cook for you for a while.

521
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,172
sorry

522
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,935
Patrolman Li?

523
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,407
Who are you?

524
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,284
Aunt

525
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:21,911
Um?

526
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,122
You have a gun, right?

527
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,430
What? Do you recognize this car?

528
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,099
Keep an eye on that car

529
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,763
(Aunt)

530
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,133
(Patrolman Li Dao)

531
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,936
It's really curious.

532
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,693
(Listening to the Voice of My Dead Son)

533
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,335
Wen Bai is not a patient person

534
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,721
-Oh shit
-Why did you scare me?

535
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,515
-What is this guy doing?
-What?

536
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,474
You bastards

537
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,061
Didn't I tell you not to park here?

538
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,521
Who are you?

539
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,147
Me? My name is Wenbai

540
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,565
-Hello
- You bastard

541
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,068
Why park your car on such a narrow road?

542
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,695
How can others pass?

543
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,329
Oh fuck, we meet again, asshole.

544
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,044
Look here

545
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,130
Take a photo of your funeral tablet

546
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,172
Smile
