1
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,500
Hey, be careful

2
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,295
Pull it up!

3
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,533
cut

4
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,534
Damn it!

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,787
oops

6
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,664
Who do they think they are?
You order me around so casually?

7
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,209
Do they know who I am? Damn it

8
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,712
When the boss made his first deal
The other party will definitely be very vigilant

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,672
Are they the only ones who are wary?

10
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,509
- We also have to stay vigilant
-knew

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,468
Hide some knives.

12
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,640
Big Brother

13
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,933
Hey, take another knife.

14
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,850
-knife?
-Um

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,228
Brother, they asked you to go over now.

16
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,063
Hey, did you see what those guys look like?

17
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,940
I didn't see their faces

18
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,983
Didn't see the face?

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,235
Yeah, I can't see it.

20
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,154
Damn, could it be a ghost?

21
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,656
damn it

22
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,659
-Hide the knife
-yes

23
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,787
-How many knives did you bring? Two?
- I just brought one

24
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,541
-Brother, this way.
-Um

25
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,755
What the fuck?

26
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,382
I really can't see anything.

27
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,884
What's that bag over there, bro?

28
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,511
Oh shit

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,805
Fuck it

30
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,348
What's this?

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,018
Is it US dollars? What is this for?

32
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,777
Hey, I heard

33
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,071
Are you looking for other distribution channels besides us?

34
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,448
Why do the same job twice?

35
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,658
What a hassle!

36
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,369
Leave it to us.

37
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,580
We can do it all cleanly and neatly

38
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,583
Hey, take this.

39
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,668
ah!

40
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,840
So what exactly are you distributing?

41
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:59,345
"Beyond the Gun"

42
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,566
(Probation officer bastard)

43
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,110
It's fucking endless. Really.

44
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,404
What happened again?

45
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,780
I am the supervisor

46
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,992
Where are you now?
I'm calling you to confirm your location.

47
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,621
Stop it, you bastard, are you looking for death?

48
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,664
Hey, please don't swear.

49
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,417
I just want to make sure you're coming home.

50
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,794
There are 20 minutes left until curfew.

51
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,796
I'm on my way home!

52
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,341
I'll be home soon!

53
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,967
I'm hanging you bastard!

54
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,850
Damn asshole fucking asshole

55
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,561
You stinky bastard are really looking for death

56
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,747
-it hurts
-Who are you?

57
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,165
Hey, I told you it hurts.

58
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,378
Driver, have you ever driven this person before?

59
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,005
This person just got off the car

60
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,006
senior!

61
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,468
This is Quan Yuancheng's electronic anklet and mobile phone.

62
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,409
If it's the police
You should say "I am a police officer" before entering.

63
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,662
How can police officers run around with hammers?

64
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,039
Aren't there things like stun guns?

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,459
What is your relationship with Quan Yuancheng?

66
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,005
Jeon Won-sung? I don't know this person.

67
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,883
You went to a stranger's house to look for a package?

68
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,635
Oh, I really don't know

69
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,806
I received a courier box a few days ago.

70
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,768
It's loaded with bullets.
And it is divided into categories

71
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,488
Only bullets?

72
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,615
What about the gun?

73
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,825
What gun?

74
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,994
There are only bullets in the delivery box

75
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,038
So you're here looking for a gun?

76
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,375
You're not a policeman.
Why do you always hold a hammer?

77
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,002
Tell me the truth quickly

78
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,671
I'm telling the truth.

79
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,716
There are only bullets in the delivery box

80
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,010
There is also a contact book

81
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,219
Address book?

82
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,764
Um, name, address, phone number

83
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,390
A fully organized address book

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,188
I was curious too, so I came here to look for it.

85
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,814
But when I got here, I was scared.

86
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,441
So just wander around

87
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,361
Then I saw the people who lived here suddenly ran out

88
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,199
Is this the person?

89
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,909
That's right, it's this person.

90
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,204
He was in such a hurry to go out that he left without even closing the door.

91
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,374
I took this opportunity to come in and look at the box.

92
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,376
It's all empty inside

93
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,509
Then

94
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,761
You just come in

95
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,691
It's me

96
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,694
Did you find Quan Yuan?

97
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,490
No, that guy seems to be deliberately deceiving us.
I left my phone in a taxi.

98
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,496
What about the gun?

99
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,748
No guns in the car?

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,333
No guns

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,836
We'll find this guy as soon as possible.

102
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,629
- Be careful and stay connected
-Um

103
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,805
Hey, thank you for your hard work.
I am Patrolman Li Dao from Daoming Police Station.

104
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,268
Please confirm
The surveillance camera in the alley at No. 45-2, Zhengri Road

105
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,604
We received a report that Jeon Won-sung is out.

106
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,897
Please confirm

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,024
"Please confirm."

108
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,280
Yes, I will contact you as soon as possible after confirmation.

109
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,614
Okay, please.

110
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,637
Is it Jeon Won-sung?

111
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,185
Does he have a gun?

112
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,365
I

113
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,159
Will help you

114
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,785
Don't move

115
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,662
one

116
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,707
Wait and don't move

117
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,751
two

118
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,128
three!

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,554
Hello, Patrolman Lee Dao

120
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,932
I checked Jeon Won-sung's whereabouts

121
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,600
He seems to be on the move

122
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,809
On the move?

123
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,854
Please continue to track his whereabouts.

124
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,211
Hey you bastard!

125
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,104
Caught

126
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,155
But who is this person? He doesn't live there.

127
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,747
（Surveillance video control room）

128
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,129
Did you find him?

129
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,798
-Yes
-Where is the exact location?

130
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,385
25 minutes ago
In front of Shuanglong Hotel, 3 km ahead

131
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,012
Found the whereabouts of Jeon Won-sung

132
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,763
Can you leave right away?

133
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,889
Yeah but

134
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,183
I can't rush over right now.

135
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,407
Hello, Patrolman Zhang?

136
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,160
I am under the surveillance camera at No. 45-5 Road, Xiping District

00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,662
Arrested the man who broke into Quan Yuancheng's house

Where to go now?

140
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,796
-Hello, Chief
-Um

141
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,299
I'm leaving. Please tell me his moving route.

142
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,927
From now on we will track backwards

143
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,512
Quan Yuancheng's movement traces in the first 28 minutes

144
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,935
All team members
Please follow the moving route of Quan Yuancheng to track his location

145
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,396
-knew
-Wow, so nervous.

146
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,023
ten

147
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,942
Nine, eight

148
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,236
seven

149
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,196
how?

150
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,824
Oh, this? This is what I just said.

151
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,285
A bunch of different types of bullets

152
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,499
We're all ready here.
Patrolman Li Dao, are you ready?

153
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
I'm ready.

154
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,587
Yes, please tell me.

155
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,048
From now on, I will tell you the movement route of Jeon Won-sung

156
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,466
Tell you exactly as it is

157
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,762
Be careful

158
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,891
200 meters ahead, turn right in front of Shuanglong Hotel

159
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,643
Let’s go!

160
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,228
(Shuanglong Hotel)

161
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,411
I saw Jeon Won-sung on Park Road

162
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,495
Cast on the big screen

163
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,333
He turned right at 4 o'clock on Parkway 409th Street

164
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,127
Go straight for 30 meters from your current location...

165
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,130
- Turn right after 10 meters
-Turn right!

166
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,593
Continue straight

167
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,067
I found where Jeon Won-sung was 21 minutes ago

168
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,111
Next turn right at the Laundromat

169
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,030
(laundry)

170
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,453
16 minutes ago, Quan Yuancheng entered the blind spot of the surveillance camera

171
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,164
This road leads to the lake crossing

172
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,833
Check the roads adjacent to the lake intersection

173
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,293
You can find it immediately

174
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,294
Check it out now

175
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,965
Found it!

176
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,426
He walked into the underground passage from the lake crossroads

177
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,763
Underground passage?

178
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,433
Vehicles cannot enter there.
I need to find a detour. Please wait.

179
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,059
There's no time. Please hurry up.

180
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,144
Let's go first

181
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,856
Turn right!

182
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,821
Please confirm his appearance and clothing.

183
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,907
The color of the clothes or some other feature

184
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,283
He is wearing an orange hoodie and windbreaker

185
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,036
Yes he is wearing an orange hoodie and windbreaker

186
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,370
And overalls

187
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,413
Yes, that's right.

188
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,999
Oh, that's right.
He also had a fishing bag or something like that on his back.

189
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,878
Is the director still carrying a fishing bag?

190
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,838
Carrying a similar bag

191
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,715
There must be a gun in there.

192
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,217
What? A gun?

193
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,095

Jeon Won-sung walks through the underground passage and turns right

194
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,723
I rely on

195
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
But can we do it?

196
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,769
"us"?

197
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,897
Yes, we are a team now.

198
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,565
Stop kidding, focus.

199
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,836
Is this a fucking blank?

200
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,712
Are you kidding me?

201
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,298
He entered the modern market.

202
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,092
Keep going forward

203
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,761
Then turn right along the fruit shop towards the Modern Market

204
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,054
Turn right over there

205
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,479

Saw him at the pharmacy 13 minutes ago

207
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,774
Wait a moment

208
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,236
This is an area with no surveillance video.

209
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,280
We need to check the surrounding surveillance before telling you.

210
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,492
There are three roads intersecting here

213
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,665

00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,561
Enter Jincheng Road and go straight ahead for 500 meters

229
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,604

230
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,069

Go straight ahead for 800 meters

232
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,961
But where is Jeon Won-sung going with the gun?

233
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,255
What about you? What are you going to do with the gun?

234
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,258
Stop doubting me. I'm still driving for you.

235

240
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,272

242
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,277

Can I call you later?

243
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,904

I'm back

247
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,416
There is a three-way intersection at the end of the road ahead.
Turn left there

248
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,630
There will be a downhill slope after 200 meters

249
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,636
The whole process is to walk from there to the city center.

250
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,388

251
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,848

Live video playback on the big screen

261

There are too many people here.

Please stay within 100 meters of the square exit
Tracking each surveillance video

263
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,145
I started tracking from the entrance of the square

264
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,730
OK

265
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,359
The 30-meter west side of the square did not capture Quan Yuancheng

266
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,987

Nor did they capture Quan Yuancheng.

The surveillance video 50 meters to the north did not capture him either.

270
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,082
The surveillance video on the south side did not capture him either.

271
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,041
Wait a moment

272
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,001
This is a bit weird

273
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,295
How could he disappear from the surveillance screen?

274
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,297
Even if we missed it

275
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,300
If you want to go to the square
He must be heading in the direction of the monitor.

276

00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,322
Is it possible that he went to the police station?

00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,301
But didn't you say those guns couldn't be used?

367
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,053
There are no bullets.

368
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,390
I have bullets

369
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,476
-What is the password?
-0920

370
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,686
Oh shit!

371
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,860
I'm going to get his attention.
You brought these police officers

372
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,111
Run to a safe place

373
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,367
So these guys aren't that great.
How dare you be so arrogant?

374
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,384
Hello

375
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,263
Do you think you can avoid death this way?

376
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,184
Um?

377
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,323
damn it

378
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,476
Fuck it

379
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,894
Oh shit

380
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,439
You fucking bastard!

381
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,610
Damn bastard

382
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,323
Fuck it!

383
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:44,918
come out

384
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,347
Run!

385
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,863
Squad leader!

386
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,543
He's bleeding a lot and we need to stop the bleeding first

387
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,795
What are you doing?

388
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,880
Hello here!

389
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,966
Can you please let me go soon?

390
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,010
I just drove for you.

391
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,886
Let me go quickly

392
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,722
Okay? Damn it.

393
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,307
Hey, I told you to let me go!

394
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,650
- Give me the gauze first
-Good for you

395
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,196
- And a bandage.
-good

396
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,576
I'll cover you.

397
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,912
You shoot whenever you get the chance.

398
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,499
Yes, I understand.

399
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,339
(Evidence Storage Room)

400
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,322
It feels disturbing.

401
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,417
What happened over there?

402
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,460
(Reporter)

403
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,016
(Inspector Seo Hyung-joo of Gyeonginse Police Station)

404
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,644
Hello

405
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,854
Monitor, are you okay?

406
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,856
We'll be there soon

407
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,900
Don't come up straight after you arrive.

408
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,695
Act with the support team

409
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,779
Got it?

410
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,823
Don't come up by yourself.

411
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,076
What are you talking about?

412
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:43,847
Wait for me

413
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,203
Please answer

414
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,668
Due to the storm, we cannot identify the enemy and our own troops.

415
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,464
All members are isolated and must retreat!

416
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,299
- Please wait a moment
-Save me

417
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,009
Li Dao's retreat is the top priority

418
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,011
This is an order to retreat quickly!

419
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,221
No, there are still survivors at the scene.

420
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,224
Leave a message
We will be wiped out, retreat quickly!

421
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:52,957
Hey I'm so fucking scared of you people

422
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,795
There has to be a limit to pretentiousness.

423
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,514
Especially your subordinates

424
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,809
That stupid big guy

425
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,519
That bastard

426
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,105
He turned off the surveillance and beat me up.

427
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,779
As a result, that bastard

428
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,699
See me holding a gun
Like a dog, he ran away trembling.

429
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,494
Look at you, you little bastard.

430
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:31,996
how?

431
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,292
Can't you escape after being shot?

432
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,795
Yes, that's right

433
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,548
You are right

434
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,011
I no longer have the strength to resist you

435
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,346
So what?

436
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,765
but

437
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,898
I will never beg a bastard like you

438
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,902
Spare my life

439
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,660
Wow

440
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,537
Are you still trying to be brave until the end?

441
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,083
Feed me

442
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,836
I have a question

443
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,255
you…

444
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,056
How many children do you have?

445
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,726
You little bastard

446
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,784
What the fuck...

447
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,287
What are you doing?

448
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,711
Why don't you bastards come out?

449
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,882
Where the fuck are you hiding?
Come out here you bastards!

450
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,693
Which asshole fired that shot?

451
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,236
Come out you bastards!

452
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,697
Oh shit

453
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,955
Come out here, asshole!

454
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,627
come out!

455
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,771
damn it

456
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,790
You bastard

457
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,252
How dare you, a bastard, play tricks on me?

458
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,757
Then give it a try, you bastard!

459
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,810
Are you the cop from before?

460
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,854
Are you scared?

461
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,731
Come out you bastard!

462
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,362
Why the hell is it always against me?

463
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,514
Jeon Won-sung, put down your gun

464
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,730
Fuck you

465
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,944
One last warning, put down your gun.

466
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,155
OK, I know. I know.

467
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,241
Here

468
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,408
The gun is here

469
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,828
Monitor, are you okay?

470
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,623
Yes, squad leader, it's ok.

471
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,186
I don't want to hold a gun anymore.

472
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,231
If you have a gun...

473
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,233
Put down the gun!

474
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,068
Put down the gun!

475
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,946
To save someone's life

476
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,744
I'll end up killing someone else.

477
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,207
Please put down your gun.

478
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:19,226
