1
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,600
Are you feeling better?

2
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,060
Hmm?

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,063
Yeah, it feels okay.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,153
What happened to you in the past?

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,613
Hmm?

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,576
You said your mother passed away.

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,542
My house was burglarized

8
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,713
Everyone in the family is dead

9
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,840
I am the only one who survived

10
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,136
If my brother were still alive

11
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,060
He should be about your age.

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,317
Have you ever thought about revenge?

13
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,198
What? If you want to find it, you can definitely find it.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,326
Why don't you just go find him?

15
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,328
Kill with one shot?

16
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,163
Forget it

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,168
you mean

18
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,545
Aren't you and I the same kind of people?

19
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,174
“He has been judged by the law.
So it doesn't matter

20
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,175
Because I’m a police officer.”

21
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,723
Human nature does not change easily

22
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,519
Those bastards dug my eyes out

23
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,354
Even if you don't do that to me

24
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,398
He would also dig out other children's eyes.

25
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,567
If revenge destroys my life

26
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,695
Is that the right choice?

27
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,958
"Beyond the Gun"

28
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,968
Overnight

29
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,846
How did it become like this?

30
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,673
I got a call from Jack.

31
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,341
how?

32
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,719
Some people are interested in the current situation in South Korea

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,180
Seems to want to contact us

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,100
Tell him I'll see him in person before I decide.

35
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,853
He is worried about you too.

36
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,605
Worry about me?

37
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,565
Still worried about business?

38
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,161
(Reporter Wang Daxian)

39
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,121
(I have to tell you something)

40
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,497
(Li Dao wakes up)

41
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,632
Thank you for coming

42
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,886
before

43
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,263
In the Middle East

44
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,557
When fighting with Li Dao

45
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,021
See there
Both children and adults are fully armed

46
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,690
Weapons pile up in the streets

47
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,735
I thought to myself: "If South Korea could use guns freely
What will happen next? "

48
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,406
At that time I felt
That kind of thing would never happen in our country.

49
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,785
so

50
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,828
How is the gun recovery going?

51
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,914
After the Liu Zhengtai and Quan Yuancheng cases

52
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,249
The direction of the investigation has changed

53
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,584
They started using real courier services

54
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,797
The other party seems to understand very well
The Characteristics and System of Koreans

55
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,174
Guns on the market in the past few days

56
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,510
About 10,000

57
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,303
possible

58
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,472
Because after the scene of the senior being shot was broadcast

59
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,724
The guns were quickly shipped out.

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,602
Terror marketing actually worked

61
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,354
"I don't want to end up like this.

62
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,231
Just pick up the gun."

63
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,984
This is the gun

64
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,653
The scariest place

65
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,737
That's right

66
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,741
“Your body is in your own hands
You have to protect yourself with a gun."

67
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,035
I'm sure everyone thinks so too.

68
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,794
Captain, you have to look at this.

69
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,840
(Gun legalization supporters rally)

70
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,551
This is what just circulated on social media

71
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,511
It has been forwarded 300,000 times

72
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:08,850
It's the dean

73
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,852
The president is preparing a speech

74
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,145
Martial law may be declared

75
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,648
In that case
South Korea will once again become a country ruled by guns

76
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,317
Okay, everyone, please pay attention.

77
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,945
Instantly confirm current available manpower
Everyone must start

78
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,698
Find out the forces that are leading this rally as soon as possible

79
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,034
If the gathering grows in size
We don't know what will happen.

80
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:26,951
-yes
-yes

81
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,501
Um?

82
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,712
What's wrong?

83
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,590
Look at this

84
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,300
What's this?

85
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,888
Is it a rally in support of gun legality?

86
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,307
(Gun legalization supporters rally)

87
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,602
If everyone gets together at a time like this, something bad will happen.

88
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,693
Unprecedented gun shooting
and the distribution of unidentified firearms

89
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,906
Some people have also proposed
The argument that “citizens should be allowed to own guns”

90
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,825
To convey their wishes to the government

91
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,994
Gun legalization supporters form protest group

92
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:10,953
Against guns!

93
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,039
Anti-gun protesters

94
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,334
A counter-rallied
Public fears of possible large-scale conflict

95
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,335
(No firearms allowed)

96
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,670
Has anyone really been shot here?

97
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,340
I was taken from some lunatic.

98
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,925
Survivor

99
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,219
We can live well without guns.

100
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,221
Now guns are everywhere

101
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,139
Who knows what else could happen, right?

102
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,434
We have to think about our family and future.

103
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,978
Fight to the death against gun freedom!

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,189
-Strongly oppose!
- Guns are definitely allowed!

105
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:42,151
-Strongly oppose!
-Definitely allow!

106
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,912
Mother

107
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,664
Daughter, are you still in the hospital?

108
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,249
Um

109
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,668
I have to continue working the night shift this week.

110
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,254
How are you? Are you okay?

111
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,256
What can I do?

112
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,633
I heard that a lot of people were shot recently.

113
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,219
Your hospital must be very busy.

114
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,512
Mom, I have to work.

115
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:10,972
Hang up first

116
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:11,973
Oh ok

117
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,948
(funeral parlor)

118
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,877
Patrolman Zhang

119
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,629
I have to go see that rally.

120
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,134
Director

121
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,387
I will do my best to send him off for the last time.

122
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll leave it to you.

123
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,240
Hello

124
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,035
I told you that if you talk back
I will never forgive you

125
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,953
sorry

126
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,791
Are you qualified to question the work schedule?

127
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,668
You do whatever you are told to do.

128
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,462
Yes, sorry.

129
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,178
Hello

130
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,514
We just need to pass a message to the head nurse.

131
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,059
You don't want to stay here any longer.

132
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,937
You know what? Don't be so arrogant.

133
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,984
If she does that again, tell me.

134
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:47,902
Oh, it's really annoying.

135
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,446
Today I ate spicy chicken feet

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,656
Is this the same one you ordered last time?

137
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,325
Of course, is there any need to ask?

138
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,702
Teacher, you are so thoughtful.

139
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,867
If guns were legalized

140
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,952
(Oppose gun legalization)

141
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,580
Then it's like
Masks are a necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic

142
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,125
Bulletproof vests have become a necessity now.

143
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,460
We want guns!

144
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,714
Legalize guns!

145
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,091
Do you want to live in such a world?

146
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,260
Against guns!

147
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,263
According to police estimates
Demonstrators in support of gun legalization

148
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,558
More than 10,000 people
And the number is still increasing

149
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,935
The police are
Prepare for possible emergencies

150
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,395
They are also trying their best to hunt down those who led the demonstrations...

151
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,813
...personally chairs the National Security Council

152
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,150
Fearing a large-scale conflict between the two factions
All police forces have been mobilized...

153
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,944
Police speculate
The forces behind the recruitment of protesters on social media

154
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,487
Two-color eyes...

155
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,615
Currently looking for their base

156
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,451
But no definite clues have been found yet

157
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,628
(No caller ID)

158
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,315
Did you enjoy this trip to hell?

159
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,654
Why me?

160
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,368
In the Beginning

161
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,328
Just curious.

162
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,997
What about me

163
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,542
To my friend at the Examination Yuan

164
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,210
Have great expectations

165
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,671
Although this is not an obligation to comply

166
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,590
But the so-called rules
It was made for everyone to follow, so...

167
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,635
What the hell does it have to do with you?

168
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,263
I'm fine. Everyone is watching.

169
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,563
Suddenly a patrolman showed up.

170
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,399
Stopped that guy

171
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,528
So I checked with the patrolman.

172
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,946
(TOP SECRET)

173
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,074
Found out that he had killed countless people with a gun

174
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,619
But now he refuses to pick up a gun

175
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,496
I think it's funny

176
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,876
Is that face the real you?

177
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,295
Or is it fake?

178
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,965
At that moment, I suddenly had an interesting idea.

179
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,762
If you pick up the gun again

180
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,306
What changes will there be?

181
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,976
What do you think of me?

182
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,936
We also have something in common

183
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,481
A garbage childhood

184
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,358
The feeling of being overwhelmed by revenge

185
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,070
Even the guns were picked up for revenge.

186
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,949
Don't take your actions
The argument seems to have some philosophical meaning.

187
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,829
You're just taking advantage of other people's anxiety.

188
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,792
A cheap businessman who comes to make money

189
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,424
Can I sell you another gun now?

190
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,676
What does it mean to me?

191
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,304
I'm just curious

192
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,808
If this country allowed guns

193
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,643
What will happen next?

194
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,103
That's all

195
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,360
There are more people who want guns than I thought

196
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,862
More?

197
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,576
In order to vent my accumulated resentment

198
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,912
This gun

199
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,082
It became the final choice

200
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,840
No, I don't need anything now.

201
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,219
Sorry, I've been feeling troubled since just now.

202
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,222
Whether you follow like a father

203
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,099
Police Station Chief

204
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,604
Oh Kyung-sook

205
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,654
Finally saved them

206
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,322
Thanks

207
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,533
They're all guns

208
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,838
In a world where the strong devour the weak

209
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,924
Can protect them

210
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,302
Not your cheap sympathy

211
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,681
It's a gun that can realize your own justice.

212
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,853
So I want to live in a world where everyone has a gun

213
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,856
A utopia of equality for all

214
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,316
That's all

215
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,984
wrong

216
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,403
Such a utopia does not exist

217
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,908
That would just make this place a

218
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,870
A hell where people keep killing each other

219
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,416
it's a pity

220
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,506
I thought

221
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,470
Only you will understand me

222
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,681
So

223
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,767
Do you want to take a look?

224
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,977
Who is right?

225
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,799
What are you going to do?

226
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,390
I will show you the world I want

227
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,810
You watch carefully here.

228

-What car?
-What is that?

229

There's a gun in front of you.

230
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,073
What are you hesitating about?

231
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,992
Take it away quickly

232
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,327
gun

233
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,245
It's a gun!

234
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,878
This is the gun come on!

235

Trucks in the middle of the square began distributing guns

236

237

244

-no
-Why not?

257
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,656
I obviously didn't do anything
I almost got shot and died.

258
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,658
Damn, if I don’t want to die, I have to shoot first!

259
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,576

What is it

268
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,960

I just

272
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,825
Just gave them the gun.

273
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,287
Pull the trigger?

274
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,499
That's their own choice.

275
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,015
Li Dao

276
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,147
If the gunfire sounds now

277
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,858
What will happen to people?

278
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,777
Is this what you wanted?

279
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,282
no

280
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,951
What I want is

281
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,455
A gunshot

282
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,382

Just one gunshot

285
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,690
If it's for revenge
And the trigger pull is less than 5 mm

286
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,233
So the fear

287
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,778
Wouldn’t it spread in everyone’s mind?

288
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,073
Because I'm afraid I'll die without a gun

289
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,576
So everyone wants a gun.

290
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,704
Then such a society

291
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,831
It will be destroyed

292
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,723
Don't shoot!

293
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,791
