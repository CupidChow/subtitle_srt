1
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,613
Um?

2
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,832
Aunt!

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,377
Are you okay?

4
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,172
Today is the coldest day this year.

5
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,840
Can you stand up?

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,386
Come, I'll take you home now

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,637
Alas, thank you

8
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,572
Give it to me

9
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,121
Sorry

10
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,250
I owe you another favor this time

11
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,252
You have to keep your promise to me.

12
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,588
You said you would take a break every hour.

13
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,258
I want to, but I can't do it

14
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,929
I have to keep fighting.

15
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,264
-Other people’s treasures…
- Other people's precious children

16
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,766
can be protected

17
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,895
Because I just stood by and watched
The world will never change, right?

18
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,065
I understand how my aunt feels.

19
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,610
But you have to take care of yourself first
This is the most important thing

20
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,362
Ouch

21
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,449
Someone who understands me and cares about me

22
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,618
It's just you, Patrolman Li.

23
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,163
Of course you should go back and have a rest.

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,081
good

25
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,625
Oh wait a minute

26
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,627
Wait here and don't leave.

27
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,636
This one

28
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,890
This is my newly pickled cinnamon. It's delicious. Take it.

29
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,393
It's okay, auntie, I have plenty of food at home.

30
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,230
Didn’t you say that the side dishes I cooked are very much to your liking?

31
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,358
- It's really okay, auntie.
-Ouch

32
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:37,282
Seeing you reminds me of my son. Take it.

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,828
Thanks

34
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,873
I'm leaving first

35
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,899
"Beyond the Gun"

36
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,610
Auntie will be here soon. It's okay.

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,570
Please don't fall asleep, okay, auntie?

38
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,488
Can you hear me?

39
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,450
No outsiders are allowed in here

40
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,826
Please wait outside.

41
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,707
(Operating Room)

42
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,627
Will everything be okay?

43
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,639
(During surgery)

44
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,556
Where are you going?

45
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,600
Where are you going!

46
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,871
That "fake police officer" is here again

47
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,502
What?

48
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,420
This kid is here again?

49
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,594
Didn't I clearly warn you?

50
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,390
Patrolman Li, are you really crazy?

51
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,268
Where is Kong Shihao?

52
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,369
(emergency room)

53
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,252
What's going on?

54
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,672
(Brother Li Dao)

55
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,426
Where are you, bro? What's going on?

56
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,679
Go search for the people over there.
See if they have a contact list.

57
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,763
Address book?

58
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,599
Hey, search their pockets.

59
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,517
Hold him down

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,561
What are you pressing? Damn it.

61
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,812
Don't move you little bastard

62
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,565
Damn you son of a bitch, get out of here and don't touch me

63
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,445
Damn you bastards.

64
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,905
Shit fuck it hurts

65
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,075
What's this?

66
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,618
elder brother

67
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,079
Have you checked the car parked in the alley?

68
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,873
No, there is no surveillance video over there.

69
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,459
So I'm still checking if there's any surveillance video nearby.

70
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,918
What about the address book?

71
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,965
What is this address book?

72
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,727
Compare

73
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,733
No. 5, 1 Daoming Road

74
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,526
Oh Kyung-suk

75
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,570
What's this?

76
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,490
Isn't this the same address?

77
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,908
That's right

78
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,787
Shootings to date
I don't think it's random.

79
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,163
What is that?

80
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,125
Organized crime

81
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,420
Someone sent these guys guns by courier.

82
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,130
To take advantage of their situation.

83
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,008
Hopefully they'll finally pull the trigger.

84
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,886
The serial shooting perpetrators

85
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,639
Neither is someone who can easily access guns at work

86
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,725
Nor do they have enough money to smuggle guns themselves.

87
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,435
They are just ordinary people.

88
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,937
(Rongcheng Examination Institute)

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,522
Why did they receive the gun?

90
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,025
Because someone is taking advantage of their situation.
Hopefully they'll pull the trigger.

91
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,194
We speculate that there is a specific force behind this

92
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,196
The address book you see

93
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,781
It's the evidence

94
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,828
So there's a gun and an address book in every delivery box?

95
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,503
Why put this thing there? What is the intention?

96
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,965
Because the person who received the address book
Exposing information to each other

97
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,135
This situation may cause anxiety

98
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,930
The man who got the gun
You'll know who else has guns.

99
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,392
Others will also know that they have guns

100
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,270
Do you remember what Liu Zhengtai said during the Examination Yuan incident?

101
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,688
gun

102
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,523
There's more

103
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,067
There are still a lot of people with guns outside.

104
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,946
Someone might go to someone else because they need a gun.

105
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,406
If some people need more guns...

106
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,074
Will you go find it yourself?

107
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,161
That's right, Zhao Yutai used the address book

108
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,495
Go find a gun

109
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,372
Aunt

110
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,541
You have a gun, right?

111
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,419
They didn't just simply give these people guns.

112
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,504
And also watching closely in secret

113
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,340
The actions of the person who got the gun

114
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,802
What's up with the names in this address book?

115
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,971
Please see here

116
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,682
When creating a mobile account you have to enter a nickname

117
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,100
They probably used these nicknames.

118
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,062
This is all private information.
How did they get this information?

119
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,981
People in the address book

120
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,649
They probably have malware on their phones.

121
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,359
Yes, that's right.

122
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,029
Yoo Jung-tae, Jeon Won-sung, and Oh Kyung-sook's cell phones

123
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
Malware is embedded in it

124
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,951
Call records, text messages
Even personal information can be seen

125
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,287
Wait a moment

126
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,874
Didn’t you say there was no actual record of delivery?

127
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,337
So I think
They were deliberately disguised as couriers.

128
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,130
(Examination Yuan)

129
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,174
For Koreans
Delivery is part of daily life

130
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,302
No one will care about or touch other people's things

131
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,138
Who on earth would do such a thing?

132
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,139
What is the purpose?

133
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,601
If that's the case
That's not a serious problem.

134
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,269
Let’s verify the information first

135
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:46,025
Check these people's real names first.
Confirm that the addresses are consistent

136
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,363
The most important thing is to confirm whether there is really a gun.
Then collect all of them back

137
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,031
-Yes, I know.
-Yes, I know.

138
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,783
Detective Xu

139
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,700
yes

140
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,497
Did Li Dao find out all this?

141
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,250
Yes, it was Patrolman Li who found it out.

142
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,793
Including today's case of Wu Jingshu

143
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,421
He is still under punishment.
Let him be careful not to be targeted.

144
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,339
yes

145
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,592
But it was thanks to him that we found the clue

146
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,386
- So keep investigating.
-yes

147
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,428
Do you understand what I mean?

148
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,346
Yes I know

149
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,557
- Tell him you've worked hard.
-yes

150
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,069
Oh, senior, are you available to chat now?

151
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:30,987
Well, you tell me.

152
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,283
I asked about the person named Wenbai

153
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,327
That Dongyue Industry is indeed nationally certified

154
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,371
Military supply companies that export military weapons

155
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,207
The security there is really strict.

156
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,751
They said they need official documents to reply me.

157
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,670
So I just confirmed some basic information.

158
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,883
Wenbai worked until the end of last year and then quit

159
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,388
The reason for leaving was terminal cancer

160
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,182
He also has a good reputation among employees.

161
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,517
Yeah?

162
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,396
But how did you get involved with him?

163
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,731
This is a long story.

164
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,191
It's good for the two of us to know this.

165
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,818
Yes, I know, senior.

166
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,497
What?

167
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,708
Where have you been? Why are you back now?

168
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,085
How could you just leave without saying a word?

169
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,673
Have you been staying here all this time?

170
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,675
Of course you can't see that?

171
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,811
This is none of your business, why bother...

172
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,192
how?

173
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,152
I've never seen you like this.

174
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,114
Just say thank you

175
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,616
If you are grateful

176
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,375
I really don't understand you

177
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,386
If only I hadn't hung up on her.

178
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,766
Before

179
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,437
What did my aunt say?

180
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,148
Um?

181
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,235
In the car

182
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,778
Wow

183
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,116
Did you see how chaotic it was before?

184
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,662
She said

185
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,666
"Even if I die, I have no regrets now.

186
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,793
Don’t bother.”

187
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,379
That's all I have to say

188
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,512
Why do you call her aunt?
She's not your relative.

189
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,848
because

190
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,977
She treats me like her son.

191
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,647
I understand

192
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,152
But your mother would be very sad if she heard it.

193
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,074
She died when I was a child.

194
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,785
Don't move, you bastard!

195
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,714
sorry

196
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,260
I don't have a mother who asks out of curiosity.

197
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,639
Your mother died too?

198
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,976
Who knows if she is dead or alive?

199
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,732
I just know

200
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,819
The day I was abandoned

201
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,448
It snowed heavily

202
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,246
(Please write your name and date of birth)

203
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,758
Excuse me

204
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,598
Are you going to put the baby in it?

205
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,273
Give it to me then
Anyway, I am the one who takes it out.

206
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,900
that…

207
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,693
It doesn't matter

208
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,821
It's okay

209
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,989
If you put it there

210
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,991
The baby will be cold.

211
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,246
Does the baby have a name?

212
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,123
name?

213
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,627
Abandoned my mother

214
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,505
Did you give me a name?

215
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,771
Is it a boy or a girl?

216
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,982
I don't know if I should leave before I get caught.

217
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,904
If it's a boy, it'll be worth more.

218
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:34,957
(Milk Supply Station)

219
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,544
If you want to buy them, buy them both together.

220
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,754
Damn, if I only dig out one eye

221
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,424
Where can you sell that one-eyed piece of trash?

222
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:47,011
He said he only needed one
But he said he would pay a high price.

223
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:47,928
What?

224
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,346
He said he would pay a high price.

225
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,807
Okay, how much?

226
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,601
How about 100 million?

227
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,353
Then please tell me the blood type you need.

228
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,479
Type AB

229
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,939
Oh ok

230
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,317
- Make sure you choose fresh
-Oh sure.

231
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,362
Okay, let's open the door.

232
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,782
Make a good fortune

233
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:15,080
I'll look at AB type...

234
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,711
Hello, it's you

235
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,671
Come over here

236
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,006
Um

237
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,098
What are you going to drink today? Soju?

238
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,602
Do you want to drink beer? No

239
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:41,106
Drink foreign wine

240
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,568
Let's drink wine together

241
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,486
Ouch

242
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,447
I worked hard today and I still managed to keep one.

243
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,284
Hey, let's go have a drink.

244
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,246
At that moment my intuition told me

245
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,794
My future life will be very difficult.

246
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,675
And the intuition soon became reality

247
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,555
After being abandoned several times and coming back

248
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,725
They sent me far away

249
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,358
-Mother
-What for?

250
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,860
What's good about going to the United States?

251
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,196
Anywhere is better than here

252
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,740
Stay here like this

253
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,202
Your life will become a stinking ditch

254
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,205
America is a land of opportunity

255
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,000
Just try to live your life.

256
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,460
And also

257
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,088
If you want to be loved, you must smile

258
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,136
Really, I'm not your mother.
So don't treat me as your mother.

259
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,388
I will be stressed

260
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,351
"If you want to be loved, you must smile"

261
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,398
You actually said this to me

262
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,280
She said it was a place full of opportunities

263
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,949
Hey sit down!

264
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,284
-There…
-sit down

265
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,828
But it is a hell more terrible than a stinking ditch

266
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,998
Where would you like to start?

267
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,333
Any place worth money

268
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,835
OK

269
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,088
Hold the FBI

270
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,423
Put down the gun

271
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,472
Go search there.

272
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,682
Go upstairs and take a look

273
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,600
I rely on

274
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,643
The child is still alive

275
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,020
Call an ambulance immediately

276
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,572
I have a good memory

277
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,824
Even the pain at that time is still vivid in my mind

278
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,789
But don't sympathize with me too much

279
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,336
You've worked hard today. Go back and have a rest.

280
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,213
It doesn't matter

281
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,175
Although I don't have much time left, I am very loyal

282
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,302
I will accompany you

283
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,359
Turtle Town

284
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,153
Turtle Town

285
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,034
Damn, are you looking for death?

286
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,079
Wait for me at the karaoke bar later.

287
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,002
Why?

288
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,337
What?

289
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,760
What happened to this kid?

290
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,428
I don't want to go

291
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,723
Say it again

292
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:03,851
Don't you want to go?

293
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,644
Um

294
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,563
You stinky boy

295
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,357
Do you want me to spread the photos you took secretly?

296
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,984
Hello!

297
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,902
Why don't you guys get in quickly?

298
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,864
Hey, why don't you go in?

299
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,532
The bell is ringing, hurry in.

300
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,208
-Go away
-Um

301
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,175
Hello

302
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,843
Say it again

303
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,636
Don't you want to go?

304
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,264
Don't you want to go?

305
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,766
Damn, why don't you answer me?

306
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,145
knew

307
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,646
Stop talking

308
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,403
Hello everyone

309
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,821
-Hello
-Hello

310
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,991
Which page should we talk about today?

311
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,618
"Stop talking"?

312
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,494
today…

313
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,412
Hello!

314
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,831
When did you have a choice?

315
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,043
Slaves should just shut up and do what they are told.

316
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,015
Call her a "math bitch"

317
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,518
no

318
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,686
Do as I say

319
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,314
Do as I say

320
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,233
Do as I say

321
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,569
Come on, you bastard.

322
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,321
Do as I say

323
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,657
Do as I say

324
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,954
Park Kyu Jin

325
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,456
What's wrong? What happened?

326
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,585
Hey you bastard

327
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,462
I told you to stop

328
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,674
I told you to stop, so you should stop.

329
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,635
I told you all

330
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,931
I told you not to do this.

331
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,684
Damn it, I told you not to do this.

332
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,063
I told you not to do this!

333
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,154
damn it!

334
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,576
Patrolman Li, you damn bastard.

335
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,913
what is going on?

336
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,415
That is to say

337
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,503
Who is this guy and what did he do?

338
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:42,926
This person...

339
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,596
What? Do you know him?

340
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,223
He is Gu Zhengwan's subordinate

341
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,141
What?

342
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,059
are you sure?

343
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,769
The day we dealt with President Kim

344
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,272
I saw him standing behind me.

345
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,898
Minister Kong, you bastard

346
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,443
Damn you bastards!

347
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,486
Just ten thousand

348
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,373
Gu Zhengwan, this bastard

349
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,336
Dad, can you help me?

350
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,047
Huh? What's wrong?

351
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,507
Are you in trouble? What happened?

352
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,677
Can you lend me some money?

353
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,220
Why? What do you want the money for?

354
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,181
I'm not saying I won't give it back to you...

355
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,892
Director, what's going on recently?

356
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,853
You will understand when you have a child.

357
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,565
Hey, before the director says it himself
Just pretend you know nothing.

358
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,400
yes

359
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,694
I'm just worried about him.

360
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,863
Hey, why are you making such a fuss?

361
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,615
In that case, why not move back?

362
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,326
Guardian of patient Wu Jingshu?

363
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,832
First of all, the operation went well, don't worry too much

364
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,210
Can I talk to you for a minute?

365
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,511
Wu Jingshu's patient had an infection inside her organs.

366
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,639
Appropriate measures were taken in the negative pressure room after surgery

367
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,974
But the inspection results...

368
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,560
Thank you Ms. Wu Jingshu

369
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,563
It seems that we need to control the infection for a few more days.

370
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,486
This afternoon
There are vendors selling gun toys in the subway

371
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,240
Frightened people
Trampling each other while running away

372
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,075
Accidents causing injuries

373
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,536
In light of the recent series of shootings

374
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,039
Passengers on subway mistook toy gun for real gun

375
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,960
Therefore, the interior was in chaos.

376
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,838
This World
It really changes in an instant, doesn't it?

377
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,633
Guns are so scary.

378
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,386
Are guns scary?

379
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,138
Um

380
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,724
Guns are scary

381
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,604
There once was a very quiet village

382
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,443
There was a man in the village square
Drop a gun and disappear

383
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,029
Not long after, the gun disappeared.

384
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,074
The village has also undergone tremendous changes.

385
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,495
There are people shot dead everywhere.

386
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,875
The villagers began to distrust each other

387
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:25,255
There was a long line in front of the gun store.

388
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,511
The man who watched all this happen

389
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,683
A smile appeared on his face

390
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,146
Why are you laughing?

391
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,985
Maybe he thought things were going his way.

392
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,281
Let people believe that guns are justice
And relying on this power

393
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,038
So what about those people?

394
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,623
Um?

395
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,876
Those who got the gun

396
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:08,632
For those people
Guns may be the real justice and a force

397
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,677
Guns are neither justice nor strength

398
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,972
It will only lead you to destruction.

399
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,393
So don't look for a gun anymore.

400
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,563
You said you didn't have much time left

401
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,941
Spend your time on yourself

402
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,908
Who is that person?

403
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,664
The man who left the gun

404
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,793
"Blue-eyed Oriental"

405
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,087
That's what I heard

406
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,804
(Kyungin Hospital)

407
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,055
Are all the guys here?

408
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,765
I checked it.

409
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,726
Big Brother

410
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,936
Hey, wait a minute.

411
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,230
Oh shit

412
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,949
When the hell did so many people come?

413
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,201
How is Yutai?

414
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,370
According to the nurses

415
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,166
He may be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

416
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,211
Oh shit!

417
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,673
I told you not to be reckless.

418
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,552
Where's that bastard?

419
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,222
Making Yu Tai such a jerk?
Did you find that guy?

420
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:40,890
not yet

421
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,559
Still looking

422
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,228
Damn it, just wait and see

423
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,985
Is there absolutely no possibility of surgery?

424
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,903
I don't want to do it

425
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,283
I don't want to suffer anymore in this life.

426
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,124
Oh shit

427
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,211
Fucking asshole

428
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,094
Aren't you coming up?

429
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,722
Excuse me

430
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,833
Hello, Patrolman Zhang

431
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,587
Yes, I'm in the hospital.

432
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,048
Getting ready to go downstairs

433
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,259
Okay, see you downstairs.

434
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,554
No, I don't need anything now.

435
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,264
Good to know

436
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,517
Patrolman Lee Dao

437
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,560
Let's eat something before we go.

438
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,437
I'm hungry

439
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,273
knew

440
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,446
Excuse me

441
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,073
Um?

442
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,200
I've been feeling troubled since just now

443
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,954
It seems to be your phone

444
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,124
Oh, sorry.

445
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,294
(Brother Shihao)

446
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,368
-Hello, senior
- You're here.

447
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,245
This is Wen Bai. This is Patrolman Zhang.

448
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,706
Oh hello

449
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,833
-let's go
-yes

450
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,585
Slow Walk

451
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,962
- Take care of yourself
-Um

452
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,885
Slow Walk

453
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,451
Hey, don't follow too closely, you'll be noticed.

454
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,956
Hey, why does this guy keep calling?

455
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,627
- Why didn't you answer? Damn it.
-I have no idea

456
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,711
You have to answer the phone.

457
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,005
Is it really okay if I don’t answer the phone?

458
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,256
He definitely can't take...

459
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,175
Minister Kong will be even more suspicious of you.

460
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,676
Why did he insist on answering it?

461
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,429
Damn, this is such a bad time.

462
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,016
Hey, be quiet.

463
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,438
-Hey, big brother
-Oh shit

464
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,398
Why don’t you answer the phone?

465
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,486
I'm sorry
My brothers got hurt at work.

466
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,612
Oh shit

467
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,781
- So busy.
-Hello

468
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,742
-yes
- You come here now

469
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,452
Um?

470
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,540
-Now?
-Yeah, you bastard.

471
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,542
Come over now

472
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:36,918
OK

473
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,672
what to do?

474
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,717
Car U-turn

475
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,325
Bring everyone here.

476
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,410
It's the eldest brother

477
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,823
Explain it

478
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,869
There seems to be a struggle for power between the various factions.

479
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,749
This is the guy I reported to before.
I'm collecting the guns he scattered

480
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,251
Things are more complicated than we thought

481
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,671
If the operation is discovered, it's over.

482
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,090
We need to report to Jack and end the mission immediately.

483
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,259
What about the gun?

484
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,137
Probably hidden somewhere in President Kim's club

485
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,182
But a new force has taken over there.
It's not easy to get them

486
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,976
It takes some time to find them

487
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,854
How about changing the plan?

488
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,150
Revise?

489
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:25,944
Who is modifying for?

490
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,780
If someone touches the hidden goods of President Jin...

491
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,784
Brother, the situation outside is not good.

492
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,203
Bad news is everywhere and

493
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,955
Jack also expressed concern

494
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,792
Jack? What are you worried about?

495
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,879
South Korea is a country that is greatly influenced by public opinion.
If our plans are disrupted

496
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,173
Surveillance and regulation will become more...

497
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,844
Hello

498
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,104
Among so many people

499
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,441
Who chose President Kim?

500
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,527
I…

501
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,612
so

502
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,698
If my plan goes wrong

503
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,866
It's because of you

504
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,665
alright

505
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,793
No more questions?

506
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,253
yes

507
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,089
Please give us instructions.

508
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,093
Go find someone who needs a gun.

509
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,178
I understand.

510
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,598
Don't make the same mistake again

511
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:38,933
yes

512
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,484
Boss, the money has been confirmed.

513
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,279
- Give them the goods
-It's the boss.

514
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,825
Show you something

515
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:56,743
I'll take a look

516
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,785
Take a look

517
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,164
This is amazing. Oh my god, this is amazing. Come and have a look.

518
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,042
- One shot can kill, super strong
-That's amazing.

519
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,303
Be prepared to act once the transaction is completed

520
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,389
I understand.

521
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:19,932
Hi

522
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,018
What the fuck?

523
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,816
Didn't expect this great pistol to be only $250?

524
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,235
Who are you?

525
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,948
It's a pity that you don't even remember me.

526
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,784
Where would you like to start?

527
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,118
Any place worth money

528
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,521
Boss, there seems to be an ambush here.

529
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,232
Fucking idiot!

530
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,776
Boss, look.

531
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,162
Damn boy

532
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,206
Did you do this alone?

533
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,098
Finally woke up

534
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,643
You've been comatose for three weeks.

535
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,814
Where is this?

536
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,774
This is your home

537
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,279
This is your home now

538
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,450
Are you a good person?

539
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,203
Whether that's good or bad depends on who you ask.

540
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,455
But one thing is certain

541
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,251
Meeting me is the greatest blessing in your life

542
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,210
Why?

543
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,171
I like you

544
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,090
So why?

545
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,675
You have to think from my perspective

546
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:22,847
You see a child
With a cheap gun in hand

547
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,016
Into the tiger's den

548
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,393
What's not to like?

549
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,900
My head hurts.

550
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,944
Yes, this is my gift to you.

551
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,863
You'll get used to it slowly.

552
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,364
Gift?

553
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,116
Hope you like it

554
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,379
Welcome to a new world

555
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,797
Two-color eyes

556
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,800
Who are you?

557
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,430
Anyone who wants a gun comes to me.

558
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,933
This is a hard job.

559
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,936
So I need someone strong.

560
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,938
For example, you

561
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,439
You picked the wrong person

562
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,609
I am weak

563
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,862
Although you are not the strongest child

564
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,665
But as long as you hold this
You will become another person

565
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,300
From now on

566
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,303
You decide your own value

567
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,751
Show the gun's position

568
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,881
I'm looking forward to it

569
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,177
A new world is coming

570
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:33,717
