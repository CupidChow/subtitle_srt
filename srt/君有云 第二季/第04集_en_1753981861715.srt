1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The sky is blue, the wind is snowy

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you don't go, you'll have to kill a lot of people

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Damn it

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're still dead

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You

23
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
To show my love

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're here

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My love

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I should be gone

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So you came here

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's child raining

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There's only one day

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The owner isBox shoes

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How are you

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Go on

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,840
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,800
Uncle Qi.

35
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
You've grown up.

36
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
I wonder how Su Bai Yi and the others are doing.

37
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,480
Don't think about your disciple and daughter.

38
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
With our current condition,

39
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,760
it's a burden to find them.

40
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,200
Good thing

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
we need to heal you first.

42
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,920
How avenues of praise.

43
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,800
Ain't aiment on the foundation.

44
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,560
Let me מק him tonight.

45
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,120
Wait a second.

46
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,680
Is there anything I can do for you?

47
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,880
The Boundless Time

48
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
Lets you

49
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I can make changes for people.

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
I made a choice for myself.

51
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I also hope that they can also follow their own path.

52
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Don't let them think about it in their dreams.

53
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Master once taught me that the path of life is the most difficult.

54
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I will obey the words of the star and the first author.

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Brother Feng, the wind and snow outside is too thin.

56
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
I have to trouble Brother Feng to carry them in.

57
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Me? I was just fighting with them.

58
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
This... this is a joke.

59
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Senior.

60
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
You can use my sincerity to save him.

61
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
You just need to use the medicine to cure him.

62
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I can feel that you have become more terrible.

63
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I only taught you half of it.

64
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Do you have to be this funny?

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,800
How come I never realized that this martial arts is so powerful?

66
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
That's because when you were practicing this martial arts,

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
there was nothing in your body.

68
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
After Xie Kan Hua stole the secret book,

69
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
he didn't study it clearly.

70
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,800
In fact, the precepts of the immortal book

71
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
are to have strong inner power.

72
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
So that's it.

73
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Continue. I will learn the rest half today.

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
After you have learned this martial arts,

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
you can't sleep anymore.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
No need.

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I have slept enough for these years.

78
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Okay.

79
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
The so-called dream is a dream.

80
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Naturally, you have to go to the dream

81
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
to be able to use his power.

82
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Spirited cheek...

83
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
No, this is not Spirited Tailed Lotus canvior,

84
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,800
it isisesti acquired by a enables to control its Lower Ayurvedic Six 왜

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Spirited fades away

86
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
intoksi

87
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
R advertisement

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
I will wait for you.

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,120
If we wait any longer,

90
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm afraid we really won't have a chance.

91
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,920
What if Ning Qingcheng

92
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
is injured

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
under Su Baiyi's help?

94
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,920
Then...

95
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Even if Ning Qingcheng is really injured,

96
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
with his martial arts that he only had ten years ago,

97
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,800
he won't be our opponent.

98
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,200
What if Ning Qingcheng is willing to give up his dignity

99
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
and ally with Shang Linshuang?

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,440
Now the rest of the Xingli Academy and Xingxiu Academy

101
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,320
are all eager to take the position of Su Baiyi,

102
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
and they all want to take the position of Su Baiyi,

103
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
the son of Su Han.

104
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,240
The Qingming Academy

105
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,240
has been disbanded

106
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,120
after Long Shouzuo's death.

107
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,840
You're wrong.

108
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,200
Ning Qingcheng can be our ally,

109
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,320
but he can never be theirs.

110
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,760
Why?

111
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,200
Is it impossible to ally with them purely for interests?

112
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,240
Impossible.

113
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,400
Because Su Han

114
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,600
was killed by Ning Qingcheng.

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
I see.

116
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,880
After Wen Xi's chief returned to the Qingming Academy,

117
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,600
he started to stay still.

118
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
He must be calculating his own interests.

119
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Sometimes

120
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
you can only make one choice.

121
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,720
Why didn't the monk come back with you?

122
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,560
Did something happen

123
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,480
in the Xingli Academy?

124
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,840
The monk has taken over the Xingli Academy.

125
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
Now he is discussing with the elders

126
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
in the Xingli Academy

127
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,160
about the following things.

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,160
How are my uncle and Helian Tower Master?

129
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
With my Mo Chen here,

130
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,440
it should be easy to solve the problem

131
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,040
of Bai Jiele's family's influence on your uncle.

132
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
Helian Tower Master went to the chief of the Xinhe.

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,960
He said that the healing in the formation of the chief of the Xinhe

134
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,480
will heal soon.

135
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,200
They all said that Senior Sister and Junior Brother Su

136
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,840
might have been taken to Tian Shui Pavilion by Ning Qingcheng.

137
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,560
But why can't I find it?

138
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
It's not your fault.

139
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
Tian Shui Pavilion is the most secret place

140
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,040
in Shanglin Palace.

141
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,440
Ning Qingcheng is a bastard.

142
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,120
Trust me.

143
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,680
Senior Sister and Junior Brother Su

144
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,800
will never lose to him.

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Senior Sister and Junior Brother Su

146
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
will never lose to him.

147
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,000
The Xingli Academy

148
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,040
will not listen to Ning Qingcheng

149
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
anymore.

150
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,760
How about you, Qianji Academy?

151
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,040
I will end it.

152
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,440
The secret weapon

153
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
is useless to me.

154
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Good.

155
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,400
Wait!

156
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't go.

157
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,920
Don't go.

158
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,120
Master of Helian Pavilion driven me to become your enemy.

159
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,120
The ordinary steel is only better than the prison of the jade.

160
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
You are indeed the master of the He Lan House.

161
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,120
The power of Chunfeng can pass through the Gui Yun Pass.

162
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
You are really amazing.

163
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
The Gui Yun Pass.

164
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
There is no exit in the Gui Yun Pass.

165
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Only those trapped in it can escape.

166
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
The conditions of Bai Ji Le Pai are too good.

168
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
You talk too much.

169
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Chief.

170
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Xiao Meng.

171
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm tired.

172
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
What?

173
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
What?

174
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
You are looking for death.

175
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Since the Gui Yun Pass can't trap you.

176
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
What?

177
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
You have a chance.

178
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
I didn't expect the He Lan House's master to be ten miles strong.

179
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
And he can reach this place.

180
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
How many weapons are there in the Qian Ji House?

181
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Gui Yun Pass.

182
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Zuo Long Formation.

183
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Wu Liang Formation.

184
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
But I don't plan to use the last one.

185
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,120
If I use it, I will die.

186
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
So?

194
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
We will withdraw from this round.

195
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,120
After all, the Qian Ji House has tried its best.

196
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Good.

197
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
The two of them.

198
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Only one person can force us to this point.

199
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
If they work together.

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
There is no chance.

201
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Wait.

202
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Princess Ning.

203
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
I have given you everything.

204
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,120
The rest is up to you.

205
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Princess Ning.

206
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Princess Ning.

207
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Princess Ning.

208
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Mr. Su, you are calling me?

209
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Your martial arts have recovered.

210
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
It's time to make a promise to go down the mountain.

211
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Ning Jing Cheng.

212
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
What are you doing?

213
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
It's just a trial.

214
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
You want to go back on your word?

215
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
I will do what I said.

216
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
But I think the martial arts of the immortal.

217
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,120
It's better not to spread the word.

218
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
You.

219
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Zi Fei.

220
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
What?

221
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
You can have me to do it.

222
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Senior sister.

223
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
You are fine.

224
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Bai Yin.

225
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Did you get hurt by him?

226
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
It's okay.

227
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
This guy who looks like a man.

228
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
He just turned his face.

229
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
You have been awake for a long time.

230
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
A body of martial arts.

231
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
All of you are good.

232
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
This business is not a loss.

233
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
We are from the Jianghu.

234
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Not a businessman.

235
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
You have a point.

236
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
I heard you are the daughter of Xie Kan Hua.

237
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
The school is in the south.

238
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Please give me a lesson.

239
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
School?

240
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Senior sister, be careful.

241
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Senior sister, are you okay?

242
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
I'm fine.

243
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I hate to hear the word school.

244
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Bai Yin, you go first.

245
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
I remember I told senior sister.

246
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
My cultivation has become stronger.

247
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
I also misled the sword method that second sister gave me.

248
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
He is Ning Qingcheng.

249
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
He is different from the previous replacement.

250
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
So.

251
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
I can't go.

252
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Because the way I choose.

253
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Always the same as senior sister.

254
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,120
People are in front of the sword.

255
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Just like you.

256
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
So powerful.

257
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Ning Qingcheng.

258
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I have seen this sword before.

259
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,120
It can break in a moment under my suppression.

260
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
I can't see you so young.

261
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,120
It's a pity to kill you.

262
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Go to hell.

263
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Go.

264
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Go.

265
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Go.

266
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Go.

267
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Go.
