1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sky is clear, the wind is strong, the clouds are high, the sky is clear, the clouds are high

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The sky is clear, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sky is clear, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Clouds of Dazhen

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 1

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How is your training going?

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's going well.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's good.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I heard you say last time that the second most powerful Xue Shen Guan,

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
what kind of person is he?

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Brother, don't mess around.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xue Shen Guan broke into Shang Ling's palace

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
because Tian Wu Bao made him the second most powerful

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but Ning Qing Cheng was the first most powerful.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Xue Shen Guan was not convinced and wanted to fight Ning Qing Cheng.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But he was stopped before the Star Academy.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He left after playing a game with the Star Academy.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He's not as good as Nan Yu Lou.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Nan Yu Lou really hit the Sky Water Tower.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's not true.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Nan Yu Lou climbed from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It took only an hour.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But Nan Yu Lou claimed that he played two hours of chess with the Star Academy.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's because at the base of the Star Academy,

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the flow of time changes.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Have you heard of the Lan Ke chess game?

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Brother, can you stop messing around with your knowledge?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then I won't mention it.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Nan Yu Lou fell into the chess game of the Star Academy.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But he couldn't get out.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xue Shen Guan is different.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He didn't fall into the chess game at all.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He played chess with the Star Academy for five hours.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He trapped the Star Academy.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Xue Shen Guan is a chess player.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He played chess and didn't want to leave.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He won the game and was in a good mood.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He didn't want to fight and went down the mountain.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What a chess player!

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The Star Academy said that Xue Shen Guan was a very sincere person.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So his chess game couldn't trap him at all.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If he were here today,

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
he would have been able to get out of the water.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, no, this skill doesn't suit me.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What you want to practice is not this martial art,

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but to train your mind.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Your mind is too disrespectful.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Otherwise, with your talent,

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you could have surpassed me.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You and the Tower Master are too serious.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If there is no me in the tower,

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it's better to change the name of Fusheng Dream Tower to Fusheng Koshui Tower.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
By the way, where did Xue Shen Guan go?

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He disappeared.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No one knows where he went.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So the four families released the news

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that Xue Shen Guan would appear at the Heroes Conference.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's why it's so hot in the martial arts world.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Besides being the second most famous martial artist in the world,

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
what other specialties does Xue Shen Guan have?

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Everyone is looking forward to him appearing.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The reason why Xue Shen Guan is called Xue Shen Guan

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is because his martial arts are so mysterious

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and mysterious.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's like a magic trick.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He hides secrets and knows the Heaven's plans.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's a martial art that everyone in the martial arts world dreams of.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not like the immortal book.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why there are many people watching him every time he appears.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Tower Master.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How is it going?

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If there is no interference from the outside world,

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it can be done by walking on the water.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The cultivation of the inner world is not different from the outside world.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That means there is no practice.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sorry, Tower Master.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Forget it.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You guys leave the city today and go to Jiangnan.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The Wang family is holding their Heroes Conference.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why should we go there?

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They are just relying on an old man.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Once that old man dies,

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the Wang family can't even control the four families.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They still want to become the leader of the martial arts world?

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Su Bai Yi will appear there.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you have any news about him?

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But Nan Gong Xi has gone down the mountain.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He also went to Xuanwei City.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So it's very likely that Su Bai Yi will appear there.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Your sword skills are good.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It seems that you have gained a lot this time.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Of course.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm not only going to be the strongest man in the school,

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm also going to be the strongest man in the world.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm tired.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's take a break.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you know that Senior Sister has gone down the mountain?

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I heard that Su Bai Yi wrote a letter on the wall.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He didn't write a letter or a letter.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He didn't treat us as brothers.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is this the point?

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Senior Sister thinks that this is dangerous.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And there is only one word that is hard to confirm.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So she doesn't want us to go with her.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Or maybe Senior Sister wants to be alone with Junior Brother Su.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She doesn't want us to be involved.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
As a junior, you should understand Senior Sister.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You shouldn't cause trouble for her.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then we won't go.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The carriage is already prepared outside the school.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The most beautiful thing in the south of the spring sun.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Miss Nan Gong, you came at the right time.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The city of Qian Tang is 10 miles away.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Compared to this city, it's much more beautiful.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a pity that our Su Bai Yi didn't see the beautiful scenery.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yujiu House.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Where is Yujiu House?

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There is Yujiu House.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Come.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Come.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Good.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You are so bold.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Good.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I told you to look.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why are you looking?

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Come.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Good.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Good.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Good.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The food was really good.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's beautiful.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Senior Sister, you came.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It seems that this is the most famous place in the school.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The name of Qingyi Lang is the most famous.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, let's talk about the official matter first.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Have you confirmed whether it is Su Bai Yi?

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Wait for Senior Sister to confirm it with you.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Sir, have you seen the man in the painting?

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This person...

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
seems to have such a small impression.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Think about it again.

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I remember.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A few days ago, I was talking about some stories in the martial arts world.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He suddenly made a mess for me.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's right, that's the face.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There is also an old man who came with him.

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Old man?

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was still outside just now.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you continue talking, you will die.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Who?

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In the martial arts world, there are many people.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you want to see me,

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I will kill you all.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Senior Sister, you don't sound like you want to.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to try.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I didn't see him stop.

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Qingyi Lang.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm fine.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Who are you?

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you want to find Su Bai Yi?

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hand over Su Bai Yi.

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This sword is interesting.

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Cheers!

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm here.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Can't you wait for me to find a comfortable position to make a toast?

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What are you doing?

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You brat.

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You dare to leave a message to your senior sister while I'm not ready.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Really?

184
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you leave a message,

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
just leave the address of our inn.

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Take care.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go.

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You old man.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You are too cruel.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Su Bai Yi.

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Miss Nangong.

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That old man ran away.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Who is this person?

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There is no news of this person in the peak.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
With his martial arts,

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
he can't be in the martial arts world.

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's go find him.

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Su Bai Yi.

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Shuyuan, slow down.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
My qiaoqi is getting worse.

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
My senior sister has been played by you.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Qian Wei, what are you afraid of?

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not hiding from your senior sister.

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This Xuanwei City,

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I felt something wrong when I stepped into the first step.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Now I understand.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There is a master who is determined to fight here.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I had a real qi outside the jade wine building.

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He led me.

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I also felt him.

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's not easy to die.

212
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you don't want to die,

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
just put away your thoughts of being a monster.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll follow you.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Okay.

216
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll follow you.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's been a long time,

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Xue Shen Guan.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You are not Xue Shen Guan.

220
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This brother's martial arts are so extraordinary.

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He is not a nobody.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But he is a great martial artist.

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I can't guess his identity.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wang Ling Xiao?

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You know me.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I not only know you,

227
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
but I also fought with you.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I didn't expect that after decades,

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
your martial arts have improved a lot.

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Who are you?

231
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
My surname is Su.

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Your grandfather should have a scar.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I cut it.

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
My grandfather Su Qian

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
is still alive.

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes, I'm still alive.

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I didn't expect that after years,

238
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I could meet an old friend.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
An old friend?

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He is still alive.

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000

I'm sorry.

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
