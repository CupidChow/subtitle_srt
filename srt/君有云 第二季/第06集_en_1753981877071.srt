The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,260
The

42
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,260
The

43
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
The

44
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,260
The

45
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,260
The

46
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,260
The

47
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,260
The

48
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,260
The

49
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,260
The

50
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,260
The

51
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
The

52
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
The

53
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
The

54
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,260
The

55
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,260
The

56
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,260
The

57
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,260
The

58
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
The

59
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,260
The

60
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,260
The

61
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,260
The

62
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,260
The

63
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
The

64
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,260
The

65
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,260
The

66
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,260
The

67
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,260
The

68
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,260
The

69
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
The

70
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,260
The

71
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,260
The

72
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,260
The

73
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,260
The

74
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,260
When did you learn this art

75
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260
Su baiyi

76
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
We do not share

77
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Place

78
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
To go

79
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,260
Unfortunately

80
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,260
This is a

81
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
Town

82
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Soon

83
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,460
or the Taoist Army

84
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,700
are unable to protect him.

85
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,100
Xie Kenghuang.

86
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,740
I'm not wrong.

87
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,980
He's taking advantage of our power.

88
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,820
This is the martial arts of the Immortal Book,

89
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,860
the Star-Eye.

90
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,420
Are you sure you can hold

91
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,620
all the power of the Shanglin Twins?

92
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,540
You can try.

93
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,700
Su Bayi, go!

94
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,700
He won't leave.

95
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,860
He won't leave.

96
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,780
Don't be angry with him.

97
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,940
I'm a good match for the Lotus-Head Monk.

98
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,020
We've never lost.

99
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,540
Even if we can't defeat him,

100
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,060
we can still run away

101
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,300
after you leave.

102
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,820
Master,

103
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,340
no one here

104
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,660
knows the Immortal Book better than me.

105
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,460
You've taken the power of the Star-Eye.

106
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,940
You can't run away.

107
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,780
You can't run away.

108
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,980
I can save you now.

109
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,300
Don't say anything more.

110
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,260
Go!

111
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,780
When I was a student,

112
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
my senior taught me

113
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,260
that every student

114
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,180
has a goal in his heart.

115
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,180
That's to become a gentleman.

116
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,220
If you want to be a gentleman,

117
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,980
you need to be a noble man

118
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,500
to be the true master of this life.

119
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,220
I'll devote my life to this word.

120
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,460
This is what a gentleman is.

121
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,740
I'm not a gentleman yet.

122
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,220
But I have one word today.

123
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,020
I have one word.

124
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,620
I'll be your brother.

125
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,100
I have one sword.

126
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,340
I'll be your brother.

127
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,700
Only

128
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,300
go forward.

129
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,020
Bayi!

130
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
You're a student.

131
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,660
You're more tough than you look.

132
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,940
I'm not just tough.

133
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,260
I'm also a man of your power.

134
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,860
Senior is right.

135
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,420
This word

136
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,260
is really hard to say.

137
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,100
But since I've made my choice,

138
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,500
I'll have to

139
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,100
make a mistake.

140
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,980
Stop! Don't come over!

141
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,100
You idiot!

142
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,740
Idiot!

143
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,500
If I let go now,

144
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,620
with the power of the two of them,

145
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,980
I'll enter your body.

146
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,140
Do you think you can still live?

147
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,420
Yes.

148
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,540
Your ultimate goal is to take me away,

149
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,980
not to kill me.

150
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,260
I can only put myself in danger

151
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,340
and your plan will be ruined.

152
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,620
There's been a lot of chaos in the Palace of Heaven these days.

153
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,500
There are some brave people who set the fire everywhere.

154
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,660
Who are they?

155
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,940
I don't know.

156
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,660
It's Bai He.

157
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,340
Why are you so sharp?

158
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,220
Even if you win,

159
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,980
you'll only get

160
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,580
the Palace of Heaven.

161
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,860
Who said we were going to get the Palace of Heaven?

162
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,020
Monk, you underestimate us.

163
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,220
What is your purpose?

164
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,020
You're calling me by my name,

165
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,740
but you're not.

166
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
Monk, you're too stupid.

167
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,300
You'd better not make a mistake.

168
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
You're lying!

169
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,180
Go!

170
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,020
Don't worry.

171
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
We have the fate of a life-and-death battle.

172
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,100
But it's not the time yet.

173
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,900
You three

174
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,060
have no inner power now.

175
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,780
We'll win this round.

176
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,740
Then let's start over.

177
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,260
I want this man.

178
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,620
It's you.

179
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,260
It seems that you don't want to keep the promise.

180
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,140
According to our previous agreement,

181
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,940
after you give me the Tianji Box,

182
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,460
I won't ask about the Palace of Heaven.

183
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,900
I'll just watch the snow.

184
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,980
That's true.

185
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,940
Then I'll ask you.

186
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,740
The Tianji Box is empty.

187
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
Where did the things go?

188
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,580
You and I both know

189
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,660
that the Tianji Box is hidden

190
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,420
a secret about the Su family.

191
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,140
A secret about the Su family.

192
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,100
But I'm not interested in this secret.

193
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,620
Why do you lie to me?

194
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,260
You know people, you know faces, but you don't know the heart.

195
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,340
Do you think I'll believe you?

196
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,380
It seems that I can't explain it clearly.

197
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,940
But what does it have to do with him?

198
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,860
You lied to me.

199
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,340
How can I let you do as you want?

200
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,860
What if I don't agree?

201
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,700
Now is the time when you are the weakest.

202
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,660
It depends on whether it's worth you taking the risk.

203
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,300
It's hard to make a choice.

204
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,620
You will pay for what you did today.

205
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,140
You don't have to say it.

206
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,060
You are...

207
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,260
No matter who it is,

208
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,900
you won't be a good person.

209
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,820
What are you doing?

210
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,580
Let me go. I won't go with you.

211
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,100
I'm leaving. What should I do?

212
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,820
What should I do?

213
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,700
Before Xinghe left,

214
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,140
he destroyed the Star Trap.

215
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,340
After all, he has lived in such a place for so many years.

216
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,700
It's a little reluctant to leave.

217
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Where is the Tower Master?

218
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,980
Tower Master told me

219
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,700
that if he didn't show up within two hours,

220
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,420
we would go down the mountain ourselves.

221
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,900
Tower Master won't fail.

222
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,940
I'm thinking too much.

223
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
I'll leave it here.

224
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
I'll leave it here.

225
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Uncle,

226
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,060
the next world

227
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,300
will belong to our Wang family.

228
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,380
The killing spirit of Uncle is very heavy.

229
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,980
Ming Qingcheng is dead.

230
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,540
Then the next person I'm going to kill

231
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,540
is Bai Ji Le.

232
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,220
I heard recently

233
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,620
that Bai Ji Le left the Heavenly Palace of Heaven

234
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,700
and gathered some remaining men

235
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,340
to re-enter the most powerful of the Fusheng Sect

236
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,140
in the hidden place of the Jianghu.

237
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,140
Find him for me.

238
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
I'll go.

239
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Go.

240
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Qi.

241
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
Father.

242
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,940
Come practice with me.

243
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Because every day

244
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,540
is likely to be a battle of life and death.

245
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Yes.

246
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,220
Ah Da Hall

247
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,780
Hello.

248
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,180
Have a look.

249
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,180
We come to find springs and alcohol.

250
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,060
Wow.

251
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,380
Please, young master.

252
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,020
Here you are.

253
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,620
Thank.

254
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
Okay.

255
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,420
Thank you.

256
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,980
Thank you, young master.

257
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,980
I whip you for life and life.

258
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,460
Those Are The Meaning of It

259
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,540
Pomp and Circumstance

260
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,540
The new world is coming.

261
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,540
The new world is coming.

262
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,540
The new world is coming.

263
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,540
The gentlemen have gathered all the famous doctors of the world.

264
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,540
But they are still unable to do anything about the injuries we have suffered.

265
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
What do you want to say again?

266
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
What I want to say is...

267
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,540
My daughter comes home early every day and rarely sees us.

268
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,540
Do you think she is disliking us two old women?

269
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Not us. Even if she dislikes us, it's also disliking yourself.

270
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Old friends should be in trouble.

271
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
My daughter...

272
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,540
Tian'er, your daughter has just committed a crime of love.

273
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
When your disciple comes back, she will...

274
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
No, I don't agree.

275
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
That brat can disappear.

276
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,540
If he dares to come back and hit my daughter's idea, I will kill him.

277
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
The moon rises and the moon sets.

278
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Xie Yuliang, who do you think Senior Sister will help in the end?

279
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
I don't want to talk to a fool.

280
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
I don't want to talk to a fool.

281
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
I...

282
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Tian'er, you are so annoying.

283
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,540
Senior Sister.

284
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
Senior Brother Luo.

285
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,540
This is the latest news from today.

286
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
Shanglin Heavenly Palace has a new owner.

287
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,540
However, the power of the martial arts world has been greatly reduced.

288
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,540
Now, there are only the Jielu Courtyard and Chunfeng Pavilion left.

289
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
So what if Shanglin Heavenly Palace has a new owner?

290
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,540
Right now, I only care about his life and death.

291
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
I don't want to see him die.

292
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,540
I don't want to see him die.

293
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,540
I don't want to see him die.

294
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
I don't want to see him die.

295
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
I only care about his life and death.

296
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
It's a pity that Die Feng is incompetent.

297
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
It's been so long.

298
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
I haven't found any news about him.

299
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
You can't blame the Senior Brothers.

300
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,540
The Senior Brothers of Die Feng have been looking for him outside.

301
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,540
Instead, it's me.

302
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
I've been staying on the mountain.

303
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
I can't do anything.

304
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,540
Junior Sister Nangong is the youngest disciple of the school.

305
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,540
She is the first person to step into the martial arts world.

306
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Moreover, her injury has not fully healed.

307
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
The teachers are stopping her from going down the mountain.

308
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,540
What's more important is the future of the school.

309
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,540
As for your junior brother,

310
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,540
although I don't know much about him,

311
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,540
but the battle between him and Ning Qingcheng in the martial arts world

312
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
has spread a lot of different rumors.

313
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
There must be something extraordinary about him.

314
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
The immortal has seen Bai Yi.

315
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,540
If Bai Yi knew that he has already had such a great reputation in the martial arts world,

316
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
he would surely be very proud.

317
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,540
I'm not going to let you go.

318
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
I'm not going to let you go.

319
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,540
I'm not going to let you go.

320
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
I'm not going to let you go.

321
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
I'm not going to let you go.

322
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,540
I'm not going to let you go.

323
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
I'm not going to let you go.

324
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
I'm not going to let you go.

325
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
I'm not going to let you go.

326
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
I'm not going to let you go.

327
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
I'm not going to let you go.

328
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
I'm not going to let you go.

329
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
I'm not going to let you go.

330
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
I'm not going to let you go.

331
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
I'm not going to let you go.

332
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
I'm not going to let you go.

333
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
I'm not going to let you go.

334
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
I'm not going to let you go.

335
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
I'm not going to let you go.

336
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm not going to let you go.

337
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
I'm not going to let you go.

338
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,540
I'm not going to let you go.

339
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
I'm not going to let you go.

340
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
I'm not going to let you go.

341
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,540
I'm not going to let you go.

342
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,540
I'm not going to let you go.

343
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,540
I'm not going to let you go.

344
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm not going to let you go.

345
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
I'm not going to let you go.

346
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
I'm not going to let you go.

347
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
I'm not going to let you go.

348
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
I'm not going to let you go.

349
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm not going to let you go.

350
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
I'm not going to let you go.

351
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
I'm not going to let you go.

352
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
I'm not going to let you go.

353
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm not going to let you go.

354
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
I'm not going to let you go.

355
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I'm not going to let you go.

356
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
I'm not going to let you go.

357
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
I'm not going to let you go.

358
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
I'm not going to let you go.

359
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540

I'm not going to let you go.

I'm not going to let you go.
