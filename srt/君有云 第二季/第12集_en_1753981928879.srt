00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The sky is clear, the wind is strong, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is clear, the sky is

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
clear,

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Episode 17

5
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am the owner of this shop, Flower Ghost.

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I am the only customer who buys the last flower in the shop every day.

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Only then can we become the real masters.

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My name is Bailong.

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think you have received the letter from the owner.

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Of course.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Otherwise, the last flower wouldn't have been left until now.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Which flower do you want to kill for you?

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you want to be as powerful as the fragile and sharp sword in your hand?

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Or do you want the strongest peony?

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The best flower is the most beautiful, but the most dangerous mandrake.

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Different flowers can kill different people.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want them all.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You want them all?

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is Xuanwei City.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you know what this means?

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is the gold ring of the four countries.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
50,000 taels.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The price of Fusheng Dream House is very high.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
50,000 taels is really enough.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But if you want all of us,

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
it means that after this order,

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Xuanwei City will no longer have our land.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is the house deed of Huai'an City.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's enough to make you open a bigger flower shop.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What do you think?

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a good idea.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay. I'll take this order.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't leak the secret.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mr. Bai Lan, this is my friend.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is that so?

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the last guest in today's shop.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I rarely take risks.

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But I saw you this month.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then take the risk.

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You can try.

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Boss, don't forget our agreement.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I almost ruined the great cause because of you.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Then I'll use my wine to make you pay.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So it's been so long.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You still don't know who your biological parents are?

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wait, let me think.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My father must be Su Han.

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Since Lv Xuanbing said he was my uncle,

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
it means that, or more accurately,

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
my mother is Lv Xuanbing's sister.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
She left Yingzhou.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And that book of the immortal was also brought down from Yingzhou.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yingzhou and Shanglin were at war.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
How could your mother be related to Su Han?

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The more I think about it, the more complicated it is.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then what are your plans?

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They need me as the body of the guardian of Nanjing.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's why they want me so much.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
How can the Su clan's disciples be used by the Lv clan?

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Kid, don't worry about it.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
With my ancestor, they have no chance.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait, but what does this have to do with Bai Qi Le?

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why does Bai Qi Le want to catch me so desperately?

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Could it be that he...

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He must be from Yingzhou.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Bai Qi Le is from Yingzhou?

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So he didn't participate in the battle in the South Sea.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If Yingzhou won,

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Bai Qi Le would clear the obstacles for them.

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But Yingzhou lost.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's why Bai Qi Le secretly planned to mess up the world.

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Only Wang Ruoxu is left to take the responsibility.

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The current power of the world is completely different from the one Su Han had ten years ago.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And he is so anxious to find me as the body.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That proves Yingzhou is about to be destroyed.

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yingzhou is in danger.

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't miss this battle.

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I wonder how Bai Yi is doing now.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't worry.

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We didn't guess that

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the one who took Su Bai Yi away should be Su Jian, the Demon Lord.

82
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He is also from the Su clan.

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Su Jian won't be hard on him.

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I regret that I passed on Su Bai Yi's immortal book.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If I hadn't passed on his martial arts,

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
it wouldn't be like this now.

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But he has to learn.

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bai Yi's mother once said that

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the one from Yingzhou has blood in his body.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If he doesn't learn the immortal book, he will become a monster.

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But maybe there is another way.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
After all, there is another half of Su Bai Yi's blood

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
from Su Han.

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Master Su, can't you be idle for a while?

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I mean, it's late night. Don't be idle.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll send it.

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's the map.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Master Su, what's wrong?

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It seems that I have wronged Bai Ji Le.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Because I just found out that

103
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the Tianji Xia Bai Ji Le gave me is real.

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh no.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I told him that the Tianji Xia was in the hand of the Demon Lord.

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This old man is very angry.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If he knows that I lied to him, he will torture me to death.

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can do it. I can do it.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll win.

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry, Master Su. I shouldn't have lied to you.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But when I first met him, I said that

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I didn't know what Tianji Xia was.

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But you don't believe me.

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can only make up a lie

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and say that it's in the hand of the Demon Lord.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You have a big mouth.

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to be angry.

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why did you say that the thing is in the hand of the Demon Lord?

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Since you don't believe me,

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I just made up a lie and let you find it.

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The Demon Lord is the second in the world.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And the whereabouts are uncertain.

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm looking forward to the day when I can find it.

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But who would have thought that

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
when I said that the thing was in his hand,

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
his whereabouts appeared in Jiangnan.

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's not an accident that the Demon Lord will appear here.

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Because even if you didn't lie to me

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that Tianji Xia was in his hand,

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
if you heard that he was here,

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I would come here without hesitation to see him.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because he is the second in the world,

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
so you want to turn him into a tablet when you enter the world again.

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Aijile is a very good chess player.

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If he can't find our whereabouts,

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
he can trick us into coming here with this trick.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I even think that the Wang family is holding a hero's meeting.

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In fact, it may still be Bai Aijile who is pushing in the dark.

139
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It seems that you don't mind being someone else's chess player.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I never mind being someone else's chess player.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Because chess has its own rules and rules.

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I have never had any rules.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't have any rules.

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Kid, watch carefully.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I will let them see what a real hero is in the hero's meeting.

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Master, I have an idea.

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What idea?

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's attend the hero's meeting in the name of the Su family.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, let's do it in the name of the Su family.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But there are still changes in the hero's meeting.

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We still don't know.

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think that Bai Aijile has used something

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to lure the Xue Shenguan here.

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I like Xuan Weicheng the most at this moment.

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Because he can make me calm down.

156
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Your face is not very handsome.

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But why can't you see it?

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Nonsense, I am very handsome.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But whether handsome or not, you won't like it.

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Who says I don't like it?

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Who says I don't like it?

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's because you haven't made up your mind?

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I promised master that I would find that mask.

164
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let me see it.

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Stop.

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can't see it.

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let me see it.

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Stop.

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Stop.

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let me see it.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you believe it?

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Young master.

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Li, Chen, Murong.

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why don't you come in?

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There is no invitation.

176
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What a great honor to attend the hero's meeting.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We also want to be in the hall.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
In the hall?

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Easy to say.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Take it.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's drink together.

182
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Young master.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Stop talking nonsense.

184
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Look.

185
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's really worth it.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What are they doing inside?

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's go inside and have a look.

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Young master.

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Young master.

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Young master.

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Who are they?

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The one on the left is in black clothes.

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He is from Mojian.

196
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He should be a member of the Black Eagle Sect.

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The one on the right looks like he is from Taiji Sect.

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They are all villains.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Who is talking nonsense?

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's the third young master of our family.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The third young master of our family.

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Move aside.

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What a bad guy.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Is there any invitation?

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You don't even know our fake sect.

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Why are you still in the martial arts world?

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What fake sect?

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I haven't heard of it.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think you want to sneak in and eat and drink together.

210
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Get out of here.

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't get in the way.

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You are lying.

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I think you are a dog watching a man.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't be impulsive.

215
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Who said that our fake sect doesn't have an invitation?

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There is really a fake sect.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now the names of the sects in the martial arts world are so casual.

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
In this life, who doesn't have a fake face?

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not casual names of our sect.

220
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's the fake face that everyone in the world can't see.

221
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Two disciples, please.

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't worry.

223
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You two are too inconspicuous.

224
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I just brought you in.

225
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You are going to fight me?

226
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Who are you?

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Who am I?

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Of course, your fellow sect.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You are a ghost.

230
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It hurts.

231
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Senior, we are sorry for the inconvenience.

232
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We have something to say.

233
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You are quite polite.

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Six disciples.

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Okay.

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

237
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The young people nowadays are too inconspicuous.

238
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I will fight.

239
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Don't rush to fight.

240
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We are not enemies.

241
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Then you are...

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I just want to find two friends to go to this hero conference.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
After all, we are all brothers of the fake sect.

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let go of me.

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If I say no...

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Then kill me.

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Brother, let's go drink.

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How can you drink with a mask on?

249
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I want to see the fight.

250
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's go.

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's go here.

252
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's go.

253
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The wind blows.

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Who are you looking at?

255
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Who are you thinking about?

256
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The day is bright.

257
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The sun rises.

258
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The moon rises.

259
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The sky is dark.

260
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The heart is lethargic.

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The man comes and the woman goes.

262
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Who is looking for discussion?

263
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The world is big.

264
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The extrovert is bored, sun and moon go away.

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Why is the placid smiling?

266
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Throughout the world is dancer.

267
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The evening flame in the public heat,

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,060
you
