1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,220
My

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,220
My

3
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,220
My

4
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,220
My

5
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,220
My

6
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,220
My

7
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
My

8
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,220
My

9
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,220
My

10
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,220
Episode 16

11
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,980
The three judges of the Jielu Hall

12
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,220
are now the big traitors

13
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,220
who colluded with the evil sect to steal the treasure.

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,980
They are about to be killed.

15
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,620
Go down the mountain

16
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,420
to meet my disciple and daughter.

17
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,380
Bring this.

18
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,380
Tell her

19
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,380
that Master has his own way to escape.

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,340
When the first snow fall on Mount Weilong this year,

21
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,780
Shanglin Heavenly Palace will punish Xie Kanhua.

22
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,220
Inform everyone

23
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,620
to gather under the evil city

24
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,620
and block all exits.

25
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,620
Su Baiyi, the time has come.

26
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,620
You can leave the city.

27
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
You want to escape?

28
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,620
Yes.

29
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
I will not let Bai Luzheng

30
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,620
fight against you two.

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,620
Master, we are coming.

32
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,620
Your disciple and daughter

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,620
are already at the foot of the mountain.

34
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,620
My replacement

35
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,020
has already taken care of

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,020
your disciple and daughter.

37
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
Senior.

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
I will give you one last chance.

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
Hand over the Magistrate's Book.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Remember,

41
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,020
you can't use both of them at the same time.

42
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,020
Otherwise, you will never wake up.

43
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,020
Shanglin Heavenly Palace

44
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,020
The third judge of the Jielu Hall

45
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,020
The third judge of the Jielu Hall

46
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,020
The fourth judge of the Jielu Hall

47
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,020
Senior.

48
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,020
You are losing your mind.

49
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,020
Your martial arts skills have increased.

50
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
What medicine did you just take?

51
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
You are like a beast.

52
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,020
Even if your skills are similar to mine,

53
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
you are useless.

54
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420
You are useless.

55
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
Hurry up.

56
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Senior.

57
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
Junior.

58
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,420
We are coming.

59
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Be careful.

60
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
Someone is coming.

61
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,420
If you dare to come, I will kill you.

62
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,420
You can't kill me.

63
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,420
Master said that I want to shoot.

64
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
I must experience the world.

65
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
So he sent me down the mountain to help.

66
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,420
Who is your master?

67
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Come.

68
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Come.

69
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Come.

70
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
Come.

71
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
If you don't hand in the Magistrate's Book,

72
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
your senior sister will die.

73
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Your senior sister will die.

74
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,420
The immortal tree is indeed in your place.

75
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,220
It's a waste to keep this tree in your place.

76
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,460
Why don't you...

77
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,100
The immortal tree is nearby.

78
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,280
Could you please

79
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
escape this tree for me?

80
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,400
Kinda rich but can't be so handsome.

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Let's go.

82
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,200
It's so great being that decadent such as Yan.

83
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,260
We need to find out what situation Singing Ci sauces best.

84
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,660
We will find out shortly.

85
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,580
Hold on.

86
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,900
Say,

87
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:48,360
why is the

88
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,900
electricity so low?

89
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,140
Bu Xie, look at this!

90
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,860
This is your crosshairs.

91
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,140
What weapon is this?

92
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,100
How could it fire a cold weapon?

93
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,740
Kneel!

94
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,220
Start scenarios now.

95
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,620
Amitabha'mo.

96
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
I'm not sure.

97
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,620
But the first snow of Mount Weilong

98
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,420
hasn't fallen yet.

99
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,100
Since I sent my body to go down the mountain,

100
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,060
it means

101
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,860
I've controlled

102
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,620
the first snow.

103
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,220
You're so impatient to kill me.

104
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,180
You're really a man of your word.

105
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,140
But I have a question.

106
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,180
Why did you send your body

107
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,060
to go down the mountain?

108
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,700
Isn't it because

109
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,460
you're badly injured

110
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,900
and can't wait

111
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,340
for the first snow?

112
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,700
I just hope my silly apprentice

113
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,980
won't be hooked.

114
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,140
Xie Yuling, have you asked

115
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,500
why Lord Dao Jun didn't come personally?

116
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,700
Master was injured in the battle with Lord Qiang.

117
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,380
So I asked him to come with me.

118
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,620
But what's the use of sending you

119
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,500
here?

120
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,940
I think it's more useful than you.

121
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,460
Hey, get out of here.

122
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,260
Wake up.

123
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,860
You're on your own.

124
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,380
You're on your own.

125
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,700
Another ghost,

126
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,260
why does it have these things?

127
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,440
Pond

128
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,180
If you keep hitting, you'll die.

129
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,500
Eight.

130
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Seven.

131
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,620
Eight.

132
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,060
Nine.

133
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,220
Ten.

134
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,340
Twenty.

135
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,820
Done.

136
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm done for.

137
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,220
What kind of demon is this?

138
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,900
It destroyed the eight powers of the West Sword.

139
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,700
Senior Sister!

140
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,700
Senior Sister!

141
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,860
Senior Sister, wake up!

142
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,140
Senior Sister!

143
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,100
Senior Sister, I'm fine.

144
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,300
The sword my second sister-in-law gave me

145
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,700
seems to have changed a bit.

146
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,460
This sword is very powerful and strange.

147
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,620
Senior Sister, look!

148
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,820
Okay.

149
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,660
No wonder.

150
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,060
It's the First Princess's body.

151
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,460
And also,

152
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
thanks to this master.

153
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,020
It's you.

154
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,020
Thank you for saving me.

155
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,580
Master and I are fated to meet.

156
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,300
This time, you saved Master Su.

157
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,700
It's really Master Su and my Buddha's fate.

158
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,980
If I meet him again next time,

159
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,340
I'm afraid I'll be helpless.

160
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,180
Su Bai Yi,

161
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,500
go up the mountain.

162
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,420
Okay.

163
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,860
But...

164
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,780
What?

165
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,340
Right.

166
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,980
It's dangerous if we don't go to Xie Kang Hua.

167
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,540
But...

168
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
Senior Sister...

169
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,020
I'll take care of her for you.

170
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,020
Su Bai Yi.

171
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,020
There's a news from the Shanglin Heavenly Palace.

172
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,020
What news?

173
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,180
When the first snow of Mount Weilong

174
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
fell this year,

175
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,220
the Shanglin Heavenly Palace

176
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,780
was about to lose Xie Kang Hua.

177
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,420
Oh, no.

178
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,900
Master Su.

179
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,340
Master Su.

180
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,100
Master Su.

181
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,780
Master Su.

182
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,500
Master Su.

183
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,260
Master Su.

184
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,980
Master Su.

185
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,700
What's this?

186
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Oh, no. It's snowing.

187
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,460
I wanted you to experience

188
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,060
the feeling of death.

189
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,980
But God didn't help you.

190
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,460
It is scary.

191
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,540
Ghost Crescent

192
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,300
I thought you would bathe some more.

193
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,180
Finally,

194
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,420
you made me wait.

195
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,980
I've been waiting for my disciples to leave.

196
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,380
Since there's no way to go to the Celestial Palace,

197
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
I'll have to accompany my old friend.

198
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,580
Only when you break it can you stand.

199
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,780
The Celestial Palace

200
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
should have this ending.

201
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Then you can leave together.

202
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
Kill them.

203
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Kill them.

204
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,180
I have limited cultivation.

205
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,180
Your injury

206
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,180
can only be helped by you for half an hour.

207
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,180
Thank you, Little Dao Jun.

208
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,380
You're welcome.

209
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
Junior Brother Su.

210
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,980
Look, it's Junior Brother Su.

211
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,780
Senior Brother Feng, Senior Brother Xie, Master.

212
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,380
Don't come over. Don't come over.

213
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,980
Someone is shooting arrows here.

214
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,380
Don't come over.

215
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,580
Don't come over.

216
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,780
Don't come over.

217
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,380
Someone is shooting arrows here.

218
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,380
I know.

219
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,980
This is the Seven Stars Formation

220
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,380
that the Star-Castle House's all star officers

221
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,180
have set up to guard the Celestial Palace.

222
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,380
Use my knowledge.

223
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,380
I can break this formation.

224
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,180
Are you Dao Jun?

225
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,980
Little Dao Jun, good luck!

226
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,180
I've decided to be your junior brother.

227
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Shut up.

228
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,580
Dao Jun's disciple, Mo Chen.

229
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,980
Greetings, Brother Su.

230
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
It's Brother Su San.

231
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Your big brother is me.

232
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,380
Second Brother is Xie Yu Ling.

233
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,780
Su San?

234
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Su San?

235
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,180
So you're the only disciple

236
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,780
of Dao Jun.

237
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,180
No wonder.

238
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,180
Thank you for your kindness, Star-Castle.

239
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,980
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to see you.

240
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,380
You don't have to apologize.

241
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,180
At your age,

242
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,380
it's really rare to break the Seven Stars Formation.

243
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Leader.

244
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
We all know

245
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,180
that you deliberately hid the Sand Formation.

246
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
It's really inappropriate to do so.

247
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Impudence!

248
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
You...

249
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,780
Which one did you sing?

250
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
It seems that

251
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,380
you chose Ning Qing Cheng.

252
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,780
Dao Jun once told me

253
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,180
that you're too heartless

254
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,780
and that you're with the Heavenly Emperor.

255
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,580
If an immortal is this cold-hearted,

256
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,780
he won't be an immortal in this life.

257
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,380
He'll only be a human immortal.

258
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
Celestial Palace.

259
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,580
How can Celestial Palace be like this?

260
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,380
Are you really going to betray the Star-Castle?

261
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,380
We only betrayed you.

262
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
But you are fighting with the enemy.

263
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,580
You really betrayed the Star-Castle

264
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,380
and Shang Li Celestial Palace.

265
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,380
You've been practicing the Seven Stars Formation for six months.

266
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,180
It seems that you've been preparing for this day

267
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,980
for a long time.

268
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
Leader,

269
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
you're too conceited.

270
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,780
Why did you give us this chance?

271
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Commander Su,

272
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,380
I know a secret path

273
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,180
that leads to the Celestial Palace.

274
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Really?

275
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,380
I'll accompany you.

276
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Plus me.

277
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
You go and save him first.

278
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
Brother Feng will stay with me

279
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,780
and help the chief together.

280
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Okay.

281
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,380
Stretch your arms this�로.

282
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,980
You guys are being too narcissistic.

283
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
Blackiman.

284
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,180
Full Strength.

285
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,480
Let's go.

286
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,980
Who is the one I'm holding?

287
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,700
The wind is blowing at night.

288
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,300
Who is the one you're looking at?

289
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,260
Who is the one you're holding?

290
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,380
Day and night, we meet again.

291
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,660
I don't know when I'll be alone,

292
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,220
or when I'll be with you.

293
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,260
I'm willing to let people come and go,

294
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,300
but who will be the one to stop me?

295
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,260
The sky and earth are vast,

296
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,140
but I'm not afraid of the sun or the moon.

297
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,420
The Keitholium soup is Hateful,

298
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,860
for I Mic

299
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,780
The200Pa,

300
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,540
it will clear my mind.

301
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,500
How glad I am I to know

302
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,340
that nothing in this world isсон.

303
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,900
The rain on the East-Sedin or the southeast-west

304
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,900
The moon is bright and the wind blows gently.

305
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,900
The rest of my life is spent in the carefree world.

306
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,760
I watch the stars and the moon

307
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,900
fluttering and falling.

308
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,400
The stars and the moon shine brightly.

309
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
The sky is bright and the moon shines brightly.

310
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I don't forget.

311
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,900
The rest of my life is spent in the carefree world.

312
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
I watch the stars and the moon

313
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,400
fluttering and falling.

314
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,900
The stars and the moon shine brightly.

315
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
The sky is bright and the moon shines brightly.

316
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,400
I don't forget.
