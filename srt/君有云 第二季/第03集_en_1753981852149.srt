00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
If Su Bai Yi enters the city,

3
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,000
we can only fight to the death in the Demon City.

4
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,600
Su Bai Yi is my wife's son.

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,600
I want to save her.

6
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
From now on,

7
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
our mission is no longer to take Su Bai Yi away.

8
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
We have to take this opportunity

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,800
to destroy the Demon City.

10
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Since you are willing to retreat with me,

11
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
please be prepared.

12
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
This is a battle of life and death.

13
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,800
I'll break the formation.

14
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Let me do it.

15
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
If we don't have a ship to lend a sword,

16
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
we can't get in the wind.

17
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
If we want to win,

18
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
we have to build a bridge.

19
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Brother.

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
The Xie family is willing to be the queen.

21
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
If the god is not here,

22
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
you can't protect them.

23
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,000
We have to try.

24
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
What if I'm here?

25
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
You want to leave?

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
I'll take care of you.

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,200
You are good.

28
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Can you fight well?

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Are you afraid of shame

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
for all the tricks?

31
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,000
You are right.

32
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
The advantage of formation is not in the majority.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's time to break the formation.

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
I'll follow the order of the chief.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,600
Brother.

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Brother.

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,200
Brother.

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,800
Brother.

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Brother.

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Brother.

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Brother.

42
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Brother.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Brother.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,600
Brother.

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,200
Brother.

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Brother.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Brother.

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Brother.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Brother.

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,600
Brother.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Brother.

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's fight!

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,200
The formation of deadly cloth

54
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,400
olinates!

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,560
You...

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,320
This...

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
Ying Qingcheng, come out!

58
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
Wasn't it me you were looking for?

59
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,160
Why did you rush to my senior sister?

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,160
Do you care about your senior sister so much?

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,040
You want to threaten me with your senior sister?

62
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,680
Your senior sister was badly injured by my kick.

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,640
If you keep delaying it,

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in the sickbed for the rest of your life.

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,040
What do you mean?

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,760
I know how to teach your senior sister.

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,880
Your master can also go down the mountain.

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,000
What about the conditions?

69
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,280
Xiaoqian.

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,160
What is it with you?

71
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,720
Senior sister,

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,440
it's all over now,

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,320
what are you going to do?

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,480
Senior sister.

75
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,080
I played a went to discover a treasure,

76
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,120
The last one is the New Law,

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
called the Dream.

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
Everyone knows

79
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,960
the Book of Immortals is the best martial art.

80
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,880
But they don't know

81
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,640
the Dream New Law

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,320
can restore people's meridians.

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
No matter how serious the injury is,

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
it can be repaired.

85
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,440
Back then, your second brother, Nan Yulou,

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,080
broke into Shanglin Heavenly Palace alone.

87
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
He was injured.

88
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,720
The injury in his body has been

89
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,080
incurable for so many years.

90
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
What a pity.

91
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,600
What a pity.

92
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,200
The Dream New Law

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,800
was taken away by my master.

94
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,120
That's right.

95
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
The Dream New Law

96
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
was taken away by my master.

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,280
If I'm not wrong,

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,760
your master, the old fox,

99
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,160
should have

100
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,040
put the Dream New Law

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,840
in your head.

102
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,480
He can only learn it from you.

103
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
You guessed it.

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,600
Then why did you

105
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,680
send your substitute to kill me?

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,480
What did you say?

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,960
I just asked him

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
to bring you here.

109
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,640
I see.

110
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm afraid you have a different purpose.

111
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
You want that immortal book, too, right?

112
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,440
It's really the dark one.

113
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
Since you've killed him,

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,480
let's not talk about him.

115
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,840
You give me

116
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,720
the Dream New Law here.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
Then I'll cure your senior

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,960
and send you down the mountain.

119
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
The new law can't be learned

120
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,240
in a day or two.

121
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Didn't you just say

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,880
my senior's injury can't be removed?

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,760
Back then, I was the first

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,840
to be ranked the best

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,480
with a good understanding.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,960
I've never been able to

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,680
master a martial art for more than three days.

128
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,440
Okay, I promise you.

129
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Senior.

130
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,200
Jingwu, you despicable man.

131
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,440
He...

132
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,200
He's the one who killed the chief.

133
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Why?

134
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Because he said he wanted to

135
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,600
stir up trouble.

136
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,600
Then...

137
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,240
I'm the deputy of the criminal court.

138
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,640
I was ordered to punish him

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,680
for betraying the Holy Spirit Palace.

140
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,600
I... I didn't do anything wrong.

141
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
Did you do anything wrong?

142
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,320
Are you sure you can explain it

143
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,640
to my senior and your brother?

144
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,920
You're arrogant.

145
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
You think I'm afraid of you?

146
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,600
Beat him.

147
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,440
You're not a good subject.

148
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
How dare you hit your senior?

149
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Let's go together.

150
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
Arrest him.

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,840
Go.

152
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,600
Arrest him.

153
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,200
Go.

154
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Don't worry.

155
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Leave the rest to me.

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,040
I believe you.

157
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,680
The six-stripe formation is hard to break.

158
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,880
Even the blood dance is like this.

159
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
I'm still behind you.

160
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
I've had many chances

161
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,520
to stop all this from happening.

162
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,920
But I still didn't do anything.

163
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,360
So,

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,880
the Holy Spirit Palace

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,480
has become what it is now.

166
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
What do you mean?

167
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
Since I made a choice today,

168
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
then some things

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,560
should be changed because of me.

170
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,480
Senior, don't.

178
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,520
When I was climbing the South Fishing Tower,

179
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,880
he said to me,

180
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,200
he said,

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,160
there's no destiny.

182
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm a star master.

183
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,680
I don't believe it.

184
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,600
But today,

185
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,520
I want to try.

186
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:38,060
It's not up to me to

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,040
achieve one more thing.

188
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,080
I don't know what I will do

189
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,520
when I have enough time.

190
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,360
Why don't you ask me

191
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
if there is still a chance?

192
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,480
There is a chance.

193
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,160
If there's a chance,

194
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,720
But I need to pay for my life.

195
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,600
Stop running.

196
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,720
plate pass

197
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,760
My friend.

198
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Bracelet

199
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
I suddenly have a bad feeling.

200
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,160
The Lin Tian Palace is going to be in chaos soon.

201
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
The Jianghu is also going to be in chaos.

202
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,160
That's why I'm worried about those young people playing chess with me.

203
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,160
The first snow of the Dragon Mountain should have fallen.

204
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
The snow in there is too far away from us.

205
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm more concerned about the people who are playing chess with me.

206
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
It's the battle now.

207
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Mr. Long, although it's already this moment,

208
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I still want to say

209
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,160
that it's not worth it for the present Shanglin Tian Palace.

210
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
It's not worth it.

211
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
It's just whether I regret it or not.

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Then do you regret it now?

213
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I've tried my best.

214
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
You died in the battle.

215
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Qingming Garden lost its people.

216
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
The future Shanglin Tian Palace,

217
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Qingming Garden will not be able to live up to glory.

218
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Qingming Garden has never had glory.

219
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
We are all people living in darkness.

220
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
He fell into the dark in this way.

221
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
He must have some regrets.

222
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,160
I left an order before I came.

223
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
If I die,

224
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Qingming Garden will be disbanded.

225
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Why?

226
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Qingming Garden's era

227
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,160
will end today.

228
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
In Mr. Long's heart,

229
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
there is a will.

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
There is no will.

231
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
I just want to kill you.

232
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Mr. Long is dead.

233
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Bai Qi Le,

234
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
you are the next one.

235
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Mr. Long,

236
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Mr. Long is dead.

Our chess chess just moved

248
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,360
It seems that two 50-50

249
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,020
must not be mixed

250
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.
