1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sky is clear, the wind is strong, the clouds are high, the sky is clear, the clouds are high.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high.

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There aren't many ties between the two.

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Schools come with flowers, it's more basic.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Would the story never end?

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:54,920
The cooks at a虎峰 can't如果能跟

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:18,960
which simultaneously

10
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
The world is in chaos.

11
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
You might want to hear about it.

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Only the immortal books can cure Princess Ning Qingcheng's wounds.

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I came to you this time because I need you to do something very important.

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
You know what Shanglin Heavenly Palace is like now.

15
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
It's very strong.

16
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,960
The things that belong to Shanglin Heavenly Palace are not in the world.

17
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,960
I order you to bring some big trouble to the world.

18
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Give me the immortal books.

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
You are friends.

20
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
You won't help her.

21
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Although we are friends, I am destined to be in Shanglin Heavenly Palace.

22
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Stop!

23
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Brother, help me!

24
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Go!

25
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
You want to die?

26
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Take this!

27
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
You are dead!

28
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
We failed.

29
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Brother Mo, my acupuncture is very strong.

30
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
I need you to teach me how to use the sword.

31
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,960
It's said that the immortal can't break the six-strikes formation.

32
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Although it's not necessary, it depends on the ability of the master.

33
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,960
It seems that the master is confident that he can beat us with his own strength.

34
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
You are wrong.

35
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
There are three people on our side.

36
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Three people?

37
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Just two of them?

38
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
You need to use some strength to deal with the chief.

39
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,960
But in the six-strikes formation, it's easy to kill these two young people.

40
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Easy to kill?

41
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
You are so arrogant!

42
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,960
What's the name of the guy who used the sword?

43
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Why do you ask my name?

44
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
You are the chief.

45
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
You are the chief.

46
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,960
What's the name of the guy who used the sword?

47
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Why do you ask my name?

48
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Because you will die.

49
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
It's not easy to kill me.

50
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I can tell you my name.

51
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I'm the strongest man in the snow palace.

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Feng Zhuojun.

53
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Feng Zhuojun.

54
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Go up from here and you will find the place where the flower blooms.

55
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Master, you must wait for me.

56
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Go.

57
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Four against four.

58
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Do you have a plan?

59
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Don't worry.

60
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
These people are not ordinary.

61
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,960
If we attack them, we can easily attract the others.

62
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
We need to find a way to attract them.

63
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
What are you doing?

64
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
It's your turn.

65
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
I know.

66
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Who are you?

67
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Senior Bai Xiao, save me.

68
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
The guard of the prison?

69
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
What happened?

70
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Senior Bai Xiao, the people who broke into the mountain have been injured.

71
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Go to help them.

72
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
They are injured?

73
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Yes.

74
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
They are very skilled.

75
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,960
But we are not allowed to leave here.

76
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
He looks smart.

77
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
He is a coward.

78
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Jianchen, why don't you rest here?

79
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Rest?

80
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I really don't know.

81
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Are you afraid of death because you are not allowed to go to the garden?

82
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
I am afraid of death, so I can't go.

83
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
You...

84
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Let me fight to the death.

85
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I hope you can be like this.

86
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
You should hide here.

87
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
What should I do?

88
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
They are not allowed to go to the garden.

89
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
The third son of Xie family, Xie Yuling, is here.

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960
I will help you if you want to die.

91
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Xie Dazi is here.

92
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Nonsense.

93
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
The real attack is coming.

94
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Do we need help?

95
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
You...

96
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I will kill you.

97
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
What should we do now?

98
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
You stay here.

99
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
You two, follow me.

100
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Yes.

101
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
He is good at fighting.

102
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's go.

103
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Go.

104
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
This is their conspiracy.

105
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,960
One is for the first person book, the other is to eliminate the first person.

106
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Why do you come to this mess?

107
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Go.

108
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Stop dreaming.

109
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
No one can go today.

110
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I am afraid I can't go as you wish.

111
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Die together.

112
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Set set go!

113
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Amitabha,

114
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
are you in a time of trouble,

115
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
I will have a60 to help you.

116
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Many thanks for your help, master.

117
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Very well.

118
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,960
It looks like the princess I was is a failure.

119
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,960
You all have to die today!

120
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Oh no!

121
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,960
He's letting go of the strength of the meridians in his body!

122
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Amitabha.

123
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I'm going to kill you.

124
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,960
The Shanglin Palace needs a future.

125
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
But you are not that person.

126
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Am I?

127
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
No!

128
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Sato!

129
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Sato!

130
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Sato!

131
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
The blood is black.

132
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
As the chief of the criminal court,

133
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
you betrayed the Shanglin Palace.

134
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
You poisoned the tea!

135
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
You...

136
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Sato!

137
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Oh no!

138
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Maybe this is the end of me.

139
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Sato!

140
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Sato!

141
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
As the chief of the criminal court,

142
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
you betrayed the Shanglin Palace.

143
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I have already punished you.

144
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Good job!

145
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Master, the disciple is here!

146
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Su Bai Yi?

147
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
How come?

148
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Are you surprised?

149
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,960
It's your fault that the disciple you sent died so quickly.

150
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Impossible.

151
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,960
You are as cunning as your disciple.

152
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Ning Qingcheng, your plan is failed.

153
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Let my master go.

154
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
You want to die?

155
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Sato!

156
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Senior!

157
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Senior, are you okay?

158
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm fine.

159
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Senior.

160
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Senior, Su, we are here.

161
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Be careful!

162
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
You!

163
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Senior!

164
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
I don't have time to waste with you.

165
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,960
If you want to save him, follow me.

166
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Stop!

167
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Sun Yuling, protect my master!

168
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Give me back my senior!

169
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,960
The sky is clear, the moon is bright.

170
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

171
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

172
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

173
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

174
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

175
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

176
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

177
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

178
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

179
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

180
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,960
The moon is bright, the moon is bright.

181
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
You
