1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sky is clear, the wind is strong, the clouds are high, the sky is clear, the clouds are high

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The sky is clear, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sky is clear, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The clouds are high, the clouds are high, the clouds are high

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,380
Should I do a deep harass or wipe you out with my

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,760
Colombia

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's going on?

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I haven't been in the world for so many years.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I didn't expect to meet you again.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've never seen such an interesting place.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You've been gone for so many years.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Where have you been?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There are many interesting places in this world.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Have you been to a place where there is no day and only night?

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Or a place where there is no night and only day?

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You have seen hundreds of thousands of mountains.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No matter how strong the master is, he can't find a place to go.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Have you been to a thousand miles of snow mountains?

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Have you seen a mountain of divine light?

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Of course you haven't.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're just stuck in that pond.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You want to be the best in the world.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've been to those places you said.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a pity that I've been in the cage all these years.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Those places are as wonderful as you said.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are you back now?

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I thought I had been lost for years.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No one could find me.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But the letter that made me have to come here

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
still fell into my hands.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If I'm not wrong, the city of Xuanwei is a chess game.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who dares to play chess on my territory?

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't care.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I never mind that as a chess piece,

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I appear on the chessboard.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And then you break out of the game?

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I like it too.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We have different positions.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Whoever starts first will be given a chance to win.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Before it's time to fight for life,

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
why don't we play a game together?

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Tonight, I want to eat this fish.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's see if you can beat me.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Boy, how about we compete with each other?

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The older you are, the more powerful your martial arts are.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But if you ask about the power,

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the longer you practice, the more powerful you are.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The sound of the Xue's God is just a middle-aged man.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Su Jian and Wang Yi are both old people.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
With the inner power, will Su Jian have a chance?

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The Xue's God has been practicing Tongtian Cells for many years.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The inner power is indeed hard to find.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Tongtian Cells?

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Tongtian Cells are not trained.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Tongtian Cells are planted.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This elder knows a lot.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It seems that you are the successor of that old man.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's because he refused to give me Tongtian Cells.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's why I practiced another martial art.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The Destruction of the Divine Attack?

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
As far as I know,

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Destruction of the Divine Attack is a martial art that pursues pure inner power.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's very violent.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm a swordsman.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Inner power is a thief to me.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What does it mean?

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Your martial arts have improved a lot over the years.

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It seems that I have to change something else tonight.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Stinky old man.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I almost killed you with that gun just now.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll get you.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why doesn't it work on him?

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I didn't expect that there is another master here who can break the purple jade in an instant.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You want to absorb my inner power?

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What you used just now is the martial arts on the immortal book.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It doesn't matter what martial arts he has.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who won this battle?

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think it's the young man around you.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He is not simple.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What is the result of the victory?

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll help you.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You go first.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll meet the old man.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ah!

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Master, can't you be gentle?

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I just helped you win the battle.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Master, you brought me here.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Isn't it just the blood god?

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If the blood god comes, why do you run away?

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That blood god is very evil.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You!

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What an interesting young man.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll go.

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Someone is playing the flute in the woods.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It seems that person is the one who manipulated the puppet.

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Should I go after him?

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Do you understand the melody?

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't hear anything.

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The melody tells us that

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
mountains are high and water is long.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We will meet again soon.

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No need to rush.

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No matter if this person is the blood god,

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
he is an interesting person.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What are you playing?

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Save me.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you asking me to save him?

122
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Master, you called yourself the Demon Lord.

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You have been in the rivers and lakes for many years.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why are you running away from me today?

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I have been thinking that

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
if I go back to the rivers and lakes,

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I will be a person with great experience.

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I just fought with this old man

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
to defeat two great masters of Tianwu.

130
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Who saw it? Who remembered it?

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Me.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You?

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You wanted to be the last one to see me.

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Then you said you were the one who won.

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How could I?

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I must be in the Heroes Conference.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Everyone is watching.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Only then can I have fun.

139
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is there anything wrong with what I said?

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I just didn't expect you to be so vain.

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is different from the Demon Lord I imagined.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What should the Demon Lord you imagined be like?

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The so-called Demon Lord?

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He is a man of the wind.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He should not be limited to fame.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Kill him if you want.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No matter when he kills, where he kills,

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and why he kills.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You are talking about the Demon Lord, not the Demon Lord.

151
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The so-called Demon Lord is not important

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
because it is the Demon Lord.

153
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It is the Lord.

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Do you know what the Lord is?

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Of course it is the Lord.

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The Demon Lord is the Lord of the Demon Head.

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The biggest Demon Head.

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Could it be the Lord of the Lord?

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's right.

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It is the Lord of the Lord.

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It seems that you are my friend.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I have been living with my ancestors for a few months.

164
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was afraid that he would kill me from the beginning.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Now he calls himself his friend.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I can't understand the so-called Demon Lord's temper.

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What?

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You want to run again?

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am coming.

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Lord of the Tree.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why are you sitting here alone?

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Look what I have prepared for you.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You are smart.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Lord of the Tree.

176
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Since your martial arts are so high,

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
why do you need Tianji Xia?

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Tianji Xia is the highest level of our family's history.

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
How can it be obtained by outsiders?

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What is in Tianji Xia?

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Since you are my family's son,

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it is okay to tell you.

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It is said that hundreds of years ago,

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
there were four great families in the world.

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The four great families are the Su family of the North,

186
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the Lv family of the South,

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the Ye family of the West,

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and the Mo family of the East.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
These four great families guard against the enemies outside the four realms.

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Outside the four realms?

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Outside the four realms is the world outside the world.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It is said that there are strong and powerful people in those worlds.

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The duties of the four great families are to prevent their invasion.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Until the battle of Kuangshi,

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
although the enemies outside the four realms were defeated,

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the survivors of the four great families were less than 20%.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
These 20% people eventually scattered into the world.

198
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Some still maintained the power of the clan.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
For example, the Su family came to the mountain of the dragon.

200
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Some completely disappeared into the world.

201
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But the four great families left a strong warrior

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
guarding the four directions.

203
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Every 100 years, the four great families will send a new guardian to change the world.

204
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wait, wait, wait.

205
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Master, are you sure you are not talking about the gods?

206
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Such a crazy story.

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How come I have never heard of it since I was a child?

208
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Because of this,

209
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
only the most core disciples of the four great families

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
knew about the story of the Su family.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
When I first entered the martial arts world,

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the two most famous clans in the martial arts world

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
were the Wuji and the Heroic clan.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have heard of it.

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
One south, one north, the world is divided.

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What world is divided?

217
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It is just a group of scoundrels.

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes, yes, yes.

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Master Shu is much stronger than a scoundrel.

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
A gentleman does not fight.

221
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I said something wrong.

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We still talk about the weather.

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
When I was a student in the martial arts world,

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I did not care about these two clans.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They gave me the title of a demon king.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I think it's good.

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I went to school for half a year.

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
By the way,

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I have a classmate friend

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
named Dongfang Wenlin.

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
How is he now?

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What?

233
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The demon king and the hero are in the same bed?

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Heroic?

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This guy has inherited the title of a hero?

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It seems that my taste is really good.

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But so many years have passed.

238
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He should have become an old scholar.

239
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you want to tell him?

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I am the one you are looking for.

241
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Zhusheng Dongfang Xiaoyue

242
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Don't say it, don't say it.

243
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Absolutely not.

244
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
By the way, Master Shu, what happened later?

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Maybe it's because I made too much noise in the martial arts world.

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
My father sent someone to look for me.

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Then I went back to Mount Weilong

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and was punished by the family rules.

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't accept it.

250
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why is it that Mount Weilong is inherited from such a powerful ancestor?

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This generation also has many great martial arts.

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But they live here.

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If we go down the mountain,

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
where else is there any Wuji sword clan and hero?

255
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
My father accused me

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that the existence of the Su clan is to guard the world.

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The world, not to bring chaos to the world.

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was used to the world at that time.

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How can I be convinced by this?

260
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I said I was going to see the Su clan's guardian in Beijing.

261
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
My father thought I was crazy.

262
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So he put me in a depression.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
At that time, I had the opportunity to escape.

264
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But I gave up on the situation.

265
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I waited for the day my father changed his mind.

266
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Unfortunately...

267
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Unfortunately, the Su family and my father were in trouble.

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Then Tianji Xia was taken away.

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You told me about these things before.

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But you didn't mention your past.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Then I was heartbroken.

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I heard the news of Tianji Xia again.

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I know what happened after that.

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Master, can we let go of it first?

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's broken.

277
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I almost forgot you.

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you think it's easy to get over today?

279
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's suitable.

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You always say your martial arts are not good.

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I tried several times.

282
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's really bad.

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But you used a martial arts to Wang Lingxiao.

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I remember Wang Lingxiao said the name of this martial arts.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Immortal Book.

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It sounds interesting.

287
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He's talking nonsense.

288
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I just hit him.

289
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He was afraid of losing face.

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So he deliberately said I was powerful.

291
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Now is not the time for you to talk.

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Master.

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Master.

294
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You point at the window, who is in love?

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Who is the one you are attracted to?

296
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Day and night, you are with me.

297
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The sun rises and sets.

298
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't know when the moon will rise.

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I look at you and think about you.

300
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The heart is happy and bright.

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
People come and go.

302
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Who is the one?

303
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The sky and earth are bright.

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't dare to look at the sun and moon.

305
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The moon and the stars are bright.

306
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I laugh and look at the world.

307
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I look at the night and the wind.

308
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I look at the stars and the moon.

309
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I can see the stars and the moon.

310
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like the light of the night.

311
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The moon shines brightly.

312
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I look at the stars and the moon.

313
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I look at the stars and the moon.

314
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can feel the stars and the moon.

315
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The moon shines brightly.

316
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,060
you
