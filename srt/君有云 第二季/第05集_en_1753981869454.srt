1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The King's Avatar

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 1

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I've seen this sword before

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Go to hell

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's a pity that the strong people in the eyes of the world

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The five ways are not returned

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I still can't go through three moves

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let go of my senior

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Senior, why are the two swords together?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Together with this guy

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Little trick

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How is it possible

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How is it possible

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I didn't expect you to have a backhand

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are too anxious

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't expect the princess who was in the sky

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Will be fooled so easily

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't even learn the immortal book

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't even think of it

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I grew up in the village with my master since childhood

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know the methods in the city better than anyone

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Princess Ning is the first person in the martial arts world

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But the methods and those small people

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There is no difference

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's talk about the conditions

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Talk about your uncle's conditions

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Go

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Senior, what is this sword?

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is Ning Qingcheng's unique sword

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wugou

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wugou

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He deserves this name

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Little girl

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Your sword skills are not bad

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But Wugou is not a sword

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But a sword formation

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If one person has a sword formation

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As long as I have a sword

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can do it

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can do it

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can do it

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I can do it

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can do it

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can do it

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can do it

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can do it

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can do it

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can do it

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
As long as my sword formation is in my Wugou sword formation

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My sword spirit is nowhere

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The person who enters the formation is nowhere to be hidden

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Only death

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Now give me the last part of the immortal book

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can save you

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Stop dreaming

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Then I will fulfill you

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Senior

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sword spirit and qi are different?

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think of a way to deal with this sword formation

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want to try

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't risk it

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Senior

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Trust me

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Seven Stars Great Technique

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come with me

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Su Baiyi

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Seven Stars Great Technique

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't let me see you

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can't do it

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't do it

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You can't do it

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can't do it

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can't do it

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You can't do it

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can't do it

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can't do it

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You can't do it

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can't do it

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then let me see how powerful you are

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Su Baiyi

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come back quickly

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can definitely do it

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Seven Stars Great Technique

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Seven Stars

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Su Baiyi

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Senior

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I succeeded

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can really do it

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Su Baiyi

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How did you do it?

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The martial arts I learned in the immortal book

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's not strange

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
When the five-star moves

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I tried it boldly

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can take the sword spirit and qi as your own

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What an immortal book

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Your sword formation is not enough

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Or change the name to useless

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Su Baiyi

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Su Baiyi

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Su Baiyi

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Su Baiyi

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It seems to be underestimated

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you really think

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Just rely on you

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Learned martial arts from the immortal book

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Can kill me

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Chaos

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Chaos sword

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Can force you to this point

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It really gave me a surprise

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dragon Lord

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wen Xi, the chief of the Qianji Academy

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Said he lost to He Lin Xiyue

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
According to the previous agreement

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wen Xi's chief has taken people away

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I suddenly changed my previous idea

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is still lonely for the general

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Maybe some people will stay

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The plan for us in the future is more powerful

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's up to you to decide

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Can that little thief do it?

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why is it so steep?

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You know the way

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You go

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
My injury has almost recovered

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You have worked hard all the way

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Just rest here for a while

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you for your help

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No problem

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sister

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What kind of monster is he?

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The world's number one

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
After all, it is the world's number one

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Even if it was once

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Be careful

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is your last chance

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Who are you scaring?

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You are just a strong end

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Killing you two is enough

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let me

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sister

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Sister

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't be impulsive

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is the exclusive swordplay of Ning Qingcheng

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It is said that after the attack, it will hurt the soul

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hard to cure

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Sister

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What sister?

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Even if it hurts the soul

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will also kill you

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How can you be impulsive?

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, what is this swordplay?

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The swordplay that is like your life

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Humph

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Little trick

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is my

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This move

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look there

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It seems that there is no need to look

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There is not much time

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hurry up

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hurry up

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hurry up

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hurry up

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hurry up

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hurry up

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hurry up

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hurry up

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's actually on him

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Horse and flower

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What is this?

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What kind of martial arts?

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is what I just did from that swordplay

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The secret of the hidden weapon

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
In addition to the fairy book

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The strongest sword is

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The name is reincarnation

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Sister

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I didn't expect you to be so impulsive

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I am not impulsive

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I am not impulsive

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I am not impulsive

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't expect that I, Ning Qingcheng, would be so impulsive

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And die in the hands of you two

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Say it again

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Kid

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You are right

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The fairy book is a little burnt, it really doesn't work

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
At this moment

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The power on my body can't be turned around

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But you know

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Even at this moment

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If I want to kill you two

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I still have that power

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Senior

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you keep fighting like this

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You will attract others

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why do we have to fight like this?

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Pidnis is dead

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Who is the other person?

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You kid is so clear

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Forget it

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Since he is here

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I will keep this power to say goodbye to my old friend

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Are you going to die?

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There are some things

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I have been looking for the answer

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Say it

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You want this world to be chaotic

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Want this human heart to be divided

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What is it for?

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If I didn't do that thing back then

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There is no such thing as if

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Will it be the same now?

241
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It seems that you really gave me a surprise

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Don't worry

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I won't kill your senior

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then please do as you please

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I really can't fight

246
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can't fight

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But you have to leave with me

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm so tired now that I can't even lift the sword

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Do you think I still have the strength to resist?

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Your father Su Han, the princess

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Invited Ning Qingcheng to Shanglin Tiangong

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Later, Su Han was assassinated

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And Ning Qingcheng

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But become the master of Shanglin Tiangong

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Master

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What do you mean?

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can kill your enemy

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You don't have any regrets

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You mean

260
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Stop acting

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I know you're ready to do it at any time

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This kind of trick

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Can't fool me

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Humph

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No matter what you say is true or false

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I won't give up

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You are not curious

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why didn't I go to your master?

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Because

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm waiting for them to come up with their own ideas

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm willing to do it

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Watch out

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Master

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Master He Lian

276
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Where did you learn this swordplay?

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Ning Qingcheng

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Ning Qingcheng is dead

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Really dead

280
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What does your apprentice do?

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Can you beat him down and then talk about it?

282
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Take out all your strength

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can't be defeated

284
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You see the flowers are not flowers

285
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Take this paper

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You will have more strength

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
OK

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This is

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The Magical Man's Book

290
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He actually practiced the Magical Man's Book

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
How about the game I set today?

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm going to the capital

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
