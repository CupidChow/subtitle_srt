The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

The sky is long and the wind is strong

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The sky is long and the wind is strong

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
The

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:02:01,560
destroying

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Episode 9

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,920
What you just used

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,560
Your martial arts are better than others.

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,760
I just hit him once.

47
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
He was afraid that he would lose face

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
and deliberately said that I was powerful.

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,480
Now is not the time for you to talk.

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,960
Uncle.

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,920
You little boy,

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
you have no truth in your mouth.

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,240
You are the disciple of Xie Kanhua,

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
a disciple of the Su clan.

55
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,040
How can you be so useless?

56
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,760
But if you are really useless,

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,440
why is Bai Ji Le

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,320
so interested in you?

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,080
Uncle,

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,120
you sent this door yourself.

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,520
So,

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
you are absorbing my inner power now.

63
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,160
Sorry, uncle.

64
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm not afraid of you.

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,680
I'm just afraid that you can't eat

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,760
my old bones' inner power.

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
Here again.

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,800
It seems that you are not

69
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,520
strange to us anymore.

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,280
Why do I always come here

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
in my dreams?

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,240
Because you belong here.

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,320
Can you stop

74
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
saying such ridiculous things?

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,560
My name is Su Bai Yi.

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
My home is either in the Dragon Mountain

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,480
or in the Flower Village.

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,680
Why is it not here?

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,680
Dragon Mountain?

80
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,800
That is where I, Li Xuan Bing,

81
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,360
will eventually be destroyed.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,400
Li Xuan Bing?

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,520
You are the one

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
who led the battle of Yingzhou Lai Ke

85
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,160
and my father.

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,200
He is not a simple man.

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
You had a dream.

88
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,360
It seems that it is still a bad dream.

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Uncle,

90
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,040
you said that

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
the Four Mirror Guardian...

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,000
What?

93
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
You still don't believe it?

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
Since you don't believe it,

95
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,560
I will just say it.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,760
Why don't you tell me

97
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,000
about your martial arts

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
of the Western people's martial arts?

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,840
You are very cunning.

100
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,440
If I don't have

101
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,160
such a deep inner power,

102
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,560
I will definitely find you.

103
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
The Four Mirror Guardian?

104
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,760
Which family is it from?

105
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,480
The Southern Realm is the Lü family.

106
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,360
They once lived in the South Sea.

107
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,440
But they disappeared long ago.

108
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,200
Why do you ask this?

109
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,640
Eighteen years ago,

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,240
there were a thousand coast guards in the South Sea.

111
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,680
The man on the horse

112
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
claimed to be Yingzhou Lai Ke.

113
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
The man on the horse is named Lü.

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,120
His name is...

115
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,640
Li Xuan Bing?

116
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,720
Li Xuan Bing?

117
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,600
My name is...

118
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,960
Li Xuan Bing...

119
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
How is it going?

120
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,920
I fear that the Capital Island

121
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
should only have a time limit.

122
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,200
What time limit?

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,280
When the farming boom is pulled off,

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,600
Yingzhou Island

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
will scene dark

126
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
拣收食物

127
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,560
and will have to fall in Otherworldly looks again.

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
Flowing kitten sorry

129
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
In fact, they really are gonna come back.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and those guests from Yingzhou.

131
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,800
Is there any way

132
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,360
to stop them?

133
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
This time, the Northern Forest of Yingzhou

134
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,120
is the last chance

135
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
for them in the past hundred years.

136
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,560
For us,

137
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
the only chance

138
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
is to fight against them.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The Northern Forest of Yingzhou

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is the last chance

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
for them in the past hundred years.

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For us,

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
the only chance

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is to fight against them.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
For us,

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the only chance

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
is to fight against them.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For us,

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the only chance

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is to fight against them.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
For us,

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the only chance

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:16,800
can be f stirring up control of the

154
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
water.

155
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,240
Gosh.

156
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,240
Even the water can't match with the princess's body,

157
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm a century younger than you.

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,600
Have you stronger?

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,920
Tolkien IV

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,440
Drink some of this Vice- seria

161
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,240
Hey, mate

162
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,040
Come to eat some grapes

163
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Mate, do you want to add liquor

164
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,320
I'd like to

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,920
drink with all of my mouldYes

166
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:54,680
This

167
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,440
Prince

168
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,320
Wang Wu Yu.

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Wang Wu Yu?

170
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,360
Captain, I bought this boat.

171
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,640
Sir, this is my food.

172
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,800
How could I sell it to you?

173
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,560
Sell it. Sell it. Sell it.

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,080
Sir,

175
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,320
I have a few boats at home.

176
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,440
How about you...

177
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,880
Think about it.

178
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
I prefer

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,640
your unyielding look.

180
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
Sir. Sir.

181
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,920
Let's talk about it.

182
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,880
Sir.

183
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,160
What are you going to do?

184
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
Tell me.

185
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,800
What's your relationship with Wang Wu Yu?

186
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,680
What does it have to do with you?

187
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,440
It has nothing to do with me.

188
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,480
I just think

189
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
he's a little bit of a coward.

190
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
I want to beat him up.

191
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,640
If you don't tell me,

192
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,880
I'll stop.

193
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,040
Don't do anything stupid.

194
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,440
If you do it now,

195
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
the whole Xuanwei City will know about us.

196
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,800
Then tell me

197
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,760
about your relationship with him.

198
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,360
Did he steal your girl

199
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,760
or beat you up when you were a kid?

200
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,440
He was my sister's lover.

201
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
My sister came to Xuanwei City

202
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,560
to attend the flower shop and met him.

203
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,120
She fell in love with him.

204
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,400
Then they fell in love.

205
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,120
A few months later,

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
the Wang family came to the court.

207
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,040
They blamed the Wang family

208
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,440
for cheating on their son.

209
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,360
We didn't ask which son it was.

210
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,600
We thought it was the third son, Wang Bu Yu.

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,760
Then we met him directly.

212
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,320
We only knew on the wedding day

213
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,480
that Wang Buli, the son of the Wang family, was the one who cheated.

214
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,280
Wang Buli?

215
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,880
Wang Buli was a high fever when he was three years old.

216
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,080
He burned his head.

217
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,120
A Chir

218
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
and my sister have never met.

219
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,440
It's a pity that the marriage contract was broken.

220
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,560
It's a loss.

221
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,360
The masters don't want to offend the Wang family.

222
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,560
My brother and I stopped the fight.

223
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,360
They were badly injured.

224
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,200
Wang Buli,

225
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,320
I want to kill him first.

226
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,640
Let me go.

227
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Calm down.

228
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
If we fight,

229
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
the whole Xuanwei City will know we are here.

230
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
Isn't that what I told you just now?

231
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,960
Wait here.

232
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
I'll help you get rid of the bad guys.

233
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,680
Beauty, you're so good.

234
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
Who?

235
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm a friend of your Mr. Wang.

236
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,080
Mr. Wang, do you remember me?

237
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,160
You?

238
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
Who?

239
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,400
In the prison,

240
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,800
we had a drink together. Do you remember?

241
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,120
Prison?

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,320
All right, you can leave.

243
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm Feng Yuling.

244
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,760
Feng family?

245
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,640
Is it the Feng family of Tian Xiaoyun?

246
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,760
It's Mr. Feng.

247
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,440
Look.

248
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,520
Look at yourself.

249
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,200
Mr. Feng, you're good at martial arts.

250
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Come on, let's have a drink.

251
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,520
Taiqing Hongyun?

252
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,880
I can smell it from your smell.

253
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,440
It's the Hang family.

254
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,240
Of course.

255
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,920
It's a good wine.

256
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Let's have a drink.

257
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,040
Bro,

258
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,640
which Feng family are you from?

259
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,520
You really forget me, Mr. Feng.

260
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,880
Mr. Feng,

261
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm from the next room.

262
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
This is the room.

263
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,520
Can you speak louder?

264
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,600
Come on.

265
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,600
I...

266
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm...

267
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,240
Feng Liu, you're so mad.

268
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,880
Mr. Feng.

269
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,920
Mr. Feng.

270
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,480
Save me.

271
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,800
Mr. Feng.

272
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,440
Mr. Feng.

273
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Save me.

274
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,520
You're too reckless.

275
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
What are you afraid of?

276
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm just asking if you're happy now.

277
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,920
You don't have to say it.

278
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
Mr. Feng.

279
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
If you want to thank Mr. Feng,

280
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,840
you must find him.

281
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,400
Thank Mr. Feng?

282
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,040
I don't care about him.

283
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,760
Even if it's the Feng family of Tian Xiaoyun,

284
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,120
I'll beat him.

285
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Mr. Feng,

286
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
be quiet.

287
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,440
The master is taking a guest.

288
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
What guest?

289
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Take a guest to the restaurant.

290
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,400
In this shabby house,

291
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
what guest can he bring?

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Be quiet.

293
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,360
The guest is...

294
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Wang Laosan.

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,280
You want to invite me to the restaurant?

296
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
Dongfangqi?

297
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,080
You don't need to go to the restaurant.

298
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,760
The three masters of the four families

299
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
drink in the restaurant together.

300
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm afraid it's not good to say it out.

301
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,400
Three?

302
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,640
My late nephew.

303
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,280
I also like the restaurant.

304
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,360
But such an invitation

305
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,960
must be said quietly next time.

306
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,640
You...

307
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Wang Laosan.

308
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Say hello to your uncles.

309
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,000
I, Bu Yu,

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,320
greet uncle Dongfang

311
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
and uncle Lu.

312
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
Old-tempered man, I

313
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,720
greet Bu Yu and his late nephew.

314
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
You can leave.

315
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes.

316
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,520
Brother Ruoxu.

317
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,520
In the future, your Wang family

318
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,360
will be inherited by this Bu Yu?

319
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm still healthy.

320
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
I don't rush to find someone to take over.

321
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,840
Today, the three of us will sit in a hall together.

322
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,640
The main thing is to discuss

323
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,840
the Hero Conference in three days.

324
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,240
Hero Conference.

325
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
The Wang family's host

326
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,720
will be the Wang family.

327
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,480
We just come to eat and have a meal.

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,400
What do we need to discuss?

329
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,480
There is a big thing to discuss.

330
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,200
The four of us

331
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,080
will have a new big parent

332
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,160
in about three months.

333
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,640
Since the four families are discussing,

334
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,960
thank you.

335
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
The Xie family.

336
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,440
The Xie family.

337
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Maybe the four families

338
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,560
should be changed to three families.

339
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,000
Master.

340
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
What's up?

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,680
A guest is asking to see you.

342
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,040
What guest?

343
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,200
Young Master Xie of the Xie family, Xie Xing.

344
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,840
Why is he here?

345
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,160
Miss Nangong.

346
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
What are you talking about?

347
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,720
The four families are discussing.

348
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,320
They are leaving you.

349
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,040
They are talking about

350
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,720
the Xie family being kicked out of the four families.

351
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,720
It's all my fault.

352
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,480
Why didn't the Xie family

353
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,280
choose a host these years?

354
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,400
You should ask your father.

355
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,040
If he hadn't left,

356
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,520
the Xie family wouldn't be here now.

357
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,320
Master had kept it for him.

358
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,760
But he left.

359
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,800
The rest of the uncles

360
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,960
would be angry at Master.

361
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,560
In the end,

362
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,480
a messy senior was born.

363
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,520
Young Master Xie.

364
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,920
Please leave.

365
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,480
It's beyond my expectation.

366
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
I didn't expect Master Wang

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,920
to choose to see me.

368
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,760
I thought the four families

369
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,840
would be changed to three families.

370
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,560
Don't be too early.

371
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I'm sorry.

372
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
I'm sorry.

373
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
I'm sorry.

375
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
I'm sorry.

378
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
