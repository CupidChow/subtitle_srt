00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm so tired.

5
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,980
You can ask the workers

6
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,980
to do these things.

7
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,940
Why bother to do these things yourself?

8
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,700
It's more meaningful to do these things myself.

9
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,180
Fine. You're an affectionate person.

10
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
We're pushovers.

11
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,820
You don't understand human love.

12
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,580
Get back to work.

13
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,060
Get back to work.

[Will you marry me?]

15
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,660
It's done.

16
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,580
Hello.

17
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,380
It's me. Don't hang up.

18
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,420
I have something to tell you.

19
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,100
Do you remember what you promised me

20
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,260
when you got drunk at the auction?

21
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,860
What is it?

22
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,180
If you want to know it,

23
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,300
come to the square where we sold flowers before.

24
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,140
So what did she promise you that night?

25
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,480
She didn't promise me anything.

26
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,140
I made it up because I want her to come.

27
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,300
Mr. Gu,

28
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,340
will Ms. Qiao come?

29
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,820
Should we arrange for a car to pick her up?

30
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,420
She will come.

31
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,140
She will definitely come.

32
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,940
Hello, Ms. Qiao.

33
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,140
Mr. Gu asked me to pick you up.

34
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
Ms. Qiao, Mr. Gu is waiting for you upstairs.

35
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
Why are you here? Where is Gu Yi?

36
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,540
You won't see him today.

37
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,780
What?

38
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,460
Are you proud to see him

39
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,180
rebelling for you?

40
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,380
Is it great

41
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,180
to manipulate him?

42
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,900
It's none of your business.

43
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,470
Why is it none of my business?

44
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,060
If it weren't for you,

45
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,830
we would have been married.

46
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,420
He doesn't love you.

47
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,300
If it wasn't me, there would be someone else.

48
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,460
Do you think you can be fearless

49
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,700
because of this baby?

50
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,300
Do you think that this baby

51
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,820
can help you marry into the Gu family?

52
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,020
This baby is a black mark against Gu Yi.

53
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,540
The Gu family won't accept it.

54
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,220
They won't let it be born either.

55
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,700
Come back! Stop!

Let go of me!

58
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,380

I don't want them to worry.

83

I understood.

84

to confirm whether the baby is dead?

105
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,260
Don't worry. As you wish,

106

it's dead.

107
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,060
This baby came unexpectedly.

108
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,460
If it was born,  it would be illegitimate.

109
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,820
This result

110
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,540
might be the best.

You want to use children to marry into the Gu family.

112
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,060
That's impossible.

113
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,060
In your eyes,

114
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,820
this baby was a tool for marrying into the Gu family?

115
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,940
Wan't that your plan?

116
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,180
It was my baby.

117
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,380
I never wanted to use it.

118
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,580
And I don't care about the Gu family.

119
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,780
No matter what,

120
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,180
you've suffered.

121
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,860
This is your compensation.

122

Get lost.

123
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,740
All right, you guys choose the styles first.

124

She's not feeling well.

130

She insists on bearing it herself.

131

I had no choice but to call you here.

132
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,660
Don't blame her.

133
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,360
She didn't mean to hide this from you.

134
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,380
She just didn't know how to tell you.

135
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,620
I understand.

136
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,020
I don't blame her.

137
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,580
I only blame myself for not taking good care of her

138
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,300
and letting her be hurt again and again.

139
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,020
Keep her company.

140
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,300
Thank you for calling me.

Why are you here?

Jiang Ling called me.

145
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,380
She was anxious.

146
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,900
What happened?

147
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,140
You're right.

put interests above all else.

150
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,260
Once something gets in the way,

151
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,900
they can do anything.

152
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,380
My baby

153
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,630
was a black mark against Gu Yi.

154
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,260
It prevented the Gu family from being social climbers.

155
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,780
I should have gone.

156
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,740
If I had left Nancheng,

157
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,640
this wouldn't have happened.

158
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
It's not your fault.

159
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,230

I'm out of my mind?

The baby died. What are you doing?

165
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,260
I think you're out of your mind.

What I do...

167
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,860
What I do has nothing to do with you.

168
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,180
Isn't the baby's death exactly what your family wants?

169
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
It's what you two want, isn't it?

170
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,540
Watch your mouth!

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,630
♫And I'm just a guest♫

191
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,830
♫I put down all my memories♫

192
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,910
♫To fulfill your love♫

193
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,060
♫But I refuse to believe it's destiny♫

194
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,800
[Su Juan]

195
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,140
Did you cause the death of Qiao Jing's baby?

196
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

197
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,720
You committed a crime.

198
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,060
If you hadn't wanted me to do that,

199
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,660
you wouldn't have told me

200
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,820
what happened between them.

201
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,020
Don't contact me anymore.

202
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,740
I know you're sad.

203
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,820
I feel bad too.

204
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,940
It was your child.

205
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,660
I can't bear to lose it either.

206
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,260
But this baby

207
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,220
didn't come at the right time.

208
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,380
Mom.

209
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,580
It was my child.

210
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,420
I haven't seen it.

211
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,540
I haven't even seen it.

212
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,300
And it died.

213
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,180
I was going to propose to Qiao Jing.

214
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,220
I was going to try my best to be a good husband

215
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,810
and a good father.

216
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,300
But...

217
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,420
But...

218
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,740
But Mom,

219
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,950
no one gave me this chance.

220
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,440
It's destiny.

221
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,660
My heart hurts.

222
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,060
Aunt Fang.

223
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,860
I love Gu Yi so much.

224
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,180
I heard he was getting engaged to Qiao Jing.

225
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,460
My heart hurts, Aunt Fang.

226
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,780
Yun's intention

227
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,740
was to talk to Qiao Jing

228
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,580
and ask her to leave Mr. Gu.

229
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,140
But Qiao Jing didn't want to leave.

230
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,380
Then Yun quarreled with her

231
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,740
and accidentally pushed her over.

232
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,620
But we didn't know

233
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,940
she was pregnant.

234
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,180
Qiao Jing was pregnant?

235
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,340
You mean

236
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,180
the baby died?

237
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,550
-I'm sorry, Aunt Fang. -Sorry, Mrs. Gu.

238
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,550
Sorry.

239
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,820
We really didn't know she was pregnant.

240
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,340
Yun didn't mean it.

241
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,150
She loves Mr. Gu too much, so...

242
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm sorry, Aunt Fang. I'm sorry.

243
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,380
We owe the Gu family an apology.

244
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,940
We owe you an apology.

245
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,500
I'm sorry, Aunt Fang. I'm sorry.

246
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,260
All right. I see.

247
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,300
Go back and rest.

248
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,980
I'll deal with it.

249
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Blood. Blood.

250
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,700
Yun, what's wrong?

251
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,620
Blood. Blood. Blood.

252
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,480
Yun, there's no blood.

253
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Look.

254
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,260
It's just water. Look.

255
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,060
You can't scare yourself, Yun.

256
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,820
OK?

257
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,380
I shouldn't have done that, right?

258
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,860
Calm down.

259
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,300
Calm down, okay?

260
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,180
Are you going to watch helplessly

261
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
as Qiao Jing marry into the Gu family?

262
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,620
Be good.

263
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,980
Don't be afraid, okay?

264
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,860
Don't be afraid. Be good.

265
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,980
Don't be afraid.

266
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,180
How about I keep you company?

267
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,060
I can cook for you.

268
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,040
You are so busy with work.

269
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,620
Don't let me hold you up.

270
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,540
I'm free these days.

271
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,020
I can stay and take care of you.

272
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,060
I want to be alone.

273
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,820
All right. The doctor said I'm fine.

274
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,460
Don't worry too much.

275
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,380
Don't worry.

276
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,660
Yun.

277
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,580
The concert is coming.

278
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,660
How's your preparation?

279
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,580
Unfortunately, I'll be busy that day.

280
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,460
I can't attend.

281
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,460
It's okay. There will be many chances in the future.

282
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,460
I promise I won't be absent next time.

283
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,660
Go on with your practice. I'm leaving.

284
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,250
[Iron & Folic Acid]

285
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,100
You have no appetite these days. Have some juice.

286
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,060
How's the preparation for the Great Project?

287
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,140
Your dad is talking to you about the project.

288
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,140
Everything is ready.

289
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,380
You're in low spirits.

290
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,320
Look at you.

291
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,580
Enough.

292
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,980
Our family finally have time to eat together.

293
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,720
Don't scold him.

294
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,260
You like fish.

295
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,020
Eat more.

296
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,020
Dad. Aunt Fang.

297
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,220
Juan, sit down.

298
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,990
Our family are eating. Why did he come?

299
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,620
Because he's one of the family.

300
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,190
Go and give him a bowl and a pair of chopsticks.

301
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,620
Why are you here so late?

302
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,660
I was busy at work.

303
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,260
Brother, you don't look well these days.

304
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,720
Are you sick?

305
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,380
Dad. Mom. I'm full.

306
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,780
Take your time.

307
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,860
He's so rude.

308
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,580
Look. He's really bad-tempered.

309
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,600
He's in a bad mood recently.

310
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,280
What happened?

311
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,180
Let's eat.

312
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,420
Let's eat.

313
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,580
The soup I made

314
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,180
is good for women who miscarry.

315
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,420
You have to drink it while it's hot.

316
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,580
A miscarriage is a big deal.

317
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,980
Don't catch a cold these days.

318
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,180
What happened that day?

319
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,180
It was Bai Yun.

320
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,700
It was her? She was too bold.

321
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,420
She looks innocent.

322
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,630
How could she do such a thing?

323
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,700
You must show her in her true colours.

324
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,780
Don't worry. I'll help you.

325
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,500
How dare she play a concert without turning a hair?

326
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,660
She's so shameless.

327
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,920
Concert?

328
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,500
Yes. She's going to play a concert tomorrow.
