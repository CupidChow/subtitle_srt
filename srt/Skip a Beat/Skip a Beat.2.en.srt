00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,460
Dress formally

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,260
and attend a charity dinner with me tonight.

6
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,100
Okay.

7
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,370
What happened?

8
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,730
Nothing. It was scratched by accident.

9
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,500
I don't want to bring

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,580
a scratched-face female partner with me tonight.

11
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,220
Deal with it on your own.

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,539
Mr. Gu, you're finally here.

13
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,140
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

14
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,980
Ms. Qiao,

15
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,010
you're now getting prettier than before.

16
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,980
Hello, Mr. Gu.

17
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,420
Yi, why are you so late?

18
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,900
Zhou Rui and I

19
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,460
were right over there with some old classmates.

20
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,460
Let me take you there.

21
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,380
Sure.

22
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,020
Isn't Mr. Gu's partner Ms. Qiao?

23
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,900
How could Bai Yun take him away?

24
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,020
Who cares?

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,620
The Gu family and the Bai family are going to be united by marriage.

26
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,420
The future wife of the CEO

27
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,260
may be Bai Yun.

28
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,540
She's just back in the country.

29
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,380
How do you know so well?

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,860
You are too young to understand, aren't you?

31
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,620
A banquet like this

32
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,220
provides a great opportunity for information sharing.

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,100
Do you think we'll get two days off

34
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,780
if Mr. Gu gets married?

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,180
If Mr. Gu really marries Bai Yun,

36
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,620
what about Ms. Qiao?

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,260
Ms. Qiao herself is not worried at all.

38
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,700
Yet you're being so nosy.

39
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,300
Ms. Qiao, why do you keep showing up everywhere?

40
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,980
In public, I'm his secretary.

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,620
In private, I'm his girlfriend.

42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,500
Is there a problem

43
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,540
I accompanying him to a venue like this?

44
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,980
You keep saying you are his girlfriend.

45
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,620
Has he acknowledged you as his girlfriend yet?

46
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,060
To him,

47
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,780
you're just a handy tool.

48
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,660
Do you think he really cares about you?

49
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,820
We're now in a public place.

50
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,340
If you don't want to embarrass yourself,

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,460
you should leave immediately.

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,260
You know, I have a bad temper.

53
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,220
Fine. I wonder if you will say the same words

54
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,220
in front of Yi later.

55
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,540
What's wrong?

56
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,620
What happened?

57
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,620
She spilt the wine on her dress.

58
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,019
What's wrong?

59
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,860
I wanted to make you some hangover tea.

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,660
But Ms. Qiao said that

61
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,620
you would only drink the tea she made.

62
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,020
When I was trying to get a glass, she pushed me aside,

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,410
so I got the wine spilt on me.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,020
The pair of shoes is my favourite.

65
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,140
Qiao Jing,

66
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,140
when did you become so unreasonable?

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,860
I didn't.

68
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,540
Forget it.

69
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,980
I don't think Ms. Qiao did it on purpose.

70
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,860
How about this?

71
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,060
If Ms. Qiao wipes my shoes clean,

72
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,860
I won't pursue the matter further.

73
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,140
Does it sound good?

74
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,700
Wipe her shoes clean.

75
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,180
Calm yourself.

76
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,940
You can't make the shoes clean by wiping them.

77
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,300
If you really like the shoes,

78
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,100
why don't you send them to the laundry?

79
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,020
Maybe that would work.

80
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,740
Yan, our grandma gave them to me.

81
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
She got them dirty.

82
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,340
So I asked her to clean them for me.

83
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,500
What's wrong with that?

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,420
At a banquet, people inevitably bump into each other.

85
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,300
Why are you so aggressive?

86
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,740
Who are you?

87
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,940
Mr. Gu, I've heard a lot about you.

88
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,460
My name is Bai Yan.

89
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,620
I'm teaching my subordinate a lesson.

90
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,740
You'd better stay out of it.

91
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
She's my friend.

92
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,700
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

93
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,340
Whether you send these shoes to the laundry

94
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,340
or buy another pair,

95
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,460
I'll pay for the cost.

96
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,460
Let's go.

97
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,540
You were scalded. Let me apply some medicine for you.

98
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,140
It's okay. The tea was not that hot.

99
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,659
You may get a scar from the scald.

100
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,580
Thank you.

101
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,740
I didn't expect to see you here.

102
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,460
What a coincidence.

103
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,100
My name is Bai Yan.

104
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,140
I'm a part-time architect.

105
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,820
What about you?

106
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,260
I'm Qiao Jing.

107
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,050
I saw what happened exactly

108
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,340
just now.

109
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,420
Bai Yun likes Gu Yi.

110
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,260
That's why she treats you as an imaginary enemy.

111
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,060
You matched this outfit for me.

112
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,380
But I didn't expect

113
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,659
that brooch would be on Gu Yi.

114
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,420
What is... your relationship with him?

115
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,260
Mr. Bai,

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,860
thank you for helping me out today.

117
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,620
I've got to go now.

118
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,620
Everything was fine at the beginning.

119
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,020
But now,

120
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,740
I've become a joke.

121
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,020
No one dares to laugh at you.

122
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
What is your relationship with Bai Yan?

123
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,010
He is my second cousin

124
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,740
and is usually not in China.

125
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,860
He just came back recently.

126
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,740
My family and I are not very close to him.

127
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,500
Yi,

128
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,900
why did you bring Qiao Jing along with you?

129
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,059
Everyone said that you two had a special connection.

130
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,860
That's why she dared to treat me that way.

131
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,780
Are you two dating?

132
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,420
I'll buy you another pair of shoes.

133
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,260
You're home. You may go in now.

134
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,300
Okay, take care on your way home.

135
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,660
Okay.

136
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,340
Bye.

137
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,220
Let's go.

138
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,980
Mr. Gu.

139
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,460
Ms. Qiao,

140
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,220
do you want to be with me?

141
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,820
Don't reject me.

142
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,620
Have you taken care of the scald?

143
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,420
Since you knew I was injured,

144
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,940
why did you force me to wipe Bai Yun's shoes?

145
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,460
To me, it doesn't matter who was right or wrong.

146
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,420
What matters is

147
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,460
you couldn't make a scene

148
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,020
at that venue.

149
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,340
What do you mean by making a scene?

150
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,260
I didn't do anything wrong.

151
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,940
Why did you force me to apologize?

152
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,660
Qiao Jing, you should be reasonable.

153
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,620
Am I not reasonable enough?

154
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,580
I've been waiting.

155
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,570
Waiting for you to tell me that

156
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,980
you're going to marry Bai Yun.

157
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,740
Who told you that?

158
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,420
Don't listen to those rumours

159
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,740
that make you so paranoid.

160
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,100
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

161
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,060
What's the rush?

162
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,820
What's your relationship

163
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,620
with Bai Yun exactly?

164
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
She's just my sister.

165

[Anxia Group]

166
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,660
Good morning.

167
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,140
Good morning.

168
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,980
You're here.

169
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,900
Ms. Qiao has been under Mr. Gu for so many years.

170
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,380
She just got a pair of shoes dirty.

171
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,220
Yet he was so moralistic that he asked her

172
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,660
-to wipe Bai Yun's shoes.
-What's wrong?

173
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,660
I knew it.

174
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,580
Capitalists have no humanity at all.

175
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,740
What's wrong?

176
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,180
Based on my ten years of experience in web fiction,

177
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,420
Bai Yun must have spilt it

178
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,180
on purpose.

179
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,100
We don't know the truth. Let's not talk about it.

180
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,540
Who doesn't know the truth?

181
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
What I saw with my eyes is the truth.

00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,680
-Good morning, Ms. Qiao.
-Ms. Qiao is here.

183

Were you okay yesterday?

188
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,780
I'll definitely teach that conniving woman a lesson

189
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,740
-until she knows her place.
-Shh.

190
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,660
Why are you hushing me?

191
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,420
Bai Yun is indeed a...

192
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,940
Good morning, Mr. Gu.

193
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,220
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,330
From today onwards,

195
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,140
Ms. Bai will work at Anxia

196
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,860
as my special assistant.

197
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,260
Hello everyone, I'm Bai Yun.

198
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,050
Why is she here?

199
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,500
Do I need to report everything to you?

200
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,420
This is a workplace.

201
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,780
I know what I'm doing.

202
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,700
Bai Yun is under the company in name only.

203
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,260
She doesn't have to do anything else.

204
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,060
What I need to do is to make her happy.

205
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,580
You may leave now.

206
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,860
Yes.

207
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,820
Why didn't you give me a hint just now?

208
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,540
I did give you a hint, but you dissed me instead.

209
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,940
Ms. Bai, do you need help?

210
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,970
I'm new here,

211
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,900
and I'm so glad to be your colleague.

212
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,860
I have prepared some gifts for you.

213
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,010
This is for you.

214
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,900
Tang Ping, this is for you.

215
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,980
Thank you.

216
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,500
This is for you, Yang Yang.

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,300
Thank you.

218
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,100
This is for you.

219
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,060
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

220
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,020
This is for you two.

221
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,820
Thank you.

222
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,820
You're welcome.

223
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,500
Ms. Bai, the scarf is too pricey.

224
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,660
Do you really want to give it to me?

225
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,620
It suits you well. As long as you like it.

226
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,060
Ms. Qiao, this is for you.

227
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,420
I carefully picked it for you.

228
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
The Sèvres porcelain

229
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,540
was the favourite writing desk ornament

230
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,220
of Madame de Pompadour from France.

231
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,060
It matches you well.

232
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,940
I appreciate it, Ms. Bai.

233
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,700
I'm not Madame de Pompadour.

234
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,260
Also, I won't be Madame de Pompadour in the future.

235
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,060
This is just a small gift.

236
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,860
Ms. Qiao, don't read too much into it.

237
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,730
Who is Madame de Pom... dour?

238
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,140
She was a mistress of Louis XV, the King of France.

239
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,060
She was a famous mistress in medieval Europe.

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,980
Yun has not suffered much since she was young.

241
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,060
I asked her to be your assistant.

242
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,860
You can't bully her.

243
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,940
Do you hear me?

244
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,300
Mum, if you are worried about her suffering,

245
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,900
you shouldn't have asked her to join the company.

246
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,780
I did that

247
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,660
to strengthen the bonds between you two.

248
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,740
Now that Yun's back in the country,

249
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,650
it's time to bring up the subject of your marriage.

250
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,660
Why would you take the engagement we made

251
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,140
when we were very young seriously?

252
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,410
It was made when you were young, so what?

253
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,740
Although the Bai family started to engage in the arts

254
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,060
in the past two generations,

255
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
when they became wealthy back then,

256
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,780
your grandpa was still building walls for them.

257
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,380
They had a much higher social position than us

258
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,780
before the engagement was made.

259
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,060
If we don't deserve it, just forget it.

260
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,740
Don't be so grumpy.

261
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,500
I don't care who you're dating,

262
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,890
but your marriage

263
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,500
correlates with the Gu and Bai families.

264
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,860
Also, it correlates with Anxia.

265
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,260
You can't be so willful.

266
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,780
Here, try the coffee I made.

267
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,460
Yun,

268
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,340
you don't have to do such a trivial task.

269
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,620
Since it's about Yi, it's not a trivial task.

270
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,500
There's no Yi here.

271
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,300
Fine, Mr. Gu.

272
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,620
You call him Mr. Gu in the company.

273
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,460
But in private,

274
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,060
he's still your brother.

275
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,420
You always love me dearly.

276
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,460
Three, two, one.

277
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,660
Get off.

278
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,620
Let's go. Have a meal.

279
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,940
What are we eating today?

280
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,380
A new stir-fried spicy hot pot restaurant has started to operate downstairs.

281
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,220
Ms. Qiao, join us.

282
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,580
No, thanks. I need to review the contract.

283
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,460
You may go first.

284
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,380
It doesn't matter when to review it.

285
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,980
Review it later.

286
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm really not going. I can't even finish it.

287
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,380
Ms. Bai, are you coming?

288
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,100
Come on.

289
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,660
The stir-fried spicy hot pot is too greasy. I'm not used to it.

290
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,860
You guys can go ahead. Thank you.

291
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,420
If so, just four of us.

292
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,700
Ms. Qiao,

293
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,220
I rarely treat everyone to a meal. Please make me look good.

294
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,300
Exactly.

295
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,460
Fine, I'll join you.

296
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,020
Let's go.

297
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,580
Aren't you the perfect secretary?

298
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,740
Let's see if you can still be perfect now.

299
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,099
I can't treat you all to a meal every day.

300
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,099
It caused me heartache.

301
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,380
It was your idea.

302
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,300
Delicious.

303
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,060
I feel dizzy after getting my fill of food and drink.

304
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,260
I should recharge my batteries so that I can work hard later.

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,860
Now I'm going to take a nap.

306
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,980
It's already past lunchtime. Yet you're still lying down?

307
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,900
I've finished my work today.

308
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,300
You're indeed Mr. Tang.

309
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,660
Then, will you

310
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,460
help your best friend, Ms. Xiang,

311
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,940
finish the presentation slides in the latter part?

312
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,070
[Anxia Group]

313
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,700
Ms. Qiao, what are you looking for?

314
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
The contract is gone.

315
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,260
It was here just now.

316
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,540
Didn't you put it here?

317
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,900
Have you searched all the drawers?

318
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,220
Yes, I have.

319
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,060
I think it's dropped from her clothes.

320
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,140
During lunchtime,

321
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,860
did you take the contract in my drawer?

322
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,860
I just finished my lunch.

323
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,540
Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.

324
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,180
The contract is very important.

325
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,500
If it's that important,

326
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,180
you should keep it well

327
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,740
instead of questioning irrelevant people

328
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,380
after losing it.

329
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,740
It's a pressing issue, I have to check your desk.

330
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,420
How dare you!

331
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,340
Do you have any evidence?

332
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,220
Who are you to search my desk?

333
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,620
What are you arguing about during working hours?

334
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,780
Mr. Gu, Ms. Qiao lost something on her own,

335
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,340
but she insisted that I took it

336
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,100
and wanted to search my desk.

337
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,650
During the lunch break,

338
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,180
I put the contract in the drawer.

339
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,380
It was gone when I came back.

340
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,300
If you hadn't gone near my drawer,

341
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,780
how could the glitter on your shirt

342
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,340
have appeared next to my drawer?

343
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,380
It's just a piece of glitter.

344
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,860
It could fall anywhere.

345
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,940
Who knows where you found it?

346
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,100
Are you sure it was her?

347
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,780
Search then.

348
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,740
Yi.

349
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,780
Be good.

350
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,820
You can prove your innocence by allowing her to search.

351
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,340
Have you found it?

352
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,060
I told you I didn't take it.

353
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,540
You don't trust me either.

354
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,940
When did you become so careless?

355
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,140
Before you get off from work today,

356
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,020
you must hand the contract over to me.

357
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,140
What should we do now?

358
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,380
Check the CCTV.

359
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,020
I'll be the one

360
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,460
who retrieves the missing documents.

361
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,260
Judging from the CCTV footage,

362
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,340
at 12:14 p.m.,

363
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,820
Bai Yun took a folder into the washroom.

364
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,580
When she came out,

365
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
she got nothing in her hands.

366
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,380
The cleaner then went in to clean up the washroom.

367
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,060
Hold on.

368
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,820
If that's the case, we can show Mr. Gu the CCTV footage.

369
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,460
It must be Bai Yun's doings.

370
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,620
Why should we suffer here?

371
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,260
Mr. Gu only cares about the result,

372
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,340
not the process.

373
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,460
What he wants is to get the contract before he gets off from work.

374
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,420
It doesn't matter how the contract was lost.

375
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,500
This is where all the company's rubbish is.

376
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,340
Hurry up.

377
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,700
Regarding the contract, I was indeed wrong.

378
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,220
After we have the meeting at the branch office,

379
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,940
I'll treat you to a meal as a token of apology.

380
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,420
I'm not angry,

381
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,060
but I feel wronged.

382
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,020
You don't trust me either.

383
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,180
I promise it won't happen again.

384
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,060
Mr. Gu, I found the contract.

385
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,460
What's the smell on you guys?

386
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,060
Can the contract still be used?

387
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,380
You came too late.

388
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,300
I've contacted the other company

389
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,660
to draft the contract and send it over again.

390
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,800
Throw this away.

391
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,730
You're not newbies anymore.

392
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,460
Do I still need to emphasize the importance of the contract?

393
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,930
It was your dereliction of duty.

394
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,780
Mr. Gu.

395
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,620
It was my mistake.

396
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,740
Please punish me only if you want.

397
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,220
Instead of having bravado now,

398
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,260
you'd better not make mistakes in the first place.

399
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,380
Mr. Gu.

400
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,210
The branch manager is waiting for us for a meeting.

401
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,540
Let's depart quickly.

402
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,620
Ms. Qiao, are you okay?

403
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,740
I'm fine.

404
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,700
Thank you for your hard work.

405
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,020
Go back and get changed.

406
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,780
I'll treat you to afternoon tea next week.

407
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,660
Yi,

408
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,740
have you ever thought about getting another secretary?

409
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,820
Why do so?

410
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,140
Ms. Qiao does not stand out in her work.

411
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,700
She even made such a big mistake this time.

412
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,700
Why don't you take the opportunity to replace her?

413
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,340
Also, those in the CEO's Office.

414
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,580
Tang Ping, is really a slacker.

415
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,220
Xiang Sese only focuses on gossiping.

416
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,500
And Yang Yang

417
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,540
always tags along with Qiao Jing.

418
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
I wonder how they

419
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,700
got into Anxia.

420
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,260
Every one of them

421
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,940
was chosen by me personally.

422
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,900
Tang Ping is of high work efficiency.

423
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,780
Whether they are spreadsheets or presentation slides,

424
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,980
his speed and quality

425
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,420
are three times faster and better than normal people.

426
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,780
He only needs an hour to finish the job

427
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,140
that others would take a day.

428
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,140
Xiang Sese

429
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,300
is good at public relations and monopolizing information.

430
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,220
She managed to handle PR crises

431
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,500
for the company a few times before.

432
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,980
Moreover, Yang Yang

433
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,820
graduated from an Ivy League school.

434
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,780
He's smart and meticulous.

435
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,140
Also, he is good at summarizing and coordinating.

436
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,900
He was a rare and all-round talent,

437
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,780
trained personally by Qiao Jing.

438
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,260
Anxia doesn't employ rubbish.

439
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,140
They couldn't get in without any exceptional skills.

440
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,540
I see.

441
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,980
I'm a workplace newcomer, so I lack experience.

442
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,900
I don't understand much as you do.

443
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,980
Okay, I'll cut it out.

444
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,660
Here, try mine.

445
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,180
It smells so good.

446
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,380
Milk.

447
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,300
Why aren't you eating?

448
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,460
Yi seems indifferent towards her,

449
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,340
but he is actually protecting her.

450
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Qiao Jing

451
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,980
kept saying she was his girlfriend.

452
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,740
But every time I asked Yi,

453
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,380
he never gave me a direct answer.

454
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,620
Since he didn't deny it,

455
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,180
it means he admitted it.

456
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,420
Are you kidding me?

457
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,860
We're getting engaged.

458
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
Yet he still has a girlfriend?

459
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,020
Whether it's true or not,

460
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,700
I will break up them.

461
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,100
Calm down.

462
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,620
You haven't got engaged with Mr. Gu yet.

463
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,540
Besides, you are a girl.

464
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,220
Don't get yourself involved in everything.

465
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,500
It may cause negative impacts.

466
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,860
What should we do then?

467
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,260
As it's the Gu family's matter,

468
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,980
of course, the Gu family should solve it.

469
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,140
Okay, I'll go to Aunt Fang now.

470
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,650
Sit down.

471
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,940
Drink the milk up.

472
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,740
I just told you

473
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,540
not to get yourself involved in everything.

474
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,380
How about I go and find Mrs. Gu for you?

475
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,620
But you have to practise the piano well.

476
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,220
Don't slack off in the concert in two months.

477
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,930
Fine, I'll listen to my dear agent.

478
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,220
Qiao,

479
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,460
I've been so busy lately

480
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,340
that I almost forgot what you look like.

481
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,420
Will you blame me?

482
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,460
Of course not.

483
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,100
You are such a busy live streamer.

484
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,340
I'm honoured enough

485
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,820
that you found time to meet me.

486
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,420
Do you want some?

487
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,220
No.

488
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,460
It's so hot. Why do you drink tea?

489
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,060
My period is coming. I can't drink an iced one.

490
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,490
Oh yeah.

491
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,580
You're in great pain every time during your period.

492
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,900
You should be more careful usually.

493
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,500
I heard that Mr. Gu

494
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,780
was engaged to the daughter of the Bai family.

495
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,660
Is that true?

496
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,180
It's rumoured everywhere now.

497
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
I don't know.

498
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,100
What if it's true?

499
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Oh dear, look at you.

500
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,220
You've been with Gu Yi for three years.

501
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,740
Now he's getting engaged to someone else.

502
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,620
How would he compensate you

503
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,900
for your three years of youth?

504
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
You know,

505
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,500
I wasn't with him

506
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,500
for that purpose.

507
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,540
I know. Of course, I know.

508
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,620
I regret it because I know.

509
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,460
I shouldn't have let you do stupid things.

510
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,780
But if everything started over,

511
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,260
I would still jump into the fire pit.

512
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,940
It's been a long time.

513
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,060
It's time to get over it.

514
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,260
This may be the best opportunity.

515
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,780
Mr. Gu, you're now not only successful in love but also in your career.

516
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Aunt Fang said

517
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,540
you were getting engaged with Yun.

518
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,180
Our families do have the intention.

519
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,470
But the date is not set yet.

520
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,420
Aren't you in a relationship with Qiao Jing?

521
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
Why are you getting married?

522
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,100
Are you going to break up with Qiao Jing?

523
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,220
I don't want to let her go yet.

524
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,540
What do you mean? You are no more getting engaged?

525
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,780
Whether marry or not is not up to me.

526
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,700
The Gu and Bai families

527
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,380
need to be tied tightly together.

528
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,060
Bai Yun and I are just their tools.

529
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,860
I don't care.

530
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,060
Yun's half my sister.

531
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,780
Don't make her upset.

532
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,540
I know you won't listen to me.

533
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,140
But remember, don't get in too deep. It's not worth it.

534
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,500
All right, take your leave.

535
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,380
You'll be late for your next live stream

536
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,580
if you don't leave now.

537
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,340
It's already so late.

538
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,740
I'm leaving first. See you next time.

539
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,980
Mrs. Gu.

540
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,020
I want to meet with you.

541
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,620
Please.

542
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,020
Ms. Qiao, Mrs. Gu is waiting for you inside.

543
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,890
Mrs. Gu, you wanted to see me?

544
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,860
Please have a seat.

545
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,780
I've always wanted to thank you.

546
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,900
Gu Yi had a car accident before

547
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,580
and was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder.

548
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,180
Thanks to you, taking good care of him,

549
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,140
he recovered quickly.

550
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,940
Here's a toast to you.

551
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,220
Ms. Qiao,

552
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,420
I am toasting you to express my gratitude.

553
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,540
Since you're a straightforward person,

554
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,780
I won't beat around the bush then.

555
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,740
Gu Yi is getting engaged soon.

556
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,100
I hope you can end your relationship

557
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,540
as soon as possible.

558
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,460
This is between Gu Yi and me.

559
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,740
You don't have to worry about it.

560
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,820
Gu Yi is different from you.

561
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,380
If he wants to inherit Anxia,

562
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,540
he will need a good wife like Bai Yun.

563
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,380
If you think it's a loss,

564
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,180
name your price, I will make it up to you.

565
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,740
I'm not with him for money.

566
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,540
What? You don't want to let him go?

567
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,780
What's the point

568
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,220
of holding it up?

569
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,140
He will break up with you sooner or later.

570
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,380
If you take the initiative now,

571
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,540
you can make yourself look better.

572
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,940
If Mr. Gu wants to break up with me,

573
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,340
ask him to talk to me in person.

574
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,500
I have something else to do. Enjoy your meal, Mrs. Gu.

575
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,380
Qiao Jing.

576
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,940
If you agree to leave,

577
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,140
I can fulfil one of your wishes.

578
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,500
Ms. Qiao is quite a personality.

579
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,580
Tell Yun not to worry.

580
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,340
I'll take care of it.

581
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,580
Sorry, Mrs. Gu.

582
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,220
I shouldn't have come.

583
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,020
But these two days,

584
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,420
Yun has been ill at ease

585
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,860
because of this.

586
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,140
I had no choice.

587
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,060
It's okay. No worries.

588
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,440
[Gu Yi]

589
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,190
[Gu Yi]

590
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,740
[Hello, the number you've dialled is unavailable.]

591
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,720
[Please try again later.]
