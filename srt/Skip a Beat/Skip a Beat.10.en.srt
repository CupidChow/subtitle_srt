4
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,980
Is it Gu Yi?

5
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,180
Don't mind him.

6
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,140
For me, you've been hurt by him

7
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,740
over the past three years.

8
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,380
I promise

9
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,060
I won't let you be wronged ever again.

10
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,380
It's all in the past.

11
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,020
Brother.

12
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,820
Brother.

13
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,660
Sister-in-law.

14
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,580
Isn't this Mr. Gu?

15
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,380
Long time no see.

16
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,979
Well, I've been seeing you a lot on titbits these days.

17
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,180
The media always likes to make up stories.

18
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,740
You may want to spend more time thinking about your husband

19
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,380
instead of worrying about this.

20
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,060
He's still unemployed, right?

21
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,380
He's already old.

22
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,260
He should have a rest.

23
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,980
Thanks to Yi, who gave him a break.

24
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,340
It's not a break.

25
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,420
Mr. Gu, how selfless you are.

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,980
You can spend a whole lot of money on a beauty

27
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,579
while sweeping your family out.

28
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,140
Son.

29
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,579
She's your aunt, your elder.

30
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,860
You're in charge of the company.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,579
You have the final say.

32
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,420
It's not easy for your aunt and uncle.

33
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,940
Your uncle is still unemployed.

34
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,700
The whole family is counting on you.

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,460
Be more considerate of them.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,060
OK, Mom. I see.

37
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,340
Sister-in-law.

38
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,220
Brother has been recuperating in Xilin Mountain, right?

39
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,740
Did he suddenly come back

40
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,900
because he's feeling better?

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,180
Still the same.

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,180
He's aged.

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,020
The treatment can't be too invasive.

44
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,380
He can only receive conservative treatment.

45
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,780
The burden of the company

46
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,780
will be handed over to Yi.

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,780
Not necessarily.

48
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,660
Not necessarily?

49
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,579
What do you mean?

50
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,500
Are you going to take charge of this company or what?

51
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,740
I'm not that capable.

52
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,860
But someone is.

53
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,140
It's time. Let's eat.

54
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,020
Son, go get your dad.

55
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
I just took a look around.

56
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,180
That's why I'm late.

57
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,340
Who is this?

58
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,780
This is

59
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,060
the son I had with Su Nian.

60
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,620
He used to live outside.

61
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,420
Now he's finally home.

62
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,180
You two just reunited.

63
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,540
There must be a lot you want to talk about.

64
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,770
It's understandable that you two spent some time talking.

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Uncle.

66
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,020
Aunt. Uncle.

67
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,380
Mrs. Fang.

68
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,300
My name is Su Juan.

69
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,580
Juan, take a seat.

70
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,660
If everyone comes to recognize their kinships with our family,

71
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,860
I don't think there'll be enough seats for everyone.

72
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,180
Sister-in-law, you are wrong about this.

73
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,980
Brother and Juan took a paternity test long ago.

74
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,860
He's indeed a member of the Gu family.

75
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,140
His surname is Su, not Gu.

76
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,060
How can he count as a member of the Gu family?

77
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,380
No matter what his surname is,

78
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,180
he has the Gu family's blood.

79
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,980
Exactly.

80
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,490
I won't recognize

81
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,820
some bastard of dubious origin.

82
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,300
It doesn't matter if you recognize him or not.

83
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,140
Dad.

84
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,660
Don't be angry.

85
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,060
I didn't think this through.

86
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,780
I'll change my surname back.

87
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,460
No need.

88
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,380
Just take your mom's surname. No need to change.

89
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,220
Speaking of which, Juan is one year older than Gu Yi.

90
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,740
Make a toast to your elder brother.

91
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,260
Brothers don't have to stand on ceremony.

92
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,820
Here's to you, my younger brother.

93
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,620
I don't have an elder brother.

94
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,220
I won't have this meal.

95
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,290
Gu Yi.

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,970
Stop!

97
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,780
Brother, look at him.

98
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,100
It's annoying enough that he's like this in the company.

99
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,420
Now he's like this even at home.

100
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,530
Outrageous.

101
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,060
He doesn't respect you at all.

102
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,780
Exactly.

103
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,340
Aunt. Uncle.

104
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,300
This is not his fault.

105
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,500
If I suddenly have an elder brother,

106
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,580
I won't be able to get used to it either.

107
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Juan.

108
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,180
You are too considerate.

109
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,580
Especially in the company,

110
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,380
don't be a pushover.

111
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,820
What did you say?

112
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,260
He's joining Anxia?

113
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,700
Yes.

114
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,740
From tomorrow onwards,

115
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,020
Juan will join the company

116
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,580
and be the manager of Project Development Department.

117
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,180
Gu Yi can't manage the company by himself.

118
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,820
I want Juan to help him.

119
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,780
I can't have this dinner either.

120
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,860
Dad.

121
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,780
I'm inexperienced.

122
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,820
I may not be able to take such a high position.

123
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,780
Besides,

124
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,580
I didn't come back to join the company.

125
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,780
I just want to spend more time with you.

126
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
Don't be too modest.

127
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,980
I know your ability.

128
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,340
Exactly. Do your best.

129
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,540
Aunt and uncle will help you.

130
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,620
We'll definitely help you.

131
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,460
Forget about them. Let's eat.

132
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,179
OK.

133
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:40,980
-Come on. -Okay.

134
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,380
Good timing. Take your things away.

135
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,580
What are you doing?

136
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,260
I'm putting it back.

137
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,700
Give it to me.

138
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,300
Give it to me.

139
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,940

Qiao Jing, don't kick me out. I'm not leaving.

146

Don't touch me.

147

Get out!

151
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,180
Where did you go?

152
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,860
Why are you like this?

153
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,300
Do you know

154
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,380
your dad wants Su Juan to join the company?

155
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,980
Isn't this why

156
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,460
he made such a high-profile comeback?

157
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,420
But Anxia won't keep incapable people.

158
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,220
He can get in the company, but he may not be able to stay.

159
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,060
Son, you can't underestimate him.

160
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,220
Su Juan is not simple.

161
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,180
Even an old fox like your dad

162
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,620
was fooled by him.

163
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,620
Listen to me.

164
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,180
Mom.

165
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,020
I want to be alone.

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,860
What do you want, Gu Yi?

167
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,420
Why are you here?

168
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,180
I miss you. I came to see you.

169
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,380
Did you drink?

170
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,900
Come in.

171
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,380
Why did you drink so much?

172
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,060
I was on a dinner party tonight.

173
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
I went to the Gu family to recognize our kinship today.

174
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,940
I was happy, so I drank quite a lot.

175
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,340
Are you really happy?

176
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,980
It doesn't matter if I'm happy or not.

177
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,500
What matters is whether the Gu family is happy or not.

178
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,500
If you're unhappy,

179
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,580
why don't you stay away from them?

180
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,180
I have the blood of the Gu family.

181
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,980
I have no choice.

182
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,180
Besides, for the sake of my mom,

183
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,220
I can't back off.

Notify all the high-level and middle-level employees of the company

190
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,980
to attend Mr. Su's induction ceremony

191
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,020
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

192
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,260
Mr. Su? Who's that?

193
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,580
The new Project Development Department manager appointed by Chairman Gu.

194
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,580
I heard that Mr. Su

195
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,740
is Chairman Gu's illegitimate son.

196
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,580
He just returned to the family recentely.

197
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,580
How dare he show off like this?

198
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,900
He's trying to seize Mr. Gu's power, right?

199
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,380
The company was solely developed by Mr. Gu.

200
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,140
An outsider wants to take away Mr. Gu's power?

201
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,820
That's right.

202
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,780
We need to resist the outsider

203
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,380
and protect the best Mr. Gu in the world.

204
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,170
Don't worry, Juan.

205
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,700
This is your first time in the company.

206
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,060
We have to hold a grand ceremony.

207
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,860
I've arranged it for you.

208
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,180
All the higher-up employees of the company must come.

209
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,540
Actually, there's no need to make a fuss over this.

210
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,460
No, we have to.

211
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,220
You are the Crown Prince of Anxia.

212
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,860
You can't let you lose face.

213
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,900
Where are they?

214
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,780
Where's the decoration I ordered?

215
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,940
This is outrageous!

216
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,780
Do they respect us at all?

217
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,860
Aunt, it's fine.

218
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,340
Maybe everyone is busy with work.

219
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,580
It's understandable that they don't have time.

220
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,220
One or two of them may not have time.

221
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,610
Is it possible that everyone's busy?

222
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,460
Didn't I inform you

223
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,580
to attend Mr. Su's induction ceremony at nine?

224
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,980
Where is everyone?

225
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,700
Mr. Gu called all the executives for a meeting on short notice.

226
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,340
Everyone is in the meeting room now.

227
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,420
I knew it. Let's go.

228
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,780
Aunt.

229
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,020
Ms. Jian.

230
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,020
Your design is pleasing to the eye but of no use.

231
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,420
That's why the buildings were unsalable.

232
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,220
The design was approved during evaluation.

233
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,500
And now there's a problem?

234
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,020
There's no problem with the evaluation.

235
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,580
It's your design that made the buildings unsalable.

236
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,340
Enough.

237
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,940
What I want is a solution.

238
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,780
Not a battle of right or wrong.

239
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,380
Do you have a solution?

240
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,930
Mr. Gu.

241
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,540
What do you mean

242
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,860
calling everyone away

243
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,860
and stopping them from attending Mr. Su's induction ceremony?

244
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,980
Yang. Send irrelevant people away.

245
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,060
Irrelevant?

246
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,140
This is the Project Development Department manager

247
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,820
appointed by Chairman Gu himself.

248
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,140
He's "irrelevant" to you?

249
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,220
He's appointed by Chairman Gu, so what?

250
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,980
What Anxia cares about is ability,

251
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,140
not some messy nepotism.

252
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,740
Aunt.

253
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,819
Mr. Gu is right.

254
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,180
Ability is what matters in the company.

255
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,380
Everyone here is my senior.

256
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,579
I look forward to working with you.

257
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,500
I saw you were discussing

258
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,060
the issue of the buildings being unsalable in the new district.

259
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,180
I have some humble opinions.

260
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,300
I'm not sure if they can be of help to you.

261
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,260
Chairman Gu showed me

262
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,380
some documents of the buildings in the new district.

263
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
There are indeed some problems

264
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,820
in design.

265
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,980
But since they're already built,

266
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,180
it can't be adjusted for now.

267
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,660
But if we sell them at a discount,

268
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,660
it's not only not cost-effective,

269
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,260
but it'll also affect the reputation of Anxia.

270
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,300
So I think

271
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,090
if we can want to maximize the profit,

272
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,620
we can try to transform these buildings

273
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,220
into brand apartments that can only be rented but can't be bought.

274
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,220
Mr. Su.

275
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,020
You don't know the market at all.

276
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,150
The profit of renting a place is nothing like the profit of selling it.

277
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,980
That's true for the short term.

278
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,660
But these buildings

279
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,420
are located in the new development zone of Changming.

280
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,530
The local government is providing lots of support

281
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,980
and reforming the rental policy.

282
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,340
But since the short-term return is low,

283
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,660
not many real estate companies have responded.

284
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,860
If Anxia can set an example at this point,

285
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,060
not only can we get the first round of bonus out of the policy,

286
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,780
but it can also boost the reputation of Anxia.

287
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
Showing that we respond to the policy call and benefit the people.

288
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,380
This way, Anxia can open the market in Changming faster.

289
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,820
Exchanging short-term losses for long-term profits.

290
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,060
Why not?

291
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,380
Mr. Gu.

292
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,980
It seems that this plan is really feasible.

293
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,580
Mr. Su is not bad.

294
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,980
In that case,

295
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,460
I'll leave this project to you.

296
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,540
I want to see the project execution plan

297
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,260
in three days.

298
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,460
You suddenly have an elder brother.

299
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,570
How do you feel?

300
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,180
Do you want it?

301
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,460
No, I can't handle it.

302
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,180
Su Juan is quite capable.

303
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,780
He showed his capabilities on his first day in the company.

304
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,540
He is indeed not a blockhead.

305
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,780
So you've accepted him?

306
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I thought you wished you could tear him apart.

307
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,900
For the company,

308
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,140
he is a capable employee.

309
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,780
He can bring profit to the company.

310
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,500
I have no reason not to accept him.

311
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,300
What about you, personally?

312
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,780
Let's not talk about this.

313
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,220
I'm here to drink with you.

314
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,580
We're having a good time, okay?

315
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,180
Bottoms up.

316
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,780
She threw away everything I bought for her.

317
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,300
She even threw me away.

318
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,220
Let me tell you.

319
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,020
She's so cruel.

320
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,620
I won't go back

321
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,540
even if I die.

322
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,980
You have guts.

323
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,180
Cheers.

324
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,180
Why are you here?

325
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,260
Why can't I be here?

326
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,740
It's between me and her.

327
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,340
It's none of your business.

328
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,130
Mr. Gu.

329
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,140
Don't take yourself too seriously.

330
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,210
I believe you know

331
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,220
you are my substitute.

332
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,180
If it weren't for me,

333
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,860
Qiao Jing wouldn't have paid attention to you at all.

334
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,020
That was in the past.

335
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,620
Now, she has feelings for me.

336
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,980
Why do you think so?

337
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,580
Just because you broke off an engagement for her?

338
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,570
Have you forgotten

339
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,860
how you treated her for the past three years?

340
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,940
Do you think she'll forgive you

341
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,970
just for some sweet words and

342
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,100
some trivial gestures?

343
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,860
I'm telling you.

344
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,900
It's impossible.

345
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,580
You and your mother ruined my family.

346
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,180
You made Qiao Jing and I be separated for four years.

347
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,220
Now the authentic one is back.

348
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,250
It's time for you to leave.

349
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,220
Brother.

350
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,020
Su Juan.

351
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,140
Are you okay?

352
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,780
You are so protective of him.

353
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
What are you doing here?

354
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,380
Now that he's back,

355
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,580
you don't want to see me anymore, right?

356
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,500
Qiao Jing, don't forget

357
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,300
how you cried and begged me

358
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,980
for my attention in the past three years.

359
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
Now that he's back,

360
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,140
you're happy

361
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,580
and you want to kick me out, right?

362
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,140
Qiao Jing, I'm telling you. It's impossible.

363
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,700
Didn't you promise

364
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,140
to be with me forever?

365
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,740
No one can change that.

366
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,660
You forced us to become

367
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,380
what we are now.

368
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,140
A person who deceived me and used me

369
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,820
doesn't have the right to negotiate with me.

370
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,540
Qiao Jing.

371
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,940
Stop pestering her.

372
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,420
Let go.

373
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
Let go!

374
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,260
Come in.

375
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,540
Mr. Gu, this document needs your signature.

376
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,080
Anything else?

377
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,760
Mr. Gu, this...

378
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,900
[Qiao Jing]

379
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,470
Print me a new copy.

380
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,440
Okay.

381
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,480
Jin Lin.

382
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,710
Thank you for throwing a welcome party for me.

383
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,220
This is what we should do.

384
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,840
[Anxia Group]

385
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,440
Mr. Gu.

386
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,800
We want to throw a welcome party for Mr. Su.

387
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,440
Please join us

388
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,450
if you have time.

389
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,790
I don't.

390
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,970
Those who can have dinner with Mr. Gu are all celebrities in the industry.

391
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,860
It's uncomfortable for them to be with us.

392
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,660
Don't make it hard for him.

393
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,270
Who said I'd be uncomfortable?

394
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,260
Everyone from the President's Office must be there.

395
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,570
No matter how tiring work is,

396
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,200
as long as I can have hotpot,

397
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,880
I can come back to life.

398
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,070
It's not easy to line up for this restaurant.

399
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,660
Have some more.

400
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,010
We don't know when we can eat this again.

401
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,610
Pour me a drink.

402
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,600
Which one do you want?

403
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,010
Excuse me.

404
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,730
Our restaurant recently launched

405
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,240
a spicy food challenge.

406
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,790
Eat the chilis in ten minutes.

407
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,730
The higher the spiciness, the higher the reward.

408
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,240
If you can complete the challenge,

409
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720
you'll get a three-month free pass of our restaurant.

410
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,900
Would you like to accept the challenge?

411
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,500
Free hotpot for three months?

412
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,510
It's no longer a dream to have hotpot for every meal.

413
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,780
Why don't we accept the challenge?

414
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,670
Mr. Su, what do you think?

415
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,200
You guys do it.

416
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,710
I have a light taste.

417
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,550
I can't eat spicy food.

418
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,860
I'll do it.

419
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,880
It's not about the taste.

420
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,180
Someone is just scared.

421
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,190
The spiciness of the chilis in front of you

422
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,580
progressively increases from left to right.

423
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,800
To be safe,

424
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,570
please start the challenge

425
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,490
with the chili of the lowest spiciness.

426
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,920
Ready?

427
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,300
Three, two, one. Go.

428
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,730
Why is it so hot?

429
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,290
I didn't notice.

430
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,080

444
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,370
Yes.

Come on, Mr. Gu.

456
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,420
You can do it.

457
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,910
Have some water.

458
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,220
Yes, take a water break.

459
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,680
Right.

Send the female colleagues home first.

Are you feeling upset in your stomach?

It's okay. I ate something too spicy.
