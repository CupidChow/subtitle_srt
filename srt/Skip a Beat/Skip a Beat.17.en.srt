Here, Gu, have some water.

Qiang.

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,180
I think this matter

7
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,700
isn't entirely Gu's fault.

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,500
Supervisor Zhang is obviously shirking the responsibility,

9
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,180
right?

10
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,620
What happened that night?

11
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,380
After you left that night,

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,060
when we were done sorting out the waste,

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,380
Quan told us to go back to sleep,

14
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,580
and that he'd finish everything up.

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,060
But I didn't expect...

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,820
Is there a CCTV there?

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,780
Yes, just one CCTV.

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,570
But the angle was very tricky.

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,420
I could only see the car pressing on the rock,

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,740
and then the car fell backward.

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,380
Which car was it?

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,900
And who was the driver?

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,259
Zheng Yaojun. Mr. Zheng.

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,380
Are you here to visit him instead of Mr. Gu?

Okay, Mr. Su.

Did you do this too?

29
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,579
In your eyes,

30
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,579
have I become such an unscrupulous person?

It's the Gu family that wronged my mother.

They are the sinners.

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,540
I know I don't have the right to persuade you to be magnanimous,

38
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,500
but I really can't understand you.

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,980
Mr. Zheng needs to be investigated too,

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,020
so we can't drive this car for now.

Are you asking for a beating?

53

Qiang, calm down. Let’s go back first.

54
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,930
I suspect that the cars sent by the waste collection company

55
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,140
have constantly been overloaded.

56
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,860
There are problems with Zheng Yaojun’s car carriage and tires.

57
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,620
The tires were just changed half a month ago.

58
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,540
They can't already be so damaged and deformed already.

59
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,020
We worked so hard

60
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,420
to separate the construction waste.

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,019
But they were all mixed up again.

62
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,620
They wanted to transport more waste,

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,899
so they mixed everything together.

64
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,100
Then, didn't we do all that work for nothing?

65
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,860
There are rocks on the road,

66
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,700
so I guessed it might have something to do with overloading the cars.

67
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,500
The top of the car carriage

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,860
should be sealed.

69
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,420
But in order to transport more,

70
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,380
they didn't seal it well,

71
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,860
causing the cover to loosen.

72
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,460
That's why the rocks fell off.

73
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,900
Overloading the cars is an extremely serious matter.

74
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,020
But this is currently just our guess.

75
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,780
We need a professional to confirm it.

76
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,340
Then we can report it to the leader directly

77
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,770

But I didn't want to offend Supervisor Zhang,

After that, when I had an accident,

166
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,260
it was my karma.

167

On the night of the accident,

a brick fell down the first car

172

and hit the car behind.

173
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,940
The second car was also too heavy,

174
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,460
so it flipped over.

188
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,540
You embarrassed me.

189
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,580
I was fooled by the contractor too.

190
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,140
Juan.

191
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,180
He's useless trash.

192
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,820
I shouldn't have let you give him a chance last time.

193
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,180
But he is your uncle after all.

194
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,180
He was fooled because he wasn't careful this time.

195
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,540
Yes, I was fooled by the contractor.

196
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,180
Aunt.

197
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,020
I want to take this lightly.

198
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,660
But Gu Yi came with the workers this time.

199
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,650
Everyone in the company saw it clearly.

200
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,780
If I don't handle it impartially,

201
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,820
I can't appease the public.

202
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,620
Why are you watering the flowers at noon?

203
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
People water flowers either in the morning or at night.

204
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,180
But you're watering them at noon?

205
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,580
I like to water them at noon.

206
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,580
I'm not only watering the flowers,

207
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,460
but also you!

208
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,500
Gu Yi.

209
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,420
Gu Yi.

210
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,540
How dare you water me.

211
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,820
Stop.

212
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,820
Stop.

213
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,580
Mom.

214
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,340
What are you two doing?

215
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,100
Mom, try the dishes Qiao Jing and I made.

216
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,140
This is the first time you've peeled prawns for me.

217
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,180
He cooked all these dishes.

218
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,580
You have never entered the kitchen before.

219
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,420
How did you become...

220
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,700
I don't even recognize you now.

221
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,380
Mom.

222
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,660
People

223
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,060
are always getting better.

224
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,580
Besides,

225
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,180
I've met someone who I want to change for the better for.

226
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,180
Let’s eat.

227
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,980
Su Juan has dismissed Zhang Chen for investigation.

228
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,940
Your aunt's fuming.

229
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,180
He deserves it.

230
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,220
What about you?

231
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,180
What are your plans in the future?

232
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,620
Are you going to keep picking up garbage at the construction site?

233
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,180
Mom.

234
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,140
I want to leave Anxia.

235
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,980
Leave?

236
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,770
Where will you go?

237
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,180
I want to start a business with Qiao Jing,

238
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,420
to research and develop the corresponding equipment for construction waste treatment.

239
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,620
This area is still a blue ocean.

240
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,500
There's a big market to be expanded.

241
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,540
Okay.

242
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,090
If you have such ambition,

243
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,820
I will definitely support you.

244
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,340
My son can make his mark

245
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,420
without depending on the Gu family.

246
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,580
Thank you, mom.

247
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,700
Madam, something happened to Chairman Gu.

248
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,100
He just used a new targeted drug

249
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,900
that can effectively prevent cancer cells from spreading.

250
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,820
How was it?

251
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,940
This illness has been with me for so many years.

252
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,820
There's no need to make a fuss.

253
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,100
Chairman Gu's cancer cells are spreading again.

254
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,780
We just tried a new targeted drug.

255
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,940
It has been quite effective.

256
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,940
Who are you?

257
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,460
Aunt Fang.

258
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,100
This is the new expert I hired.

259
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,500
We will make a new treatment plan

260
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,940
based on dad's condition.

261
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,980
Thank you for your hard work, Dr. Han.

262
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,380
The expert you hired?

263
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,380
I think

264
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,140
we should use just a familiar doctor.

265
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,780
If my past doctor was good,

266
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,380
I'd already been cured.

267
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,780
It's for the better to switch doctors.

268
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,260
Aren't you going in to check on him?

269
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,170
No.

270
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,820
He will only be more unhappy

271
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,660
when he sees me anyway.

272
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,820
Chairman Gu is just like you.

273
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,580
You both never mean what you say.

274
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Deep down, I'm sure he wants to see you again.

275
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,420
Go in.

276
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,110
Dad, have some water.

277
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,980
The matter with Zhang Chen is settled.

278
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,580
He colluded with the contractor and took kickbacks.

279
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,700
I've dismissed him.

280
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,050
He's such a loser,

281
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,660
but he sure is bold.

282
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,020
I don't know what your aunt likes about him.

283
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,260
I trusted him too much.

284
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
I'm also responsible

285
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,380
for implicating my younger brother.

286
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,819
I wanted him to come back to the company,

287
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,180
but he said he didn't want to.

288
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,700
What is he doing then?

289
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,569
He said he wants to start a business.

290
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,180
He's overestimating himself. It's not easy to start a business.

291
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,700
Don't bother about him. Let him do as he pleases.

292
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,940
Let's see what he can accomplish.

293
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
Juan, push me back.

294
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,220
Okay, Dad.

295
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,620
Turn left at the intersection ahead.

296
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,860
Hello.

297
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,170
Hello, who are you looking for?

298
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,420
Does Qiao Jing live here?

299
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,780
Yes, she does.

300
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,780
Great.

301
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,620
Excuse me. Thank you.

302
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,900
Excuse me, who are you?

303
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm Gu Yi's mother, Fang Pei.

304
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,820
Gu Yi's mother.

305
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,620
Why are you

306
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,180
at my daughter's house?

307
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
Didn't you say you were just colleagues?

308
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,380
When did you get into a relationship?

309
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,260
It's fine if he's ordinary.

310
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,180
I heard he's the son of the boss of Anxia.

311
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,300
His family is so problematic.

312
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,300
Everyone has heard about the news.

313
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,180
Surely our family is not good enough for them.

314
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,300
I don't mind your family's humble background.

315
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,140
Instead, you're putting on airs.

316
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,740
A humble family like ours

317
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,980
would never suddenly have an illegitimate child.

318
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,660
I heard that Gu Yi had a fiancée.

319
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,220
I don't know which woman he broke off the engagement for.

320
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,860
It turned into such a mess.

321
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,980
Mom, that woman is me.

322
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,940
Yes.

323
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,660
I don't know

324
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,580
which family's daughter

325
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,220
had him bewitched.

326
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,980
Mom, let's talk nicely.

327
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,380
What is there to talk about?

328
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,180
I can tell you now.

329
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,940
I'll never agree to this relationship.

330
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,660
Mom.

331
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,980
Don't be fooled by them.

332
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,100
Right now, they're saying a bunch of nice things

333
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,180
to coax you and cling onto you,

334
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,700
but they actually have ill intentions.

335
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,660
My son isn't clingy.

336
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,820
It's your daughter who was so persistent.

337
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,180
Mom, I chased Qiao Jing first.

338
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,820
You...

339
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,140
I don't know who it was

340
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,780
that came to me in the past.

341
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,620
I have never paid any attention to you at all.

342
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,740
It's impossible for me to agree to this.

343
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,220
Just give up.

344
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,450
You...

345
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,340
Auntie, my mom still has something to do.

346
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,260
I'll send her back first.

347
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,980
I won't see you off.

348
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,980
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

349
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,420
Mom.

350
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,340
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

351
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,220
Are you that desperate to marry him?

352
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,060
I...

353
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
Stop pushing me, stop pushing me.

354
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,580
Whose son are you?

355
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,180
I'm so mad.

356
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,460
I can't believe you compromised my stance by taking her side.

357
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,060
But it's true that I chased Qiao Jing first.

358
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,260
You still have the nerve to mention that?

359
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,740
You loser.

360
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,980
I confirmed it.

361
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,250
Li Jing is resolute in opposing to

362
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,420
the two of you being together.

363
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,100
Aunt Li is indeed prejudiced against our family.

364
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,380
But I will use my actions

365
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,620
to prove myself.

366
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,660
You've persuaded me,

367
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,780
but it might not work on Li Jing.

368
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,700
Mom, trust your son.

369
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,660
I'll succeed.

370
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,780
All right, you don't have to see me off.

371
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,700
Go back in.

372
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,580
Bye.

373
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,100
Okay.

374
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,900
When did you get together with him?

375
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,820
A lot has happened recently.

376
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,780
I haven't had the time to tell you.

377
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,740
Mom, calm down.

378
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,780
My dear, this man won't do.

379
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,820
He does have a good family background.

380
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,140
But there are so many rich people in the world.

381
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,420
Why must you choose a problematic one?

382
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,860
That's a matter of the previous generation.

383
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,420
Gu Yi's not like that.

384
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,980
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

385
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,300
You don't understand that logic, do you?

386
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,660
Mom, Gu Yi was indeed immature before.

387
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,500
But I was partially at fault too.

388
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,980
Now, we've both changed for the better.

389
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,860
You should get to know him better.

390
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,660
Auntie.

391
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,740
Yes.

392
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,580
Okay.

393
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,980
I’ll stay here for a few more days

394
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,980
and get to know Young Master Gu again.

395
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,220
Young Master Gu.

396
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,180
Welcome.

397
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,420
Delicious.

398
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,060
Who made it?

399
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Qiao Jing made it.

400
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,380
Eat.

401
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,180
Mom.

402
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,700
Eat.

403
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,220
Mom, eat.

404
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,380
♫It's too quiet♫

405
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,560
♫You're always silent♫

406
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,410
♫Our sweet past♫

407
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,450
♫Probably is not worth mentioning♫

408
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,090
♫Looking at your back as you leave♫

409
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,770
♫So unfamiliar yet familiar♫

410
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,010
♫The cruelty of memories♫

411
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,910
♫Unwilling to freeze in moments of happiness♫

412
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,630
♫I turned around and saw your back♫

413
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,300
♫A dreamlike illusion♫

414
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,000
♫The night is acting with me♫

415
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,800
♫As my partner♫

416
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,620
♫Even if we just had a fleeting relationship♫

417
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,810
♫I'm also fine with it♫

418
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,510
♫Come closer♫

419
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,410
♫A little more♫

420
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,420
You like this drama too?

421
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,740
Great. Let's watch it together.

422
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,860
How naughty.

423
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,740
Auntie.

424
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,180
I'm sorry. I went the wrong way.

425
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,700
Auntie.

426
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,060
Good men get up early to cook.

427
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,780
Only lazy men stay in bed at this hour.

428
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,140
One, two, three. Get up!

429
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,660
Go cook.

430
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Okay.

431
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Auntie, please enjoy your meal.

432
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,780
Do you like it?

433
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,820
The stuffed buns are too small.

434
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,500
The steamed buns are too dry.

435
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,840
The dumplings are too oily.

436
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,110
The rice porridge is too watery.

437
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,500
The soy milk is bland.

438
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,900
Fried dough sticks are not healthy.

439
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,180
I can tell you've never done manual work before.

440
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,300
Kneel on the ground.

441
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,780
Then it'll be easy to use force, understand?

442
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,620
Yes.

443
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,020
What are you doing so early in the morning?

444
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,380
What's wrong?

445
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,580
If he wants to be my son-in-law,

446
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,620
he has to be able to bear hardship without complaint, like your father.

447
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,340
Understand?

448
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,460
Then we can work together.

449
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,300
Why must you let him do it alone?

450
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,220
Isn't it natural for a man to dote on a woman?

451
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,060
What use is it if a tall man like him can't do work?

452
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,420
Yes, auntie is right.

453
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,620
Mom.

454
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,940
I want to eat your boiled fish.

455
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,020
I've been craving it for a long time.

456
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,740
Really?

457
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,340
Okay, I'll go buy some fish for you.

458
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,820
Work hard.

459
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,370
Okay. Bye auntie.

460
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,930
Get up quickly.

461
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,420
Get up quickly.

462
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,580
Are you tired?

463
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,660
Do you know

464
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,660
your mom waked me up at 5:30 a.m.

465
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,730
and made me work until now?

466
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,060
My back is about to break.

467
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,340
Have a rest. Let me give you a massage.

468
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,580
Jing, where is my wallet?

469
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,220
It's here.

470
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,020
Not bad.

471
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,140
Work hard.

472
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,620
I'll inspect when I'm back.

473
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,420
Okay.

474
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,140
Have some sunflower seeds.

475
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,940
Sit down. Have some sunflower seeds.

476
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,820
I'm leaving.

477
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,700
Bye auntie.

478
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,140
Get up quickly.

479
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,690
Forget it. I'll wipe the floors clean first.

480
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,940
There's so much left.

481
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,420
Then let me help you.

482
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,020
No need. Just take a rest.

483
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,700
It'll be faster if we work together.

484
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,100
But my mom did go too far this time.

485
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,300
It's okay. She's just testing me.

486
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,420
Pleasing one's mother-in-law

487
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,740
is a rite of passage for a qualified son-in-law.

488
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,820
Let's get wiping then.
