I went there after I got a call from Gu Yi.

13
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,060
You need to ask the police about the details.

Mrs. Gu,

I'm sorry.

Thanks to her, you've become like this.

Yet you still think about her.

Glad to hear that she's fine.

That's good to hear.

45
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,020
Moreover, you were in deep water because of Bai Yun.

I felt something was wrong.

47
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,850
So I went there.

00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,740
I called the police on my way.

49
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,180
Luckily, you're fine.

The doctor said you hadn't hurt the vital part.

52
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,340
The wound is not too deep.

53
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,860
But you need to rest more during this period.

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,820
I want a chance to explain.

59
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,100
I was really unaware of

60
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,380
what Bai Yun did before this.

61
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,140
The Gu family has never

62
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,180
despised the child.

63
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,460
When I came to the hospital after knowing you had a miscarriage,

64
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,980
I saw you and Su Juan...

65
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,300
I was too childish and impulsive.

66
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,180
I said those words without further thinking

67
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,620
because I thought you didn't care about our child.

68
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,860

69
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,820
I'm sorry.

you are the one who suffers the most

72

73
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,210
That day,

74
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,660
why did you

75
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
ask me out?

76
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,660
That day,

This ring

79
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,980
should be on your finger.

80
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,340
I'm not forcing you to say yes.

81
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,180
If you give me another chance,

82
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
it will be good enough.

83
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,940
I'm back.

84
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,299
How did it go?

85
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,260
-Yes. How did it go?
-Yes.

86
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,539
Ms. Qiao was fine.

87
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,659
Mr. Gu would be hospitalized for a few days.

88
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,260
Poor Mr. Gu.

89
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,340
Mr. Gu said

90
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,260
the person in charge of the Great Project had arrived in Nancheng.

91
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,660
We must finalize the proposal within a week.

92
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,060
Work hard, everyone,

93
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,460
so that Mr. Gu can have a good rest.

94
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,460
Okay.

95
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,820
Come on. Keep it up.

96
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,260
OK. Come on. Keep it up.

97
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,220
The incident

98
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,860
must have something to do with the Bai family.

99
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,140
Bai Yun is already jailed.

100
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,700
Why is she still trying to look for trouble?

101
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,340
We can't let her go easily.

102
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,620
The police are still investigating

103
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,260
who the mastermind is.

104
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,020
It's just speculation for the time being.

105
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,380
How is Gu Yi?

106
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,300
I heard his waist had been stabbed.

107
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,620
The doctor said he was fine

108
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,860
but needed some rest.

109
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,620
This time, he really threw caution to the wind

110
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,900
for the sake of you.

111
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,180
It seems that

112
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,060
he's not on the same side as Bai Yun.

113
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,740
I misunderstood him.

114
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,900
Are you now pitying him?

115
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,220
If you still like each other so much,

116
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,100
why don't you take the opportunity to make up?

117
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,340
But many problems between us

118
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,220
haven't been solved yet.

119
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,460
But now,

120
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,260
I want to give each of us another possibility.

121
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,420
No one knows well about love.

122
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,740
But if you follow your heart,

123
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,820
nothing will go wrong.

124
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,780
We've got news from the police.

125
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,300

to declare the letter of understanding.

127
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,020
Those thugs didn't know anything either.

128
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,340
If not the Bai family,

129
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,660
who could it be?

130
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,460
How are you? Are you feeling better now?

131
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,140
No big deal. I'll be fine after a while.

135
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,540
Okay.

136

138
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,300
Nothing.

139
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,660
I'm here to check if your waist can function normally.

140
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,540
It's better than yours.

141
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,580
You were really heroic.

142
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,170
You won a big victory even in the face of a large number of enemies.

143
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,980
Are you really not afraid of death?

144
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,300
No, I'm afraid.

145
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,180
But I had only one thought in my mind at that moment.

146
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,020
It was to protect her.

147
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,700
Awesome.

148
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,700

150

No one can influence your decision, can they?

151
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,260
Besides,

152
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,780
Yun is willing to bear

153
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,020
all the consequences.

154
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,260

has fully handed over the Great Project to Su Juan.

159

How could that be possible?

160

How could my dad give it to him?

162

You're now injured and hospitalized.

163
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,580

How is Mr. Gu?

166
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,860
It's a pity

167
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,380
for him to quit this time.

168
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,540

I'll be totally in charge of the project.

176
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,740

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,380
I've taken care of it.

192
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,540
I'll leave first then.

193
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,500
Thank you.

194
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,980
You were too reckless.

195
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,610
If I hadn't been there,

196
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,660
what would have happened to the project?

197
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,780
It's everyone's hard work.

198
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,460
I can't disappoint them.

199
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,260
If you're worried,

200
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,860
you can stay here

201
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,420
and take care of me personally.

202
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,420
You don't even listen to me.

203
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,540
What's the use of staying here?

204
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
I listen. I don't dare to not.

205
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,900
I'll listen to every one of your words.

206
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,820
Have a good rest at home.

207
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,020
I'll go to the company to keep an eye on the project.

208
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,900
Okay.

209
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,980
He still minds what happened to Bai Yun.

210
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Don't take it to heart.

211
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,460
What about you? What do you think?

212
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
Bai Yun did something wrong,

213
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,940
so she has to bear the consequences.

214
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,740
But there's one thing

215
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,140
I feel fishy about.

216
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,210
Bai Yun told the police that

217
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,890
she found out about your pregnancy

218
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,540
from Su Juan.

219
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,300
How could that be possible?

220
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,660
I never told him I was pregnant.

221
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,700
But Su Juan had been around you these days.

222
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,820
Maybe he got some inklings.

223
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,820
But why did he do that?

224
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,020
First, he made use of Bai Yun

225
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,060
to sow discord between us.

226
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,300
After I was hospitalized,

227
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
he then took away the Great Project.

228
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
So far,

229
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,300
he's the biggest beneficiary

230
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,420
of everything.

231
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,700
H-He's not that kind of person.

232
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,180
Qiao Jing.

233
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,820
People change.

234
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,620
If you look at him objectively,

235
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,460
you'll find

236
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,620
he's not that simple.

237
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,900
Gu Yi is indeed reluctant to give up on this project.

238
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,820
The Bai family is no more useful either.

239
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,340
If we want to dominate him,

240
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,820
we have to put more effort.

241
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,980
Don't worry, Uncle Jiang.

242
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,580
Everything is going as planned.

243
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,600
[Su Juan]

244
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,620
Are you free tomorrow?

245
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,620
What happened?

246
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,340
I wanted to get off the bed and put on my pyjamas,

247
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,540
but I fell.

248
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,620
Can you help me?

249
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,020
M-My wound hurts.

250
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,260
Come on. Let me help you.

251
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,220
What are you doing?

252
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,820
Don't be so petty.

253
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,740
Let me hold you for a while.

254
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,460
This ring

255
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,819
was designed for you.

256
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,260
I know you're not ready yet.

257
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,420
Whether you accept me or not,

258
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,260
it belongs to you.

259
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,780
It only belongs to you.

260
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,660
Let me put it on you.

261
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,020
You're here.

262
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,780
I have something to ask you.

263
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,660
Can we talk later?

264
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,020
I want you to come somewhere with me.

265
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,020
Where?

266
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,180
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

267
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,740
Mr. Gu, that's all for the proposal.

268
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
What else do you think needs to amend?

269
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,580
Well done.

270
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,420
We've worked hard for a year.

271
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,780
Tomorrow is the time to hand in the paper.

272
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,700
I believe Anxia will gain the final victory.

273
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,970
[Thank you for watching]

274
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,540
Declare your bidding document for the Great Project

275
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,380
to the public,

276
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,780
or you'll suffer the consequences.

277
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,100
Who are you?

278
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,820
Mr. Gu.

279
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,620
I'll only give you 30 minutes.

280
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,640
[Sorry, the subscriber you dialled is not in the service area.]

281
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,970
[Sorry, the subscriber you dialled is not in the service area.]

282
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,940
She's not home either.

283
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
What happened?

284
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,380
Has she been kidnapped again?

285
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,020
Inform the police to track the anonymous call immediately

286
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,980
and investigate the competitors of the bidding first.

287
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,020
Yes.

288
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,620
Could they have taken this in advance

289
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
to trick us?

290
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,980
I put this necklace on her last night.

291
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,220
What should we do?

292
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,060
I can't risk her life.

293
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,980
Let's declare the document like what they requested.

294
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,700
No way.

295
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,820
We've been preparing for the Great Project for so long.

296
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,900
If we declare the document, we are considered to have given up the bidding.

297
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,620
All of our efforts will be in vain.

298
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,500
Of course, I won't give up the project in vain.

299
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,820
I have a plan.

300
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,300
Let's have a meeting.

301
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,780
It's an emergency.

302
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,180
We need to combine the eliminated versions and turn them

303
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,220
into a new proposal

304
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,380
in the shortest time.

305
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,020
Hide all the questionable points and highlights

306
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,060
and make it half-genuine and half-sham.

307
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,140
Don't let them discover any loose ends.

308
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,420
Mr. Gu, it is too urgent.

309
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
We can't complete it in time.

310
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,260
You have to.

311
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,780
Tang Ping, put your work aside

312
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,980
and give the Design Department full support.

313
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,620
Okay.

314
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,460
Mr. Gu, we'll finish the task as soon as possible.

315
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,410
Xiang Sese.

316
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,090
Draft a few PR plans immediately.

317
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,900
Once we locate Qiao Jing,

318
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,860
distribute the news immediately

319
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,100
and minimize the negative impact.

320
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,020
Okay.

321
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,580
Time is running out.

322
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,660
Move. Hurry.

323
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,530
[The Grave of the Loving Mother, Su Nian
Su Juan, the Son]

324
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,580
Aunt Su.

325
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,220
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,580
I didn't come to see you until now.

327
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,820
My mum liked you very much.

328
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,340
Unfortunately,

329
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,210
she didn't get to see you before her last breath.

330
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,570
The Gu family

331
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,780
was a drag on her whole life.

332
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,660
Mr. Gu.

333
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,500
Have you checked?

334
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,020
We did it according to your instruction.

335
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,100
It has no problem at all.

336
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Send it now.

337
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,780
Okay.

338
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,090
Have you been with Gu Yi these days?

339
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,100
He got hurt because of me.

340
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,020
I should take care of him.

341
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,540
Just take care of him?

342
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,140
What are you trying to say?

343
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,940
Gratitude isn't love.

344
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,540
I'm afraid you might get confused.

345
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,140
I'm grateful to him.

346
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,770
But actually,

347
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,900
before you came back,

348
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,300
I had already been into him.

349
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,620
So,

350
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,420
that's why you never responded to me.

351
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,620
We've known each other for so long.

352
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,780
Isn't it worth more than these three years?

353
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,300
Love can't be measured by time.

354
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,020
You and I

355
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,060
have missed too many things.

356
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,820
Why would we miss them?

357
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,340
It was all because of the Gu family, because of Gu Yi.

358
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,220
How could you fall in love with him?

359
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,620
So,

360
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,820
I'm also a pawn for you to take revenge on Gu Yi,

361
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,820
right?

362
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,780
I never wanted to make use of you.

363
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,940
Were you aware of

364
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,100
my pregnancy long ago?

365
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,940
Yes.

366
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,770
You didn't tell me,

367
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,450
so I didn't expose you.

368
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,860
What about Bai Yun?

369
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,780
You abetted her, didn't you?

370
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,900
No.

371
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,540
Yes.

372
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,900
I admit I let it slip.

373
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,020
I really didn't expect her to do that.

374
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,020
Such a lame excuse.

375
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,140
Do you believe it yourself?

376
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,620
You'd rather trust Gu Yi

377
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,620
than me?

378
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,580
The Su Juan I liked

379
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,100
will never come back anymore.

380
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,610
Gosh.

381
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,660
Tang Ping, come here.

382
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,580
Ru, Yang Yang, look!

383
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,090
[The Great AI + Future Amusement Park]

384
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,330
Oh no.

385
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,420
Go in!

386
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,820
He is the one

387
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,180
who took the wrong USB flash drive

388
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,700
and sent out our real proposal.

389
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,020
What's going on?

390
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,820
Mr. Gu,

391
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,180
there were too many versions.

392
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,220
I sent it wrong by mistake.

393
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,580
Have you taken it back?

394
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,780
Yes, I am doing it.

395
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,260
But I guess it won't help much.

396
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,220
I've been emphasizing the checking.

397
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,580
Why would you still make a mistake?

398
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

399
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,980
Dad.

400
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,620
Dad.

401
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,260
Stop it!

402
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,620
He's still injured.

403
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,260
The leak of the proposal was an accident.

404
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,610
I'll take full responsibility.

405
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,660
But dad,

406
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,060
Qiao Jing is still missing.

407
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,180
I need to ensure her safety.

408
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,420
Qiao Jing is important.

409
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,020
Yet thousands of employees in the company

410
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,220
are nothing to you.

411
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,860
Because of your mistake,

412
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,820
all their efforts have gone in vain.

413
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,620
On what basis can you bear the consequences?

414
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,060
Yi,

415
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,420
you were indeed too impulsive this time.

416
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,460
No matter what,

417
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,900
you couldn't sell the company

418
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,500
for the sake of a woman.

419
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,540
Yes.

420
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,020
You don't own Anxia.

421
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,060
Do you have any respect for us?

422
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,900
Dad.

423
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,740
You were not in the company all day.

424
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,580
Where have you been?

425
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,060
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

426
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,460
I went to visit her.

427
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,420
Gu Yi,

428
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,410
what happened with the leak of the proposal?

429
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,900
Mr. Gu heard that Qiao Jing was kidnapped.

430
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,420
So he sold the project to save her.

431
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,340
That couldn't be.

432
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,980
Qiao Jing went to visit the grave with me.

433
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,180
She should be at home now.

434
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,540
She was with you?

435
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,780
Why couldn't I reach out to her by phone?

436
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,660
The graveyard is on the mountain.

437
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,900
Maybe the signal was bad.

438
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,980
Yi, you are such a fool.

439
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,740
Wait. Why didn't you discuss it with me

440
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,620
when such a big event occurred?

441
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,500
You just couldn't get in touch with Qiao Jing for a while,

442
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,820
yet you already sold a big project of the company.

443
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,100
If anything happens to her,

444
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,500
you'll surely implicate the whole Gu family for her.

445
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,820
From tomorrow onwards,

446
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,300
you don't have to go to the company anymore.

447
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,940
I'm glad that you're fine.

448
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,980
I'm glad that you're fine.

449
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,020
Sorry.

450
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,380
I wanted to talk to Su Juan today.

451
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,300
I didn't expect...

452
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,820
Let's go home first.

453
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,340
Let's go.

454
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,180
Su Juan took me to the graveyard today

455
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,460
on the spur of the moment.

456
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,620
No one else knew about it.

457
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,540
And the shooting distance and angle

458
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,820
show that this photo couldn't be taken far away.

459
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,380
You said you had called me many times

460
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,700
during that period.

461
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,220
But my phone didn't ring at all.

462
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,380
He must have blocked the signal.

463
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,900
Su Juan is indeed mean.

464
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,580
He even made use of his mother's death anniversary.

465
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,020
I guess Chen Lan who sent out the real proposal

466
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
is also his man.

467
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,060
I should have told you my whereabouts.

469
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,860
We didn't do anything wrong.

470
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,620
If it started over again,

471
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,500
I would still make the same choice.

472
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,020
As long as you are fine.

473
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,220
Tomorrow is the bidding.

474
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,860
Are we really giving up

475
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,540
the bidding for the Great Project?

476
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,260
Wasn't there an older version?

477
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,300
Why don't we ask the employees

478
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,100
to work overtime and amend it?

479
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,620
Or we can contact the Great

480
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,420
and ask them to spare us a few more days.

481
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,900
Then we...

482
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,740
Enough.

483
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,340
Juan.

484
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,540
What do you think?

485
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,980
I think at this point,

486
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,820
we can't turn the table anymore.

487
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,860
But we can consider

488
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,780
collaborating with the company that wins the bid in the end.

489
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,420
The Great Land is not a small project.

490
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,820
Besides us,

491
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,420
it's most likely to fall into Jiahe's hands.

492
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,980
This is feasible.

493
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,180
Our proposal was leaked,

494
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,820
but

495
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,180
we have more experience than Jiahe.

496
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,020
I'm sure they won't refuse us.

497
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,260
Right.

498
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,620
Young people are indeed quick-witted.

499
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,660
In this way, we can get a share

500
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,290
and minimize the company's losses.

501
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,300
How about this?

502
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,420
Juan, you replace Gu Yi

503
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,980
and carry on with the project.

504
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,030
Dad...

505
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,520
[Anxia Group]

506
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,550
After working hard for half a year,

507
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,060
we're now back to square one.

508
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,250
Do you think Jiahe did what happened yesterday

509
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,640
for a destructive competition?

510
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,750
They knew Ms. Qiao's whereabouts in advance

511
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,890
and took photos to deceive us.

512
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,690
I don't think so.

513
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,120
I think

514
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,260
it might not be done by outsiders.

515
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,490
It depends on who got more benefits in the end.

516
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,250
Mr. Gu.

517
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,140
Mr. Gu.

518
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,720
Mr. Gu.

519
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,520
Mr. Gu.

520
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,260
Notify the Design Department and Project Department for a meeting.

521
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,900
We can't give up the Great Project yet.

522
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,220
Mr. Gu.

523
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,860
Are you sure about the meeting?

524
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,050
What do you mean?

525
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,440
Su Juan, why are you sitting here?

526
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,810
You came at the right time.

527
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,920
The transfer order for you has been issued.

528
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,240
The properties in Wanyuan District are almost done.

529
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,410
Dad asked you to keep an eye on them.

530
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,510
I tried to persuade him.

531
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,280
But he's on the warpath lately.

532
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,130
So for the time being,

533
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,300
you have to suffer a bit.

534
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,700
The Great Project hasn't been solved yet.

535
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,540
I can't leave.

536
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,530
The project has been handed over to me.

537
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,120
Don't worry.

538
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,430
I won't let your efforts go to waste.

539
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,820
Also,

540
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,610
take your photo with you.

541
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,310
Since I was hospitalized,

542
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,950
you have been setting me up.

543
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,510
I underestimated you.

544
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,330
I don't understand what you're talking about.

545
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,490
Since you like this position so much,

546
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,250
I'll give it to you.

547
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,660
But I hope you can sit tight.

548
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,810
Don't fall from the position too fast.

549
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,230
Su Juan.

550
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,659
I'm now asking you.

551
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,840
Did you feel any remorse

552
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,900
in front of Aunt Su's grave yesterday?

553
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,610
Why should I?

554
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,060
I just took the girl she used to like

555
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,020
to visit her.

556
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,830
You used her to lie to me.

557
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,880
I did not lie.

558
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,320
Yesterday was her death anniversary.

559
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,560
Then you shouldn't have done that.

560
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,960
No matter how you take revenge on the Gu family,

561
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,270
you shouldn't use Aunt Su as your pawn.
