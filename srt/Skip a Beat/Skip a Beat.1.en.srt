Mr. Gu.

[Year 2017]

7
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,050
Mr. Gu, it's time.

8
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,940
Time to go.

9
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,380
Mr. Zhao has arrived.

10
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,460
Did Jiahe's people

11
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,020
get wind of tonight's meeting?

12
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,140
This is a secret schedule.

13
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,060
No one knows about this.

14
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:34,940
Mr. Zhao.

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,180
Mr. Gu, long time no see.

16
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,259
This is my secretary, Qiao Jing.

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,660
I've long heard that you have a secretary

18
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,700
who's smart and capable.

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,860
Upon meeting you now, you sure deserve the reputation.

20
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,180
Mr. Zhao, you flatter me.

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,820
Let's sit down and talk.

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,220
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

23
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,580
It's okay.

24
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,460
Someone from Jiahe is here.

25
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,940
Hold him off. I need ten minutes.

26
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,180
Mr. Zhao, I need to use the restroom.

27
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,060
This way!

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,820
We're here.

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,740
Sorry for being late.

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,940
What took you so long?

31
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,460
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,730
Let me clean it up for you.

33
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,020
Anxia is the leading enterprise of the industry.

34
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,460
I'm looking forward to working with you.

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,620
But this time,

36
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,940
Jiahe's plan is more in line with my requests.

37
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,860
As long as there is a better plan,

38
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,220
all requests can be changed.

39
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
My ancient mansion was passed down from my ancestors.

40
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,260
The whole structure is made of wood.

41
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,020
It has been through a hundred years of wear and tear.

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,620
So I've to spend a fortune on maintenance fees every year.

43
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,060
Jiahe suggested that I remodel it

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,220
into a hotel.

45
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,660
I can also rely on the surrounding attractions to drive consumption.

46
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,780
A hotel will only bring temporary profit.

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,700
Ten or twenty years later,

48
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,540
it would inevitably become obsolete.

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,579
By then,

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,700
do you want to repeat everything with another remodeling?

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,420
History will never become obsolete.

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,050
The ancient mansion has important historical value

53
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,220
and traditional heritage.

54
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,540
The mansion itself can be turned into an attraction.

55
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,060
Most of the old mansion has collapsed,

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,140
and it's not big.

57
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,090
Even if we remodel it into an attraction,

58
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,860
no one would visit.

59
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,540
It's indeed not enough on its own.

60
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,100
But we can create a unique ancient-style town

61
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,140
with it at the center.

62
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,940
Mr. Chen.

63
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,380
Ms. Qiao.

64
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,060
What a coincidence.

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,740
You're here too?

66
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,780
Then I guess Mr. Gu is here too?

67
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,060
No, he's not here.

68
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,250
I came out alone to have fun.

69
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,060
Would you do me the honor of having a drink with me?

70
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,450
I have something to do. Let's do that next time.

72
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,899
I said next time.

73
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,250
Mr. Gu, your plan is very good indeed.

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,300
But the scale is too huge.

75
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,250
It will definitely exceed my budget.

76
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,580
Let's work together next time instead.

77
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,500
I have something to do. I'll get going.

78
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,260
Have it cleaned and send it to the T1 private room.

79
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,620
Okay.

80
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,060
And wait for me at the door.

81
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,660
Okay.

82

Mr. Chen, you're heading in the wrong direction.

The lobby is over there.

85
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,820
I did not.

88
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,820
This room hasn't been reserved yet.

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,340
Mr. Chen, I told you.

90
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,540

I just confirmed the schedule with Mr. Zhao.

94
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,020
He's coming to the company to discuss the contract this afternoon.

95
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,540
Mr. Zhao was originally leaning towards Jiahe.

96
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,620
How did you convince him to work with us instead?

97
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,420
He was satisfied with Jiahe.

98
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,340
But in the end, I promised that

99
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,100
as long as he works with us,

100
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,010
we would pay for the maintenance fees of the ancient-style town.

101
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,780
We can provide

102

the best design

103
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,940

104
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,940
It was clear what choice he should make.

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,420

We've won the project of Zhao's old mansion.

116
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,660
Not only can it promote traditional culture,

117
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,220
but it can also become

118
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,420
Anxia's first ancient-style town in the local tourism market.

119
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,300
Our client was originally leaning towards Jiahe.

120
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,780
To win this project,

121
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,900
we arranged for a secret meeting.

But in the end,

124
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,380
Jiahe's people still got wind of the news.

125
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,740
How could this have happened?

126
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,940
Mr. Zhang, who do you think leaked the news?

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,900
Who? Who was so bold?

128
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,180
How dare he betray us?

130
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,060

Mr. Gu.

132
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,460
Mr. Zhao said he'll arrive at T61 in an hour.

133
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,260
At that time, I was at the underground parking lot.

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,220
But I'm not in touch with

135
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,420

During the period of the meetings with the client,

137
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,900
just in case,

138
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,860

This is the photo they took.

140
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,380
Yes, I did meet up with Chen Jia last night.

141
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,850
But it was just an ordinary gathering for drinks.

142
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,380
There were others there too.

143
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,860
Yi, we're family.

144
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,900
How could your uncle leak the company's secret

145
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,220
to outsiders, right?

146
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,140
Mr. Zhang loves to be honest after getting drunk.

147
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,620
I'm afraid you did the same thing again this time.

148
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,420
Ms. Qiao, don't slander me.

149
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,060
Where did you hear that from?

150
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,170
There were other business partners

151
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,780
at last night's gathering.

152
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,700
Someone would have eventually heard about it.

153
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,420
How about this?

154
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,180
I'll call Mr. Chen directly

155
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,220
and see if you'll still keep your dignity.

156
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,580
Yi, I did drink too much yesterday

157
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,020
and revealed just a little bit of the secret.

158
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,100
But I didn't mean it.

159
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,380
Yi.

160
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,020
I will kick this bad habit.

161
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,980
I promise!

162
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,420
This is not the first time.

163
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,380
The last New District project

164
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,860
was also ruined because you weren't careful with your words.

165
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,900
I didn't hold you accountable then.

166
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
But this time,

167
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,780
I won't just let you off.

168
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
From now on,

169
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,220
don't show up at Anxia.

170
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,850
Don't you like drinking?

171
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,900
You can go drinking at ease in the future.

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,100
Are you firing me?

173
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,420
What right do you have to do so?

174
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,020
Everyone makes mistakes.

175
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,780
That's not a mistake, but stupidity.

176
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,140
Yi. Yi!

177
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,300
Ms. Qiao, I was just momentarily confused.

178
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,500
Mr. Gu listens to you the most.

179
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,940
Please plead for mercy on my behalf.

180
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,420
Mr. Zhang.

181
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,780
Don't forget to go to the 8th floor to handle your resignation procedures.

182
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,500
Thanks.

183
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,140
Thank you.

184
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,580
Mr. Gu finally fired Mr. Zhang.

185
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,060
Finally, no one will hold us back.

186
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,420
We can finally relax.

187
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,740
We spent so much effort on this project.

188
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,580
But he sold us out just after having some drinks.

189
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,580
If it weren't for Mr. Gu and Ms. Qiao's great coordination,

190
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,300
our project would have been ruined again

191
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,900
and our efforts would have been in vain.

192
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,140
If it weren't for Mr. Gu's quick wits

193
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,460
and perceptiveness,

194
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,530
we'd have been screwed by Mr. Zhang's folly.

195
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,940
This time, Mr. Gu turned the tide again

196
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,180
and even killed off his family member

197
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,220
by finally firing Mr. Zhang.

198
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,860
This time,

199
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,500
Ms. Qiao and Mr. Gu's coordination

200
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,540
was really brilliant.

201
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,740
The kind of tacit understanding required

202
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,180
to be this well-coordinated is definitely not that of

203
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,420
a regular boss and secretary's relationship.

204
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,340
There must be something between them.

205
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,700
I heard that Mr. Gu and Ms. Qiao

206
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,100
have been together for a long time.

207
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,020
It's just that they haven't made it public.

208
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,660
Really?

209
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,380
Yes.

210
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,580
Are you done with your work?

211
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,860
Ms. Qiao.

212
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,020
You're really something.

213
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,940
Right now, all the financial sections in the news of Nancheng

214
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,740
[Financial Century]

215
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,860
are about you.

216
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,100
In just three years,

217
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,100
you've more than doubled the market value of Anxia.

218
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,020
I believe our cooperation this time

219
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,100
will be smooth-sailing.

220
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,220
I'm just an employee of Anxia.

221
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,860
Mr. Gu is the one in charge.

222
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,420
I'll show everyone

223
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,740
how Anxia

224
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,540
never lets anyone down.

225
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,860
Come in.

226
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,700
Mr. Gu. Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhao.

227
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,890
Here's your coffee.

228
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,540
Thank you.

229
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,700
Mr. Gu, I really envy you

230
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,300
for having such a beautiful and sweet secretary.

231
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,860
Office lover.

232
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,740
Such a rigid woman

233
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,860
is only useful at work.

234
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,140
Mr. Gu, you're drunk.

235
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,860
Cut the crap.

236
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,380
Time to take your medicine.

237
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,460
Boring.

238
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,300
Since four years ago,

239
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,740
after you had that car accident,

240
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,740
not only did you lose some of your memory,

241
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,820
but you also got that...

242
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,340
bipolar disorder.

243
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,620
You're manic for a moment, and depressed for another.

244
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,300
You can't control your emotions at all.

245
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,260
A machine that has lost all control.

246
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,940
How is it now?

247
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,020
Are you still taking your medicine?

248
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,620
Yes.

249
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,660
But the doctor said I'm much better.

250
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,140
Yesterday, you said Ms. Qiao is useless.

251
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,540
I think she's actually taking great care of you.

252
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,180
Zhou Rui.

253
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,900
You’ve been dating for about three years.

254
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,500
Are you going to keep hiding your relationship

255
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,540
and not make it public?

256
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,140
Dating is between two people.

257
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,540
Why should we make it public?

258
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,260
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

259
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,140
If you keep hiding it,

260
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,220
Qiao Jing is going to

261
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,500
leave you for someone else sooner or later.

262
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,780
Don't worry. She won't leave me.

263
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,600
[Mr. Chen]

264
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,380
Hello, Mr. Chen.

265
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,940
Isn't that Ms. Qiao?

266
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,860
Where are you?

267
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,940
Ms. Qiao really is Mr. Gu's right-hand man.

268
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,020
I was running around and working so hard

269
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,250
that I was about to break my legs.

270
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,140
But I still lost to Anxia.

271
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,020
Anxia is not as experienced as Jiahe,

272
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,820
so we naturally have to work harder

273
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,140
to get a piece of the pie behind Jiahe.

274
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,940
You're too modest.

275
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Jiahe's the one

276
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,620
that has to get a slice of the cake after Anxia.

277
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,500
Anxia still needs Jiahe's help in the future.

278
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,220
It'd be good for us to cooperate more.

279
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,700
Mr. Gu.

280
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,740
I'm outside.

281
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,380
Where, exactly?

282
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,260
Mr. Gu's so handsome.

283
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,380
This is my first time seeing him up-close.

284
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,700
Let's have a drink.

285
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,300
Something's up with your Ms. Qiao.

286
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,060
Ms. Qiao.

287
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,540
You're pretty and capable.

288
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,210
Haven't you considered taking your talents somewhere else?

289
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,300
Mr. Chen—

290
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,020
As long as you're the one asking,

291
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,180
I'll agree to all of your conditions.

292
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,340
Mr. Chen.

293
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,210
You sure are generous.

294
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,300
Mr. Gu.

295
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,980
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

296
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
I haven't had the time to thank you for the project

297
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,380
that Jiahe let Anxia win the last time.

298
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,580
Anxia won with its capabilities.

299
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,380
You don't have to thank me.

300
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,820
You're too kind, Mr. Chen.

301
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,060
Let's get drunk tonight.

302
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,780
Waiter, serve us the drinks!

303
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,580
Mr. Gu, I have something to do later.

304
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,540
Enjoy your drinks. I'm leaving.

305
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,260
Mr. Chen, this is just a token of appreciation from Mr. Gu.

306
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,300
Come on.

307
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,460
Let's get drunk today.

308
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,340
You misunderstood.

309
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,740
There's nothing between me and Mr. Chen.

310
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,380
Nothing?

311
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,540
Then why did you drink with him?

312
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,940
That's because of the project—

313
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,460
Enough!

314
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,220
Qiao Jing.

315
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,260
Qiao Jing!

316
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,620
Change your clothes and go somewhere with me.

317
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,940
Okay.

318
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,260
I used to go hiking with your dad.

319
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,460
He's currently in poor health,

320
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,660
so he asked me to accompany you.

321
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,980
Your dad is indeed in poor health.

322
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,980
Anxia will have to depend on you from now on.

323
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,620
I'm inexperienced,

324
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,300
so I still have to rely on older seniors like you.

325
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,780
You're currently developing a tourism zone. I hope...

326
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,940
About this matter,

327
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,340
things have not even begun to take shape yet.

328
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,780
Let's go further up.

329
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,900
Ms. Qiao, what's wrong?

330
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,980
Are you not feeling well?

331
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,740
What's wrong? Are you sick?

332
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm fine.

333
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,770
Let's head down the mountain then.

334
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,660
Uncle Yang—

335
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,620
Let's talk again next time.

336
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,100
Let's go.

337
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,860
Okay.

338
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,660
Uncle Yang.

339
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,380
Uncle Yang, slow down.

340
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,380
As long as it's still here,

341
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,180
then nothing else matters.

342
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,780
The famous and beautiful pianist, Bai Yun, has returned to China in glory.

343
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,540
She looks quite good in this photo.

344
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,980
She's young,

345
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,620
beautiful and capable.

346
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,460
She's really a winner in life.

347
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,660
We have to work overtime this Saturday.

348
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,860
Here, eat something.

349
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,970
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

350
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,620
Thank you.

351
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,300
Ms. Qiao, you don't look well.

352
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,620
Are you sick?

353
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,300
Why don't you go back and rest first?

354
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,700
We can do the rest of the work.

355
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,940
I'll do them with you,

356
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,260
so we can all go home early.

357
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,820
Here.

358
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,980
Yi.

359
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,500
Did I keep you waiting?

360
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,260
For you, it's worth it no matter how long I have to wait.

361
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,980
Here.

362
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,660
Have a seat.

363
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,860
You've been abroad and haven't been home for two years.

364
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,700
It seems like you don’t miss home at all.

365
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,380
Don't you even miss me and Zhou Rui?

366
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,540
I do.

367
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Especially you.

368
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,060
I'm not leaving this time.

369
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,580
You're not?

370
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,740
What about your pianist dream?

371
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,220
My pianist dream has already come true.

372
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,420
Now, it's time for me

373
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,060
to start the next phase of my life.

374
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,580
Who are you going to start it with?

375
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,140
For the past few years that you've been abroad,

376
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,980
you must have had a lot of suitors.

377
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,340
They are not as good as you.

378
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,900
Welcome home.

379
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,700
[Gu Yi]

380
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:48,660
Hello?

381
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,460
Send me some hangover medicine.

382
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,020
I've texted you the address.

383
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,980
What's wrong? Are you sick?

384
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,290
[Mr. Gu's Work Schedule]

385
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,780
Ms. Qiao, what's wrong?

386
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,620
Something urgent came up.

387
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,900
Continue with the remaining work.

388
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,300
I'll treat you to dinner when I return later.

389
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,580
Hang in there.

390
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,700
The medicine will be here soon.

391
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,580
Mr. Gu, you drank too much.

392
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,980
What took you so long? Hand me the medicine.

393
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,780
Yi, who is she?

394
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,020
My secretary.

395
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,100
Since you've delivered the medicine, you can go back.

396
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,740
Why are you drinking again at this hour?

397
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,620
Let me take you home.

398
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,100
None of your business.

399
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,900
Yun, let me send you home.

400
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:58,980
Come on.

401
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,660
Ms. Qiao.

402
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,610
This suit

403
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,580
is tailor-made for Mr. Gu.

404
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,780
It's good, but I think there's still something missing.

405
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,100
Sir, I eyed this first.

406
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,460
Excuse me, do you still have stock for this brooch?

407
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,540
This is the last one in our store.

408
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,060
This brooch

409
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,100
is the work of one of my favorite designers.

410
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,020
I came here specially for it.

411
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,780
Miss, do you think you can let me have it?

412
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,540
Of course, as compensation,

413
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,930
you can buy another brooch

414
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,770
and I'll pay for it.

415
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,660
You're too kind, sir.

416
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,940
But I only like this one.

417
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,460
The design of this brooch is too flashy,

418
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,780
and it doesn't suit your aura.

419
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,850
Let me recommend you a more suitable one.

420
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,500
What occasion do you want to use it in?

421
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,300
A... business banquet.

422
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,380
Try these on.

423
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,180
Okay.

424
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,580
This brooch suits you very well indeed.

425
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
You have good taste.

426
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,220
Are you a designer or a buyer?

427
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,530
Neither.

428
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,740
It's because you have a refined aura, so you can pull off the look.

429
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,940
You helped me with my outfit.

430
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,460
How should I thank you?

431
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,660
Haven't you already thanked me?

432
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,180
Thank you for giving up the brooch to me.

433
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,100
I heard that

434
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,700
Chen Jia was carried home that night.

435
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,140
Those carts of alcohol scared him to death.

436
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,900
If you dare to touch my woman,

437
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,700
then you should pay the price.

438
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,980
But we really misunderstood Ms. Qiao.

439
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,140
It's true that Chen Jia likes Ms. Qiao,

440
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,100
but he was trying to poach your talent

441
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,300
and not to steal your woman.

442
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,700
You didn't give her a hard time when you went back, did you?

443
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,540
Give her a hard time?

444
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,860
It's been like this for years.

445
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,460
She's your girlfriend after all.

446
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,100
Why are you so cruel to her?

447
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,620
You call this cruel?

448
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,620
Then what's the right way to do things?

449
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,660
It's not your fault.

450
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,020
You're ill.

451
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,620
But I've never seen you depressed.

452
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,220
Why do you only have manic episodes?

453
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,460
It's hard for you to even date now.

454
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,100
Shut up if you don't know how to speak properly.

455
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,700
I know how to date.

456
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,140
You're used to treating her like this.

457
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,380
Let me tell you.

458
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,460
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

459
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,900
Even the nicest people have their limits.

460
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,220
If you continue treating her like this,

461
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,420
she will leave you.

462
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,860
Don't regret it then.

463
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,300
If she can't stand it,

464
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,860
she can ask me for a breakup.

465
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,500
You sure are stubborn. Good for you.

466
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,860
Come on, lift your cue stick.

467
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,900
Ms. Qiao, what a coincidence.

468
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Ms. Bai.

469
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,340
You're so sweet.

470
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,500
You even personally bought clothes for Yi.

471
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,700
This is my job.

472
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,980
Is that part of a secretary's job?

473
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,540
Am I ignorant?

474
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,420
Or... did you cross the line?

475
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,900
Thank you for your hard work. You can leave the clothes with me.

476
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,740
Mr. Gu's stuff can't be handed to outsiders.

477
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,420
Sorry about that, Ms. Bai.

478
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,660
I’m Mr. Gu’s fiancée.

479
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,140
Don't you know?

480
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,420
Then, do you know that

481
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,540
I'm not only his secretary,

482
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,020
but also his girlfriend?

483
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,020
There are many

484
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,980
who like and pursue Gu Yi.

485
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,860
I didn't expect Ms. Bai

486
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,180
to be one of them.

487
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,180
Who do you think you are?

488
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,020
Let go of me!

489
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,820
Ms. Bai.

490
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,660
My tolerance only applies to Gu Yi.

491
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,180
Towards others,

492
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,340
I don't have such a good temper.

493
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,340
Ms. Bai, remember that.

494
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,300
Qiao Jing.
