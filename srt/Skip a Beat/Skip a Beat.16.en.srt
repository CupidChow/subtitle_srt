[Episode 16]

4
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,340
How could you have our son be posted to the construction site?

5
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,260
It's the company's decision. Why are you making such a huge fuss?

6
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,460
You make it sound so nice.

7
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,730
But it's something you could've solved very easily.

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
It's just losing a project. Is that necessary?

9
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,100
Or

10
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,860
you've already decided to drag my son down

11
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,580
and make space for your eldest son?

12
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:16,820
It's his incompetency.

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,539
And because you spoiled him,

14
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,980
that's why he's like what he is today.

15
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,140
I spoiled him?

16
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,260
You, as his dad, is already biased.

17
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,620
If I don't protect him,

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,940
you would cause more harm to him!

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,340
No one wants to harm him.

20
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,860
You haven't been peaceful for even a second all these years.

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,580
Aren't you tired?

22
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,380
If you weren't so paranoid,

23
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,140
that car accident wouldn't have happened.

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,500
Without that old lover of yours,

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,300
without that bastard who suddenly came back out of nowhere,

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,460
would I be so paranoid?

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,820
The person in the office yesterday was Mr. Gu.

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,540
Today, it's Mr. Su.

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,340
Things are changing so quickly.

30
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,980
Secretary Qiao left.

31
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,980
Mr. Gu too.

32
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,860
My heart left with them too.

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,140
Don't.

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,900
It's so competitive now.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,020
Many people want to enter Anxia Group.

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,140
Listen to me.

37
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,900
No matter how big the change is,

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,500
we can't lose our job.

39
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,620
Mr. Gu said don't slack off even without him here.

40
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,540
And I believe

41
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,660
he will come back.

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900
Work hard.

43
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,220
Sese, what are you looking at?

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,420
Come in.

45
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,820
Juan.

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,340
Aunt, what brings you here?

47
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,140
I made you some soup.

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,450
Have a taste.

49
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,020
Thank you, aunt.

50
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,620
We're family. Don't mention it.

51
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,220
Try it.

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,220
Juan,

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,180
you're more suited to sit here.

54
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,540
Thank you for your support all along.

55
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,700
As a woman,

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,180
I can't help you much.

57
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,700
But your uncle thinks you're having a hard time

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,140
and wants to come help you.

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,980
Previously,

60
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,730
it was Gu Yi who thought your uncle

61
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,579
was too serious and responsible for things he work on,

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,860
and made a mountain out of a molehill.

63
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,220
Aunt,

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,940
if Uncle is willing to help me,

65
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,140
of course, I'd be glad.

66
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,460
But I just took office.

67
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,060
If I my uncle to here too,

68
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,420
it wouldn't look good if this gets out.

69
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,019
I'm not asking you to reinstate him.

70
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,780
I only hope you can give him another chance.

71
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,900
Okay, Aunt.

72
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,420
I will make the necessary arrangements for Uncle.

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,659
Juan, you are the best.

74
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,659
Drink it.

75
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,060
Drink it while it's hot. There's more.

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,860
Jiahe also wants to cooperate with Anxia.

77
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,020
Once they win the bid,

78
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,700
both groups will work together on this project.

79
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,980
This is indeed the safest way now.

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,810
What about you? What are your plans?

81
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,060
Are you really going to the construction site?

82
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,540
What else can we do? The transfer order has been issued.

83
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,380
Listen.

84
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,740
Su Juan arranged this

85
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,100
to disgust you.

86
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,820
You might as well just leave the company.

87
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,260
Why do you have to go and suffer?

88
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,580
I won't leave before

89
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,700
Great Project is set.

90
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,580
And Chen Lan,

91
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,020
There must be someone behind him.

92
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,540
Go get her to speak.

93
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,380
Okay, don't worry. I understand.

94
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,820
You haven't recovered yet.

95
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,620
You should rest for a while.

96
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,820
I'm almost recovered.

97
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,260
If I skip work because of this minor injury,

98
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,620
they will laugh at me.

99
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,130
Let them laugh.

100
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,740
Your health is the most important.

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,659
Qiao Jing.

102
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,220
I have nothing now.

103
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,220
Will you dislike me?

104
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,980
Yes.

105
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,580
So you can't give up. Don't be discouraged.

106
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,020
As Mr. Gu,

107
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
you can't fall into such a mud pit.

108
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,660
Will you stay with me?

109
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,500
I'm Guan Hui.

110
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:38,260
I'm the person in charge of the construction of this building.

111
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,260
We'll be colleagues from now on.

112
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,780
Please take care of me.

113
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,060
This is the office area.

114
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:56,130
[Anxia Group]

115
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,260
That is the living area.

116
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,420
Behind this

117
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,500
is our construction site.

118
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,220
Mr. Gu?

119
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,210
No, Young Master Gu.

120
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,070
No, Supervisor Gu.

121
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,340
Supervisor Zhang.

122
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,900
You know him?

123
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,860
You don't know Mr. Gu?

124
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,540
Mr. Gu used to sit in the top-floor office.

125
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,860
But coming here,

126
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,420
is making Mr. Gu suffer.

127
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,220
Here,

128
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm just a supervisor.

129
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,740
I didn't expect to be able to work Supervisor Gu.

130
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,860
Mr. Su appointed me to supervise

131
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,900
the overall project.

132
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,700
I'll arrange your work.

133
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,820
You have to report to me.

134
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,780
It's getting late. Let's go to the construction site.

135
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,340
Yi, you came in on a short notice.

136
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,820
I don't have anything suitable for you.

137
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,020
But I'm your uncle after all.

138
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,020
In any way, we are a family.

139
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,620
I have to find something for you.

140
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,340
We're short of hands in construction waste.

141
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,820
Why don't you be the waste supervisor?

142
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,860
Yongquan, Daqiang, Xiaowei.

143
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,820
Come here.

144
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,740
Okay.

145
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,340
This is the new Supervisor Gu.

146
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,780
He will be in charge of you in the future.

147
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,180
It's such a mere job

148
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
and they're sending such a big-shot?

149
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,380
Supervisor Gu is very experienced

150
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,620
in managing people.

151
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,820
But I don't know how well

152
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,930
he can manage things on the construction site.

153
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,140
What exactly am I responsible for?

154
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,260
You just need to cooperate with the recycling company

155
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,100
and complete the recycling and transportation

156
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,060
in the north district.

157
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,700
Oh right,

158
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,940
we need to ensure the cleanliness and regulations of this area.

159
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,580
The construction site is dirty and messy.

160
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,700
It's better not to dress so formally.

161
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,740
It's inconvenient.

162
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,810
I see, Supervisor Zhang.

163
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,420
Mr. Lin,

164
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,500
how much waste do we produce in the North zone every day?

165
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,380
There's more in the North zone.

166
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,940
There are five or six tons a day.

167
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,780
The people from the recycling company

168
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,340
come every other day.

169
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,220
We have to pick out the garbage before recycling.

170
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,180
And it's a large amount.

171
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,860
Why didn't you divide them before sending them over?

172
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,740
It can avoid waste

173
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,260
and also save our time.

174
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,020
It's good enough that they can send it here.

175
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,220
We have to do this ourselves.

176
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,540
Son.

177
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,780
Mom, why are you here?

178
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,820
You haven't recovered yet.

179
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,420
How can you be picking up garbage here?

180
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,700
Let's go home.

181
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,420
Mom, it's okay. This is my job.

182
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,020
Look at you.

183
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,220
Even if you're not Mr. Gu now,

184
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,780
you're still a top student from a prestigious school.

185
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,660
How can you be picking up garbage here?

186
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,140
This Su Juan is horrible.

187
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,940
He must have done it on purpose.

188
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,220
Let's go find him.

189
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,380
Mom, calm down.

190
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,140
I've been an executive since I graduated.

191
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,140
Coming down here this time

192
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,020
is a good learning opportunity.

193
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,340
Look at the sun.

194
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,540
It's so messy and dirty. I...

195
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,500
Supervisor Gu, someone from the recycling company is here.

196
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,300
Okay.

197
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,540
Mom, I have to go to work.

198
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,220
It's too messy here.

199
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,740
Don't come here again.

200
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,490
Don't worry about me.

201
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,820
He has changed a lot.

202
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,250
It's all for you.

203
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm the one who should be sorry towards him.

204
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,460
I always hoped

205
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,420
Gu Yi could find someone of the same social status.

206
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,940
Unexpectedly,

207
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,780
he would lose out because of love.

208
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,660
Qiao Jing.

209
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,930
I can't stop him from liking you.

210
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,340
Now I can only hope

211
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,180
his efforts can be rewarded.

212
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,740
That the sincerity he gives

213
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,060
can receive sincerity too.

214
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,340
Let me help you.

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,700
Y-you're wearing it.

216
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,060
Does it look good?

217
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,860
Do you know what it means to wear it?

218
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,860
Yes.

219
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,420
After you wear it,

220
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,890
you're not allowed to take it off.

221
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,220
I don't want to take it off any way.

222
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,820
You worked hard.

223
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,700
Guys, it's time.

224
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,780
Let's go and eat.

225
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,420
Let's go eat.

226
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,900
Supervisor Gu, let's go eat.

227
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,300
You go first. I'll take a rest.

228
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,920
Okay.

229
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,690
I'm hungry.

230
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,620
Juan.

231
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,820
No, no, Mr. Su.

232
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,420
The construction site is so messy and it’s noon.

233
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,900
Why are you here in person?

234
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,620
Let's go and eat.

235
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,020
It's okay.

236
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,900
I just stopped by.

237
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,940
The progress isn't getting delayed, right?

238
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,740
Yes. Don't worry.

239
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,460
We're fast.

240
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,540
Are you adjusted to your work?

241
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,580
What kind of attitude is that?

242
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,540
There's a huge gap.

243
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,340
It's normal to have resentment.

244
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,220
I didn't treat him badly

245
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,330
when he's on the construction site.

246
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,980
Who put the brick here?

247
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,820
Supervisor Gu.

248
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,700
According to the regulations,

249
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,780
we should separate broken glass from other garbage.

250
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,980
Why are the glass waste and bricks

251
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
still together?

252
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,260
I didn't know there was such a regulation.

253
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,660
The notice has been issued.

254
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,820
You don't know?

255
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,860
It's your negligence if you don't.

256
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,820
I think we still have time to deal with it.

257
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,090
I'll ask the workers to clean it up.

258
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,820
No need.

259
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,500
You're in charge of this area.

260
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,860
You take care of it.

261
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,700
You have to clean it up before work this afternoon.

262
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,420
Mr. Gu, let me help you.

263
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,420
Secretary Yang,

264
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,940
I'm training him.

265
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,620
If you help him,

266
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,900
he won't learn this lesson

267
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,100
and will make the same mistake again.

268
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,700
Yang Yang,

269
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,020
if you get covered in dust,

270
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,580
how are you going to the meeting with me later?

271
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,940
Eat slowly.

272
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,420
I thought

273
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,099
you're not used to this street food.

274
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,020
I never came to a place like this before.

275
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,140
But now I realize

276
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,420
places like this

277
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,940
is as good as a five-star restaurant.

278
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,140
Really?

279
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,180
Thank you, honey.

280
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,660
What are you talking about? We haven't even got our marriage certificate.

281
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,620
As long as you agree,

282
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,340
we can get the marriage certificate right away.

283
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,260
Stop talking nonsense. Just eat.

284
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,460
Aren't you hungry?

285
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,620
Let me try yours.

286
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,220
It's the same.

287
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,900
The one in your bowl is different.

288
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,940
They want us to move all these waste in the day?

289
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,260
The waste disposal time is usually at night.

290
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,940
If we have to move it now, do they want us to move it with our bare hands?

291
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,660
What's wrong?

292
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,220
Supervisor. Gu.

293
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,860
Supervisor. Gu.

294
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,860
The higher-ups have issued a notice

295
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,140
to finish moving everything  in the daytime.

296
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,420
I had no choice.

297
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Do we have to finish all these garbage today?

298
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,580
The garbage has been piled up here for a day.

299
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,180
Supervisor Zhang asked us to finish it today.

300
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,460
But the garbage truck isn't moving out of the way.

301
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,660
Leave it to me.

302
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,540
Mr. Zheng.

303
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,660
What is it?

304
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,260
The garbage over there has been piled up all day

305
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,860
and haven't been taken away.

306
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,660
Can you help us

307
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,580
transport some first?

308
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,860
Mr. Zheng? Mr. Zheng?

309
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,700
There are rules on the road.

310
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,140
Large trucks can only leave at 10 p.m.

311
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,780
Let's talk about it tonight.

312
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,860
Is there any small-sized truck that can go on the road here?

313
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,890
Mr. Zheng? Mr. Zheng!

314
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,460
Mr. Zheng.

315
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,740
Supervisor Gu.

316
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,620
The waste for today is also coming.

317
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,300
We have to get rid of these quickly.

318
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,700
We can't send them out with a large truck.

319
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,660
We can only use a small truck first.

320
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,780
Any bit counts.

321
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,620
It's slow, but it's better than nothing.

322
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,220
Supervisor Gu, we can go now.

323
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:58,580
Okay.

324
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,060
Come on.

325
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,100
You must be tired. Have some.

326
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,140
You worked hard.

327
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,940
You worked hard.

328
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,060
Everyone worked hard.

329
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,260
Is it Supervisor Gu?

330
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,780
Come on.

331
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,020
-Supervisor Gu, come on.
-Supervisor Gu.

332
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,660
Sit.

333
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,620
Supervisor Gu,

334
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,610
I think we're almost done.

335
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,380
The rest can go with the big truck in a bit.

336
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,860
There are about two truck's worth left.

337
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,260
Yes, Supervisor Gu.

338
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,540
It's been a long day.

339
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,650
If it weren't for you,

340
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,660
we couldn't have done it today, right?

341
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,820
Yes.

342
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,100
Well, here's a toast to you.

343
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,260
Here, I'll drink up first.

344
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,380
Drinking this after work

345
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,260
feels so good.

346
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,260
Are you not used to it, Supervisor Gu?

347
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,860
No, I don't usually drink.

348
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,220
This costs more than ten yuan a bottle.

349
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,100
Usually we can't bear to drink this.

350
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,700
If we want to drink something, we just dilute it.

351
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,340
I've been building houses for others for the first half of my life.

352
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,660
I also want to save some money to build a house for myself.

353
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,580
Come, let's celebrate your new home in advance.

354
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,180
Okay.

355
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,700
Cheers.

356
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,460
Okay. Come on.

357
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,450
A toast to Qiang.

358
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,860
Come on.

359
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,380
Supervisor Gu, I have work to do.

360
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,780
I'll drink water instead of wine.

361
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,100
My daughter. She's calling me.

362
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,940
Let me answer this.

363
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,180
Hello?

364
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,820
Dad, I got first place in the exam.

365
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,700
You got first place again?

366
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,140
Amazing.

367
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
Dad, when are you coming back?

368
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,580
I miss you so much.

369
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,100
I miss you too.

370
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,860
I still have work to do.

371
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,740
When the project is done,

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,340
Always follow the rules and regulations.

558
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,740
Remember, safety first.

559
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,540
Safety

560
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,220
comes first in a construction site.

561
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,140
How could this happen?

562
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,100
I'm sorry, Dad.

563
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,820
It's useless to apologize to me.

564
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,100
Apologize to the patient and family.

565
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,250
We'll comfort them.

566
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,260
Apologies and compensation are all necessary.

567
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,580
It was Gu Yi who caused the trouble again.

568
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,650
I’ve suspended him.

569
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,860
But we have to wait

570
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,620
till the workers wake up.

571
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,620
When did Gu Yi become so careless?

572
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,620
Things change quickly on a construction site.

573
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,380
It's normal to be careless.

574
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,380
I don't want

575
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,540
this kind of thing to happen again.

576
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,860
Understood.
