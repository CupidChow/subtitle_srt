[Episode 4]

4
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,020
I brought you supper.

5
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,260
Are you injured?

6
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,660
I accidentally scratched it. It's no big deal.

7
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,180
Come on, I'll apply the medicine for you.

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,780
Okay.

9
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,980
You know what?

10
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,580
I learned Sanda for a period when I was a kid.

11
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,220
I'm familiar with this kind of injury.

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,140
I knew it.

13
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,980
I can't hide anything from you.

14
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,820
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,979
Don't worry. I didn't suffer losses.

16
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,700
It was a pity that I didn't punch him more

17
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,130
to avenge you.

18
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,740
Why did you help me?

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,500
Because I want to have an ordinary and cosy home.

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,900
My dream wife

21
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,420
will have the same thoughts as mine.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,020
We can rely on each other in life.

23
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,780
We can smile together when we are delighted.

24
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,490
When we are exhausted,

25
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,979
we will hug each other.

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,700
And you,

27
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,100
have concretized my dream.

28
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,980
That's because you don't know me well enough yet.

29
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,340
I'm totally different from the person you imagined.

30
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,700
It's not too late to start knowing you now.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,620
Hello.

32
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,500
Mr. Bai, something happened.

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,460
Please come back quickly.

34
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,500
Don't worry. I'm going back now.

35
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
I have to go back for a while.

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,540
Something came up at work.

37
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,900
Drive safe.

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,540
Okay.

39
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,100
You shouldn't have stopped me.

40
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,180
I only gave him one punch.

41
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,700
That'd let him off lightly.

42
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,540
Don't make a scene outside there.

43
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,180
How is it going?

44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,180
I did as you said.

45
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,060
But after all, he's Yun's cousin.

46
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,220
Will the Bai family be irritated

47
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,660
with you dealing with him like this?

48
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,900
If the Bai family really cared about him,

49
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,780
would he still accomplish nothing

50
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,660
after so many years?

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,900
Aren't you afraid that Qiao Jing will find out?

52
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,180
I intentionally want her to know.

53
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,020
You are really something.

54
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,380
This place is so beautiful.

55
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,420
No wonder you wanted to move out in such a hurry.

56
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,900
What brings you here today?

57
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,820
Aren't you busy with the renovation?

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,980
Don't mention it.

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,420
I hired a design agency.

60
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,980
I think they've been having some problems lately.

61
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,860
Every project has someone competing with them.

62
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,940
They've been quite hectic recently.

63
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,220
So serious?

64
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,380
Yes.

65
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,300
It's the company that won the gold medal for architecture

66
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,780
named Bamboo Forest Shu.

67
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,860
I don't know if they offended someone

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,930
after becoming famous.

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,380
Bamboo Forest Shu...

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,300
Bai Yan?

71
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,100
Yeah, do you know him?

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
You came later than I thought.

73
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,180
You did those to Bai Yan, didn't you?

74
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,659
I was just competing with him for business as usual.

75
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,820
Is there a problem?

76
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,460
He's innocent.

77
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,980
Why do you get him involved?

78
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,820
He provoked me first.

79
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,340
How is he innocent?

80
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,460
He asked for it.

81
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,180
What do you want?

82
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,620
It's simple.

83
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,700
Come back to me.

84
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,860
It was my fault back then.

85
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,250
But I promise

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,660
I will treat you nicely in the future.

87
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,770
You're getting married.

88
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,140
How can you treat me nicely?

89
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,620
Does it matter?

90
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,380
Don't be so stubborn.

91
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,940
Also, I won't get married so soon.

92
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,100
Before that,

93
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,210
you have to come back to me.

94
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,180
Okay.

95
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,340
As long as you stop harassing Bai Yan.

96
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,540
You agreed without hesitation

97
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,900
for the sake of him.

98
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,500
I'm a man of my word.

99
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,970
I hope you are too.

100
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,180
Mr. Bai, good news.

101
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,020
Anxia withdrew from the Guanlan project.

102
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,780
Why?

103
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,940
Didn't they still insist yesterday?

104
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,420
Could it be something hiding behind

105
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,180
what they did today?

106
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,180
I don't think so.

107
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,580
I asked the person in charge.

108
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,780
Anxia really withdrew from the project.

109
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,980
And they won't compete

110
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,380
with us for other projects anymore.

111
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,340
It's a little odd,

112
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,740
but not a bad thing.

113
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,580
Keep an eye on it for me.

114
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,580
Okay, Mr. Bai.

115
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,500
Why are you here?

116
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,780
I was going to find you.

117
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,180
No wonder Gu Yi suddenly pulled back.

118
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,180
You had compromised with him.

119
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,940
Why?

120
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,220
His dirty tricks

121
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,420
couldn't defeat me.

122
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,580
After some period, I would...

123
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,660
I know him very well.

124
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,020
Once he's determined,

125
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,180
he's very persistent.

126
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,060
It was not easy for you to leave him.

127
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,020
Are you going to fall by the wayside?

128
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,780
I've thought it through these two days.

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,580
To deal with him, running away is not a solution.

130
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,420
I'll settle it with him this time.

131
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,900
But you...

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
Don't worry.

133
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,700
I know what I'm doing.

134
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,620
Thank you for everything you did for me during this period.

135
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,020
If you need anything else,

136
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,340
feel free to contact me.

137
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,820
Okay.

138
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,740
Have you solved everything with Bai Yan?

139
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,420
Don't worry.

140
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,100
No matter what happened between you and him,

141
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,500
I can simply overlook it.

142
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,140
But from now on,

143
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
I don't want to hear his name again.

144
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,980
You're going to be a family soon.

145
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,700
Can you manage to avoid him?

146
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,700
Don't make trouble. I don't want to argue with you.

147
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,060
Follow me.

148
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,260
Haven't you always wanted to watch this movie?

149
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,100
I'll watch it together with you.

150
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,060
I watched it long ago.

151
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,900
Then watch it with me.

152
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,170
Do you want to go back to the company?

153
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,220
I want to rest for a while.

154
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,820
Okay.

155
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,500
I'll find you a housekeeper.

156
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,300
So you don't have to do the house chores

157
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,580
in the future.

158
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,460
You want someone to monitor me?

159
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,300
I want to be good to you.

160
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,220
Don't misunderstand me.

161
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,500
Gu Yi,

162
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,180
you planned to marry Bai Yun

163
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,980
from the beginning, right?

164
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,900
You said you wanted to tell me something on your birthday.

165
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,440
You just wanted to make it clear to me.

166
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,220
But you didn't expect that

167
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,860
I wanted to break up with you before you did.

168
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,020
So you, an arrogant, spoilt son of a rich family,

169
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,930
were displeased.

170
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,180
You felt that you were disobeyed.

171
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,340
After all,

172
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,540
you're just not used to it

173
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,500
and haven't been accustomed to it.

174
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,650
Don't pretend like you are that spoony.

175
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,540
Are you crazy?

176
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,100
I promised to come back

177
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,700
but I didn't agree to do such a thing with you.

178
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,980
Mr. Gu, are you looking for me?

179
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,380
Go buy something for me.

180
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,300
You are...

181
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,220
Ms. Qiao.

182
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,020
Mr. Gu hired me to take care of you.

183
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,260
Ms. Qiao, it's time to eat.

184
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,700
Sorry, I have an appointment.

185
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,580
So I won't eat at home.

186
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,100
What do you think? Do I look good in this?

187
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,620
Every piece looks good on you.

188
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,300
Is Yi that busy?

189
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,620
We're getting engaged soon.

190
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,890
He doesn't even have time to accompany me to try on the wedding dress.

191
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,340
He has a lot to do in the company.

192
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,340
Besides, he doesn't have better taste than me.

193
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,660
Only you know how to coax me.

194
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,020
You used to be a crybaby.

195
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,380
But now you're getting married.

196
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,220
When will you get yourself a wife?

197
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,410
What's so good about getting married?

198
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,020
I still want to be free for another two years.

199
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
This one looks good.

200
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,420
I still think it looks better.

201
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,500
What do you think?

202
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,140
This one?

203
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,580
How about this one?

204
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,700
This one?

205
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,140
Sese.

206
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,140
Ms. Bai.

207
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,700
What a coincidence.

208
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,460
Mr. Zhou.

209
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,020
Are you shopping at this hour?

210
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,940
I am doing it for work.

211
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,500
Mr. Gu asked me to buy it.

212
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,620
You have such a good taste.

213
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,010
Can you give me some advice?

214
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,820
Sure.

215
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,420
Pick this.

216
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,940
This is my favourite in this series.

217
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,410
The design is so unique that it won't go wrong if you pick it.

218
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,020
Your pick must also be Mr. Gu's favourite.

219
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,660
That's it. Pack it up for me.

220
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,820
Okay.

221
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,780
Please pay the bill over here.

222
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,780
Okay.

223
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,380
It costs 25,000 yuan in total.

224
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,100
Okay. Here you are.

225
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,620
Okay.

226
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,860
Let's go.

227
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Are you not buying anymore?

228
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,860
Didn't you say you lack a necklace to match the dress?

229
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,460
I already bought it.

230
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,260
Whom else can Yi give the necklace to if not me?

231
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,020
What is this?

232
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,910
This is for you. Do you like it?

233
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,460
It's pretty.

234
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,140
Let me put it on you.

235
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,540
Thank you.

236
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,040
Just a thank you?

237
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,140
I'll bring you lunch at noon tomorrow.

238
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
That sounds more reasonable.

239
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,160
[Anxia Group]

240
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,620
Let's go.

241
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,500
Let's go.

242
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,860
My back hurts.

243
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,700
Let's go.

244
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,740
It's Gang's treat today. What should we eat?

245
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,460
Something simple.

246
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,460
I'm on a diet.

247
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,820
Let's go.

248
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I'm going to eat the veggies only.

249
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,340
On a diet again?

250
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,260
Yes, eat some veggies.

251
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
It's already at this hour.

252
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,420
She should be arriving soon.

253
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,980
Come in.

254
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,540
Why are you here?

255
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,140
I came to give you a love lunch.

256
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,740
I made this myself.

257
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,060
No need, I have no appetite.

258
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,300
What's wrong?

259
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,660
Are you feeling unwell?

260
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,980
I'm fine.

261
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,660
An important guest is coming later.

262
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,580
Go back first.

263
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,860
Keep up the good work then.

264
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,370
Why is the necklace on your neck?

265
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,940
Why can't it be?

266
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,140
Stop it.

267
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,580
I fried two more eggs for you.

268
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,180
Who wants to eat your food?

269
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,140
Get lost!

270
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,020
Qiao Jing.

271
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,780
Why would she have the necklace?

272
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,740
Do you two still keep in touch?

273
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,420
I wanted to give her the necklace from the very beginning.

274
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,500
Is there a problem?

275
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,380
We're getting engaged.

276
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,900
We both know

277
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,220
the marriage is what our parents want,

278
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,540
not me.

279
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,140
I don't know why she came today.

280
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,620
It's okay. I don't care.

281
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,580
This will never happen again.

282
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,420
Do you still want to leave?

283
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,780
Can I leave?

284
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,900
That's right.

285
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,780
Wherever you go,

286
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,380
I will manage to find you.

287
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,700
Stop drinking.

288
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,260
Gu Yi is going to engage with me,

289
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,260
but why is he still thinking about Qiao Jing?

290
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,780
If so, are you still going to get engaged?

291
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,380
Why not?

292
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,660
Gu Yi is mine.

293
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,740
He has someone else in his heart.

294
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Aunt Fang said

295
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,060
if he got married,

296
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,780
he'd know his place.

297
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,780
He will.

298
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,180
You know.

299
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,020
I only see Bai Yun as my sister.

300
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,850
You're the only one I want.

301
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,380
Marriage is not a deal.

302
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,700
All right, you should go now.

303
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,820
Wait for me.

304
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,060
Ms. Qiao.

305
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,740
Is something bothering you?

306
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,060
You should be glad today.

307
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,580
Nothing.

308
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,740
I don't care what you did before,

309
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,300
but you must stop doing it after your engagement.

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,090
[Sorry, the phone you're calling is powered off.]

313
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:30,660
Stop the car.

314
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,060
Stop it!

315
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,530
I said stop! Are you deaf?

316
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,820
Stop it!

317
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,660
It's too late. She's gone.

318
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,300
I sent her away.

319
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Gu Yi has been watching me closely.

320
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,020
I can only meet with you

321

when delivering food to him.

322
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,980
Last time you said that if I left him,

323
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,740
you'd fulfil one of my wishes.

324
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,300
Does it still count?

325
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,460
Of course. What do you want?

326
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,980
Money? How much?

327
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,900
No, I need you to help me leave Gu Yi.

328
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,980
If you promise he won't pester me anymore,

329
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,660
I promise I'll leave Nancheng forever.

330
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,340
Mum, how can you decide on your own?

331
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,660
Because I'm your mother.

332
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,180
Gu Yi, stop hesitating.

333
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,740
Think carefully.

Which woman

335
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,380
is more important to you?

336
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,180
You are the heir of Anxia.

337
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,980

You are so nice to me.

377
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,930
Jing worked alone in Nancheng.

378
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,080
She couldn't come home even once in a year.

379
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,670
It's good to quit this time.

380
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,430
That's right.

381
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,240
She didn't have even two days off in a year.

382
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,090
It also held her up in getting married.

383
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,780
Jing,

384
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,550
are you in a relationship with someone?

385
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,770
Do you have a boyfriend?

386
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,080
No.

387
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,600
Mum, what do you mean by having a boyfriend?

388
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,410
Jing.

389
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,340
Do you still remember

390
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,890
that Li living upstairs

391
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,580
who always played with you when you were a kid?

392
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,630
Yes.

393
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,160
He's very successful now.

394
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,020
He has a car and a house.

395
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,740
His savings are all...

396
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,000
Enough.

397
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,430
The financial status is secondary.

398
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,610
Most importantly, they have to get along well.

399
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,250
Why isn't financial status important?

400
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,010
What else is important then?

401
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,990
If he doesn't have money, our daughter will suffer hunger with him.

402
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,740
Mum.

403
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,620
You have no guts at all.

404
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,350
I just want to rest for the time being.

405
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,740
We'll talk about the rest later.

406
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,880
Okay.

407
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,030
Let her eat first.

408
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,010
Eat up.

409
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,850
Here, have another one.

410
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,600
Thank you, sister.

411
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,160
It's delicious.

412
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,520
Eat more.

413
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,740
All you know is eating.

414
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,210
Take a good rest since you're back.

415
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,730
It's all over.

416
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:43,190
♫Hold your breath and lower your head♫

417
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,330
♫The moonlight of the night slips through the window♫

418
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,410
Mr. Gu, my name is Qiao Jing.

419
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,400
♫I'm feeling weak, hold my hand♫

420
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,330
Mr. Gu, it's time for taking your medicine.

421
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,490
♫I can't control my feelings♫

422
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:11,770
♫The air suddenly becomes thin♫

423
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:19,010
♫Memories are separated♫

424
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,560
♫The air suffocated me♫

425
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,600
♫I cross my arms before my chest♫

426
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,920
♫Tears can't stop falling♫

427
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,780
♫Maybe it's the end♫

428
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,750
♫I get up♫

429
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,490
♫Looking at the end at a distance, the blocked road♫

430
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,520
♫Where should I go?♫

431
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,020
♫The air freezes when I turn around♫

432
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,010
♫The wilted flower♫

433
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,730
♫When it finally falls and freezes♫

434
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,460
♫I still remember♫

435
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,160
♫You said♫

436
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,420
Why are you here?

437
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,390
What? Don't you welcome me?

438
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,050
Jing, who is here?

439
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,160
He is Bai Yan, my friend.

440
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:18,970
Hello, aunt.

441
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,200
I came uninvited.

442
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,990
Please excuse me for my rudeness.

443
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,050
This is a little something from me.

444
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,280
You're too courteous.

445
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,040
It'd be fine even if you came bare-handed.

446
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,850
Why did you bring so many gifts instead?

447
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,360
Come in. Have a seat.

448
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,700
Have you had your breakfast?

449
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,250
Not yet.

450
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,090
Come in quickly.

451
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,390
Let's have breakfast together. Come on.

452
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,200
Thank you.

453
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,140
He's tall and handsome.

454
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,710
With that good look,

455
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,020
he's indeed a perfect match for Jing.

456
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,870
Shh.

457
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,600
Jing said they were just friends.

458
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,990
Don't overthink it.

459
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,210
Why would he come if he were only an ordinary friend?

460
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,650
-Open your eyes wide and look at them.
-Shh.

461
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
He's in no way ordinary.

462
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,590
Thank you.

463
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,700
Look how sweet he is.

464
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,240
Close it.

465
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,220
I learned about you and Gu Yi.

466
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,600
I was a little worried.

467
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,570
So I came to visit you.

468
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,510
How do you know where I live?

469
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,620
When you signed the lease agreement,

470
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,130
I got your basic information.

471
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,310
Qiao Zhi, come over here.

472
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,120
This is my brother, Qiao Zhi.

473
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,050
Greet the guest.

474
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,010
Hello, uncle.

475
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,460
Call him brother.

476
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,860
You're so tall. Which grade are you in?

477
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,250
I'll be in the fifth grade soon.

478
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,390
That's the time for laying a solid foundation.

479
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,990
I have a friend who runs a tutoring agency.

480
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,880
Do you want some tutoring books?

481
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,990
I finished my homework with a great effort.

482
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,210
Yet you still want me to do more?

483
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,630
Can you please let me rest a while, uncle?

484
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,160
Where are you going?

485
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,600
To poop.

486
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,340
Why are you

487
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,350
behaving so rudely?

488
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,210
Bai, don't mind him.

489
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,720
He's cute.

490
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,940
So-so.

491
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,090
Bai, what do you do?

492
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,860
I'm an architect.

493
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,090
It's good to be an architect.

494
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,390
You have a bright future.

495
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,690
What about your parents?

496
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,740
What do they do?

497
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,870
Where is your hometown?

498
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,880
Where does your house property locate at?

499
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,280
Mum, are you checking about his household registration details?

500
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,670
There's no big deal to ask.

501
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,900
Honey, look at the time.

502
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,240
Are we still going to open the shop?

503
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,960
Oh, how could I forget that?

504
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,390
How about...

505
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,830
Oh, we haven't picked up the veggies yet. Go, Qiao.

506
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,960
I can't.

507
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,190
I have to prepare the stew. I don't have enough time to do so.

508
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,690
Then...

509
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,370
I am unoccupied. I'll go.

510
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,420
No way.

511
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,940
You're our guest. We can't trouble you.

512
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,330
It's my pleasure.

513
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,429
Look, Jing.

514
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,530
Bai doesn't know the way well.

515
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,040
Go with him.

516
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,960
You two go together.

517
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,070
-Okay. Let's go. Help me with something.
-Fine.

518
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,719
Let's go.

519
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,940
Is this the solution you meant,

520
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,420
leaving Gu Yi and hiding in your hometown?

521
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,280
I wanted to come back to visit my parents from the very start.

522
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,440
Will you go back again?

523
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,840
Anyway,

524
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,480
I'll keep that guesthouse for you.

525
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,420
You can come back anytime.

526
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,470
Thank you.

527
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,970
You tried so hard to leave me

528
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,780
just for this man?

529
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,510
Didn't you get engaged?

530
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,190
I broke off the engagement.

531
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,220
Do you know what you are doing?

532
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,220
I know.

533
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,070
I've thought it through.

534
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,890
Didn't you want me to devote myself to you?

535
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,520
Fine, I'll break off the engagement for you.

536
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,570
Are you satisfied now?

537
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,350
For me?

538
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,820
Because of me?

539
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,390
I've given in to you several times.

540
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,390
What else do you want?

541
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,030
I know you like me

542
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,790
and you love me.

543
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,800
You found this man just to piss me off.

544
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,110
Gu Yi.

545
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,710
Can you stop being so full of yourself?

546
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,100
Let's go.
