00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,420
Ms. Qiao.

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,700
Have you found out anything about the person I asked you to investigate?

6
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,420
This person is very strange.

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,690
We've been looking for him for months, but we still haven't found him.

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,100
Why don't you collect more clues?

9
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,890
This is not a simple matter.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,020
In the past, we only found out that

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,340
maybe Mr. Gu has

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,500
Mr. Su's heart.

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,500
But if you want to dig deeper,

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,100
there're no more clues.

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,539
Okay, got it.

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,700
Sister, where is Yi?

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,380
I want to treat him to my favorite ice cream.

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,580
He left.

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,300
What? He left?

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,420
Why didn't you tell me?

21
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,220
He has something urgent to do.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,100
Qiao Zhi, have you finished your homework?

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,300
No.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,539
Stop dawdling. Go and do it now.

25
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,740
Look at your dear son.

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
He made such a scene

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,740
that he has disgraced the entire Gu family!

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,380
What's the use of yelling at me?

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,970
If you're so capable, come back and take care of your son yourself!

30
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,180
You still have the audacity to come back?

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,380
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,100
Now, the whole Nancheng is laughing at us.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,860
What should I tell the Bai family?

34
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,340
I'm talking to you.

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,540
I sent someone to find you,

36
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,740
but you ignored it.

37
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,940
You're back now.

38
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,940
You don't want your family and company anymore, do you?

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,370
I'm talking to you! Are you mute?

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,860
Mom.

41
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,570
I'll handle the aftermath.

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,220
Handle it?

43
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,740
How will you handle it?

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,300
Are you going to keep messing around with that Qiao Jing—

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,180
Don't mention her to me!

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,620
Mom.

47
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,829
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,900
The other party involved in the car accident was Su Juan.

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,660
The heart you received in your heart transplant

50
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,740
was his heart.

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,060
What you thought was just a coincidence...

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,460
was actually meticulously planned by others.

55

is actually his.

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,700

58
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,460
What's wrong with you so early in the morning?

59
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,820
I've been thinking about it all night but I'm still unclear.

60
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,420
About what?

61
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,100
Bai is just a friend.

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,700
Yes.

63
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,180
Gu is just a colleague.

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,980
Yes.

65
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,820
Doesn't she have anyone special?

66
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,020
Okay. Alright.

67
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,460

She's quite old already.

72
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,659
She's quite old already!

73
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,980
In a few years, she'll be...

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,780
She'll be...

75
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,060
in t-t-the a-a-advanced maternal age!

76
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,900
She'll no longer be

77
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,060
a woman of c-c-childbearing age!

78
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,460
Su Juan has been gone for so many years.

79
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,420
She must be miserable.

80
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,580
I'm just hoping that she'd meet a guy

81
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,460
and date happily,

82
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,180
so that she can get over that.

83
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,620
You're right.

84
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,580
But it's useless for us to hope for her.

85
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,820
She needs to figure it out herself.

86
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,180
Let's not interfere too much

87
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,900
and trust her.

88
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,060
Fine.

89
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,940
And you,

90
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,100
don't worry too much for no reason.

91
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,300
Look at this...

92
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,580
Mom, what are we having for breakfast?

93
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,659
Your mom is chopping stuff

94
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,180
to make the marinated minced meat for noodles.

95
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,580
That's my favorite.

96
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,780
Put more chilies.

97
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,820
Sure. Put more chilies.

98
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,860
Chop lightly, please.

99
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,980
Are you trying to drink yourself to death?

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
People out of the loop might think

101
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,730
you were the one who got rejected.

102
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,460
Let me tell you, what you did this time was really foul.

103
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,610
You should have made it clear earlier if you didn't want to get engaged.

104
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,340
How could you run away on the day of engagement?

105

What do you want Yun to do?

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
I'll make it up to her.

107
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,860
Make it up to her? How?

108
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,820
She's still waiting for you to go back to her!

109
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,340
You abandoned everything to look for Qiao Jing.

110
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,660
But in the end?

111
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,740
You still couldn't make her stay.

112
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,980
So what?

113
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,460
She really thinks highly of herself.

114
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,620
Who does she think she is?

115
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,380
Look.

116
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,730
Since you're all here, let's drink together.

117
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,940
Mr. Gu.

118
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Don't drink so fast. You'll get drunk easily.

119
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,780

125
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,860
Can you let go of me first?

126
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,780
Let me ask you a question.

127
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,780
Do you like me?

128
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,700
Say something!

129
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,300
Y-Yes, I like you.

130
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,100
How much do you like me?

131
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,060
I've liked you since the first time I saw you.

132
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,410
Because I like you,

133
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,900
so I came to you.

134
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,980
You're lying.

135
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,860
You got close to me just for Su Juan!

136
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
Why is it you?

137
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,090
Shouldn't it be me?

138
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,140
You still owe me an explanation.

139
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,260
Since you wouldn't come to me,

140
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,340
I can only go to you and ask for it myself.

141
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Sorry, I've been busy lately.

142
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,540
What have you been busy with?

143
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,380
Busy looking for Qiao Jing?

144
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,340
You made a joke out of me for her sake.

145
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,980
Gu Yi, how have I wronged you?

146
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,340
I was the one who'd wronged you.

147
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,860
How do you want me to make it up to you?

148
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,980
As long as it's within my capabilities,

149
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
I'll do it.

150
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,140
I want you to marry me.

151
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,410

[Qiao's Skewer Restaurant]

153
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,260
Gu Yi is indeed unpredictable.

154
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,660
He's so stubborn even with his engagement.

155
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,020
Did he come look for you?

156
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,060
But he has gone back already.

157
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
He really came?

158
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
What did he want?

159
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,820
Was he trying to reconciliate with you?

160
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,900
What was there to reconciliate?

161
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,020
Our relationship was a mistake from the beginning.

162
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,540
Could he have really fallen in love with you?

163
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,900
No way.

164
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,180
He's just like that because my sudden departure

165
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,900
goes against his desire for control.

166
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,660
In the past, you were only looking for Gu Yi

167
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,780
because you wanted to investigate about Su Juan.

168
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,420
I didn't expect you two to become like this.

169
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,340
So you plan to keep staying at home

170
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
and not go back to Nancheng?

171
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,780
My assistant has gone home to visit family,

172
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,900

Why don't you come help me?

174

You'd have something to do,

175
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,380
so you won't think too much.

176
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,380
I don't feel like going back for now.

177
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,860
Fine.

178
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,580

Zhou Rui told me something happened to him and got me here,

270
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,340

282
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,660

Do you know how dangerous it was?

356
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,620
Because you haven't been eating well recently,

00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,820
and your immunity is poor,
