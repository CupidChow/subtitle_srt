Let's welcome the new chairman, Su Juan, to the stage!

[Inauguration ceremony of the new Chairman, Su Juan]

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,300
Dear leaders of Anxia,

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,580
in recent times,

8
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,340
many things have happened within the group.

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,060
But, we must not stop

10
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,380
in our steps because of this.

11
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,539
We must not let President Gu down.

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,010
We have to work harder.

13
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,060
To err on the safe side,

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,580
I'll record a video as proof.

15
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,340
My properties and savings

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,420
jointly belong to me and my spouse, Fang Pei.

17
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,100
My share

18
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,340
will be divided equally among my other family members.

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,780
As for the 80% stake in Anxia,

20
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,740
Gu Yi inherits 50%,

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,900
Su Juan inherits 10%,

22
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,100
Gu Yu inherits 10%,

23
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,420
and Gu Ying inherits 10%.

24
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,820
Gu Yi,

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,539
I'll leave the company to you.

26
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,940
As the Chairman,

27
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,660
I hope you can lead the company well.

28
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,180
As a father...

29
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,980
I may not have been a good father.

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,460
All these years,

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,579
you have always been my pride.

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,620
Watching you lead the company to become increasingly better,

33
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,620
I'm very proud,

34
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,900
but also very scared.

35
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,140
You've been doing well along the way.

36
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm afraid you have yet to learn how to deal with failure,

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,260
and I don't have time to teach you slowly.

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,900
So I left you at the construction site,

39
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,220
because I wanted to polish you.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,540
Luckily, you didn't let me down.

41
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,060
During that period of time,

42
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,980
you didn't kick a fuss or had any complains.

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,220
Instead, you found a job you like.

44
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,300
I believe

45
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,380
you'll meet your own company soon.

46
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,579
You are a lot like me,

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,300
but you are also different from me.

48
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,579
You are a responsible man.

49
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,700
In this life,

50
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,540
I've let two people down.

51
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
One is your mother,

52
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,450
and the other is Su Nian.

53
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,980
Su Juan,

54
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,260
I know you've been blaming me.

55
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,580
I'm sorry to you and your mother.

56
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,540
I am willing to use everything to make it up to you.

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,180
This company is a work of many people.

58
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,100
I hope you can assist Gu Yi

59
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,820
and manage the company together.

60
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,820
Su Juan!

61
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,700
I clearly cleaned everything up.

62
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,780
Where did you get the video?

63
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,020
You thought you had everything under control,

64
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,060
but you're too smart for your own good.

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,100
You went overboard.

66
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,140
Was it the painting?

67
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,820
Ms. Qiao,

68
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,380
what are you doing?

69
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,300
I know this is wrong,

70
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,820
and I am crossing the line.

71
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,300
But we need the truth.

72
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,700
Yang Yang, do you trust Mr. Gu?

73
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,220
Do you trust me?

74
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,180
This chip was hidden in the scroll of that painting.

75
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,620
The video left behind by Mr. Gu was inside.

76
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,900
At this point,

77
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,540
what else do you have to say?

78
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,020
Juan, what's going on?

79
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,380
Su Juan, you have let me down!

80
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,260
How dare you tamper with the will?

81
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,620
Why would I be afraid to?

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,980
Mr. Su.

83
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,500
Lawyer Zhao.

84
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,220
Thank you.

85
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,500
My father suddenly wanted to change his will today,

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,140
and he even asked you to bring the original copy here.

87
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,180
But he's been in a coma after taking the medicine,

88
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,820
and I don't know when he'll wake up.

89
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,970
It's fine.

90
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,820
Just call me again

91
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,340
whenever he needs it.

92
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,580
Sorry to trouble you, Lawyer Zhao.

93
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
You're welcome, Mr. Su.

94
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,020
Are you alright, Lawyer Zhao?

95
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,770
I'm fine.

96
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,180
Maybe I ate something wrong at lunch.

97
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,580
How could you throw up like this all of a sudden?

98
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,540
What exactly has the Gu family done to you?

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,380
How could you do such a thing?

100
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,060
Father felt sorry towards you,

101
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,020
and has been finding ways to make his mends.

102
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Even so,

103
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,540
he can't stop your wild ambition.

104
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
Every minute and every second that you're with him,

105
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,340
you have been scheming him.

106
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,380
Exactly who is scheming whom?

107
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,180
You have no right to stand here.

108
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
Get out of Anxia!

109
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,860
No matter how careful we were,

110
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,970
we were still a step short.

111
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,060
Gu Nan is really cunning.

112
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,940
Juan,

113
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,340
I really like this painting that you auctioned.

114
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,060
We're family.

115
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,140
This is something I should do.

116
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,540
Such good things must be kept well.

117
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,140
Put it away.

118
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,980
So what if I had changed the will in advance?

119
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,540
So what if I searched the safe?

120
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,980
No matter how hard I calculated his moves,

121
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,740
I just didn't expect that

122
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,660
he would tamper with the painting I gave him.

123
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,740
Juan.

124
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,460
So much for a good father-son relationship.

125
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,220
Fang Pei,

126
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,740
all these years,

127
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,860
I've always regretted

128
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,940
neglecting you

129
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,180
for the company

130
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,140
and for work.

131
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,980
I have also let Su Nian down.

132
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,020
You've been with me for so many years,

133
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,060
but I haven't seen you smile that many times.

134
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,820
Although we quarreled,

135
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,980
I know

136
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,420
you only have me

137
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,180
in your heart.

138
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,620
Thank you.

139
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,140
We're going back to Anxia tomorrow.

140
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,140
What are you going to do with the new company?

141
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I will continue to work on the new company.

142
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,300
After all, it's a link in Anxia's industrial chain.

143
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,460
My father is right.

144
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,180
All these years, under the protection of the Gu family,

145
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,580
I never had to suffer much,

146
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,220
or ever felt weary.

147
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,540
Besides, environmental protection

148
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,060
is a concept that many promote.

149
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,580
I believe the new company

150
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,380
will grow well with Anxia.

151
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,620
Okay, I'll be with you.

152
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,940
He used to be a sharp knife.

153
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,620
But, it's blunt now.

154
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,700
We can't leave the company to him.

155
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,660
Gu Yi is a blunt knife,

156
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,260
and I'm his sharpening stone.

157
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,270
[Anxia Group]

158
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,740
Chairman Gu.

159
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,500
Chairman Gu, I need you to take a look at the new project.

160
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,340
Hello, Chairman Gu.

161
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,460
Send it to my office later.

162
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,060
Okay.

163
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,460
A case has been filed

164
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,700
to investigate Su Juan for tampering the will.

165
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
As his accomplice,

166
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,260
Jiang Sheng will also be held accountable.

167
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,580
The results will be out soon.

168
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Su Juan will lose all of his rights to inherit.

169
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,180
With my return,

170
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,780
there will be some changes in the company's personnel.

171
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,780
Mr. Gu, what personnel changes?

172
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,090
I plan to set up an environmental company.

173
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,940
The Public Relations Department is short of a director,

174
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,380
and the Project Department is missing a person in charge.

175
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,660
I wonder if you guys have any self-nominations.

176
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,100
The salary may not be as much as Anxia's,

177
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,380
but there will be options and dividends.

178
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,180
Mr. Gu,

179
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,780
do you think that PR director

180
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,980
looks like me?

181
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,580
She looks exactly like you.

182
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,780
Mr. Gu, I have a question.

183
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,100
How many hours does the

184
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,420
person in charge of this project work a day?

185
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,460
What time does he get off work every day?

186
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,220
Are there any guarantees about

187
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,100
statutory holidays and having two days off a week?

188
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
And the most important thing is...

189
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,580
how are you calculating the bonus?

190
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,100
The Project Department is the core department of the company.

191
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,300
Times might be difficult

192
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,580
when the company is just starting out.

193
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,930
That's a deal.

194
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,500
From now on, I'll change my name to Tang Fendou.

195
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,060
Mr. Gu, what about me?

196
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,780
Do you have any other new positions over there?

197
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,170
No.

198
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,420
Wasn't it said just now?

199
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,220
There's just two. That's all.

200
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,220
But Anxia needs a

201
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,780
serious and responsible Chief Secretary

202
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,380
to assist the newly appointed CEO.

203
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,180
Newly appointed CEO?

204
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
The new company will take up most of my energy.

205
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,380
So I need someone

206
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,540
to help me with Anxia.

207
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,460
Therefore, I have asked my uncle Gu Yu

208
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,180
to be the new CEO of Anxia.

209
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,660
In the future, he will manage the company with me.

210
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,180
Congratulations, Yang. You got promoted.

211
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,460
It's not too much to ask for a treat, right?

212
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,410
Yes.

213
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,700
Yes, I will give you guys a treat.

214
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,660
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

215
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,700
Juan, we should go.

216
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,660
Juan?

217
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,340
Juan?

218
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,780
Mr. Gu, you're still here?

219
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm waiting for someone.

220
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,220
You must be waiting for Ms. Qiao.

221
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,460
Well then, we aren't going to stay and become a third wheel.

222
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,980
There are two minutes left. We shall leave first.

223
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,060
You guys go have a dinner together.

224
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,820
I will pick up the tab.

225
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,060
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

226
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,380
Let's go!

227
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,620
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Mr. Gu!

228
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,990
[Su Juan]

229
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,340
Hello?

230
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,740
Su Juan.

231
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,140
Gu Yi,

232
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,180
you have won.

233
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,859
When things have come to this point,

234
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,260
no one is a winner.

235
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,060
You have it all.

236
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,180
Of course you can say such nice things.

237
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,060
Even if Father gave you the company,

238
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,060
I will still maintain the same attitude.

239
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,980
You're his beloved son,

240
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,140
and I'm just your stepping stone.

241
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,700
How could he give me the company?

242
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,380
Dad has never taken sides with anyone.

243
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,090
He has always loved you.

244
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,580
It's just that you have taken too many wrong steps

245
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,420
out of your own selfishness.

246
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,540
That's why he's disappointed in you.

247
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:40,780
Gu Yi.

248
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,700
Where is he?

249
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,620
Didn't we agree to have dinner together tonight?

250
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,420
Mom, Su Juan asked to meet him on the rooftop.

251
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,900
Wait for me in the office.

252
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,340
If he loves me,

253
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,650
where was he when my mother was bedridden?

254
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,140
When your family reunited,

255
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,780
did he ever considered my mother and I?

256
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,340
You won the company

257
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,740
and Qiao Jing.

258
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,780
You won everything.

259
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,940
Why?

260
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,740
Why should I be the loser?

261
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,100
You asked for it.

262
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,060
You deceived everyone and disappointed Father,

263
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,580
and you let down Qiao Jing's expectations of you

264
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,540
and her feelings for you.

265
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,220
You used Zhou Rui, Bai Yun

266
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,620
and all the other innocent people.

267
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,980
Who are you to ask me why?

268
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,100
Why did you kill my mom?

269
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,250
Reason with me only when

270
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,420
you have paid off your blood debt.

271
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,580
Son!

272
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,780
Don't come over!

273
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,940
Su Juan, calm down!

274
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,940
I've been calm for so many years,

275
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,900
and I have held it in for so many years,

276
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,420
just so that I can avenge my mother.

277
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,940
Now that the chance is here,

278
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,810
why should I calm down?

279
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,260
Su Juan,

280
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,260
if you want revenge,

281
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,820
come at me instead.

282
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,620
Please don’t hurt Gu Yi.

283
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,780
I was wrong.

284
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,380
I was blinded back then.

285
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,060
I was afraid your appearance would threaten Gu Yi.

286
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,380
So I asked Yao Shunde to stop you

287
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,220
and prevent you from meeting Gu Nan.

288
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,100
I never meant to hurt you.

289
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,780
I didn't know Yao Shunde

290
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,490
would do something to your car.

291
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,140
Neither did I know that your mother was sick,

292
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,580
and was in fact, heavily sick.

293
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,340
Do you think I'm stupid?

294
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,140
I do not.

295
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,700
You don't have to believe me,

296
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,300
but Gu Yi is innocent.

297
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,940
He chased after your car back then,

298
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,820
because he wanted to save you.

299
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,170
If he hadn't hit your car,

300
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,300
you would have been long dead.

301
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,020
If the hospital had not secured a match for the heart source,

302
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,380
he would have also been dead.

303
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,180
You are still making up stories.

304
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,420
It's true.

305
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,900
Gu Yi really had a heart transplant.

306
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,180
Back then I approached him

307
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,820
because

308
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,740
I thought you donated his heart.

309
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,860
I always wanted to hide it from Gu Yi.

310
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,100
But,

311
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,220
that is also why I have been covering this up.

312
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,500
But I swear

313
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,460
everything I said today is true.

314
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,300
You can investigate

315
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,100
and verify it.

316
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,300
I can give you all the information you want.

317
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,060
I lost half my life.

318
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,140
Nothing has changed.

319
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,580
You did nothing wrong.

320
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,100
You did nothing wrong too.

321
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,580
What about me?

322
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,420
Who should I seek revenge for my mother's death?

323
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,580
Who will be responsible for my mother's death?

324
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,940
Tell me!

325
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,730
I'll take responsibility.

326
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,780
Su Juan,

327
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,820
if you want a life for a life,

328
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,180
then take my life instead.

329
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,420
Don't hurt my son.

330
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,980
I am begging you.

331
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,100
Please don't hurt my son.

332
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,060
Mother!

333
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,700
It's too late. The truth came too late.

334
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,820
Su Juan, are you crazy?

335
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,980
Yes.

336
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,420
I have gone crazy.

337
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,900
Because I don't understand

338
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,860
why the world is constantly against me.

339
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,620
Why did the person I love leave me?

340
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,860
What for did I plot my revenge for so many years?

341
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,420
Give me a reason to live.

342
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,980
Let go!

343
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,620
Let go!

344
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,220
Of course it's easy to die.

345
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,420
You're too selfish.

346
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,460
You keep saying you care about your mother.

347
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,940
Are you doing her justice?

348
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,180
She's someone whom you have hurt

349
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
and someone you have used.

350
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,740
Don't you want to take responsibility?

351
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,860
I don't want to lose any more of my family.

352
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,940
Brother!

353
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,140
Lawyer Sun and Lawyer Wu are back in the country.

354
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
They are the witnesses of your father's will.

355
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,940
In order to forge the will,

356
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,860
Su Juan deliberately sent them abroad.

357
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,980
They got the news and rushed back.

358
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,140
I wanted to ask you

359
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,100
how do you plan to deal with this?

360
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,580
How about we withdraw the lawsuit?

361
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,900
What Su Juan did

362
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,620
is also understandable.

363
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,860
Besides,

364
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,780
your father had always hoped our family

365
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,860
could live harmoniously when he was alive.

366
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,980
Let's not hurt each other anymore

367
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,540
because of the will.

368
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,660
I've already withdrawn the lawsuit.

369
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,140
But he...

370
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
chose to turn himself in.

371
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,980
I respect his decision.

372
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,850
When he comes back,

373
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,060
we can start over as a family.

374
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,060
I often visit Yun.

375
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,620
From fear and sadness initially,

376
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,900
to her repentance and calmness now,

377
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,380
she seems to have grown up.

378
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,660
It's good that she can change.

379
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,460
She has walked out of the past,

380
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,220
but I am still standing at the same spot.

381
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,100
Was it also you

382
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,260
who kidnapped Qiao Jing

383
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,300
and forced her to sign the letter of understanding?

384
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,580
Yes.

385
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,220
I plan to turn myself in.

386
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,220
You're right.

387
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,140
One has to pay the price

388
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,780
of his own actions.

389
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,500
Believe it or not,

390
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,700
in my heart,

391
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,500
you've always been my brother.

392
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,180
All the best. Take care of yourself.

393
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:36,360
[Yi Jing Environmental Technology Co. Ltd.]

394
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,500
We have started to partially pilot

395
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,450
the automatic sorting and production line for construction waste,

396
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,940
which was independently developed by our own company.

397
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,060
According to the tester's feedback,

398
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,220
this processing system

399
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,980
can sort and select the waste

400
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,380
into various type of materials

401
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,820
when it is initially generated.

402
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,260
Of course, this can avoid wasting of resources,

403
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,620
and it also greatly saves

404
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,180
construction and manpower costs.

405
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,460
Daqiang,

406
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,300
your construction site is the first one to put it into use.

407
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,340
How do you feel?

408
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,180
Just one word after using it:

409
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,770
awesome.

410
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,340
Yes.

411
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,980
We have implemented an industry-leading

412
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,340
one-stop service for delivery and processing.

413
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,340
Some construction waste,

414
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,780
such as concrete blocks, bricks and tiles,

415
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,980
is dismantled and then delivered

416
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,060
to the production plant for primary sorting.

417
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,100
After further processing, construction aggregate is produced.

418
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,500
This kind of construction aggregate

419
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,940
can replace the mining of natural stones

420
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,420
and the use of natural sand.

421
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,900
To tackle the problems of such upcycled aggregate

422
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,290
not being able to withstand pressure well

423
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,380
and having poor durability,

424
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,980
we at Yi Jing developed

425
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,380
a key patented technology

426
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,900
for the recycling of concrete waste.

427
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,060
This technology

428
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,660
enables the upcycled concrete's rigidity

429
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,860
and the various indexes of quality

430
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,140
to be on par with ordinary concrete,

431
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,540
all while decreasing the cost.

432
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,580
Since this system was put into use,

433
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,540
we not only saved time and effort,

434
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,700
but it is also much easier

435
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,260
on all of us than before, right?

436
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,780
Yes.

437
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,540
Most importantly, the workers at the construction site next to us

438
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,260
have been asking about this every day too.

439
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,300
Yes.

440
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,700
Recycling and upcycling

441
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,780
have become the trendsetter for future waste disposal,

442
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,060
and our independent research project

443
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,980
has also achieved results.

444
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,140
Yi Jing is creating miracles.

445
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,980
In the past few years, the country has also been encouraging

446
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,060
entrepreneurship and innovation among its people.

447
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,100
As long as we work hard,

448
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,260
there will be a miracle.

449
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,260
That's right.

450
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,620
Mom, I'm in a meeting.

451
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,380
What meeting?

452
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,780
Something bad has happened. Come out quick!

453
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,500
What?

454
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,660
Mother?

455
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,860
[Is Gu Yi and Qiao Jing getting married today?]

456
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,580
Hurry up.

457
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,970
Mr. Gu and Ms. Qiao, are you getting married today?

458
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,540
Mother, is this the big deal you are referring to?

459
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,180
[Is Gu Yi and Qiao Jing getting married today?]

460
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,220
Isn't this a big deal?

461
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,140
You two are busy with work every day

462
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,180
and care for nothing else.

463
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,180
Do you know how many times Li Jing called me

464
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,100
and rushed me?

465
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,180
Gu,

466
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,140
so the two of you are not married yet?

467
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,610
I thought you were already married.

468
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,580
Brother, you have to hurry up.

469
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,970
Ms. Qiao is such a great lady.

470
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,220
If you miss her, there won't be someone else like her.

471
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,580
That's right.

472
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,860
I counted quickly on my fingertips and found out that

473
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,580
today is an auspicious day to get married.

474
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,640
[Household Register]

475
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,060
I have also brought your household register over.

476
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,860
Mrs. Gu...

477
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,900
Don't call me Mrs. Gu.

478
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,420
From now on,

479
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,100
you have to call me mother.

480
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,260
But we still have work to do today.

481
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,170
Today's a holiday.

482
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,900
Let's go get our marriage certificate.
