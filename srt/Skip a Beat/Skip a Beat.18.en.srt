[Episode 18]

4
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,780
How is it?

5
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,500
With this kind of fragrance and color,

6
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,180
this chili must be

7
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,740
authentic erjingtiao chili from Nanchong.

8
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,900
It's fragrant and bright.

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,620
The texture of the fish is delicate and tender.

10
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,740
It must be a fresh northern snakehead.

11
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,700
Our Jing is indisputably

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,420
the best at eating.

13
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,539
That's because Mom is good at cooking.

14
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,020
That's why as her daughter, I can afford to be picky.

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,780
Your cooking

16
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,340
is better even than that of a five-star chef.

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,140
Exactly.

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,780
Stop flattering me.

19
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,900
Your family is so rich.

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,980
Don't you feel bad,

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,100
having free food at our place?

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,259
Do you want to be a freeloader?

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,810
Mom,

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,820
something happened

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,380
with his family.

26
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,700
That's why he's staying with me for the time being.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,900
I see.

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,820
Did that illegitimate son come back

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,860
to fight for your inheritance?

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,259
Will you end up with nothing?

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,979
You should at least find a job.

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,380
I'm preparing to start a business.

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,430
Start a business?

34
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,460
It's not easy.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,420
The income isn't steady.

36
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,100
You can't make her struggle with you.

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,060
Mom.

38
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,020
Gu Yi and I are going to start a business together.

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,180
We are partners.

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,020
What we want to do is good for the country and the people.

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,380
It's very promising.

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,460
We will definitely succeed.

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,620
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,700
Let everyone start businesses and create new things.

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,140
The country is also very supportive of entrepreneurship right now.

46
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,540
With the help of national policies,

47
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,990
our hard work

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,980
can definitely bring us success.

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,700
Don't worry.

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,579
No matter how hard it will be to start a business,

51
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,460
I won't let Qiao Jing suffer.

52
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,260
You're so confident.

53
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,620
Your argument is very complete.

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,420
What business are you starting?

55
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,860
We plan to research

56
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,579
the recycling of resources.

57
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,660
We will break down construction waste, and then—

58
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,020
You're picking up garbage?

59
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,420
The yard is so big.

60
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,300
The plants here look nice but aren't useful.

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,340
What a pity.

62
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,380
I should plant some cabbage here,

63
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,860
some garlic here,

64
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,100
and green onions here.

65
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,240
Coming!

Is Qiao Jing here?

73
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,420
She went out for business.

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,060

Do you want to have dinner together?

78
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,700
Okay.

79
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,700
You and Gu Yi are brothers?

80
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,900
You are the illegitimate child?

81
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,180
My mom only told me before she passed away.

82
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,580
It's been tough on you and your mother.

83
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,260
Gu Nan is a jerk.

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,260
Did the Gu family bully you

85
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,700
when you went back?

86
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,740
My dad and relatives are kind to me.

87
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,060
That's good.

88
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,700
That's good.

89
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,620
I'm really happy

90
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,380
to see you again.

91
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,980
Here.

92
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,140
Here.

93
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,380
You have no idea.

94
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,380
When you got into trouble,

95
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,700
our Jing was so upset.

97
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,140
It's my fault that I didn't contact her in time.

98
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,060
I made her worry for so long.

00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,900
How has she been recently?

When she was discharged,

102
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,140
the doctor asked her to take good care of herself.

103
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,980
Discharged?

104
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,420
When was she hospitalized?

105
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Didn't you know?

106
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,500
I've handed my work over

107
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,660
to the new supervisor.

108
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,700

110
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,540
is the first day of our business.

112
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,300
Trotters.

114
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,860

What happened?

119
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,730
Auntie, let me explain. We...

120
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,620
How long were you planning on hiding this from me?

121
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,820
Mom,

122
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,220
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

123
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,300
I didn't want you to worry.

124
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,060
Would that stop us from worrying?

125
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,300
Auntie, it's all my fault.

126
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,900
I failed to protect her and the baby.

127
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,340
Is it that you couldn't protect the baby,

128
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,100
or that your family

129
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,500
doesn't want this child at all?

130
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
You don't want to take responsibility?

131
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,300
It's not that.

132
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,100
The Gu family also feels sorry for this child.

133
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,980
I'm his father.

134

146

147

No.

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,020
You went to the hospital alone.

157

No one accompanied you.

I'm really fine.

171
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,060
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,740
I shouldn't have made you worry.

The doctor is also using a new treatment method,

177
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,740
but it's not very effective.

178
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,980
How long more do you think Gu Nan has?

179
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,140
There are some things

180
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,100
we must prepare for ahead of time.

181
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,860
Post-miscarriage confinement is very important for women.

182
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,700
You don't know this because you're still young.

183
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,500
You must take good care of yourself, okay?

184
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,460

185

Besides,

187
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,900
Gu Yi has been taking care of me.

188
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,700
As a man,

189
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,130
he couldn't even protect his own child.

190
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,220
How could he take care of you?

191
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,220
Mom, that was because of someone else's ulterior motive.

192
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,500
And it happened so suddenly. He couldn't do anything about it.

193
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,900
What are you doing?

194
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,620
Why are you defending him?

195
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,460
You haven't married him yet,

196
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,940
but you're already always on his side.

197
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,660
Li Jing would have found out about Qiao Jing's pregnancy

198
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,780
sooner or later.

199
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,820
You can't keep a secret forever.

200
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,180
Auntie is still angry.

201
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,860
I know it's my fault.

202
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,020
But because of this,

203
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,890
her impression of me has worsened.

204
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,380
Mom, I'm really at my wit's end.

205
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,580
I can only ask you for help.

206
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,860
How can I help?

207
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,340
I don't know how.

208
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Help me propose.

209
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,740
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

210
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,770
What are you doing?

211
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,820
Auntie.

212
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
We need to talk.

213
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,900
Put it here.

214
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,330
I brought you a little something.

215
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,500
I wonder if you have seen it before.

216
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,690
You're welcome.

217
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,140
Who cares about your stuff? Take it away.

218
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,700
Mom, didn't you say anyone who comes is a guest?

219
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,980
How can you drive them away?

220
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,940
Sit down.

221
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm not here

222
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,340
to fight with you.

223
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,220
I have something to discuss with you.

224
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,500
I'll be frank.

225
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,540
My son and your daughter are in an on-again, off-again relationship.

226
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,620
It's been a while.

227
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,740
It's time to settle things.

228
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,340
I've calculated the date.

229
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,060
The eighth day of next month is an auspicious day.

230
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,570
You two should go get the marriage certificate.

231
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,580
What marriage certificate?

232
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,900
Who agreed to get the marriage certificate?

233
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,460
Auntie.

234
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,140
I've thought about it for a long time.

235
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,690
I've brought my mom here today

236
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,260
to make myself clear.

237
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,340
I'm serious about Qiao Jing.

238
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,900
I want to marry her.

239
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,060
That's not up to you.

240
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,060
Why should we agree?

241
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,300
Young people are free to get married.

242
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,940
Can you stop them?

243
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,820
Besides,

244
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,050
whether in terms of family background or appearance,

245
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,060
how is my son not a good match for your daughter?

246
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,980
Do you know how many girls

247
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,580
want to marry into the Gu family as our daughter-in-law?

248
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,860
They should marry him instead.

249
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,420
Anyway, we are from a small family. We are not interested.

250
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,300
Mom, this isn't an issue we can solve so easily.

251
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,500
Let's eat first.

252
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,540
No. Don't interrupt.

253
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,660
Not drinking while one eats

254
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,140
is not fun at all.

255
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,900
Surely a rich madam like you

256
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,900
would trash a wine like this after just a few sips?

257
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,900
What a joke. Me, afraid of drinking?

258
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,180
I'll drink up first.

259
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,100
Sorry, I drank it first.

260
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,300
Mom.

261
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,460
Mom! Mom!

262
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Let go.

263
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,980
I drank it up first again.

264
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,260
I...

265
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
I'll finish it.

266
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,660
Mom.

267
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,140
Auntie.

268
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,620
Leave me alone!

269
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,340
Leave her alone!

270
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,100
You don't agree?

271
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,940
I don't want to either.

272
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,580
I've always wanted to find a good wife from a suitable family

273
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,140
for Gu Yi.

274
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,820
But my son

275
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,220
likes your daughter.

276
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,300
No matter how I try to stop him,

277
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,460
no matter what I do,

278
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,020
I can't separate them.

279
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,300
What should I do?

280
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,380
I can only let him be.

281
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,380
As long as my son is happy,

282
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,700
I'm willing to do anything.

283
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,300
You want to make your son happy.

284
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,540
I... I also want my daughter to be happy.

285
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,500
I don't want her to be rich.

286
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,580
I just want her to find a man who loves her

287
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,380
and make her his priority.

288
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,660
Cheers.

289
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,460
You know,

290
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,180
in terms of loving Qiao Jing,

291
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,420
if my son ranks second,

292
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,500
no man would dare claim he's first.

293
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,140
You have no idea.

294
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,849
My son can give up his life

295
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,180
for your daughter.

296
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,940
Come on.

297
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,300
Cheers.

298
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,810
Li Jing.

299
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,540
Tell me.

300
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,580
How did you birth such a pretty daughter?

301
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
She's really pretty.

302
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,300
She's kind, too.

303
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,100
There's just one thing.

304
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,700
A flaw.

305
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,460
It's definitely a flaw.

306
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,220
She's too formidable.

307
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,580
I'm afraid she'll bully Gu Yi.

308
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,020
She's just like me.

309
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,780
All her good and bad traits are from me.

310
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,940
In-law,

311
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,580
if your daughter

312
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,440
marrys into our family,

313
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,060
I will treat her very well.

314
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,300
Listen.

315
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,660
When that time comes,

316
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,100
whenever we are free,

317
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,260
we can go on holiday

318
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,090
and take care of our grandson.

319
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,820
Will they fight?

320
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,060
I don't think they will.

321
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,940
Won't a granddaughter work?

322
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,060
Fine.

323
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,700
Either a grandson or granddaughter would be good.

324
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,260
It'll be best if there were more than too.

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,660
I look forward to our cooperation.

326
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,380
It's good that they can talk this out.

327
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,940
Auntie.

328
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,460
Come here.

329
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,540
Did you send your mother home?

330
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,180
She drank too much today.

331
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,860
If she said something inappropriate,

332
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,020
don't take it to heart.

333
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,900
I know

334
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,380
she has your interests at heart.

335
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,700
Although my mom is strong,

336
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,850
for me,

337
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,530
she has been through a lot of hardship.

338
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,420
Gu Yi.

339
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,860
I'm not trying to make things difficult for you.

340
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,460
But I have my concerns.

341
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,860
Previously,

342
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,340
I asked you to sweep the floor, cook,

343
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,020
and do all sorts of chores.

344
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,260
Actually, I didn't actually want you

345
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,020
to be a househusband.

346
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,980
I just wanted to see

347
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,180
how far you could go

348
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,220
for Qiao Jing.

349
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,770
I don't care about your family background.

350
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,060
What I care about is if you will still treat her well

351
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,060
after you two get together.

352
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,780
Auntie.

353
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,940
I understand your concerns.

354
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,060
Before I met Qiao Jing,

355
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,020
I had a problem with relationships.

356
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,500
I was a selfish and childish person,

357
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,620
and I made many mistakes.

358
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,460
But Qiao Jing never gave up on me.

359
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,020
She also changed me.

360
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,180
She made me understand love and responsibility.

361
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,140
To me,

362
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,860
she is not just someone I love,

363
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,860
she's someone who taught me to grow up

364
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,660
and helped me to overcome obstacles.

365
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,900
Auntie.

366
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,220
It's okay if you don't approve of me now.

367
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,740
Time will prove my heart.

368
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,060
I hope you will remember

369
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,460
what you said today.

370
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,660
Sleep early.

371
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,980
Good night, Auntie.

372
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,540
Good night.

373
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,980
Mrs. Gu, you can’t go in.

374
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,580
President Gu cannot have visitors right now.

375
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,420
I'm Gu Nan's wife.

376
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,540
I have the right to know

377
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,180
how my husband is now.

378
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,300
Mrs. Gu. Mrs. Gu.

379
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,460
President Gu is still in a coma.

380
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,900
His condition is not good.

381
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,980
He needs to rest.

382
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,220
How could this happen?

383
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,050
The metastasis of President Gu's cancer cells is serious.

384
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,100
We can only adopt conservative management now

385
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,380
and hope that he makes it through this.

386
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,140
When will he wake up?

387
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,820
It depends.

388
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,380
Don't eat dry food. Have some milk.

389
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
Thank you, Mom.

390
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,660
Here.

391
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,300
Thank you, Mom.

392
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,700
Who are you calling Mom?

393
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,860
You will be, sooner or later.

394
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,940
If you want to call me that legitimately,

395
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,380
you will have to get the marriage certificate first.

396
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,260
Of course.

397
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,860
I've been here for days.

398
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,860
I'm afraid my business

399
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,260
will be ruined by your Dad.

400
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,420
I have to go back.

401
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,220
Mom, stay a few more days.

402
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,100
I'll go to Nancheng with you.

403
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,060
You and Gu Yi are busy picking up garbage.

404
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,300
I can't wait any longer.

405
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,180
Hey,

406
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,060
take your health seriously.

407
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,500
Take care.

408
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,700
You must be mindful of your post-miscarriage confinement.

409
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,260
If it weren't for Juan,

410
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,660
I wouldn't have known about this.

411
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,180
Mom, you met him?

412
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,530
You weren't home when he came to see you.

413
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,820
Don't blame him.

414
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,860
He's just worried about you.

415
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,540
It's not easy to suffer so much at such a young age.

416
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,260
I also made a lot of fried dough balls.

417
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,420
Give them to him later.

418
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,700
Enjoy your meal.

419
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,500
I had to work late.

420
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,820
Did you wait long?

421
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,060
My mom said you like fried dough balls.

422
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,940
She made some for you.

423
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,900
Other than my mom,

424
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,180
she's the only person who remembers my preferences.

425
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,460
If you still have feelings for my mom,

426
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,580
you shouldn't have dragged her into this.

427
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,380
You told her

428
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,740
about my pregnancy, right?

429
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,300
Were you intending on keeping it from her?

430
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
It's my business whether or not to tell her.

431
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,860
Don't interfere with my life anymore.

432
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,460
What took you so long?

433
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,860
Are you jealous?

434
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,780
No.

435
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,580
I'm the son-in-law of the Qiao family that our mother acknowledged.

436
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,260
No one can threaten my position.

437
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,340
Mr. Gu.

438
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
Please help me.

439
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,100
I'm desperate.

440
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,660
Wait.

441
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,700
According to Mr. Gu's requests, this is a new version.

442
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,620
Use this to publish.

443
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,380
Really?

444
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,500
Why didn't the secretary send me an email as with the standard procedure?

445
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,220
It's a matter of life and death. Why should we bother with standard procedure?

446
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,620
Hurry up.

447
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,580
It's such a big deal.

448
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,450
I can't take the responsibility.

449
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,020
And you gave me the USB.

450
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,140
I'm going to tell Mr. Gu.

451
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,380
Stop.

452
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,180
Do you have any evidence?

453
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,860
Do you think he will trust you or me?

454
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,580
Don't worry.

455
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,620
If you take the fall,

456
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,700
I won't treat you badly.

457
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,940
Here's $500,000. Take it.

458
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,460
I'll take care of the rest for you

459
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,780
and send you abroad.

460
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,180
But if you report me,

461
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,700
I'll bring you down with me.

462
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,660
What do you mean?

463
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,940
Anxia refused an out-of-court settlement.

464
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,020
They are determined to sue you.

465
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,060
How is that possible?

466
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,420
Someone in Anxia will definitely help me.

467
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
The trial is coming up.

468
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,620
Who can help you?

469
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,380
Where are you?

470
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,580
Why aren't you coming out?

471
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,540
[Zhou Rui]

472
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,260
Mr. Gu,

473
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,260
I was stupid. I was blinded.

474
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,460
That's why I fell for Zhou Rui's trap.

475
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,980
I really don't want to go to jail.

476
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,100
I finally escaped.

477
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,060
You must save me.

478
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,860
Get up first.

479
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,380
Don't worry.

480
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,780
I will find out the truth.

481
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,300
The only thing you can do now

482
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,060
is to tell the police the truth.

483
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,620
You will help yourself

484
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,380
and Anxia.

485
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,820
I understand.

486
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,860
I'm leaving.

487
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,170
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

488
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,620
Let me see you off.

489
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,740
Chen Lan is going to court.

490
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,660
How is the preparation going?

491
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,340
The case is clear cut and the evidence is sufficient.

492
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Everything is fine.

493
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,340
OK.

494
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,460
Thank you, Lawyer Wang.

495
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,180
It's my pleasure.

496
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,900
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

497
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,580
OK. Thank you.

498
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,660
Mr. Zhou, Chen Lan ran away.

499
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,060
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

500
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,780
How long has he been gone for?

501
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,100
About two hours.

502
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,940
Let's go.

503
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,500
You may leave now.

504
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,420
Yes.

505
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,740
I treated you as my brother.

506
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,260
How dare you stab me in the back?

507
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,140
Brother?

508
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,260
Are we brothers?

509
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,300
Since we were young,

510
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,340
I've always given in to you.

511
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,460
I did whatever

512
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,180
you said.

513
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,420
I gave you

514
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,860
whatever you liked.

515
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,060
When we were young, it was candy.

516
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,580
When we grew up, it was my car,

517
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,020
the projects I wanted to do,

518
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,740
and even...

519
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,820
and even the person I loved.

520
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,380
You did all this for Bai Yun?

521
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,940
You don't know, do you?

522
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,740
I've liked her for a long time.

523
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,610
I don't want to be like a brother to her.

524
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,380
She only loves you.

525
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,020
It's okay. I'm fine with anything.

526
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,260
I'm fine as long as she's happy.

527
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,940
But what about you?

528
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,260
For Qiao Jing,

529
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,580
that wretched woman,

530
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,060
you hurt her again and again.

531
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,090
Yes, she did wrong.

532
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,020
But why are you so heartless?

533
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,420
At this point,

534
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,420
your wish has come true.

535
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,620
You and Qiao Jing

536
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,700
can live happily ever after.

537
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,780
But have you ever thought about Yun?

538
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,900
Have you ever thought about her situation?

539
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,940
Her life is ruined.

540
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

541
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,660
Why didn't you say it outright

542
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,020
in front of Bai Yun?

543
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,140
Why?

544
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,460
I've never asked you

545
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,900
to give me anything.

546
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,340
Your complaints

547
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,100
only show that

548
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
you can't even tell the truth.

549
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,620
She ruined her own life.

550
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,140
It has nothing to do with anyone.

551
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,740
All these years,

552
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,380
I've never seen you clearly.

553
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,660
Because you've never cared about me.
