[Episode 9]

4
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,370
What did my dad say to you today?

5
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,260
He said you treated me badly

6
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,700
and I should leave you instantly.

7
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,420
What do you think?

8
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,420
You did treat me badly,

9
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,060
but I did something wrong too.

10
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,700
So neither of us has the right to point fingers.

11
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,060
I apologize for what I did to you.

12
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,450
I won't treat you that way anymore.

13
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,259
I won't make you sad

14
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,860
or let you down again.

15
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,860
Can you give me another chance?

16
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,700
Can you?

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,420
Yes.

18
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,940
One year is far from enough.

19
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,300
I want to be with you forever.

20
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,699
Let's give it a try.

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,500
Be together forever.

22
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,300
I'll never regret it.

23
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,620
Okay.

24
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,020
Why are you up?

25
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,140
Go back and lie down.

26
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,100
You're still running a slight fever.

27
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,380
I'm making porridge for you.

28
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,660
Eat it before you take the medicine.

29
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm fine.

30
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,100
I won't die.

31
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,260
The phone.

32
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,500
Hello?

33
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,140
Bro, I've made some headway.

34
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,140
I investigated Li Changlin for a long time

35
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,860
but didn't uncover anything.

36
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,020
So I went another way

37
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,090
and found something interesting about this guy.

38
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,700
Li Changlin is a fake name.

39
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,340
His real name is Yao Shunde.

40
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
No wonder I couldn't find anything about him.

41
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,900
Yao Shunde?

42
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,140
What? You know this guy?

43
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,570
By the way,

44
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,340
you can try to find clues in the memories you lost

45
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,420
in the car accident.

46
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,130
It's okay. Take your time.

47
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,540
No hurry.

48
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,460
Although I've found out his real name,

49
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,100
other information about this guy

50
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,500
has all been wiped clean.

51
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,980
I can't find anything.

52
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,540
Tell me if you recall anything.

53
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,780
I'm leaving.

54
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,460
Wait.

55
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,300
Give me a ride home.

56
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,980
What are you rummaging for?

57
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,540
Here he is.

58
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,300
Yao Shunde.

59
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,780
My dad's personal assistant.

60
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,900
Yao Shunde seldom appeared in public.

61
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,700
That photo is one of the few he left.

62
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,580
He died of illness half a month ago.

63
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,300
He had no children.

64
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,180
So his house is in the care of a distant relative.

65
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,140
Everything remains the way they were.

66
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,100
This one.

67
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,020
Here we are.

68
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,660
Let's go.

69
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,659
These things were all his personal stuff.

70
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,180
I've gotten his family's permission.

71
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,220
We can look around.

72
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,940
Let's look carefully.

73
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,100
We may find something new.

74
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,940
Okay.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,720
[Rest assured…]

76
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,820
Rest assured, Madam.

77
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,020
I know what to do with Chairman Gu.

78
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,180
Gu Yi.

79
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,060
Did you find anything?

80
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,530
No. What about you?

81
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,780
Have you searched the bookshelf?

82
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm doing it now.

83
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,780
Why do you insist on getting to the bottom of that accident?

84
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,740
Four years ago,

85
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,660
Su Juan abruptly told me that he needed to go to Xilin Mountain.

86
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,140
Then he got in the car crash.

87
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,220
When I got to the hospital,

88
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,730
I didn't even see his body.

89
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,300
Later,

90
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,100
I found your heart transplant report

91
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,659
and his diagnosis

92
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,380
in the doctor's office.

93
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,260
He donated his heart.

94
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,020
Where was his body?

95
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,660
The accident was also very weird.

96
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,260
He needed the truth.

97
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,660
I need an explanation.

98
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,940
We found nothing today.

99
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,500
Are you disappointed?

100
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,780
No.

101
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,020
It took me so long to find some clues.

102
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,500
You helped me make a breakthrough.

103
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,730
That's good enough.

104
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,700
I'll go upstairs and get changed.

105
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,060
Take the medicine on the table.

106
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,620
OK.

107
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,500
Chairman Gu does have an illegitimate son.

108
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,020
I've sent you his profile.

109
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,660
Su Juan?

110
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,220
A bastard coming out of nowhere!

111
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,220
Hello, Madam.

112
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,420
Don't worry.

113
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,060
I won't let him meet Chairman Gu.

114
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,860
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

115
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,340
Pain in the head? Let me rub your temples.

116
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,860
Okay.

117
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,700
Are you feeling better?

118
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,060
You said

119
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,780
you want to seek justice for Su Juan.

120
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,260
But if the truth

121
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,700
was really related to the Gu family,

122
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,820
what would you do?

123
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,700
Did you remember something?

124
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,940
No.

125
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,260
But Yao Shunde worked for my father.

126
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,780
I'm afraid it had something to do with my family.

127
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,420
We haven't come to any conclusion yet.

128
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,180
Don't think too much.

129
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,060
Besides, your family is not you.

130
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
I won't blame you

131
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,050
for what others did.

132
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,730
Really?

133
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,420
Since we've decided to start over,

134
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,460
we have to be honest with each other.

135
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,700
As long as you don't lie to me,

136
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,020

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,140
So,

159
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,420
it must have something to do with Fang Pei.

160
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,820
What are you going to do?

161
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,020
Although it had nothing to do with Gu Yi,

162
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,140
his parents were involved.

163
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,930
I'm afraid I may hurt Gu Yi

164
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,860
if I delve into it.

165
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,460
Are you going to give up the truth for him?

166
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,650
No.

167
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm going to tell him what I found.

168
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,180
No matter what the truth is,

169
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll face it with him.

170
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,140
Yeah. You've spent so many years investigating after all.

171
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,620
In the past,

172
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,820
Gu Yi and I told each other too many lies.

173
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,540
This time,

174
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,980
I'll face everything with him.

175
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,500
I suspended you and canceled your cards

176
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,580
just to take you down a peg.

177
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,420
But you just walked away and left everything to me.

178
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm back now.

179
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,300
Have you gone to the hospital

180
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,660
for a follow-up recently?

181
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,740
The memories you lost…

182
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,090
I've gotten them back.

183
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,060
No wonder you looked into Yao Shunde.

184
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,650
But no matter what you know,

185
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,619
stop investigating.

to prevent Su Juan from meeting Dad.

189
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,180

190
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,700
Who did I do that for?

191
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,180
Do you expect me

192
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,579
to let that bastard come back

193
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,740
to share your father and inheritance?

194
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,340
There were many ways that you could keep him away.

195
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,620
Why did you have to kill him?

196
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,220
I didn't!

197
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,980
I just didn't want him to meet your dad.

198
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,740
I didn't expect that to happen.

199
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,940
What's done is done.

200
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,930
There's no point in arguing.

201
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,980
What do you want?

202
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
Bring everything to light?

203
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,980
Do you have to push me so hard?

204
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,540
You're pushing me here.

205
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,660
The records of all your chats

206
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,860
with Yao Shunde are in it.

207
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
How did you get it?

208
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,420
Qiao Jing.

209
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,940
Qiao Jing!

210
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,220
Qiao Jing, it's not what you think.

211
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,900
Listen to me. I can explain.

212
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,890
[Anxia Group]

213
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,740
Qiao Jing!

214
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,500
Qiao Jing, listen to me.

215
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,140
What do you want to say?

216
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,930
You want to tell me

217
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,260
how you hid the phone from me

218
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,860
and

219
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,220
how you pushed me around

220
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,540
to cover up for your mother?

221
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,580
No.

222
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,900
I just… I…

223
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,530
Gu Yi, what did you promise me?

224
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,420
You said you'd never lie to me again.

225
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,540
I'm so stupid.

226
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,260
How would someone like you

227
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,500
change for me?

228
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,660
Everything was fake.

229
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,700
What you said,

230
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,100
the way you looked at me,

231
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,740
and everything you did

232
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,060
was all fake.

233
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,020
No.

234
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,860
Qiao Jing.

235
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,980
You said

236
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,250
we'd be together forever.

237
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,940
You can't leave me.

238
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,060
You can't go back on your word.

239
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,540
It sickens me to be with a liar!

240
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,280
[Four years ago]

241
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,380
Mom.

242
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,900
Who is this man?

243
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,500
He's your father.

244
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,250
When we were together,

245
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,580
I thought I belonged with him,

246
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,620
but in the end, he married someone else.

247
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,860
After we broke up,

248
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,300
I found that I was pregnant.

249
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,860
I didn't want to disturb him,

250
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,420
so I didn't tell him.

251
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,360
[Gu Nan]

252
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,680
[Gu Nan, the chairman of Anxia Group, is currently recuperating in Xilin Mountain due to illness.]

253
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,060
I need money to save Mom.

254
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,340
Maybe this man can lend me some money.

255
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,260
Your DNA report

256
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,340
has been submitted to Chairman Gu.

257
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,700
Directly go in when you arrive.

258
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,620
Juan.

259
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,380
Juan.

260
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Uncle Jiang?

261
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,020
What are you doing here?

262
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,540
You had a car accident in Xilin Mountain.

263
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,740
I rushed here as soon as I was informed.

264
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,020
What time is it?

265
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,060
You've been in a coma for almost a month.

266
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,500
You woke up sometimes

267
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,610
but were in a trance.

268
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,780
Careful. Careful.

269
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,860
Where is my mom?

270
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
How is she?

271
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,380
She'll have surgery on the 15th. I need to see her.

272
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,620
Juan. Juan.

273
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,290
Are you alright?

274
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,140
I need to see my mom.

275
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
I need to see my mom.

276
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,060
Listen to me!

277
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,260
Your mother

278
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,340
has passed away.

279
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,220
No.

280
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,460
She finally got a match.

281
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
I can save her as long as I have money.

282
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,860
I need to see my mom.

283
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,620
She's dead!

284
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,180
Before she died,

285
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,460
she was worried sick about you.

286
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,500
So you should take good care of yourself.

287
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,180
Don't let her worry about you anymore.

288
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,500
Understand?

289
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,620
It's my fault.

290
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,660
It's all my fault.

291
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,810
It's all my fault.

292
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,420
It's not your fault.

293
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,260
That crash

294
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,540
was not an accident.

295
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,660
So you need to take good care of yourself.

296
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,380
After you recover,

297
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,980
you have to find justice for your mother.

298
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,780
How's your recovery going?

299
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,780
Not bad.

300
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,700
Have enough rest.

301
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,110
How do you feel after the surgery?

302
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,520
Don't worry. I feel great.

303
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,820
Dad.

304
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,620
I finally meet you,

305
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,900
my son.

306
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,620
Sorry. I failed you and your mother.

307
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,180
These years,

308
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,940
you've suffered a lot.

309
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,980
It's okay, Dad.

310
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,460
I understand you.

311
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,420
Don't worry.

312
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,500
In the future,

313
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,540
no one dares to mess with you.

314
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,900
That's how I spent these years.

315
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,900
I planned

316
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,660
to borrow money from Gu Nan

317
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,180
to pay for Mom's surgery.

318
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,700
I didn't see that coming.

319
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,460
After the accident, I was afraid of being found by Fang Pei,

320
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,300
so I hid out.

321
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,100
That nightmare didn't end

322
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,620
until I met Gu Nan.

323
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,540
Sorry.

324
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,780
My bad.

325
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,220
I should've contacted you earlier.

326
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,940
It's okay.

327
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,780
Now that you've come back alive,

328
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,860
nothing else matters.

329
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,740
You narrowly survived.

330
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,380
Then who donated the heart

331
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,010
to Gu Yi?

332
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,820
I always thought my heart was Su Juan's,

333
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,340
but he didn't die.

334
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,780
In your junior year in college,

335
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,020
you were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy.

336
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,380
I'd been looking for donors since then.

337
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,060
But because your case was not urgent,

338
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,060
we waited in line for a long time

339
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,060
and no suitable donor appeared.

340
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,460
After the car accident,

341
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,020
your case became very urgent.

342
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,700
When your life was hanging by a thread,

343
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,140
the hospital got a heart for you

344
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,900
and saved you.

345
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,660
But I don't know

346
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,180
who the donor was.

347
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,020
So,

348
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,340
my heart has nothing to do with Su Juan?

349
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,260
Where are you?

350
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,620
Why aren't you back yet?

351
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,100
Where I am is none of your business.

352
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,650
I'll wait for you at home.

353
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,620
I want to talk to you.

354
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,740
There's nothing to talk about.

355
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,820
Pack your things

356
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,900
and leave my house.

357
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,540
I know you're mad at me.

358
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,420
But we…
