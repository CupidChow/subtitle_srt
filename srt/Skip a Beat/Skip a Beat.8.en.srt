4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,490
We'll have my homemade lunch together in the afternoon.

5
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,900
Then, we'll go to the amusement park in the afternoon.

6
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,340
Are you scared?

7
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,780
Then hold my hand.

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,650
♫How many winters has it been since we broke up?♫

9
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,190
♫What day is today?♫

10
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,360
♫I think of you sometimes♫

11
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,510
♫Your sudden text♫

12
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,940
♫Caught me off guard♫

13
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,820
♫I froze on the spot♫

14
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,050
♫When everyone is happy for you♫

15
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,660
♫I finally come to my senses♫

16
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,100
♫So someone has already made you a wedding dress♫

17
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,160
♫Thank you for inviting me♫

18
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,360
♫To witness your love♫

19
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,100
♫I keep reminding myself not to run away♫

20
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,090
♫Holding the invitation, I slowly♫

21
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,440
♫Approach the carefully decorated venue♫

22
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,310
♫It's a pity that this is your scenery♫

23
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,670
♫And I'm just a guest♫

24
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,829
♫I put down all my memories♫

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,910
♫To fulfill your love♫

26
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,060
Why are you following me?

27
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,340
Because I've seen

28
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,660
the date checklist you kept behind Su Juan's photo album.

29
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,850
♫But I refuse to believe it's destiny♫

30
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,260
Four years ago, on this day,

31
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,860
you were going to confess to him.

32
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,670
♫Time has distanced us♫

33
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,329
♫We shake hands and exchange polite words♫

34
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,260
That's right.

35
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,760
♫Why did you do that in front of him?♫

36
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,459
But he will never come again.

37
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,459
No.

38
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,140
♫You hid that you were once part of my world♫

39
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,380
He came to the date today.

40
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,220
Today.

41
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,300
Su Juan went to the library with you.

42
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,780
He had lunch with you.

43
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,500
He played in the amusement park with you,

44
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,540
and set off fireworks with you.

45
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,170
♫Before we know it, the bell rings♫

46
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,970
♫You stay where you are♫

47
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
Why are you doing this?

48
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,800
♫Waiting for him to get closer♫

49
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,860
Because I want to know

50
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,180
how it feels

51
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,980
to be deeply loved by you.

52
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,360
♫The gentle him kneels on his knees♫

53
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,770
♫He puts the diamond ring on♫

54
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,930
♫Your ring finger ♫

55
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,220
You are not him.

56
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,700
♫When everyone is happy for you♫

57
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,160
♫I finally come to my senses♫

58
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,020
But his heart is here.

59
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,640
♫There's no more relationship between us♫

60
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,860
He will help you fulfill the wish

61
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,340
you didn't manage to fulfill back then.

62
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,910
♫Thank you for inviting me♫

63
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,140
I hope after tonight,

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,920
♫To witness your love♫

65
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,740
when you wake up tomorrow,

66
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,860
♫I keep reminding myself not to run away♫

67
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
you'll no longer be the Qiao Jing who's trapped in the past,

68
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,620
but a new you.

69
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,650
♫You're dressed so beautifully today♫

70
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,300
♫I once held this beauty in my arms♫

71
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,870
♫It's a pity that this is your wedding with him♫

72
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,310
♫And I'm just a guest♫

73
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,520
♫I put down all my memories♫

74
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,590
♫To fulfill your love♫

75
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,300
♫But I refuse to believe it's destiny♫

76
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,270
♫Our promised forever became the past♫

77
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,850
♫I try to sincerely wish you happiness♫

78
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,450
♫Please forgive me for being shameless and useless♫

79
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,450
♫Please excuse me for leaving first♫

80
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,050
You're awake.

81
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,340
Here.

82
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,090
This is my best attempt.

83
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,980
You must try it.

84
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,980
Here.

85
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,580
Mr. Gu.

86
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,580
It's not very appropriate

87
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,580
to have four eggs for breakfast.

88
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,100
Why not?

89
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,460
Two for you, two for me.

90
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,220
Here, try it.

91
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,660
How is it?

92
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:20,940
Delicious.

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Do you still think I'm causing you trouble?

94
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,500
You're a man.

95
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,580
Can you not hold grudges?

96
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,580
I...

97
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,420
I'll get it.

98
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,210
Sit down. Finish everything.

99
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,260
It's only been a few days since we last met.

100
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,659
How did your cooking become so bad?

101
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,460
Who asked you to eat it?

102
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,220
Don't be stingy, Mr. Gu.

103
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,020
I've been busy all night and haven't had breakfast.

104
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,900
I made this for my...

105
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,460
for Qiao Jing.

106
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,420
No wonder.

107
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,860
I was wondering why the egg is heart-shaped.

108
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,940
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

109
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,860
What were you doing? You're starving.

110
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,940
Please save your poor sister.

111
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,180
What's wrong?

112
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,780
I've sold some of the flowers from the

113
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,060
farming charity event via livestream.

114
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,460
But all the customers know that

115
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,340
the delivery will cause certain damage to the flowers.

116
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,260
So, everyone wants to buy half-blooming flowers.

117
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,809
But I still have a batch of fully bloomed flowers.

118
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,100
If I can't sell them, they will all be wasted on me.

119
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,780
Then you have to sell them quickly.

120
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,659
The longer it takes, the less fresh the flowers become.

121
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,460
That's why I came to you.

122
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,900
But I don't have any experience selling flowers.

123
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,300
You sold houses.

124
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,900
How hard could selling flowers be?

125
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,700
Are you going to do it?

126
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,660
I can help you.

127
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,540
But you have to promise me one thing.

128
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,700
What is it?

129
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,900
Mr. Gu, don't take advantage of the situation.

130
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,740
I'll tell you later.

131
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,620
Let's sell flowers first.

132
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,060
Hello, do you need flowers?

133
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
No, thanks.

134
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,460
Do you need flowers?

135
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,140
No need.

136
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,780
I thought you had some good ideas.

137
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,260
I didn't expect this to be it.

138
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,660
Do you remember the old man selling sweet potatoes

139
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,980
at the back of the Anxia building?

140
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,060
He earns more than you.

141
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,300
Do you need flowers?

142
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,260
Oh my god. Hurry up. Our queue number is about to expire.

143
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,860
It's hard to secure a seat at the Lakeview restaurant.

144
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,700
Is it that delicious?

145
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,460
Mr. Gu.

146
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,850
Mr. Gu, what are you...

147
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,460
I...

148
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,940
Market research.

149
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,260
Ms. Qiao.

150
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,900
This flower stalk is so cute.

151
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,580
We got these flowers for the farming charity event.

152
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,100
The flower farmers' flowers aren't selling well.

153
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,330
So Mr. Gu and I have decided to help with sales.

154
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,540
We'll sell as much as we can.

155
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Can we take photos?

156
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,980
Sure.

157
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,900
You can take photos.

158
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
But not for free.

159
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,420
Okay.

160
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,300
Got it.

161
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,300
20.

162
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,700
So little?

163
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,620
I only have 20 in cash.

164
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,260
But I can scan the QR code.

165
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,420
No need.

166
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,060
Pay only if you really want to buy some.

167
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,340
We're not forcing them on anyone.

168
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,420
There's only so many we can buy.

169
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,300
Why don't we

170
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,020
sell them with Mr. Gu and Ms. Qiao?

171
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,180
No way.

172
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,380
We have sales indicators even during our vacation?

173
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,540
Then hurry up and spend money.

174
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,580
Buy them all.

175
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,820
Fine, I'll sell them.

176
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,100
Come on. What are you waiting for?

177
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,140
Thank you.

178
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,700
Here, take it.

179
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,490
Here, this is for you.

180
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,500
Do you need flowers?

181
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,100
Do you need flowers?

182
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,460
It's getting dark.

183
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,940
You can't even see the colours of the flowers anymore.

184
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,220
People won't have the mood for them.

185
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,860
Yeah.

186
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,580
Thank you, everyone.

187
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,780
These flowers won't be fresh tomorrow.

188
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,420
If we can't sell them,

189
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
take them back and share them.

190
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,820
There are so many left.

191
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,380
What a pity.

192
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,220
Which one do you want?

193
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,610
Ten yuan for one.

194
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,460
Everyone. Look here, please.

195
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,780
Everyone. Look here, please.

196
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,460
My girlfriend said,

197
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,020
as long as I sell all these flowers,

198
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,780
she will marry me.

199
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,460
Really?

200
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,180
Ms. Qiao.

201
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
When did you get this far in the relationship?

202
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,660
Gu Yi, what are you doing?

203
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,060
My girlfriend said,

204
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,100
as long as I sell all these flowers,

205
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,220
she will marry me.

206
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,340
Bro, you're brave. Give me a bouquet.

207
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Here.

208
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,900
Come on.

209
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,140
Here.

210
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,180
Scan the QR code.

211
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,820
Is this okay?

212
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,780
I'll take two bouquets.

213
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,900
Scan the QR code. Scan the QR code.

214
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,140
One bouquet please.

215
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,660
Here.

216
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,100
Here you go.

217
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,620
Thank you.

218
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,580
Gu Yi.

219
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,900
What are you doing?

220
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,220
Selling flowers.

221
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,260
Come on, scan here.

222
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,940
-Scan here.
-Here. Here.

223
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,660
Here, this is yours. Take it.

224
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,380
Here.

225
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,780
Thank you.

226
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,380
-Okay.
-Five yuan.

227
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,820
Ten yuan. Scan the QR code. Yaoyao.

228
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,900
A bouquet of sunflowers, right?

229
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,100
This one? Okay.

230
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,420
Ten yuan. Scan the QR code over there.

231
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,060
Here.

232
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,140
Remember to scan the QR code.

233
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,540
Scan it.

234
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,420
Come on, this way.

235
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,580
-Come on. Scan.
-Scan the QR code over there.

236
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,620
Bro, your flowers.

237
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,820
When are you proposing?

238
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,180
We've bought all the flowers.

239
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,300
Everyone is waiting.

240
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,020
That's right.

241
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,540
That's right.

242
00:12:51,820 --> 00:13:07,660
Propose! Propose!

243
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,700
So romantic.

244
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,740
Marry him.

245
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,620
Yes, say yes.

246
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,820
Say yes.

247
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,020
Say yes!

248
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,380
Say yes!

249
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,300
So sweet.

250
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,100
Marry him.

251
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,940
Oh my god. Am I dreaming?

252
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,100
I actually witnessed

253
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,740
Mr. Gu's proposal in person.

254
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,940
This overtime is worth it.

255
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,820
Qiao Jing, will you marry me?

256
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,730
Say yes.

257
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:58,220
Marry him! Marry him!

258
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:08,100
Marry him! Marry him!

259
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,570
She agreed!

260
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,660
Congratulations.

261
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,760
We wish you happiness.

262
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,840
Be happy forever.

263
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,400
Be happy forever.

264
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,580
[Bring a bouquet of beautiful flowers. It's a nice day anyway. Long time no see.]

265
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,420
Mr. Gu, Ms. Qiao.

266
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,620
We're almost done packing.

267
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,700
We'll leave now.

268
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,180
Okay.

269
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,140
Thank you.

270
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
Good night, Mr. Gu.

271
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,740
Mrs. Gu.

272
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,340
Goodnight, Mr. Gu, and Mrs. Gu.

273
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,380
Ms. Qiao.

274
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,940
No, Mrs. Gu.

275
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,460
Are you getting embarrassed?

276
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,010
Mr. Gu, you sure made great sacrifices just to sell flowers.

277
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,460
Let's go.

278
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,940
Qiao Jing.

279
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,210
Look.

280
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,540
We were so focused on selling the flowers on the car,

281
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,700
we forgot about the ones down here.

282
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,380
[Love in your heart, roses in your arms]

283
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,580
Thank you for today.

284
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,980
For what?

285
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,980
I'm doing this on a condition.

286
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,380
Your flowers are not sold out yet.

287
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,380
Your conditions don't count.

288
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,500
I said we can sell them all.

289
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,860
I'll deliver it to the buyer now.

290
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,780
Sit tight.

291
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,940
Who is it at this hour?

292
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,180
[For the handsome Mr. Zhou: 
 Can't woo ladies without flowers]

293
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,630
[Remember to pay!]

294
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,780
Qiao Jing, will you marry me?

295
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,380
Hello?

296
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,220
You really sold all those flowers?

297
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,700
I didn't expect

298
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,540
this young master to be actually capable.

299
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,980
He is the CEO of Anxia afterall.

300
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,530
He's not that useless.

301
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,420
I think he's different now.

302
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,220
He used to look down at everyone.

303
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,980
Why would he stoop down to sell flowers?

304
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,140
He did change a little.

305
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,220
Why are you here?

306
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,180
The flowers are sold out.

307
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,820
I came to you to make good on my demand.

308
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,380
I won't agree if your demand is too much.

309
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,580
What kind of demand is considered too much?

310
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,180
That's too much.

311
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,420
I want a date

312
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,740
only for Gu Yi and Qiao Jing.

313
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,780
I've prepared the date checklist.

314
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,860
Here.

315
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,480
[Relationship course. Anniversary. Play diary. Type record. Concert souvenir. Family photos. Beach day. Holiday together. Our gifts. Shopping.]

316
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,220
We only need the lace rims now.

317
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,220
I didn't expect your demand

318
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,420
to be a date.

319
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,300
You never did this in the past.

320
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,780
The past is the past.

321
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,940
I'll make you remember this day forever.

322
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,780
I will make you so happy that

323
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,660
you will come to my appointment

324
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,580
on time every year.

325
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,220
I'll get the door.

326
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,620
What is it?

327
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,820
Madam asked me to invite you home, Mr. Gu.

328
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,060
Next time.

329
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,380
Chairman Gu is back. You must go back.

330
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,300
What’s wrong?

331
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,860
The old man is back.

332
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,340
I have to go back.

333
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,580
Wait for me at home.

334
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,060
[Gu Residence]

335
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,100
Dad.

336
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,380
Even I can't make you come home anymore.

337
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,860
The past few days,

338
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,660
you didn't go to the company or come home.

339
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,580
Where did you go?

340
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,620
Dad, did something happen? Why are you suddenly home?

341
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,980
My son fell to a woman.

342
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,100
He doesn't even care about the company anymore.

343
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,500
If I didn't come back,

344
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,940
Anxia might collapse soon.

345
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,140
I gave you freedom for the past few days.

346
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,540
You should have had enough fun.

347
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,420
Listen to your dad.

348
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,380
Break up with Qiao Jing.

349
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,420
Dad.

350
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,140
Mom.

351
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,180
Qiao Jing and I can't break up.

352
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,740
It doesn't matter who says otherwise.

353
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,300
I have something to do. I have to go.

354
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,660
Gu Yi.

355
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,450
Gu Yi!

356
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,700
Get in.

357
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,580
I didn't know you could ride a motorcycle.

358
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,420
There are many things you don't know.

359
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,340
Everything was arranged according to your checklist.

360
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,580
Did I miss anything?

361
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,180
It's exactly what I thought it would be.

362
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,930
I told you to wait for me at home.

363
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,340
Why did you do this alone?

364
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,100
I was worried,

365
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,740
so I went to see you.

366
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,300
When you met Chairman Gu in the past,

367
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,010
the two of you would argue 80% of the time.

368
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,820
You must understand it by now.

369
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,740
The Gu family is just a mess of scattered sand.

370
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,940
Actually, sometimes I envy you.

371
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,540
You have hot food as soon as you get home,

372
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,180
instead of a cold quarrel.

373
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,820
No one can

374
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,180
choose their own family.

375
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,940
All we can do

376
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,820
is to accept

377
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,020
or change.

378
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,660
I can't choose the family that gave birth to and raised me.

379
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,580
But I can choose the right person

380
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,740
and build a warm home with her.

381
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,420
It's hot. The cake is melting.

382
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Wait.

383
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,380
If you cut it like this,

384
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,850
our names will be separated.

385
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,900
What should we do?

386
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,860
Like this.

387
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,140
This way, they won't be separated.

388
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,340
Here.

389
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,660
I hope every year on this day,

390
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,020
you can stay by my side

391
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,780
like now.

392
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,020
You talk too much.

393
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,780
Don't drink too much.

394
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,580
Are you worried that something might happen to Su Juan's heart?

395
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,180
That's not what I meant.

396
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,620
It's just that

397
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,400
your recent attitude

398
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,380
and reaction

399
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,540
are a bit hard for me to get used to.

400
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,940
Why am I like this?

401
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,140
Do you really not understand?

402
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,980
I want to cover the traces

403
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Su Juan left in your heart.

404
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,580
But you don't want to

405
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,740
get out of the past.

406
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,250
I...

407
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,580
I'm sorry.

408
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,620
I was wrong from the beginning.

409
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,580
I shouldn't have tried to find traces of Su Juan in you,

410
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,900
or see you as his shadow.

411
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,460
I don't need your apology.

412
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,620
Qiao Jing.

413
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,860
Let me ask you.

414
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,420
Who is the man in front of you right now?

415
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,620
Su Juan,

416
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,460
or Gu Yi?

417
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,660
Gu Yi.

418
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,140
You're Gu Yi.

419
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,370
Sorry.

420
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,660
If you don't want to do this, I...

421
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,420
Give me one.

422
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,100
Your hand is for holding my hand.

423
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,940
Hello?

424
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,020
Hello, Ms. Qiao.

425
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,700
Is Mr. Gu beside you?

426
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,220
Yes.

427
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,620
A business partner is here.

428
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,700
He wants to see Mr. Gu.

429
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,820
But we...

430
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,740
Okay, I got it.

431
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,940
Mr. Gu, you've been absent for too long.

432
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,340
It's time to go to work.

433
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,620
But I still don't want to leave you, what do we do?

434
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,660
Alright, stop cheating.

435
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,820
I'll bring you food later.

436
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,100
Okay.

437
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,300
I'll wait for you.

438
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,940
That's too much.

439
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
I'll wait for you.

440
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,900
Hello.

441
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,940
Who are you?

442
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,170
Miss Qiao, Chairman Gu wants to see you.

443
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,660
Miss Qiao, please come in.

444
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,860
Chairman Gu is waiting for you inside.

445
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,820
Miss Qiao.

446
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,980
We meet again.

447
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,530
Chairman Gu, how are you doing?

448
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,460
Still the same.

449
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,900
Don't worry about me.

450
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,500
Chairman Gu, I've resigned.

451
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,180
Why did you ask me here today?

452
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,700
Have a seat.

453
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,300
I didn't ask you here for work.

454
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,530
I want to talk about you and Gu Yi.

455
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,940
For you, Gu Yi

456
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,060
rejected his marriage with the Bai family,

457
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,770
and neglected his company duties.

458
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,450
Do you think

459
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,420
he really loves you?

460
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,100
Qiao Jing.

461
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,460
Didn't you say you'd deliver food to me?

462
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,420
But you didn't answer my calls.

463
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,500
What are you doing?

464
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,820
Qiao Jing?

465
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,060
The Gu family has never had a lover.

466
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,780
But they all love to act like one.

467
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,940
When I was young,

468
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,090
I met someone I liked too.

469
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
But in the end,

470
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,380
I married my current wife.

471
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,500
People usually realize,

472
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,700
after calming down,

473
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,260
that their devotion to someone

474
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,890
was just a momentary obsession.

475
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,140
Gu Yi is not like you.

476
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,580
He's just like me.

477
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,180
He's from the Gu family.

478
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,380
He has to bear the responsibility of the Gu family.

479
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,220
He's a businessman.

480
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,620
He will understand sooner or later.

481
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,530
Love

482
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,460
is a losing deal.

483
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,340
Miss Qiao,

484
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,180
you should know your place.

485
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,820
Mr. Gu has arrived. He's waiting for you outside.

486
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,420
Miss Qiao, it's raining heavily outside.

487
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,220
It's remote here.

488
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,780
Please stay here until the rain has stopped.

489
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,740
Please.

490
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,739
Where is Qiao Jing?

491
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
Why are you panicking?

492
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,219
I just wanted to chat with her.

493
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,260
Look at you.

494
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,460
Look at what you've become.

495
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,179
Dad, just come to me if you need anything.

496
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,340
Don't get her involved.

497
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,260
You're the one who got her involved.

498
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,980
If you really care about her,

499
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,380
you should stop pestering her.

500
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,260
Gu Yi, snap out of it.

501
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,780
You are the heir of the Gu family.

502
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,460
From the moment you were born,

503
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,780
you have

504
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,780
what others could never have.

505
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,940
But these

506
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,139
are not from the sky.

507
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,699
You have to give

508
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,860
as much as you have taken.

509
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,660
To marry a woman from a good family and support the family business,

510
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,060
is only one of the

511
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,380
sacrifices you have to make.

512
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,580
Why do I have to make a choice?

513
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,820
I can do both.

514
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,210
I'll do my best in love and career.

515
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,940
Don't be too greedy.

516
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,340
Dad.

517
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,340
Have you ever loved anyone?

518
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,860
What love?

519
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,020
It's insignificant.

520
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,460
Life goes on.

521
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,580
Let's go.

522
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,260
Dad.

523
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,660
Let's go.

524
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,610
♫Hold your breath and lower your head♫

525
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,740
♫The moonlight of the night slips through the window♫

526
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,810
♫I'm feeling weak, hold my hand♫

527
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,900
♫I can't control my feelings♫

528
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,190
♫The air suddenly becomes thin♫

529
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,300
Let's go home.

530
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,420
♫Memories are separated♫

531
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,970
♫The air suffocated me♫

532
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,010
♫I cross my arms before my chest♫

533
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:01,330
♫Tears can't stop falling♫

534
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,190
♫Maybe it's the end♫

535
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,160
♫I get up♫

536
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,900
♫Looking at the end at a distance, the blocked road♫

537
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,420
He used to be a sharp knife.

538
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,940
♫Where should I go?♫

539
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,060
But it's blunt now.

540
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,220
We can't leave the company to him.
