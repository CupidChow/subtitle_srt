There's a bed there.

192
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,700
It's more comfortable than the chair in your office.

193
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,140
And you, don't always sleep late.

194
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,340
Don't rush to work every day.

195
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,260
If you miss the elevator,

196
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,220
you'll be late.

197
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,300
No, I'll miss you.

198
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,940
Right, why don't you reconsider it?

199
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,540
Right, Ms. Qiao, think about it.

200
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,020
Alright, stop persuading me.

201
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,620
Let's celebrate my freedom.

202
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,380
Come on.

203
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,740
Come on.

204
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,500
To freedom.

205
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,900
Now both families have eaten together

206
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,980
and it's settled.

207
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
You're getting engaged to Bai Yun.

208
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,740
I can be relieved.

209
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,130
What are you going to do about the engagement?

210
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,940
Do you have any idea about the venue decorations?

211
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,020
Mom, it's up to you.

212
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,180
This is an important event of your life.

213
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,620
Can't you put more effort into it?

214
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,780
Hello?

215
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,540
Son.

216
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
I'm talking to you.

217
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,140
Did you hear me?

218
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,580
Hello?

219
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,740
It's over between us.

220
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,540
Have you really made up your mind?

221
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,940
Maybe I should have done it earlier.

222
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,220
I have a very important phone conference

223
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,820
on Wednesday afternoon.

224
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,740
but my schedule says I'm boarding at 1:30 p.m.

225
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,780
No.

226
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,380
The version I gave to Ms. Bai

227
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,420
is not like that.

228
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,540
Then why is one page missing?

229
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,940
Maybe Tang Ping missed it.

230
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,940
Mr. Gu,

231
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,700
the electronic version I sent is complete.

232
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,820
You can check it anytime.

233
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
Then who made this work schedule

234
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,540
full of flaws?

235
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,780
I just saw that your work progress is too slow.

236
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,100
I wanted to help you.

237
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,020
Who asked you to interfere in my work?

238
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,180
Ms. Qiao left.

239
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,620
I just want to help you.

240
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,540
I don't need it.

241
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,140
Do it again.

242
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,100
Let's go.

243
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,420
From tomorrow onwards,

244
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,780
you don't have to come to work.

245
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,180
Go back and prepare for the engagement ceremony.

246
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,940
Why?

247
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
Do you think I'm not as good as her?

248
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,140
Are you still thinking about her?

249
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,740
How is that possible?

250
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,700
She's just a secretary.

251
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,940
What's there to be sad about?

252
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,380
Go.

253
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,860
I...

254
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,780
Get out.

255
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,580
[Gu Yi]

256
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,540
Come downstairs.

257
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,900
I'll knock on the door

258
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,100
if I don't see you in three minutes.

259
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,980
Get in.

260
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,130
Get in.

261
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,660
How did you know I was here?

262
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,300
I know your background.

263
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,540
As long as I want to,

264
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,980
no matter where you go,

265
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,940
I'll find you.

266
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,970
Why are you here at this hour?

267
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,140
I'll go upstairs if there's nothing else.

268
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,380
When are you going to stop making a scene?

269
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,140
I'm not.

270
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,740
I meant everything I said.

271
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,340
What's your problem?

272
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,970
Just because I didn't celebrate your birthday with you?

273
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,660
I'm going upstairs.

274
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,780
What do you want?

275
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,300
As long as you ask for it,

276
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,220
I can give you whatever you want.

277
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,980
I don't want those.

278
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,220
I want you to leave me.

279
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,540
Impossible.

280
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,340
Gu Yi.

281
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,660
Your mother has already come to me.

282
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,380
You're getting engaged to Bai Yun soon.

283
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,180
What's the point of doing this now?

284
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,900
It's over between us.

285
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,460
I don't want to see you again.

286
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,780
What are you doing so early in the morning?

287
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,380
I found a new place.

288
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,300
I'll move out later.

289
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,260
When did that happen?

290
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,220
Why all of a sudden?

291
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,610
I found it last night.

292
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,980
Tell me the truth. Why did you leave?

293
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,860
Did that Gu Yi threaten you

294
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,700
and asked you to leave?

295
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,100
Of course not.

296
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,100
You do live streaming every day.

297
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,380
Our schedules are different.

298
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,980
I'm disturbing you staying here.

299
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,780
I'm just busy for this period.

300
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,140
I'll be fine in a few days.

301
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,500
I can't stay here forever.

302
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,540
Come on, I'll take care of myself.

303
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,180
Don't worry.

304
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,380
By the way,

305
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,660
Here's your key.

306
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,820
I can't persuade you

307
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,140
on anything you decide on.

308
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,820
But take the key.

309
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,580
Feel free to come back anytime.

310
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,740
Okay.

311
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,420
Ms. Qiao, sorry to bother you.

312
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,660
There's something wrong with our hotel system.

313
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,220
Someone booked this room online.

314
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,100
But we will compensate you

315
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,740
and upgrade your room

316
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,100
for free.

317
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,180
What do you think?

318
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,180
No need.

319
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,740
Just get me another one.

320
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,780
All our other rooms are full now.

321
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,540
Only the presidential suite is available.

322
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,780
Alright then, thank you.

323
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,300
It's okay. It's my duty.

324
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,980
Ms. Qiao, your room is ahead.

325
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,780
Okay.

326
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,380
Enjoy your stay.

327
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,100
Thank you.

328
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,820
Qiao Jing,

329
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,260
You could've said you wanted to stay at a hotel.

330
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,980
I can stay with you.

331
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,300
Are you bored?

332
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,300
No.

333
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,980
Of course not.

334
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,340
It's kind of interesting to play cat and mouse

335
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,180
with you sometimes, isn't it?

336
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,820
I told you

337
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,490
no matter where you go,

338
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,580
I will find you.

339
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,180
Gu Yi,

340
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
can you stop being so willful?

341
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,860
Have you even considered

342
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,940
what I told you last night?

343
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,620
My engagement with Bai Yun

344
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,740
is just a business alliance.

345
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,460
It's our family and Anxia who needs the Bai family.

346
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,380
But don't worry.

347
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,780
I thought you had mood disorders,

348
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,740
that's why you lack sympathy

349
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
and didn't know how to respect anyone.

350
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
I can understand all of that.

351
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
But now,

352
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,540
how could you

353
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,900
say such a thing?

354
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,660
I have no limits to how low I can stoop.

355
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,580
[Bai Yan]

356
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,500
[Bai Yan]

357
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,140
Thank you for tonight.

358
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,260
Thank you.

359
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,820
You're welcome.

360
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,340
I'm glad you called me.

361
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,780
This means you trust me.

362
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,940
Where are we going now?

363
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,660
We'll be there soon.

364
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,100
This is the hostel I designed before.

365
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,660
I stopped running it after I went abroad.

366
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,380
But there is always someone

367
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,980
taking care of the flowers and plants here.

368
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,020
Although it's a bit old,

369
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,180
it's still clean.

370
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,540
You can stay here for now.

371
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,340
There's a staircase here

372
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,420
that leads to the second floor.

373
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,700
There are a few bedrooms here.

374
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,940
You can choose any one.

375
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,340
That's the living room.

376
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,340
Mr. Bai,

377
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,420
I don’t know how to thank you.

378
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,660
You don't have to tell me this.

379
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,820
I know something about what you're going through.

380
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,140
Gu Yi will be engaged to my cousin at the end of the month.

381
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,740
Until then,

382
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,900
you can rest here safely.

383
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,300
What about the rent?

384
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,500
It's such a big place.

385
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,820
It must cost a lot.

386
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,780
We don't need to talk about this between us.

387
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,620
Mr. Bai,

388
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,380
I must pay the rent.

389
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,860
You've helped me a lot.

390
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,260
If you don't accept it,

391
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,060
I'll have to find another place.

392
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,260
Okay.

393
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,100
Let's set it at the price of a double bed room.

394
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,420
You can help take care of these flowers and plants for me too.

395
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,300
By the way,

396
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,580
you have to promise me one more thing.

397
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,940
What is it?

398
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,940
Don't call me Mr. Bai anymore.

399
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,300
Call me Bai Yan.

400
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,060
Bai Yan.

401
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,220
Have you found her?

402
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,980
I've been looking all day. I'm exhausted.

403
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,740
She didn't go to her friend's place.

404
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,900
There's no news of her at any of the

405
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,060
hotels, rentals, airport, or the bus stations.

406
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,900
Keep looking.

407
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,820
I don't believe she can keep hiding.

408
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,300
Why don't you forget it.

409
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,300
You broke up with her.

410
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,540
Besides,

411
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,700
you're going to get engaged with Yun.

412
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,580
This isn't a good time

413
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,620
to be making such a big fuss

414
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,700
for another woman.

415
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,420
I will let her go.

416
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,140
But not now.

417
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,580
Anyway,

418
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,260
you think about who is more important

419
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,580
between Yun and Qiao Jing.

420
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,140
All right, I'm going to eat something nice.

421
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,900
You'll be reimbursing me.

422
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,300
Qiao Jing.

423
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,180
Where are you?

424
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,860
Not many people in Nancheng can say they've eaten

425
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,260
dishes cooked by Secretary Qiao.

426
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,540
It's not that exaggerated. Try it.

427
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,380
Okay.

428
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,260
This seems to be

429
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,180
from a five-star restaurant.

430
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,100
I knew you were a good cook.

431
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,740
but I didn't expect it to be so good.

432
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,420
I didn't know how to cook before.

433
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,540
If it weren't for Gu Yi being picky.

434
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,900
Leaving him

435
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,570
is a good thing for you.

436
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,940
He is not worthy of your trust

437
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,500
and he doesn't deserve you being sad over him.

438
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,180
He'll be your cousin-in-law soon.

439
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,740
Why aren't you speaking for him?

440
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,180
Although Bai Yun and I are cousins,

441
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,940
we don't usually get in touch.

442
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,500
People say that Gu Yi has sharp eyes,

443
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,460
but I don't think so.

444
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,300
Why?

445
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,180
If he really had a good taste,

446
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,220
he wouldn't mistake jade for a common rock.

447
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,210
Gu Yi is blind

448
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,180
to your good qualities

449
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,860
but someone else can cherish it.

450
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Don't mention him.

451
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,100
The dishes are cold.

452
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
Let's eat.

453
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,020
Okay.

454
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,500
Who is that man?

455
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,980
It's Bai Yan.

456
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,220
Where is she?

457
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,460
Who are you asking?

458
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,260
Qiao Jing.

459
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,500
I can tell you nothing.

460
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,300
Who do you think you are?

461
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,660
How dare you meddle in our business?

462
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Hand her over.

463
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,700
Qiao Jing has broken up with you.

464
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,900
There's no more "our" between you and her.

465
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,780
Gu Yi, calm down.

466
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,820
-Childish. Qiao Jing, you don't deserve it.
-Calm down.

467
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,100
Go!

468
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,340
Let go!
