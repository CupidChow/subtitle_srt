00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,740
This ungrateful bastard.

5
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,940
You treated him so well.

6
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,020
How dare he do such a thing?

7
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,780
No, I have to ask him now.

8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,740
What did the Gu family do to him?

People change.

11
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,300
We can’t understand nor stop them.

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,060
Zhou Rui and I

13
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,380
are no longer on the same path.

14
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,460
But we can't just let it go.

15
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:16,060
With Chen Lan's testimony,

16
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,780
we've found a breakthrough.

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,500
Anxia withdrew the lawsuit.

18
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,850
How come?

19
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,860
Yang Yang said the president just received a reply from the lawyer.

20
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,979
Su Juan and the others wanted Chen Lan

21
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,460
to take the rap.

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,380
But Chen Lan told the truth,

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
so Zhou Rui must also be held accountable.

24
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,060
Anxia is withdrawing the lawsuit now

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,700
to save Zhou Rui

26
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,140
and remove him from the matter.

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,979
Su Juan's reach in the company is outrageous.

28
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,100
Let's go to your dad now.

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,340
I want to see

30

if there's really no one who can deal with him.

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,380
Mom, take a seat.

32

Dad needs to rest now.

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,980
We'd better leave him alone.

34
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,380
I'll settle this myself.

35
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,380
Why did you withdraw the lawsuit?

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,900
I didn't want to deal with

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,940
the mess my predecessor left me anymore.

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,180
Plus, Anxia's reputation couldn't take the hit.

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
You wanted to stop

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,420
because your true colors were showing, right?

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,100
Let me tell you.

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,500
This concerns the company's interests.

43

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,340
Before you withdrew the lawsuit,

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,420
did you ask Dad?

50
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,220
Did he agree?

He's already halfway inside his coffin.

I didn't want to listen,

I found that he always made my mom angry.

But I don’t understand.

162
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,300
How could your dad leave the company to him?

163
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,940
The company must be yours.

164
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,340
Dad must be disappointed in me.

165

Look at your dad.

174

He didn't like me.

175
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,620
Why did he bring this photo around with him in his wallet

176
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,540
everywhere he went?

177
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,140
When I first met your dad,

178
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,180
he was a boss of a small company.

179
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,060
He had no money

180
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,860
and no backers.

181
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,780
He wooed me

182
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,420
just with his mouth.

183
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,540
I must have lost my mind

184
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,540
when I insisted on marrying him.

185
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,580
In the end,

186
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,460
the business became bigger and bigger.

187
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,380
Our relationship

188
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,380
got worse and worse.

189
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,300
I fought and quarreled with him

190
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,100
for a whole lifetime.

191
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,980
How could he leave just like that?

192
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,100
Mom.

193
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,740
You still have me.

194
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,780
Are you hungry? I'll cook some noodles for you.

195
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,940
I'm not hungry.

196
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,260
Don't bother. Have a rest.

197
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,420
What is this?

198
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,340
It's a birthday gift from my dad.

199
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,060
It's the first time we played with legos together.

200
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,780
I didn't expect

201
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,260
that to be the last time.

202
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,780
Later, there was once I quarreled with him.

203
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,380
I was so angry that I broke it.

204
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
I didn't expect my dad

205
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,460
to gather all the pieces back.

206
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,620
He's kept them until now.

207
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,860
President Gu has always loved you.

208
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,300
Qiao Jing, let's put it back together.

209
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,580
OK.

210
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,780
Lawyer Zhao, we're not suspecting you.

211
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,940
It's just that

212
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,180
I thought about the will all night.

213
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,260
I still don't understand

214
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
President Gu's arrangements.

215
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,460
I didn't know beforehand

216
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,380
that his physical condition was not very good.

217
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,180
When I arrived,

218
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,980
he handed me

219
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,180
a sealed document,

220
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,700
saying the will was inside.

221
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,900
He told me to keep it safe

222
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,460
and not to open it until he passed away.

223
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,580
Was Su Juan there?

224
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,090
Only President Gu and I were there.

225
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,420
This will

226
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,180
should have come from himself.

227
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,140
I know you have doubts about Su Juan.

228
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,780
But the fact is that

229
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,500
President Gu died of an illness.

230
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,420
It has nothing to do with anyone.

231
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,700
To be honest,

232
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,380
I also think President Gu’s arrangements are weird.

233
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,410
But who knows

234
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,260
what President Gu was thinking?

235
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,020
What are you doing here?

236
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,610
I just went to see Yun.

237
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,380
This is from her.

238
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,820
Qiao Jing,

239
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,340
there's something I should have told you a long time ago.

240
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,500
But I was too weak back then.

241
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,420
This is the only way

242
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
I can apologize to you.

243
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,980
I know

244
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,220
this cannot make up for the hurt I caused you.

245
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,660
I don't expect you to forgive me.

246
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,460
But I still want to apologize to you.

247
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,819
I didn't understand this before.

248
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,020
You were inferior to me in every aspect,

249
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,940
so how did you get Gu Yi's love?

250
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,579
Now I understand

251
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,819
I was the one

252
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,820
who was inferior in every aspect.

253
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,890
So,

254
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,300
I sincerely wish the best for the two of you.

255
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,220
Yun was sentenced to two years for assault.

256
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,300
She really let it go.

257
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,460
You must be happy

258
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,180
to see her like this.

259
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,620
Even she has come to terms with things.

260
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,660
How long more are you going to wallow in self-pity?

261
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,100
Gu Yi really thinks of you like a brother.

262
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,100
He is the last person you should hurt.

263
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,020
What do you know about us?

264
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,420
I don't know anything.

265
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,210
But I still want to tell you

266
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,700
to stop hurting the people who love you

267
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,220
in the name of love.

268
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,620
The handover ceremony is about to begin.

269
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,580
We can't let down our guard.

270
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,700
Is there any news from Gu Yi?

271
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,100
They went to see Zhao Ming.

272
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,980
What's the use of seeing Zhao Ming?

273
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,940
When Gu Nan was alive,

274
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,500
there was someone with him at all times.

275
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,660
Even if I had contact with him,

276
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,540
there's only one will.

277
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,660
The division of the inheritance

278
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,900
is final.

279
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,220
What tricks can he play?

280
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,620
He's here.

281
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,140
Mr. Su.

282
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,740
President Gu's important documents,

283
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,940
certificates, and safe

284
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,700
are here.

285
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,420
Thank you, Assistant Lü.

286
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,220
Where does this go?

287
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,980
I didn't find it on the diagram

288
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,260
I remember when I did this with my dad,

289
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,060
there were just enough pieces.

290
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,380
Plus, the color scheme of this castle

291
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,810
is grey and beige.

292
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,620
This extra red piece

293
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,420
doesn't seem to be part of the original.

294
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,100
This is the only one.

295
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,820
It's normal to have extra pieces

296
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,020
in this kind of toy, right?

297
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,140
Are you thinking too much?

298
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,500
Mom, after Dad passed away,

299
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,740
did anyone touch his things?

300
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,900
Since he fell ill,

301
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,700
I've been the one tidying up his room.

302
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,900
No one else has been inside.

303
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,340
Your dad was the only one who has opened that cabinet.

304
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,660
Right, the housekeeper told me

305
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,700
that half a month ago,

306
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,140
your dad opened the cabinet

307
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,420
and rummaged through the things inside.

308
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,860
My dad never does things without a reason.

309
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,380
There must be important information

310
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,860
in this extra piece.

311
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,620
President Gu always has his reasons for doing things.

312
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,820
This piece is number 0407.

313
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,180
Do you know what it means?

314
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,140
0407.

315
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,380
This is our wedding anniversary.

316
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,460
That means

317
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,020
it's not a coincidence

318
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,220
that this is the only extra piece.

319
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,060
Your dad

320
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,820
has always liked riddles.

321
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,380
Let's go back now.

322
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,660
Take these numbers

323
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,540
and find your dad's safe

324
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,860
to see if it's the password.

325
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,020
Okay.

326
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,980
Assistant Lü.

327
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,140
Who gave you the right

328
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,620
to send all the documents and the safe

329
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,060
to Su Juan?

330
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,620
Madam,

331
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,300
Mr. Su has taken over Anxia.

332
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,620
It’s reasonable to hand them to him.

333
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,220
You...

334
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,860
Mom.

335
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,500
Assistant Lü, you can go now.

336
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,620
Thank you.

337
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,500
Mom.

338
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,900
No, I have to get everything back

339
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,020
from Su Juan.

340
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,660
Mom, it won't be easy

341
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,780
to get them back from Su Juan.

342
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,620
If we pay extra attention

343
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,740
to the safe,

344
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,020
he will get suspicious.

345
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,340
It's our honor

346
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,420
to work with Anxia.

347
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,220
I’m also looking forward to this collaboration.

348
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,500
Mrs. Gu, you can’t go in.

349
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,620
Mr. Su is in a meeting.

350
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,420
Mr. Su.

351
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,140
Sorry, I couldn’t stop her.

352
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,220
Su Juan.

353
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,100
Gu Nan and I bought a villa

354
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,970
in Mingyuehu Resort ten years ago.

355
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,700
Doesn't it count as a joint owned property?

356
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,820
He promised me

357
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,220
the three rows in front are mine.

358
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,980
Where is the property title deed?

359
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,420
Mom, why are you making a fuss here?

360
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,180
It's embarrassing.

361
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
We don't want that anymore.

362
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,020
We don't?

363
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,620
Do you like getting the shorter end of the stick?

364
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,860
You don't want anythng.

365
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,940
You weren't worried even though you lost the company.

366
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,020
Now, you don’t even want the house.

367
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,220
Aunt Fang, I’m in a meeting.

368
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,580
Can we talk about this later?

369
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,620
When?

370
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,220
When you've transferred the house under your name?

371
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm telling you.

372
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,420
If you don't give me the property title deed,

373
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,220
I'll sue you for theft.

374
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,860
Mom, let's go first.

375
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,780
Go where?

376
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,140
I'm not going anywhere

377
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,140
if I don't get that title deed.

378
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,900
Mr. Su,

379
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,860
I think you have something to deal with.

380
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,780
Let's talk next time.

381
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,980
Take care.

382
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,700
Su Juan, the title deed.

383
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,820
Aunt Fang,

384
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,180
I will give you what you want.

385
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,740
But I hope

386
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,180
this is the last time.

387
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,540
If this happens again,

388
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,300
don't make a scene at the company.

389
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,220
Dad's stuff is all here.

390
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,900
Do you remember which cabinet it was in?

391
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,540
It's been too long.

392
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,620
I don't remember.

393
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
I only remember

394
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,940
it was in an old

395
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,900
and big safe.

396
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,420
This is it.

397
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,860
There are many confidential documents in it.

398
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,540
My time is limited.

399
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,740
And I have a lot of things to deal with in the company.

400
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,260
These are Anxia's accounts from the past ten years.

401
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,820
I've taken inventory.

402
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,460
There's nothing else.

403
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,220
It must be this one then.

404
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,620
These are the official seals.

405
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,620
Aunt Fang, you’d better figure out

406
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,820
where the thing you want is.

407
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,020
Mom, is it that cabinet, 0407?

408
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,540
I remember Dad said

409
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,420
the things in the cabinet

410
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,460
are all gifts for you.

411
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,100
Yes, it must be that.

412
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,220
Are you sure?

413
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,220
Yes.

414
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,500
It seems that I don't have

415
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,820
what you want.

416
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,340
Please go back.

417
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,220
Let's go.

418
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,220
Don't forget your bag.

419
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,100
At first, I thought 0407 was the password.

420
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,420
But then I realized

421
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
it wasn't the password.

422
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,020
It's the serial number of the safe.

423
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,940
Yes.

424
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,860
We saw that safe

425
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,020
when your dad and I

426
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,220
went on a trip together.

427
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,820
The number was the same as our wedding anniversary.

428
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,740
I thought it was fate,

429
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,020
so I bought it.

430
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,820
I didn't expect

431
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,220
the clue your dad put in so much effort to leave

432
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,900
to be an empty safe.

433
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,620
My dad would never

434
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,900
do anything without a reason.

435
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,820
Maybe the things inside

436
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,380
had been taken away.

437
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,700
Damn it.

438
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,820
Lawyer Zhao.

439
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,300
Mr. Gu, is Mrs. Gu here?

440
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,980
Yes.

441
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,020
Mrs. Gu.

442
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,380
Lawyer Zhao.

443
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,580
After you left that day,

444
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,100
I checked President Gu's will again,

445
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,250
carefully.

446
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,660
I found something.

447
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,420
Lawyer Zhao.

448
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,220
Everything is inside.

449
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,420
Before I pass away,

450
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,300
no one is to open it.

451
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,060
When President Gu gave me the will,

452
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,020
the seal was yellow.

453
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,660
But the seal on the current copy

454
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,380
is new.

455
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,660
I didn't realize it then.

456
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,700
The more I think about it, the weirder it is.

457
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,220
I suspect the will had been swapped.

458
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,700
The only one who could do this

459
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,820
is Su Juan.

460
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,820
But these are just speculations.

461
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,020
We don't have solid evidence

462
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,340
that he forged the will.

463
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,060
The clue my dad left is a dead end, too.

464
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,780
Lawyer Zhao,

465
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,500
haven't you been taking care

466
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,410
of Gu Nan's safe and documents?

467
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,380
Not entirely.

468
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,820
I'm just in charge of

469
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,940
his art and collections.

470
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,380
There's a safe number 0407.

471
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,420
Do you remember it?

472
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,220
The last time President Gu stored things

473
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,860
was in that safe.

474
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,420
He stored a painting.

475
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,700
Painting?

476
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,740
I work overtime and stay up late every day.

477
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
When will this end?

478
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,300
Stop skiving off.

479
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,020
Mr. Su’s inauguration ceremony is coming.

480
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,460
We still have a lot to do.

481
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,780
Poor Mr. Gu.

482
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,860
He lost completely this time.

483
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,500
Isn't Mr. Gu starting a business?

484
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,300
Why don't we join his company?

485
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,420
Yes.

486
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Maybe we can even

487
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,780
get a bonus

488
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,380
as his first batch of employees.

489
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,740
Yes.

490
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,980
Ms. Qiao.

491
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,740
Ms. Qiao.

492
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,340
Why are you here?

493
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,900
I was just passing by

494
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,380
so I came up to chat with you

495
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,820
and treat you to afternoon tea.

496
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,860
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

497
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,820
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

498
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,620
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

499
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,580
Share it.

500
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,460
Ms. Qiao, we were just talking about you.

501
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,660
We heard that you and Mr. Gu

502
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,700
are starting a business.

503
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,340
Are you still short of people?

504
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,380
Definitely,

505
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,660
if you're willing to come.

506
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,020
What did I say? Thank you again.

507
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,420
Hello?

508
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
We'll be there in five minutes.

509
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,420
Another project meeting?

510
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,300
Ms. Qiao, we have to go.

511
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,020
How long will you be gone for?

512
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,420
I'll wait for you.

513
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,620
It'll be half an hour.

514
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,740
Wait for us.

515
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,740
Alright.

516
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,780
Okay, let's go.

517
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,420
Let's go.

518
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,700
Go on.

519
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,500
See you.
