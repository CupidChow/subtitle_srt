[Episode 11]

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,460
Why did you bring me here?

5
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,900
I want to show you something.

6
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,630
[May Qiao Jing get into Nancheng University successfully]

7
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,340
Look.

8
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,660
This is the first tag I hung.

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,289
I know.

10
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,260
After you left, every year

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,220
[I hope Su Juan comes back safely]

12
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,880
I'd come and hang a tag for you.

13
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,230
Before I left,

14
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,590
you said you had something important to tell me.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,350
Are you still willing to tell me,

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,200
now?

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,110
I often thought about it.

18
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,100
If that car accident hadn't happened,

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,830
we wouldn't have been apart for four years.

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,289
What would our future have been like?

21
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,300
We can't go back

22
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,240
to that future.

23
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,310
I used to struggle too.

24
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,830
I was unwilling too.

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,720
I even tried to find someone else to numb myself.

26
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,830
But now I realize

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,400
sometimes we need to learn

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,210
to accept changes in life.

29
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,660
Do you remember

30
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,460
the book we read together?

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,750
There's a saying in it.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,610
As long as there are one or two things that we are certain of,

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,240
we can resist all kinds of uncertainties in the world.

34
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,290
I'm back.

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,530
I'm sure of my heart.

36
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,380
So we can still have a future.

37
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,010
Su- Su.

38
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,390
Aren't you dead?

39
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,579
Touch wood! How are you still alive?

40
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,430
What's going on?

41
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,610
That's enough. Slow down.

42
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,370
This...

43
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,630
Does it hurt?

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,020
Of course it hurts.

45
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,030
Am I dreaming?

46
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,810
You're still the same.

47
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,070
You're speechless when you get excited.

48
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:40,630
Su,

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,390
where have you been all these years?

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,610
Qiao Jing

51
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,630
cried so many times for you.

52
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,110
It's a long story.

53
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,920
It's good that you're back safely.

54
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,890
Yes, that's good.

55
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,530
You'll be blessed after you survive a catastrophe.

56
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,880
Li.

57
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,010
Young Master Su.

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Let me do it.

59
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,210
Okay.

60
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,550
Dad.

61
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,310
Juan.

62
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,250
It's time to take your medicine.

63
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,769
Didn't I tell you?

64
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,959
You don't need to come if you're busy.

65
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,480
It's the weekend. I'm not busy.

66
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,900
Besides,

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,950
you just changed your medication.

68
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,470
I'm worried that Li can't figure it out.

69
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,040
How are you doing in the company?

70
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,850
Do you find anything hard to adjust to?

71
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,659
Did Yi bully you?

72
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,810
No, he takes good care of me.

73
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,200
I have Uncle Jiang.

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,460
I'll ask him if I have any questions.

75
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,720
Yes.

76
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,210
When Anxia just started,

77
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,270
Jiang Sheng did a lot for the company.

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,880
I’m relieved that he's here to help you.

79
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,190
Dad.

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,370
What took you so long?

81
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,310
I played chess with him for awhile

82
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,830
after making sure he took his medicine.

83
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,140
I left after making sure he fell asleep.

84
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,550
It's important to keep Gu Nan on our side.

85
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,700
But he won't last long.

86
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,010
You need more help.

87
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,200
You mean...

88
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,810
I know Qiao Jing is a good girl.

89
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,460
But she can't help you.

90
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,610
You're different from Gu Yi after all.

91
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,230
Gu Yi can do anything he wants when it comes to Qiao Jing

92
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,370
because he has Fang Pei supporting him,

93
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,860
and a group of blood relatives and friends who support him.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
What about you?

95
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:54,940
Yes.

96
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,130
Gu Nan is on your side now.

97
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,660
But one day if he's gone,

98
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,850
how sure are you

99
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,410
that how many of them will be on your side?

100
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,190
I don't mean anything else.

101
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,220
I'm not saying I want you to cut off contact with Qiao Jing.

102
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,910
I just want to remind you

103
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,430
not to forget your purpose.

104
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,500
Uncle Jiang.

105
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,400
I won't forget it.

106
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,409
That's good.

107
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,020
The Gu family has been clinging to the Bai family.

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,250
It shows that the Bai family is powerful.

109
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,560
You must seize the chance.

110
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,810
Gu Yi broke off the engagement and caused a lot of trouble.

111
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,500
Will the Bai family still accept the Gu family?

112
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,409
The Bai and Gu families are connected.

113
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,600
What they are unhappy about

114
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,030
is just Gu Yi.

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,260
How about I stay with you?

116
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,280
This is my first concert in China.

117
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,090
It's very important to me.

118
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,190
I want to practice the piano alone.

119
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,830
I invited many good friends

120
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,850
to watch this concert

121
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,860
to support you.

122
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,420
You really need to get prepared.

123
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,800
Okay, I know.

124
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,400
When have I ever embarrassed you?

125
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,880
Of course, my good daughter.

126
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,980
Then practice the piano well.

127
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,360
I'll pick you up in a few days.

128
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,380
Alright, my manager.

129
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,110
You're the best, right?

130
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,620
Why are you alone?

131
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,590
Where's Su?

132
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,400
He's on a business trip today.

133
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,090
You know his schedule very well.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
To be honest,

135
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,290
one is a childhood friend and the other is a prince charming.

136
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,420
Which one are you planning on choosing?

137
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,160
Neither.

138
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,250
Why?

139
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,440
If I have to choose, it must be Su.

140
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,630
The gentle and considerate long lost love.

141
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,760
Isn't he a better choice?

142
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,080
Or you don't like him anymore?

143
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,560
You've been thinking about him for so many years.

144
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,030
I did.

145
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,220
But...

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,880
It's different now.

147
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,860
It's okay.

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,750
Adults don't make choices.

149
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,880
Excuse me.

150
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,270
Excuse me.

151
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,840
Wait.

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,770
You bumped into me on such a wide road.

153
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,420
This is the only way to the Butterfly Valley.

154
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,680
And I rang the bell just now.

155
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,860
What do you mean?

156
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,990
Just because I didn't hear you pressing the bell

157
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,420
so I deserve to be hit by you?

158
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,650
That's not what I meant.

159
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,060
Why don't you sit down first?

160
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,400
Did you sprain your ankle?

161
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,920
It's nothing.

162
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,190
Let me take you to the hospital.

163
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,740
No need.

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't move.

165
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,470
It's quite serious,

166
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,940
but I don't think you hurt your bone.

167
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,480
You should be fine after spraying some medicine.

168
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,110
Be gentle.

169
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,240
Don't move.

170
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm Edel, a vacationer.

171
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,070
What about you?

172
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
Vidina.

173
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,190
What took you so long?

174
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,160
Don't touch me.

175
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,720
I miss you.

176
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,150
You want to coax me with these sweet words again?

177
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,750
Sorry, but I'm tired of it.

178
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,720
What should I do?

179
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,350
Tell me.

180
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,450
I'm willing to do anything.

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,430
I know I shouldn't lie to you.

182
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,400
But it was my mom's fault

183
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,620
that caused Su Juan to get into trouble.

184
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,430
I was afraid you'll leave me.

185
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,030
Qiao Jing,

186
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,510
I've never loved anyone in my life.

187
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,060
You're the first one.

188
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,710
I told you I wanted to be together forever.

"Ballade pour Adeline"

230
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,020

The Goddess of Love gave the statue life,

240
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,050

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,730
I'll bid it for you later.

378
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,340
Mr. Liu, excuse me.

379

Let's go.

381
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,280

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,380
Ms. Bai.

383
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,750
Yun.

384
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,360
I heard there are some nice jewels today.

385
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,790
If you like them,

386
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,180
let Yi bid them for you as a gift.

387
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,280
The Bai family are not short of that money.

388
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,050
We can afford it.

389
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,770
Mom.

390
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,340
Isn't that your eldest son?

391
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,910
This is Qiao Jing.

392
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,080
That is the illegitimate son of the Gu family

393
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,060
who came back a while ago.

394
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,000
His surname is Su, Su Juan.

395
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,550
We only have one son.

396
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,980
His name is Gu Yi.

397
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,760
Mom, I need to go to the bathroom.

398
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,200
I have something to tell you.

399
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,310
Should I call you Edel?

400
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,130
All of you in your family are good actors.

401
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,320
It must have been hard for you,

402
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,960
acting so hard at the resort in order to get close to me.

403
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,400
I really didn't know you were Bai Yun.

404
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,460
In my eyes,

405
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,940
you're the Vidina I accidentally bumped into.

406
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,170
I don't care if you're Edel or Su Juan,

407
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,560
it has nothing to do with me.

408
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,380
Mr. Gu, the members are all here.

409
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,310
Please take a seat.

410
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,710
Who arranged the seating? Such bad luck.

411
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,440
Do we need to change seats?

412
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,320
Look, the Gu family is quite present.

413
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,040
The woman surrounded by those two brothers

414
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,130
is not simple too.

415
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,640
She used to be Gu Yi's secretary.

416
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,040
Now she's Su Juan's partner.
