268

[The Plan for Mr. Gu's Proposal
Presenter: Tang Ping]

269
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,380
I did the opposite.

270
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,340
After conducting a large-scale survey,

271
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,620
I learned about some ways of proposing

272
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,420
which women hate the most nowadays.

273
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,780
Mr. Gu can avoid these ways.

274
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,100
The first one is grandstanding.

275
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,500
The man proposes suddenly in public

276
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,660
and encourage the people around them to cheer.

277
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,340
It makes the woman feel embarrassed.

278
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,460
The second one is emotional blackmail.

279
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,660
The man asks the relatives and friends to come secretly

280
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,740
and take the woman by surprise when he proposes.

281
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,860
If she refuses,

282
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,940
he will try to show her his loyalty,

283
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,660
moving himself, the relatives, and the friends.

284
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,500
It achieves his purpose of emotional blackmail.

285
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,460
The third one is persistence.

286
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,060
It is the most shameless way.

287
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,900
The man proposes to the woman.

288
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,460
If she refuses,

289
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,380
he won't let her go.

290
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,540
Judging by the above points,

291
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,740
I think the most critical reason for the failure

292
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,180
is that the relationship between the two people hasn't go that far.

293
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,860
If one person proposes rashly,

294
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,060
that person will definitely fail.

295
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,940
But Ms. Qiao and Mr. Gu

not to force her to agree,

300
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,220
but to show her my love, determination,

301

Whether to agree is one thing.

304
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,900
Whether to propose is another.

305
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,900
Mr. Gu, the next is my plan.

306
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,860

and how many people

374
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,500
are waiting to see you being replaced by Su Juan?

375
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,580
As long as you can coax Bai Yun...

376
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,020
Mom, I don't want to rely on the Bai family.

377
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,370
Even if you don't rely on them,

378
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,620
you can't make the two families fall out.

379
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,940
Otherwise, Su Juan would take advantage of it.

380
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,260
Besides,

381
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,660
Yun and you grew up together.

382
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
No matter for what reasons,

383
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,940
you should attend her concert.

384
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,590
[Anxia Group]

385
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,100
The next

386
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,460
is our plan for the Great Project.

387
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,030
[The Plan for Mr. Gu's Proposal]

388
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,140
The first part is the goal of this project.

389
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,940
The next part is a further implementation plan.

390
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,060
Can they be woven into a hat?

391
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,260
Mine is similar to yours.

392
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,740
I gave up.

393
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,660
It's so difficult.

394
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,300
Baby, I've done my best.

395
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,020
I'll buy you a ready-made one when you are born.

396
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,300
When are you going to tell the news to your mom?

397
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,700
After some days.

398
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,740
The doctor said the fetus's condition isn't stable yet.

399
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,500
What about Su?

400
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,740
Does he know it?

401
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,500
If he knows it,

402
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,740
he will be very upset.

403
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,460
I'll think about how to tell him.

404
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,050
Leave me alone.

405
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,460
You're drunk.

406
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,460
Leave me alone.

407
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,100
You're sad here.

408
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,460
He's preparing to propose.

409
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,460
Propose?

410
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,050
Gu Yi is going to propose to Qiao Jing.

411
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,460
Everyone in the company is helping him.

412
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,100
Why does Qiao Jing have

413
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,860
what I don't have?

414
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,580
I'll tell Aunt Fang about this.

415
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,580
She won't let her marry into the Gu family.

416
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
It's useless.

417
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,180
Fang Pei doesn't accept Qiao Jing,

418
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,940
but she'll accept the grandchild of the Gu family.

419
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,820
What else can I do?

420
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,050
Should I watch helplessly as they get married?

421
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,660
No.

422
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,620
I can't accept it.

423
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,500
Mr. Gu, the ring arrived.

424
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,460
She will definitely like it.
