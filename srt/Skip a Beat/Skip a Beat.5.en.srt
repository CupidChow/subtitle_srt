00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,380
I've bothered you all day.

190
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,620
I'm leaving.

191
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,700
It's late.

192
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,140
It's not safe to drive at night.

193
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,980
Don't go.

194
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,220
How about staying overnight at my home?

195
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,540
I'll stay too.

196
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,980
Great! Yes!

197
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,820
Yi,

198
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,700
don't leave tonight.

199
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,650
Let's play together.

200
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,420
Okay.

201
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,460
Where can he sleep?

202
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,780
There's no space for him at home.

203
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,820
Mom, don't worry.

204
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,020
My bed is one point two meters in width.

205
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,420
Isn't it wide enough for us?

206
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,620
I can sleep anywhere.

207
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,980
Come with me.

208
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,180
What happened?

209
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,060
Slow down.

210
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,140
Why do you want to stay at my home?

211
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,100
If I left, you could continue to flirt with Bai Yan, right?

212
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,620
What's so good about him?

213
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,860
I don't understand.

214
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,180
You and I were in a relationship before.

215
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,340
Why do you like him?

216
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,260
So what?

217
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,500
Are you a god?

218
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,700
I broke off the engagement for you.

219
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,020
You must come back.

220
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,460
If...

221
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,020
If you want to marry me,

222
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,940
it's not impossible.

223
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,620
You can marry me?

224
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,220
Yes, I can.

225
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,980
But not now.

226
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,220
You know

227
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,620
getting married is not easy.

228
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,260
Getting married is not difficult.

229
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,460
People can get a marriage certificate anytime if they love each other.

230
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,540
You're worrying and hesitating,

231
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,220
because you're weighing up the pros and cons.

232
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
In your heart,

233
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,620
there're only interests, but no love.

234
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,460
If I only cared about interests,

235
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,620
I wouldn't have come here today.

236
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,900
I don't care. I won't leave tonight.

237
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,020
Gu Yi,

238
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,980
when did you become so shameless?

239
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,380
I've always been like this.

240
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,180
You've known me for a long time.

241
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,940
Yi, it's time to go home.

242
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,340
Okay.

243
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,820
I won't leave.

244
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,940
Why did you let him stay here?

245
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,380
It's so troublesome.

246
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,740
Bai is Jing's friend.

247
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,500
Gu

248
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,740
is Jing's colleague.

249
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,100
You treated Bai warmly.

250
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,800
Gu was embarrassed, right?

251
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Qiao Zhi and Gu are close.

252
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
He insisted on letting Gu stay here.

253
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,180
What could we do?

254
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,460
It's all your fault.

255
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,740
Gu Yi doesn't compare with Bai.

256
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,620
He's bad-tempered

257
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,500
and insensitive.

258
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,580
I said we didn't have space for him,

259
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,140
but he insisted on staying here.

260
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,940
Your space is big.

261
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,300
You feel good. What about me?

262
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,460
I feel good? I can't even move.

263
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,260
Don't touch me. Get lost.

264
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,620
I can't stand it anymore. Get off the bed.

265
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,970
Why should I get off the bed?

266
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,780
Don't go too far.

267
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,020
I don't want to argue with you here.

268
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,220
Let go of me!

269
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,900
Let go of me!

270
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,260
Let go of me!

271
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,060
You...

272
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,660
We...

273
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,020
We're fine.

274
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,500
We're fine.

275
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,460
You're weak.

276
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,660
You sleep on the bed. I'll get off the bed.

277
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,380
No need.

278
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,060
The bed is too soft. You sleep on it.

279
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,900
I'll sleep on the floor.

280
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,620
I can sleep anywhere.

281
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,340
It's cold.

282
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,940
I think it's better for you to sleep on the bed.

283
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,780
Okay.

284
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,780
Mrs. Qiao, it's getting late.

285
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,100
Rest early.

286
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,110
Good night.

287
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,620
Good night.

288
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,300
You won.

289
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,460
I don't want to sleep there.

290
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,300
I want to sleep with you.

291
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,900
What's wrong with you?

292
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,220
That bed is too small.

293
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,740
Bai Yan kept pushing me. I couldn't sleep well.

294
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
My home is too small for you.

295
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,980
Leave now. Sleep wherever you want.

296
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,180
Isn't your bed

297
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,340
wide enough for both of us to sleep?

298
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,300
Get out.

299
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm asking you to get out.

300
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,460
No.

301
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,540
Get out!

302
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,740
Don't be so mean.

Who is this man?

304
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,900
It's none of your business. Get out.

305
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,140
Get out!

306
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,460

Get out!

309
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,380
Who is that man?

310
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,780
Did you sleep well last night?

311
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,619
After Gu Yi left, I slept well.

312
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,260
He is a troublesome person.

313
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
He broke off the engagement for you.

314
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,900
What do you think?

315
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
Even if he did this,

316
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,180
we won't be reconciled.

317
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,380
Do you really think so?

318
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,430
I always thought you treated everyone the same.

319
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,860
But last night I found

320
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,460
you treat him differently.

321
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,420
You have him in your heart.

322
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,020
It's just a trivial matter.

323
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,380
It can't prove anything.

324
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,460
Even details can tell something.

325
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,660
Details can show sincerity.

326
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,260
For example, you didn't know

327
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,140
there were mosquitoes in my room too.

328
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,700
When are you going to leave?

329
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,780
It's none of your business.

330
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,900
You're so shameless.

331
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,220
How long are you going to stay here?

332
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,820
Hurry up. You'll be stuck in a traffic jam if you don't leave now.

333
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,340
Are you leaving too?

334
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,860
Of course.

335
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,100

Tell your parents I'm leaving for me.

340

I'm not going to disturb them.

341

Okay, be careful while driving.

342
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,380

00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
She'll be back soon.

377
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,340
What's wrong?

378
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,780
It's so annoying.

379
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,500
The person who should come didn't come.

380
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,980
The person who shouldn't come came instead.

381
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,900
It would be great if Bai could come

382
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,100
to the birthday party.

383
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,220
He has to work.

384
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,540
Although

385
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,860
Bai is a good person,

386
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,980
I think

387
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,580
Jing doesn't have feelings for him.

388
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,900
There's something between her and Gu.

389
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,980
Didn't you see that?

390
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,540
Yes, I did.

391
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,860
Although Jing is angry with him,

392
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,740
the way she looks at him is different.

393
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,780
Yes.

394
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,340
She's been hiding her thoughts all these years.

395
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,740
We're her parents, but we can't know her thoughts.

396
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,660
Gu knows what she's thinking.

397
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,460
He can make Jing anxious and angry.

398
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,100
He can make her alive.

399
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,220
As long as he can help Jing

400
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,180
let what happened four years ago go,

401
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,820
I think we can accept him even if he's bad-tempered.

402
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,780
Am I right?

403
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,140
I hope he can make it.

404
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,780
I hope so.

405
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,020
Stop talking. Wash the dishes.

406
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,060
Okay.

407
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,810
You broke off the engagement.

408
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,500
There must be many things in Nancheng waiting for you to deal with.

409
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,940
I'll leave.

410
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,300
But I must take you with me.

411
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,580
Gu Yi, have you ever thought

412
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,060
your persistence

413
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,460
is a sign of your bipolar disorder.

414
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,460
Don't try to drive me away by talking about this.

415
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,460
I know what I'm doing.

416
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,820
Before,

417
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,180
I did hesitate.

418
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,660
I didn't want to give either you and Bai Yun up.

419
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,860
But I've figured it out.

420
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,660
If I had to choose between you and her,

421
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,060
I would choose you.

422
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,300
Qiao Jing.

423
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,620
We've been together for so long.

424
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,780
Do you really want to break up?

425
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,860
You didn't drink much before.

426
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,300
Why are you so drunk today?

427
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,380
Let me take you home.

428
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,140
Get up.

429
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,420
Su Juan.

430
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,580
Su Juan.

431
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,300
Su Juan.

432
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,380
He is Su Juan.

433
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,900
What is your relationship with him?

434
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,700
I can investigate if you don't tell me.

435
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,620
He was my senior in high school.

436
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,700
What is this place?

437
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
This is where I first met him.

438
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,900
You're Su Juan, right?

439
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,300
I heard that you were very arrogant recently.

440
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Let me tell you.

441
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,380
I hate pretentious people.

442
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,820
Hello, officer.
You...

443
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,060
A person is being robbed at the back door of No.3 Middle School.

444
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Yes. Hurry up and come here.

445
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,580
You...

446
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,890
Where did you come from?

447
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,460
Mind your own business.

448
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,460
Did you hear that?

449
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,740
They're extremely arrogant.

450
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,260
They scared me. Hurry up and come here.

451
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,140
Well played.

452
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,940
Wait and see.

453
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,860
Are you okay?

454
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,980
I'm fine.

455
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,480
Thank you. My name is Su Juan.

456
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,540
Qiao Jing.

457
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,450
What's your QQ number?

458
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Do you know how to solve the questions I taught you yesterday?

459
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,260
Let me teach you how to solve them again.

460
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,140
Look at this question.

461
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,260
Parametric coordinates and parametric equations.

462
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,780
Look at the question. Don't look at me.

463
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,420
Look.

464
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,900
Let me shoot for you.

465
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,060
Juan.

466
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,740
Aren't you in class?

467
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,900
Why are you here?

468
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,860
After you graduate,

469
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,060
we won't be at the same school.

470
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,500
If you want to stay with me,

471
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,260
study hard.

472
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,660
I'll wait for you at Nancheng University next year.

473
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,980
But my scores...

474
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
I trust you.

475
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,780
Okay. Wait for me.

476
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,900
Okay. I'll wait for you.

477
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,380
After I went to university, I realized

478
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,220
I didn't want to see him as my brother.

479
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,610
I wanted to be closer to him.

480
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,580
In order to tell him I like him,

481
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,580
I made a list of date ideas.

482
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,500
Unfortunately,

483
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,420
he didn't keep the appointment.

484
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,020
You've been his backup for so long.

485
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,060
He must have forgotten you.

486
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,380
He's dead.

487
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,380
Four years ago,

488
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
you had a car accident in Xilin Mountain.

489
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,620
That car accident

490
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,260
made you lose some of your memory

491
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,460
and change your heart.

492
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,060
Su Juan was also in that car accident.

493
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,540
The heart you changed your heart to

494
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,660
was his.

495
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,060
How is that possible?

496
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,220
How could there be such a coincidence?

497
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,140
Coincidence?

498
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,860
What you think was a coincidence

499
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,620
was carefully planned by others.

500
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,740
It was carefully planned?

501
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,820
So you approached me

502
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,420
because of this heart?

503
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,500
For the past three years,

504
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,260
you've stayed by my side

505
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,540
because of Su Juan?

506
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,060
Every year,

507
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,220
the birthday I asked you to celebrate with me

508
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,380
was actually his.

509
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,700
Qiao Jing, you're so cruel.
