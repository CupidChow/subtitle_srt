[Episode 7]

4
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,380
How was it?

5
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,860
Did the last trick work?

6
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,220
This is the extent of my help.

7
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,380
She still cares about me.

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,740
That means Qiao Jing

9
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,580
still has you in her heart.

10
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,140
Here, look at this.

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,140
These are photos taken by a birdwatcher

12
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,740
along the road where I had my car accident.

13
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,380
Before the crash with Su Juan,

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,740
his car was already out of control.

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,780
Qiao Jing suspects that someone had tampered with his car.

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,180
Does she have a particular suspect?

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,900
Yes, someone called Li Changlin.

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,940
But although she has been investigating for a long time,

19
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,620
she hasn't found anything.

20
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,580
Okay, leave it to me.

21
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,500
Thanks.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,140
The best gratitude you can give me

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,860
is for you to stop torturing yourself.

24
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,900
I'll leaving.

25
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,580
What are you doing?

26
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,930
Do you want to eat together?

27
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,140
I want to see you.

28
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,900
Mom.

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,820
Come with me to Bai Yun's house tonight.

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,730
I can go.

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,460
But I must cancel this marriage

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,540
with Bai Yun.

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,579
Are you sure?

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,220
Yes.

35
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,500
My mom terminated me from my job,

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,340
canceled my credit card,

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,579
and kicked me out of the house.

38
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,460
I'm penniless and homeless.

39
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,740
You can't ignore me.

40
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,460
Go out, turn left and walk for 800 meters.

41
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,420
There's a five-star hotel there.

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,340
Go and stay there.

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,940
My credit card was canceled, so I have no money.

44
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,060
I'll pay for it.

45
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
I’m not used to staying in a hotel.

46
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,940
Then you can go and stay at Zhou Rui’s house.

47
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,620
Zhou Rui’s personal life is too messy.

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,420
I can’t live with him.

49
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,650
You two are joined at the hip,

50
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,660
but you're telling me you can't live with him?

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,620
Anyway, I don't care.

52
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,530
Since you promised to be with me,

53
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,420
I want to stay at your house.

54
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,210
You used to live in my house.

55
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,900
Isn't it fair for me to

56
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,940
live in your house now?

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,780
Then how long do you plan to stay?

58
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,420
When my mom's no longer angry,

59
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,500
I'll leave.

60
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,660
What's wrong?

61
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,580
We've lived together before.

62
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,500
I just don't want to serve you anymore.

63
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,220
I don't need you to serve me.

64
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,060
I've already served you for three years.

65
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,459
Don't worry.

66
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,779
This time, it's my turn

67
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,620
to serve you.

68
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,540
You'll serve me?

69
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,500
Is this my room?

70
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,860
If you don't like it, you can go and find another place to stay.

71
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm very satisfied.

72
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:49,540
It's nice. I love sleeping on tatami mats.

73
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,940
At least, get me a blanket!

74
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,420
Step one, done.

75
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,850
I went out to do something.

76
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,260
The key is on the table.

77
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,700
Perfect.

78
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,260
Come on.

79
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,760
For food, just remember this poem.

80
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,260
Get pork belly meat from the market.

81
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,900
Pan-fry thoroughly on both sides until yellow.

82
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,220
Both sides. Pork belly meat.

83
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,580
Forget it.

84
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,890
Add scallions, ginger, garlic cloves, and dried chili peppers.

85
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,570
Add some eggs and stir-fry.

86
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,300
D-Dried chili peppers?

87
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,610
Add both light and dark soy sauce.

88
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,300
Add table salt and rock sugar into the pot.

89
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,980
Light and dark soy sauce?

90
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,000
Add oyster sauce and soybean paste.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,230
Add the braised meat spice pouch

92
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,730
and mineral water into the pot.

93
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,370
It'll be perfect if you add enough at once.

94
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,160
Stew it on low heat for an hour.

95
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,950
Cut into small pieces to plate.

96
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,540
Perfect.

97
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,780
Why isn't she back yet?

98
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,460
This is A5 Wagyu beef.

99
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,380
It was aged in butter for 40 days.

100
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
It's delicious.

101
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,260
Thank you.

102
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,460
Have a taste.

103
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,700
Have you reached a conclusion

104
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,900
about what I asked you last time?

105
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,299
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,660
There are still too many things here that I can't let go.

107
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,860
I'm unable to be so unrestrained.

108
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,980
Actually, I knew that

109
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,900
you wouldn't go with me.

110
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,660
But I still wouldn't give up,

111
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,340
and wanted to give it a try.

112
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,580
When are you leaving?

113
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,980
Tomorrow.

114
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,340
So soon?

115
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,940
Then, I wish you

116
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,940
a bright future.

117
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,500
Thank you.

118
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,020
I wish you happiness too.

119
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,300
Why isn't she back yet?

120
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,740
Qiao Jing, come here.

121
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,980
Where did you go today?

122
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,420
Why didn't you answer my calls all day?

123
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,540
I left my phone muted in my bag.

124
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,490
What's up?

125
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,980
I made you braised pork rice. It's already cold.

126
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,740
Whose clothes are these?

127
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
It's yours. I washed it for you.

128
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,300
Thank you.

129
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,180
You're welcome.

130
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,090
So this is what you meant by serving me?

131
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,100
Is there a problem? Is this not enough?

132
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,100
I'm not asking for your help.

133
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,100
Can you just stop causing me trouble?

134
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,660
I've exhausted myself the entire day,

135
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,060
yet I'm still just causing you trouble?

136
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,500
Whose jacket is this?

137
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
It's obviously a man's.

138
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,700
Which man gave this to you?

139
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,140
I know.

140
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,900
It's that pretty boy

141
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,130
Bai Yan again, right?

142
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,340
Why did you meet up with him again? Tell me.

143
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,020
We're friends. Why can't we meet up?

144
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,860
Friends?

145
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,260
I know how he feels about you.

146
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,660
Men know men best.

147
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,660
I've already told you we're just friends.

148
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,940
Why are you being so paranoid

149
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,140
and unreasonable?

150
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm being paranoid

151
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,220
and unreasonable?

152
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,780
You have no right to control me.

153
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,450
I do.

154
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,020
Don't forget you're still mine.

155
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,700
Qiao Jing, are you crazy?

156
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
Get out!

157
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,820
Qiao Jing, you...

158
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,060
Open the door!

159
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,460
It's all because of the project—

160
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,100
Enough!

161
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,380
Was she very sad then?

162
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,700
If I had listened to her explanation,

163
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,420
we wouldn't have come to this.

164
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,380
Hello?

165
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,500
Hello, Baby. It’s an emergency.

166
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,060
What’s wrong?

167
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,380
Do you remember the farming charity event

168
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,820
that I've been organizing?

169
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,220
To help farmers sell their flowers.

170
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,460
This batch of flowers has arrived in the suburbs,

171
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,740
but I can't go receive it because something cropped up.

172
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,420
Can you pick it up for me?

173
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,500
Okay, I'll be right there.

174
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,700
Mr. Gu is awake!

175
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,820
What's going on?

176
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,980
Are you living on the street?

177
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,740
What a rare sight.

178
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,660
Stop filming and untie me.

179
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,180
Don't be in a rush.

180
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,380
Come on, let's take a selfie.

181
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,140
Untie me!

182
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,060
Fine.

183
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,540
Come on, Young Master Gu.

184
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,860
Mr. Gu, you're so heavy.

185
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,220
Qiao Jing is really something.

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,820
She's managed to punish you.

187
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,180
It was because I let her win.

188
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,020
Otherwise, she wouldn't be my match.

189
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,420
Cut the crap.

190
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,740
If she hadn't texted me this morning,

191
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,220
you'd probably still be stuck here for another day.

192
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,020
Look, she'd even kept the door open for you.

193
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,060
This place is nice.

194
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,420
Auntie used money and the company to force you to yield,

195
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,340
but I didn't expect you to be living quite a happy life.

196
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,580
What my mom said was out of anger.

197
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
The hardest to deal with

198
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
is Qiao Jing.

199
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,940
I've deigned to

200
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,860
wash her clothes, cook for her, and do the dishes.

201
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,740
She...

202
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,340
You know how to do all that?

203
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,180
I don't think you should be called Gu Yi.

204
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,140
You should change your name to Butler Gu.

205
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,860
Haven't I done enough?

206
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,980
I've done so much.

207
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,780
It's fine if she doesn't appreciate it.

208
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,540
But she...

209
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,060
she's even entangled with another man.

210
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,220
I'm so mad.

211
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,540
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

212
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,900
Didn't you treat Qiao Jing like this in the past?

213
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Besides,

214
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,340
your relationship will end in a year.

215
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,700
Don't take it so seriously.

216
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,330
No way.

217
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,820
I must make her fall in love with me

218
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,380
within a year.

219
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,020
Are... you serious?

220
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,780
Before, it was very wrong of me

221
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,220
to ignore her opinions

222
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,900
and to force her to stay by my side.

223
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
But this time,

224
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,980
I'll use my actions

225
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,860
to convince her to be with me willingly.

226
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,220
About pursuing girls,

227
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,700
do you have any good ideas?

228
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,220
I don't have any good ideas.

229
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,860
Just cater to her needs and wishes.

230
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,300
C-Cater to her needs and wishes?

231
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,540
Cater to her needs and wishes...

232
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,820
I found it.

233
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,220
Yi.

234
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,540
This is my sister's treasure.

235
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,340
If it were anyone else,

236
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,740
I wouldn't have told them.

237
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,220
Children shouldn't look at such stuff.

238
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,420
Why did you get involved with Gu Yi again?

239
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,340
This on-again, off-again relationship

240
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,500
is so ridiculous.

241
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,100
I need his help for something.

242
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,940
What matter can there be that involves the two of you?

243
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,540
Did he force you again?

244
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,660
He wants to help me investigate Su Juan's death.

245
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,940
Help the woman he loves

246
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,220
to investigate about her unrequited love?

247
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,980
Look in front while driving.

248
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,220
It didn't take long for Mr. Gu

249
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,450
to switch to looking at the big picture.

250
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,820
Yang Yang, what's wrong?

251
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,940
Ms. Qiao, where are you?

252
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,740
I'm on my way home.

253
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,859
That's great.

254
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,140
We want to see you,

255
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,180
and also ask you some questions about work.

256
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,740
By the way, we're almost at your door.

257
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,180
Welcome home.

258
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,620
Welcome home.

259
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,020
Welcome home.

260
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,580
Welcome home.

261
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,980
Welcome home.

262
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,620
Welcome home.

263
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,820
Mr. Rabbit welcomes you home.

264
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm used to being a bossy CEO.

265
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,380
I'm really not used to

266
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,340
acting like this.

267
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,380
Why isn't she back yet?

268
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,460
Yang Yang and the lot are coming. Hide for a while.

269
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,820
Why should I hide?

270
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,940
It's not like I'm shameful.

271
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,260
Come in.

272
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,220
Wow.

273
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,820
It's so beautiful.

274
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,940
There's even a small pavilion here.

275
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,460
This is literally my dream yard.

276
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,420
The rent must be expensive, right?

277
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,700
It's alright.

278
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,740
A friend of mine rented it to me,

279
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,900
so I got a friend discount.

280
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,780
Does your friend

281
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,540
have any other houses to rent out?

282
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,180
I want a new house now too.

283
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,580
Yes, I want one too.

284
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Alright, stop fooling around.

285
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,940
We still have business to do.

286
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,540
Here.

287
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,380
This is so adorable.

288
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,140
Ms. Qiao, with this decoration,

289
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,980
are you holding an event?

290
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,620
Nobody's home, but the candles are lit.

291
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,340
It's too dangerous. It's easy to catch fire.

292
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,940
I didn't have time to clean up after a gathering with friends yesterday.

293
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,300
You're right. I'll be more careful next time.

294
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,330
Have a seat while I clean up first.

295
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,850
Is this a surprise Mr. Gu

296
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,140
prepared for you?

297
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,260
Hurry up and clean up.

298
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,540
Have a seat.

299
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,020
Jiang Ling, go get some water for everyone.

300
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,780
Okay.

301
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,420
There's a greenhouse here too.

302
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,620
Xiang Sese.

303
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,780
Where is the file?

304
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,460
It's in my bag.

305
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,820
I can't find it.

306
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,460
Here.

307
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,500
Isn't this Mr. Gu's watch?

308
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,220
No, no, no.

309
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,020
A friend of mine left this behind

310
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,420
after our gathering here

311
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,620
yesterday.

312
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,460
It doesn't belong to Mr. Gu.

313
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,020
But I remember that this watch

314
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,020
is a limited edition watch where every one is different.

315
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,140
Isn't there something wrong with your report?

316
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,260
Let's check it.

317
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,060
The data here doesn't match.

318
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,340
That's about it.

319
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,260
I've marked every area

320
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,380
that has problems.

321
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,020
I'll leave you to it. I'll get going.

322
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,820
It's a little cold outside.

323
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,180
I'll get a jacket from your room.

324
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,100
Go ahead. It's the innermost room on the left.

325
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:04,970
Okay.

326
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,900
Tell them to leave quickly.

327
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,370
Where are you?

328
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,100
Your room.

329
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,620
Where is the jacket? Where is the jacket?

330
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,860
The jacket is in Qiao Jing's room.

331
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,260
There's a bathrobe here, and there's pajamas here.

332
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,740
Where is the jacket?

333
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,060
Why are these doors stuck?

334
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,940
These doors have been stuck for a long time.

335
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,500
Don't waste your energy on them.

336
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,460
Wear this one.

337
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,740
Baby, I’ll get going then.

338
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,620
We're almost done too.

339
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,740
We won't bother you any longer.

340
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,780
Ms. Qiao.

341
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,060
A grateful heart.

342
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,260
We're thankful to you.

343
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,820
I won't keep you then.

344
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,700
It's okay.

345
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,100
It's not safe here. It's better for me to leave.

346
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,250
What are you looking at?

347
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:22,820
Get out of the way.

348
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,580
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

349
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,300
That was...

350
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,940
Mr. Gu?

351
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,220
Is this something I can see for free?

352
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,220
I didn't see anything.

353
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,860
Wait for me.

354
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,940
I didn't see anything.

355
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Go and coax your Mr. Rabbit.

356
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,180
See you.

357
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,740
You know how to feel embarrassed now?

358
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,180
Who's embarrassed?

359
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,620
Yesterday, you were a househusband.

360
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,380
Today, you're Mr. Rabbit.

361
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,940
What are you trying to do?

362
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
How can you bring them back

363
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,380
without a word?

364
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,340
Didn't I inform you beforehand?

365
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,580
Who knew you would be up to something like this?

366
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,940
I saw your card collection at your house.

367
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,970
Zhi said you like this type of thing.

368
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,100
That was when I was young.

369
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,260
I know you're trying to make me happy.

370
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,260
But it's not necessary.

371
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,660
We're just taking what we need from each other.
