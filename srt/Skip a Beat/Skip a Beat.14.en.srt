165

You're awake.

166
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,180

we're sorry.

179
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Yun was out of her mind

180
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,970
and made such a mistake.

181
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,660
As her mother,

182
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,260
I didn't educate her well.

183
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,020

184
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,820

185
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,140
But now she knows she was wrong.

186

Ms. Qiao,

187
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,660
can you give her a chance?

188
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,380
No matter how young

189

or immature she is,

190
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,500
it has nothing to do with me.

191
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,060
Why should I pay for her mistake

192
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,780
with my child's life?

193
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,660
Qiao Jing, the child is gone.

194
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,420
It won't come back no matter how you pursue the matter.

195
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,060
As long as you agree to write a letter of forgiveness,

Unless I die,

198
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,900
I will never

199

200
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,180
Ms. Qiao,

201
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,420
she's my only daughter.

202
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,050
Her father died early.

203
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,020
I brought her up.

204
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,660
I spoiled her.

205
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,900
It's all my fault.

206
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,180
But

207
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,380
she is my only hope.

208
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,060
Without her,

209
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,859
I can't live.

210
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,819
Ms. Qiao.

211
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,420
Since you care about your daughter so much,

212
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,980
you should know how I feel.

213
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,099
If you were the one who had lost her child,

214
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,060
would you forgive the culprit?

215
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,100
Ms. Qiao, I'm sorry.

216
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,940
But I beg you.

217
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,380
It's all my fault.

218
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,820
I made her like this.

219
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,900
Give her a chance.

220
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,140
I can give you

221
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,340
any compensation you want.

222
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,820
Okay?

223
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
Ms. Qiao.

224
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,380
Auntie.

225
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,740
Auntie, let's go.

226
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,300
Ms. Qiao, sorry for bothering you.

227
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,060
Seems that Qiao Jing won't change her mind.

228
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,340
What can Yun do in the future?

229
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,420
Auntie, don't worry.

230
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,060
Let's think of another way.

231
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
Lawyer Wang said

232
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,620
Yun had told him everything.

233
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,540
Du Huan was also involved.

234
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,650
Du Huan?

235
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,020
I knew Yun is not a scheming person.

236
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,780
How could she do such things?

237
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,420
Du Huan must have incited her.

238
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,760
If anything happens to Yun,

239
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,300
I won't let her get away with it.

240
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,060
I won't let anything happen to Yun.

241
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,020
Ms. Du, where are you going?

242
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,180
You are Yun's agent.

243
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,300
You decided to run away right after she got into trouble?

244
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,090
How could it be?

245
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,940
Some of Yun's overseas business needs to be stopped.

246
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm just going to deal with it.

247
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,490
Will you not come back after going abroad?

248
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,900
I've known Yun for years.

249
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,340
I treat her like my sister.

250
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,700
Why would I abandon her?

251
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,020
Sister?

252
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,900
But who would teach their sister to do bad things?

253
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,700
You taught Yun to do those things

254
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,820
to Qiao Jing, right?

255
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,900
I have no grudge against Qiao Jing.

256
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,500
Why would I incite Yun to harm her?

257
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,500
You do have no grudge against her.

258
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,260
But every time you came up with an idea for Yun,

259
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,940
you got paid, right?

260
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,100
Since you like money so much,

261
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,180
why don't you do me a favor?

262
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,940

Why not?

266
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,700
Didn't Du Huan admit

267
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,420
that she did everything alone?

268
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,980
Ms. Bai pled guilty.

269
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,220
And the evidence is solid.

270
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,980
The police have found out everything.

271
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,020
Whatever Du Huan does is useless.

272
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,660
The only way now

273
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,100
is to get a letter of forgiveness

274
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,900
and try to reduce Yun's sentence.

275
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,940
But Qiao Jing

276
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,140
won't sign the letter.
