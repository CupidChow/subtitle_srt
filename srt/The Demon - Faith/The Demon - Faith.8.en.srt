1
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Shen Wangchen, come here.

2
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,719
Oh my god.

3
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,159
Young master can touch people now.

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,719
How is it?

5
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,000
Aren't I impressive?

6
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,079
Amazing, amazing, amazing!

7
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,760
The King is truly incredible.

8
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,560
All hail the King! All hail the King!

9
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
What's wrong with her?

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,079
The King is impressive.

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,079
Amazing, amazing, amazing!

12
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,640
Shen Wangchen, don't be surprised.

13
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
I've seen the old fox couple before.

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
They always do this kind of thing.

15
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,840
You'll get used to it.

16
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,400
All hail the King!

17
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,800
So impressive!

18
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,560
Amazing, amazing, amazing!

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
She's actually fine.

20
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,360
Everyone,

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,120
Starting today,

22
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,599
we officially accept

23
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,199
their invitation to form an alliance.

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
From now on, our Ao Wu Stronghold

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
and Moyuan City

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
will build a great legacy together.

27
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,520
For the benefit of all living beings.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,199
Alright.

29
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,719
That's wonderful!

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,639
It's all mine.

31
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,120
Si Ming.

32
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,120
Master.

33
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,520
Quickly check the Spirit Array.

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,599
See if there's anything unusual.

35
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,240
Master.

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,000
This array gathers

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,719
only the aura of subdued demon spirits.

38
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,560
There's nothing unusual.

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
She's alive.

40
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,560
Impossible.

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Who?

42
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,080
A hundred years ago,

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
our sect fought the cat demon for a long time.

44
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,360
In the end, she was slain by the sword.

45
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,599
She destroyed her own demon core.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,000
She vanished without a trace.

47
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,159
Master, are you saying

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,479
this bamboo tube hasn't glowed for a hundred years,

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,319
but today,

50
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,479
the demon core still remains.

51
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,599
Its aura hasn't faded.

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,879
A faint light has appeared.

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,080
This demon clan is truly vile.

54
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,560
No matter where they are, they must be destroyed.

55
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,680
Yes.

56
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,600
I just dreamed about something.

57
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,639
Why do I feel a sense of shame?

58
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,279
No.

59
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,000
Embarrassment.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,639
No.

61
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,199
What is this feeling?

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Don't think about it. Don't think about it.

63
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,279
Don't let him confuse you.

64
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,480
I'm the King, after all.

65
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,079
This dream...

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,480
How was it?

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,319
Was it nice?

68
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,480
It was.

69
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,800
Why did it feel so real?

70
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,240
Da Yao.

71
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,959
Da Yao.

72
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,199
Da Yao.

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,279
Your Majesty.

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,399
What kind of illness is this?

75
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,360
Ever since I dreamed of that mortal,

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,319
I've been having constant hallucinations.

77
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,959
My whole body feels hot.

78
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Young Master Shen.

79
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,240
Your Majesty.

80
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Look,

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Was your dream like this and this?

82
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,519
Or like that and that?

83
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,199
That's right.

84
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,560
Just like this and this.

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,439
And like that and that.

86
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,560
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,199
This thing of yours,

88
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,399
isn't really an illness.

89
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,439
Rather,

90
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,800
it's more like a spell.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,600
It's called the Spring Heart Spell.

92
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,600
Spring Heart Spell?

93
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
Shen Wangchen.

94
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,720
You cunning scoundrel.

95
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,839
Just in time.

96
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,600
Why are you laughing?

97
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,879
Chief Fan, today

98
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,720
you're quite different.

99
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,240
Tell me,

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
what evil spell did you use

101
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,480
to enter my dream?

102
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
You said we'd stick together through thick and thin,

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,399
but you use such dirty tricks behind my back.

104
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,920
You dreamed about me?

105
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,240
That's right.

106
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,399
What did you dream about?

107
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
Wasn't it just

108
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,720
ridiculous?

109
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,079
You even want to know the King's dreams?

110
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,519
Shen Wangchen, let me tell you,

111
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,279
don't think you can control me.

112
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,439
Withdraw your evil spell at once.

113
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,399
Or don't blame me

114
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,360
for showing no mercy.

115
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,199
Mercy?

116
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,120
What are you doing?

117
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,680
What about you? What's your situation?

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,079
Don't you know yourself at all?

119
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,199
What mercy?

120
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,799
So if I just return the demon core,

121
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,799
then I can...

122
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,639
when love is in the stars for you,

123
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,879
divine power will naturally have no effect on it.

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
At that time,

125
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,279
you'll be just like everyone else,

126
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,559
free to enjoy the pleasures of mortal life.

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,679
All the beauty of this world,

128
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
is the way of heaven and earth.

129
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
Go with the flow,

130
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,120
and you'll find true joy.

131
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,840
Enjoy the joys of human relationships.

132
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,759
Savor the wonders of the mortal world.

133
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,080
I can finally hold you.
