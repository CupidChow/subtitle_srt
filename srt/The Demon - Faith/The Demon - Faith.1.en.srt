1
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,159
Why are demons called demons

2
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,959
and not humans?

3
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,680
It's like a beam of light shining into the darkness.

4
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,879
Then the light itself is deemed guilty.

5
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,480
Once, demons appeared in the world.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,159
But human fear

7
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,840
gave rise to demon catchers.

8
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,359
By order of the Moyuan City Lord,

9
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,319
they hunt down demons.

10
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,879
Surrender now!

11
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,560
I'll stay.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Let the children go.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,760
In the name of catching demons,

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
they harm innocent lives.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,879
This sparks conflict between humans and demons.

16
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,719
The City Lord's son

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,640
has suffered from a strange illness since childhood.

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,400
No one can approach him.

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,719
Because of this,

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,560
he set out for the Western Regions.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,439
Rumor has it

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,719
only the cat demon of the West

23
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,480
can cure his affliction.

24
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,200
There,

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,959
demons run rampant.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,159
It's full of mysteries.

27
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,560
Brothers,

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
we've had a fruitful day.

29
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,879
Let's slaughter a few beasts soon

30
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,520
so everyone can celebrate.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,199
Alright.

32
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,159
The tiger demon is here!

33
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,479
Release the animals first.

34
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,800
Please spare us, Your Majesty!

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,199
Young master, let's go quickly!

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,639
Stop, all of you!

37
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,159
Are you seeking death?

38
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,439
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

39
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,000
He's just an ordinary human.

40
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,479
How does he have such power?

41
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,639
That's impossible.

42
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,159
Your Majesty, this man is strange.

43
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,319
We shouldn't prolong the fight.

44
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,519
Shen Gongzi's strange illness

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
Only the Western cat demon

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,879
can give you shining eyes and let you touch the light of the world

47
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,680
She

48
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,079
This person is extremely dangerous

49
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,920
Must not be released

50
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,480
Or there will be endless trouble

51
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
Go, hurry!

52
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
Who said you could leave?

53
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,480
Stop wasting time and energy

54
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,439
You can't beat me

55
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,319
Let them go

56
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,079
If you want to let them go

57
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
That's fine

58
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,720
You have to come back to the demon village with me

59
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
If you refuse

60
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,120
I'll kill everyone within a hundred miles

61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
Everyone

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,639
Shen Gongzi, we don't want to die

63
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,439
You have to save us

64
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,560
Save me, save me

65
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,920
She can make me see colors

66
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
but she's just a wicked tiger demon

67
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,160
Better to play along and decide later

68
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,759
Fan Dayao, I hope you'll keep your word

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,959
If I stay in the village

70
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,079
I won't harm the innocent anymore

71
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,240
Welcome back, Chief!

72
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Welcome back, Chief!

73
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Welcome back, Chief!

74
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,759
Welcome back, Chief!

75
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,519
Listen up, everyone

76
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,079
From today on

77
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,279
We must treat Shen Gongzi well

78
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Yes, ma'am

79
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,160
Treat him well

80
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,839
Shen Gongzi

81
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,360
Are we really staying here?

82
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,040
Shen Gongzi

83
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,600
I know you want to protect

84
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,319
those people

85
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,120
But if we

86
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,279
still can't find that cat demon

87
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,000
and don't get rid of her soon

88
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,120
I'm afraid your body

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
won't make it through this winter

90
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,079
We're really out of time

91
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,079
Besides

92
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,319
we're living here now

93
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,639
I can see colors now

94
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,279
Colors

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,319
Shen Gongzi can see colors now

96
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,680
Jiang Li

97
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,199
Shen Gongzi

98
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,759
You can see colors now

99
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,079
How come

100
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,800
your strange illness that

101
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,199
makes people fly away

102
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,519
still isn't cured?

103
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:03,879
Come

104
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,680
Shen Gongzi

105
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,800
Wait, that's not right, Shen Gongzi

106
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
How can you see colors now?

107
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,959
Maybe it's related to Fan Dayao

108
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,879
Fan Dayao

109
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,399
Could she be

110
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,480
the demon you're looking for?

111
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,480
No, that's not right

112
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,360
Shang Shibei said your illness

113
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
was caused by a cat demon

114
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,399
But Fan Dayao is

115
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,959
a famous tiger demon

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,039
Then we have to find the answer from that tiger demon

117
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,039
and get the answer

118
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,200
Si Ming

119
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,799
We've known each other for years

120
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,120
Why are you still making trouble?

121
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,919
You bold tiger demon

122
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,600
How dare you harm people in the city

123
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,279
Ridiculous

124
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,440
When humans harm us

125
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,320
why don't you stand up for justice?

126
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Do you have some obsession with demons?

127
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,080
All demons in this world

128
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,240
should be slain by my Star Sword

129
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,200
Trying to run?

130
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,639
Prepare to die!

131
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,080
Darn it, it's raining

132
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,639
Who's there?

133
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
What's going on?

134
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,399
And who are you?

135
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Why did you hurt my cat?

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Sorry, I made a mistake

137
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,440
Why is he here?

138
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,080
You're hurt

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,159
Let me take you back first

140
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:08,720
Alright

141
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,679
Darn it

142
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,679
Are we just going to let him do as he pleases?

143
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
I really have no strength to resist now.

144
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,679
None at all.

145
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,559
Gongzi,

146
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,639
How can you still be in the mood to keep a cat?

147
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm so anxious I could die.

148
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,480
How can you—

149
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,279
What are you looking at? You think I want this?

150
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,320
Gongzi,

151
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,360
Why don't you—

152
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
team up with that demon hunter

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,879
to deal with Fan Dayao?

154
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,120
We could come up with

155
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,360
a plan to coordinate from inside and outside.

156
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
And wipe out Aowu Village in one go.

157
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
I heard you.

158
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,360
Then Gongzi, get some rest.

159
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,759
I'll head back first.

160
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Wipe out Aowu Village?

161
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Don't even think about it.

162
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,519
Kitty,

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,639
I saved your life.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
Shouldn't you repay me?

165
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,399
He really did save my life.

166
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
I came to this place,

167
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,600
not knowing anyone or anything.

168
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,519
Meeting you

169
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,200
is probably fate.

170
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,000
If you hadn't practiced dark arts,

171
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,320
I would've torn you apart right away.

172
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,399
You wouldn't even be alive here

173
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,679
talking to me about fate.

174
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,519
What are you doing? Hey!

175
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,080
Where are you touching? You—

176
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,679
This is for

177
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,080
acupoints that promote wound healing.

178
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Let me press them for you.

179
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,759
Don't touch me, I'm the king!

180
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,120
Where's my dignity as king?

181
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,039
Where's my pride?

182
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm warning you—

183
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,360
Actually, this feels pretty good.
