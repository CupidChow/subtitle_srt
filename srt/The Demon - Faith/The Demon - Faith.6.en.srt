1
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,879
This person is clearly a mortal.

2
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,439
Why does he have a demon core inside him?

3
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,920
Such a creature

4
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,840
should not be allowed to exist in this world.

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
Chief Fan.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,200
Chief Fan.

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,959
Why are you hitting him?

8
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,640
A mortal body,

9
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
yet such a powerful demon core.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,599
Could he be an ancient demon in disguise?

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,439
Shen Wangchen.

12
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,799
Go back to the demon stronghold first.

13
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,280
I promised you

14
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,599
not to harm the innocent.

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,400
But I never promised not to hurt demon hunters.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,799
Step aside.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,519
I need to take him away today.

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Si Ming.

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,879
I'm the most powerful demon here.

20
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,760
If you won't take me, I'll take him.

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,359
Who are you looking down on?

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
Are you human or demon?

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,800
Sorry for any offense.

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Chief Fan, move aside.

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,639
Who asked you to meddle?

26
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you alright?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,759
None of your business.

28
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,919
This medicine heals internal energy injuries.

29
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,840
It's the most effective.

30
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,560
Don't be so impatient next time.

31
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,800
Take care of yourself first.

32
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,159
Don't die before I even get to fight you.

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
You might just die from illness first.

34
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,680
Minions, your king has returned!

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,319
Minions!

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,199
Cousin.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Everyone couldn't stand your torment.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,840
They all ran away.

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,199
Ran away?

40
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,000
Where did they go?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,439
Everyone quit.

42
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,560
They took their belongings and left.

43
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,319
Sorry for your loss.

44
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,159
How could this happen?

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,240
Was I not good to them?

46
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,599
You always

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,039
fly into a rage

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,439
and use threats and bribes.

49
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,719
Actually, they told me long ago

50
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,240
they wanted to quit.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,319
They said

52
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,319
if there's anything else

53
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,479
I did wrong.

54
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,560
No one mentioned anything else.

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,479
I'm not really sure.

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
Rule number 868:

57
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,879
To build public trust,

58
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,919
one must keep their word.

59
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,479
But you...

60
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,199
Enough!

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,680
I am the great

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,719
undefeated Demon King of Qianchun Mountain!

63
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,080
How could I tolerate such humiliation?

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,719
They'd better never come back.

65
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,879
Cousin.

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,519
Xiao Er.

67
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,360
Why do you always come here

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,759
when you're in a bad mood?

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Xiao Er, how have you been lately?

70
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
Not good at all.

71
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm so annoyed I could die.

72
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,399
At least you're still useful.

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Serve your king well

74
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,279
to ease my troubles.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
Now that's relaxing.

76
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,319
Master,

77
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,000
my powers are lacking.

78
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,759
I failed to defeat Chief Fan.

79
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Si Ming.

80
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,680
You've gone after that tiger demon again and again.

81
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,279
Do you want to catch her

82
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,040
or just see her?

83
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,759
As a cultivator,

84
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,839
the greatest taboo is falling for mortal desires.

85
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
I wouldn't dare.

86
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,199
Don't disappoint me again.

87
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,639
Yes.

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,319
It's getting late. Go rest.

89
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,079
Master.

90
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,759
Have you ever seen a mortal

91
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,680
with a demon core inside?

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,519
There are records of it in our sect's scrolls.

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
If a demon

94
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,519
transfers its demon core to a mortal,

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,879
this will happen.

96
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,399
But once the demon core leaves the body,

97
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,959
the demon will surely die.

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Why are you asking about this?

99
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,680
I was reading ancient texts today

100
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,920
and became curious.

101
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,439
Deal with that tiger demon as soon as possible.

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,480
Yes.

103
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,680
Those brats...

104
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
Still haven't come back.

105
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:46,959
If on the way

106
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,639
someone snatched them,

107
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,759
what should I do?

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Chief Fan.

109
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,000
I've told you before,

110
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,279
using threats and bribes

111
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,600
won't keep friends around.

112
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,240
What use are friends to me?

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,560
Then they'll never

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,360
come back.

115
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,279
Even if they're taken away,

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
they still wouldn't want to live with you.

117
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,959
Am I really that unlikeable?

118
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,879
Calm your mind like still water.

119
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,000
Free yourself from desire.

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
Unite your mind and spirit.

121
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Let go of all things and self.

122
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,319
Do you truly have a way

123
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,639
to bring them all back?

124
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,839
And make them even more loyal to me?

125
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,720
There is a way.

126
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
But, Chief Fan,

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
what is it?

128
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,839
If you can't be honest with them,

129
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,920
then likewise,

130
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,000
you won't earn

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,879
their genuine respect and trust.

132
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,600
It must be because lately

133
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,679
they couldn't defeat you.

134
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,159
They think I'm not strong enough.

135
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,480
So they all left.

136
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,039
They went to find another way.

137
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,480
They didn't leave

138
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,840
because you weren't strong enough.

139
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,559
Force can't win people's hearts.

140
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,720
Only sincerity can earn sincerity.

141
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,200
You already have

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,519
the kindest heart in the world.

143
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,360
Why not let everyone see it?

144
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,639
Xiao Er.
