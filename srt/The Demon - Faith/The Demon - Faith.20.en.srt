00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,250
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,280
Is anyone there?

4
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
Where's the shopkeeper?

5
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,159
I came to treat his illness.

6
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,319
It's me.

7
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,200
Mr. Shen, do you remember

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
saving a white cat?

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,000
(I'm here repay your kindness.)

10
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,920
(What if I offered myself to you?)

11
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,280
Mr. Shen.

12
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,120
Mr. Shen.

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
Are you there?

14
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,759
Mr. Shen.

15
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,560
Are you there?

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Master.

17
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,680
Mr. Shen.

18
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,840
I know.

19
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm sorry for making you worried.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,919
This medicine
can only ease your coughing.

21
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:53,752
It can't

22
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,360
heal your frail body.

23
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,080
It treats the symptoms, not the root.

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
Thank you for your concern.

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,199
Life and death are fated.

26
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,240
I've long been prepared.

27
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,000
Even if short,

28
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,039
I will cherish it.

29
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,120
I only hope
that you'll protect her for me

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
when I'm gone.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Please.

32
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,599
Don't worry.

33
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,120
She'll be fine.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,400
Did Master Shang come by?

35
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,520
Did he say

36
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,919
the demon core can be returned?

37
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,639
That's right.

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,280
That's great!

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,039
You have no idea

40
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,439
how heartbroken I've been

41
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,120
seeing you cough all the time.

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,479
It's killing me!

43
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,960
Once you have both demon cores,

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,680
you'll be the strongest demon

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,759
in this world.

46
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,400
Don't forget what I taught you then.

47
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,039
I remember it.

48
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,520
With you watching me,

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,120
how could I go around doing evil?

50
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Well,

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
once I get my demon core back,

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
I'll return to the fort in glory.

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll let my followers witness

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,959
the power of double demon cores.

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,680
Momo.

56
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,800
Momo!

57
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,879
Momo.

58
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,879
Momo.

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
You just recovered.

60
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,879
Stop pushing yourself.

61
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
Why did you save me?

62
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,600
I can never

63
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,319
become the Guardian again.

64
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,160
Why does this dish taste
both bitter and salty?

65
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,480
Jiang Li.

66
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,279
There are no secrets between us.

67
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,040
I can't taste anything anymore.

68
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,600
Was it because
you tested those herbs for me?

69
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,800
You lost your sense of taste?

70
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,439
I'm sorry!

71
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,839
It's all right.

72
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,199
I chose this myself.

73
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,639
From now on,

74
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,079
I can't make delicious dishes anymore.

75
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,399
Will you hate me for that?

76
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,079
What nonsense are you saying?

77
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,120
All right.

78
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Look.

79
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,439
I'm just a mortal, aren't I?

80
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,879
The only spell I know

81
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,360
is making good food.

82
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,959
But now,

83
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm no longer able to do that.

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,360
But I can do other stuff.

85
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,879
For example,

86
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,959
I know

87
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
how to turn mushrooms into dried goods.

88
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,160
I know

89
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,000
how to tell poultry from wild animals.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,639
I also know

91
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,199
what to eat in each season
for nourishment.

92
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,959
Above all,

93
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,279
I can always

94
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,720
stay by your side.

95
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,560
You're both human

96
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,439
and demon.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
You're much stronger than I am.

98
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,360
Thus, guarding the fort

99
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,399
doesn't always mean
getting into a fight.

100
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,560
You mean,

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,079
I can protect the fort for Dayao

102
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,560
in my own way?

103
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,759
Of course.

104
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,639
Why are you always so brilliant?

105
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,799
Just combing my hair

106
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,039
makes my face blushed and heart race.

107
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
I really want this moment to last.

108
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
That's wonderful.

109
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,879
Oh, right.

110
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,279
Let me tell you.

111
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,279
From now on, you must never

112
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,159
hide things from me.

113
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,759
Understand?

114
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,399
Most importantly,
don't you leave without a word again.

115
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,159
Yes.

116
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,159
Why… Why are you
looking at me like that?

117
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,320
(I want to remember your face.)

118
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,879
I was thinking...

119
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,600
Were we like this too

120
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,960
in our past lives?

121
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,120
I find that infuriating.

122
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,480
That dream is always fragmented.

123
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,360
I still don't know

124
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,639
what happened to Fan Awu and Shen Qinghe

125
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,039
in the end.

126
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,519
How did the demon core

127
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,279
end up inside your body?

128
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,080
Let's get to sleep.

129
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,360
Maybe we'll dream of it.

130
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,962
(Qinghe)

131
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,600
You foolish doctor!

132
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,039
And you dare call yourself
a famed physician?

133
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,360
You're actually living with a demon!

134
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,799
Indeed.

135
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,840
You're a mere quack!

136
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,200
Get out of our city now!

137
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes!

138
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,679
- Get lost!
- Scram!

139
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,440
It's those from the east of the city.

140
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,360
I'll go settle the score with them.

141
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,159
Awu.

142
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,200
Don't do that.

143
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,759
It's fine.

144
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,399
Let's just leave this place.

145
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,200
Is our love

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,759
that intolerable?

147
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,759
Qinghe.

148
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,919
You need not give up anything for me.

149
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,320
I'll leave alone.

150
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,080
Awu!

151
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,759
Are you really leaving me

152
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,120
because of those unreasonable people?

153
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
I just don't want you

154
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,679
to be despised by the world
because of me.

155
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,240
You were born

156
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,440
the purest soul in the world.

157
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,720
How could they...

158
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,879
It's all right, Awu.

159
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,039
It's fine.

160
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,960
Though there's so much beauty
in the world,

161
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,759
you alone are enough for me.

162
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,399
I'll be fine.

163
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,320
Just don't leave me, all right?

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,120
It's fine.

165
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:14,879
How silly of you, Awu.

166
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,480
Without you,

167
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,440
how could I live on?

168
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,639
No!

169
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,279
It's all right.

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,639
He...

171
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,399
It's all right.

172
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,559
How could he do such a foolish thing?

173
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,879
Why would he take his own life?

174
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,679
Everything's fine.

175
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,960
Everything's fine.

176
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,200
It's all over now.

177
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,600
Shen Wangchen.

178
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,519
Can humans and demons

179
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,759
truly never be together?

180
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:11,960
Now,

181
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,080
you're just like Shen Qinghe.

182
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,759
Because of me,

183
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,360
you're scorned by the world.

184
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,399
It's all my fault.

185
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,480
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,679
It's all right.

187
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm not Shen Qinghe

188
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,600
and you're not Fan Awu.

189
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,240
Let the past

190
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,360
stay in the past.

191
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:35,960
In this life,

192
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,039
we will never

193
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,240
end up that way.

194
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,039
Well, when I'm gone,

195
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,440
you must live well.

196
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,519
That's an order.

197
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,159
You must not disobey it.

198
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,080
Yes.

199
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,679
You must promise me too.

200
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,639
If...

201
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,840
I mean,

202
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
if I'm gone too,

203
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,639
you must...

204
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,559
I won't let you die on me.

205
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:26,840
(Xiao'er.)

206
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,600
(I'm sorry.)

207
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,919
(I'm now a dying man.)

208
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,759
Momo.

209
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,919
Let me do it.

210
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,879
You want grilled fish?

211
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,879
It's all right.

212
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,600
I'll do it.

213
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,320
Why grill fish?

214
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,559
Dayao will be

215
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,159
back from the city soon.

216
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
She's probably furious.

217
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,639
Let's grill her a fish for nourishment.

218
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,120
Leave it to me.

219
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,919
There's too much smoke.
You should go outside.

220
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,639
Seriously, let me do it.

221
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,240
All right.

222
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,360
Is that a burn?

223
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,360
Don't cry.

224
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,600
If it hurts, wait here.

225
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,639
I'll get you the ointment.

226
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,759
Don't go!

227
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,519
Come back.

228
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,039
What's it?

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,120
Actually, I've felt really uneasy

230
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,720
since last night.

231
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,960
I feel like something bad

232
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,720
is going to happen.

233
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,200
The time has come.

234
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,879
The double demon cores will be mine!

235
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,960
They shall be mine!

236
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,840
