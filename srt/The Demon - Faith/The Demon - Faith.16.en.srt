00:00:56,287 --> 00:01:00,262
=The Demon=

2
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,250
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
Who put that vase there?

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,120
It's not well placed at all!

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,040
This red cloth.

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,640
Hang the red cloth

7
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,040
there!

8
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,879
Can't you see it's empty there?

9
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,120
You're unbelievable.

10
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:14,525
Oh my God!

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,799
Just get to work already!

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,959
Look, dear.

13
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,640
The Princess is nothing but bossy.

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,120
Will Chen be able to put up with her?

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,359
Who placed the food here?

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,799
Look at how meager it is.

17
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,400
Will it be enough

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
for the whole household?

19
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,000
Well...

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What are you looking at?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,799
I...

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,480
Do something!

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,599
Yes,

24
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,680
let's get to work!

25
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,040
You're all fools!

26
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,120
What is all this?

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,879
What a troublesome woman.

28
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,519
Why is it so slippery here?

29
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,840
What if I slipped

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
tomorrow?

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Your Highness.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
Well,

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,120
what else do we need here?

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
You're actually asking me that?

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
Just see to it!

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,319
I'm telling you.

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,159
This will be the most luxurious
wedding chamber

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,760
in Moyuan City.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,519
Make sure you make that happen!

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,439
Got it!

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Hang the lanterns!

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,480
What a bunch of good-for-nothings!

43
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,719
Wangchen.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,199
Look,

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,599
I'm all tired.

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,599
Shall we

47
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
take a stroll in the backyard?

48
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,439
Sure.

49
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,120
Let's go.

50
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,560
Wangchen.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,879
Ever since I met you,

52
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,360
I...

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,039
Your Highness.

54
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,960
Have you forgotten

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,990
I suffer from some peculiar ailment?

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,080
But...

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,199
But...

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,719
But I don't care!

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
You demoness!

60
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,400
Fan Dayao.

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,919
How could you be so stubborn?

62
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,439
Guards.

63
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,319
Get her out of here!

64
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,120
Hold on!

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,719
Coming, Young Master!

66
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,680
Your Highness!

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,039
Could...

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,280
Could it be you're really a demon?

69
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,919
You managed

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,919
to push me all the way here!

71
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,319
You're overthinking, Your Highness.

72
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,520
She's a mere

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,919
uncultured commoner.

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,319
Let's go now,

75
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,240
Your Highness.

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,319
You're in

77
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
a rather bad shape.

78
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,800
Wangchen, please pardon me

79
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,120
for my embarrassing state.

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,479
Let's go.

81
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,840
Shen Wangchen.

82
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,840
As a good chief,

83
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,199
not only am I knowledgeable,

84
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,000
humane, and prestigious,

85
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,319
but I've also learned
to be patient and composed.

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,800
I can let it all slide

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,000
and give you another chance.

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,199
Nobody cares.

89
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,439
See the guest out, Mr. Zhen.

90
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,240
Wangchen.

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Let's go.

92
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,439
Please leave,

93
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,639
Young Madam.

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Well, Young Madam,

95
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,240
just what's the matter

96
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,639
with Young City Lord?

97
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,399
How could he do that to you?

98
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,519
The Princess

99
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,720
has turned the place

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,800
upside down.

101
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,199
She's been driving me

102
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
crazy.

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,360
You must hang in there.

104
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,920
You have our support,

105
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,600
so don't ever give up.

106
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,720
The Young City Lord

107
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,920
is truly unbelievable.

108
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,439
He's a womanizer

109
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,399
and an ingrate.

110
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,240
If it hadn't been for...

111
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,959
Mr. Zhen.

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Stop it

113
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,079
or I'll beat you up.

114
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's drop the subject.

115
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,560
Let's drop it.

116
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
For decades, I'm a demon slayer

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,680
in Moyuan City,

118
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,199
protecting its people.

119
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,959
To my surprise, as the City Lord,

120
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,480
you've put the people in danger

121
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,480
by sheltering a demon.

122
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,800
We still don't know

123
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
if that's true.

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,639
If what you said is true

125
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,879
and the demon is here in my residence,

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,879
I'll act accordingly.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,120
If you're spewing nonsense

128
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,879
to cause a scene here,

129
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,439
Dayao.

130
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,759
I won't let it slide.

131
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,480
Run.

132
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
It's her!

133
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,279
That's the demoness!

134
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,600
Stop talking nonsense

135
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
unless you have evidence!

136
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,480
I had a duel with her.

137
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,680
It's all thanks to her
that I'm injured.

138
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,240
Many saw

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,079
how she hurt me

140
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:42,686
on that day.

141
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,680
After that,

142
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,879
there was a demon doing evil at night.

143
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,879
It went missing not long after a report
was made at the yamen.

144
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,959
It's you

145
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,600
who have kept her in check.

146
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,040
If it were her doing,

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,240
I'd like to know

148
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,920
what evil deed

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,279
you've done.

150
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,680
Me?

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,279
Of course I was trying
to capture the demon.

152
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,319
Liar!

153
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,199
You mistook my bunny for a demon.

154
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,759
You know nothing about demons at all.

155
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,240
I won't let you hurt Dayao.

156
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,560
Indeed.

157
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,920
If he can't tell

158
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,160
animals and demons apart,

159
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,199
he's an unreliable demon slayer!

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,920
That's right.

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,639
Children

162
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,439
don't lie after all.

163
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,199
Certainly.

164
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Children never lie.

165
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,959
Come here, kid.

166
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,839
It's my fault

167
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,800
for hurting your bunny.

168
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,839
But let me ask you a question.

169
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,839
Did this woman

170
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,600
say

171
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,879
she's the most powerful demon?

172
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,920
Yes.

173
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,759
Dayao

174
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,480
is the strongest demon.

175
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,639
She's brilliant,

176
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,680
and she stands up

177
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
to injustice.

178
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,399
Something's off.

179
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
The City Lord has been muddle-headed

180
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,279
in sheltering a demon.

181
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,879
Today, we shall take matters
into our own hands!

182
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,519
Stop it!

183
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,519
Just come at me!

184
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,920
Don't worry,

185
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,079
I won't resort to violence.

186
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,279
That's right.

187
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm the most invincible demon.

188
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,920
So just come at me.

189
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,240
Do you think

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,879
I can't do anything about you?

191
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,959
Watch out, dear!

192
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,319
Help me up!

193
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
Run!

194
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,680
Let's go now!

195
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,879
I'm sorry, Dayao.
