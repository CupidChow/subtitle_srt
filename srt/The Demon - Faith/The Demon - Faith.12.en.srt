00:00:56,287 --> 00:01:00,262
=The Demon=

2
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,250
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
All right.

4
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,560
Let's hear your plan.

5
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,959
Your Highness genuinely cares
about the world.

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Lately, Moyuan City has been saturated
with a demonic presence…

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,120
Enough.

8
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,359
I don't care

9
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,640
about the fate of the world.

10
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,640
All I want is Shen Wangchen.

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280
If that's the case,

12
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
then it's simple.

13
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,879
It's you.

14
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,439
What are you doing in Moyuan City?

15
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,319
None of your business.

16
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,479
Look who's talking.

17
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,960
Why were you on the roof

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,439
of Shen Wangchen's house?

19
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,840
I'm here to catch demons.

20
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,479
That's laughable.

21
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
This is Shen Wangchen's home.

22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,039
Where are the demons?

23
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,660
- Don't tell me…
- Don't tell me…

24
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,599
100 years ago,

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,840
demon slayers battled the Cat Demon
for a long time

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,800
and finally defeated her by the sword.

27
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,280
She destroyed her demon core

28
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,680
and turned to ash.

29
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,400
(You)

30
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,719
(are that Cat Demon.)

31
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,639
(I don't understand.)

32
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,360
(I know she's a demon now,)

33
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,280
(but why do I find it even harder
to strike her down?)

34
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
(What defines)

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,879
(good and evil?)

36
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,810
(It seems I still haven't fully grasped)

37
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,599
(the notion)

38
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,120
(of right and wrong.)

39
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,480
Did you go after the Cat Demon?

40
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,040
I was incompetent.

41
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,720
I failed to catch the Cat Demon

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,360
and even soiled the geomantic compass.

43
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,600
What happened?

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
I ran into human traffickers.

45
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,079
I got hurt while rescuing a child.

46
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,000
Once the compass is stained with blood,

47
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,519
it will only point to the blood's owner
for seven days.

48
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Never mind.

49
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,279
Go treat your wounds.

50
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,560
Understood.

51
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,279
Master,

52
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
according to the servants,

53
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,360
Young Madam has been

54
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,319
acting strange lately.

55
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,839
Someone saw her drinking water

56
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,600
with her tongue.

57
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,519
She also likes to fish

58
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,040
in your koi pond.

59
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
Qianchun Mountain has fewer

60
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,120
than 20 hunting families.

61
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,720
None with the surname Fan,
as far as we know.

62
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,839
Dear,

63
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,759
that is peculiar indeed.

64
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,399
All right, all right.

65
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,959
I will investigate this matter.

66
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Zhen Gui,

67
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,800
there's another urgent task

68
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,199
I need you to handle.

69
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,560
Rumor has it a vicious demon

70
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,480
has been spotted again inside the city.

71
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,319
Every place it visits,

72
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,680
no one survives.

73
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,079
The people are terrified.

74
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,000
It looks like trouble is brewing
in the city again.

75
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,360
Find this demon's whereabouts

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
and report to me.

77
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,399
Why are you standing there? Go!

78
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,120
Though Qianchun Mountain
is sparsely populated,

79
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
demons abound.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,439
Dear, you mean…

81
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,519
Chen has genuine feelings for her.

82
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,279
Don't spread this

83
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,439
until we know the full truth.

84
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,560
Otherwise,

85
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,279
it could hurt them both.

86
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,519
All right.

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,759
What's this blackened thing?

88
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,920
Is that a charcoal stick?

89
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,879
People say it tastes good.

90
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,519
Who said that?

91
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,920
If you make anyone sick,
you'll pay for it!

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
It looks fine to me.

93
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,439
It's all burnt to charcoal!

94
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,079
Who would eat

95
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,319
something that black?

96
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,839
They're eating it.

97
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,279
They eat it?

98
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,120
If they get sick, you'll pay!

99
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,399
Ever since Chief Fan showed up,

100
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,480
the red beans are being used up
faster than ever.

101
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
If this keeps up,

102
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,790
we'll have to start buying them
from outside the city.

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,079
It's perfectly fine!

104
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,639
Jiang Li?

105
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,360
I finally found you, Jiang Li!

106
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,240
They won't even let me fish anymore.

107
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
Fishing like this takes forever…

108
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Dayao!

109
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,159
Quiet. I'm fishing.

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,919
Momo?

111
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,879
Momo!

112
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,480
Dayao!

113
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,320
Oh,

114
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,720
I missed you so much!

115
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,960
What are you doing here?

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
It's a long story.

117
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,759
You can move in and tell her everything later.

118
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,519
Right.

119
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,039
Come on.

120
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,759
I'll give you a tour.

121
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,039
All right.

122
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,000
You managed to get here on your own.

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,759
Impressive.

124
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,879
I'm amazing, aren't I?

125
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Not bad.

126
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Dayao.

127
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,559
You two go on ahead.

128
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,279
All right.

129
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,320
Let's go.

130
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,279
Come on.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,799
What is it?

132
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,480
Do you remember I told you

133
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,679
there's a hidden hand

134
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,080
stirring trouble behind the scenes,

135
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,120
deliberately causing chaos

136
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,279
to pit humans and demons

137
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,799
against each other?

138
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,200
I've decided to take action

139
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
and unravel their scheme piece by piece.

140
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
During this time,

141
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,840
it might be dangerous
for you and Rong Momo

142
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
to stay in the city.

143
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,679
Why don't you both

144
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,879
go back to the fort

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,799
for a while?

146
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,919
Dangerous?

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,279
Moyuan City?

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,759
If you hadn't stopped me

149
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,879
from acting,

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,480
I'd crush

151
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,600
those puny humans

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,799
like ants.

153
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,399
You worry too much.

154
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,799
Besides,

155
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,960
you said

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,440
this is your territory.

157
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,919
You'll protect me.

158
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm afraid

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,720
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

160
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,480
What does that mean?

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
I don't want to study today.

162
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,919
I'm off to play with Rong Momo.

163
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,360
Momo!

164
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Dayao!

165
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,600
I'll show you

166
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,159
something amazing!

167
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,840
All right!

168
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,159
Listen,

169
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,639
there's a little girl
who raises rabbits here,

170
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,919
and she idolizes me.

171
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,480
So,

172
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
humans aren't so bad after all.

173
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,519
They admire us demons.

174
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,879
So, humans

175
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,080
treat you well then?

176
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,679
Very well.

177
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,840
Everything

178
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,960
requires strategy.

179
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,639
I mean,

180
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,960
my alliance with Shen Wangchen

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,039
worked perfectly.

182
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Dayao,

183
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,600
is your relationship with Mr. Shen

184
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,240
just an alliance?

185
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,519
Of course.

186
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,000
And a very close one at that.

187
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,799
Whenever I find something tasty,

188
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,080
he's the first to try it.

189
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
When I find something fun,

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
he's the first one I tell.

191
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,039
Every night when we part,

192
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,919
I feel

193
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,200
