00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,439
Cat Demon?

4
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,719
It's really you.

5
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,000
Who are you?

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
Dayao!

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,879
Where have you been?

8
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,280
I've been looking for you!

9
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,079
A half-demon?

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,319
If you want a duel, let's just have one.

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,239
Cut the crap.

12
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,599
What a joke.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
You've been doing evil for a century.

14
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,159
And now you're

15
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,280
doing humanity harm

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,519
with this half-human and half-demon.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,079
You're dead meat!

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,840
A half-demon?

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,079
Momo.

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,280
I've heard about half-demons.

21
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,199
A half-demon is the result
of a human and a demon's union.

22
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,639
And they're not able
to enhance their spiritual power.

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Hear me out, Momo.

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,400
No matter how hard I work,

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,479
petty tricks

26
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,639
are all I can manage.

27
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Thus...

28
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,319
It's not that

29
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
you're reluctant
to make me the Guardian.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,240
I just can't be one.

31
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,120
Momo!

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,919
You busybody!

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,479
Fan Dayao.

34
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,639
Run.

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
Step aside!

36
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
He's my master.

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,039
If you want to fight him,

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
defeat me first.

39
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,879
You think I dare not do that?

40
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,120
Of course you'd dare to do it.

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,479
But I think

42
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,719
you should go find Miss Rong first.

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,240
Just you wait.

44
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,520
I've cast the Heartless Spell on you.

45
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,039
Whenever you think of her,

46
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,919
your heart will be in bone-eroding pain.

47
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,680
Things won't end well

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,759
if you fall in love with a demon.

49
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,840
Master.

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,520
No matter
what her past lifetime was like,

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,560
she hasn't hurt the innocent in this one.

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,319
What a joke.

53
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,360
A demon is born to hurt people.

54
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,439
But she's not the same.

55
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
How stubborn you are.

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,839
Accept your punishment.

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Momo!

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Momo!

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,959
Momo!

60
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,639
She's not back yet.

61
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,319
Where could she be?

62
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,319
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,759
I'm getting you out of here.

64
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,680
Go away!

65
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,240
Are you really going to stay here

66
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,079
and witness his wedding?

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
So what if I am?

68
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,439
If you're here to catch demons,

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
just come at me.

70
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
I've never thought of capturing you.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,680
Then why did you

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,519
cause a scene at my fort
time and time again?

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,639
Were you messing with me?

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,639
You've changed a lot.

75
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,680
What?

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,879
You're different now.

77
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,040
I have no time for you.

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,279
Enough!

79
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,120
This place is no longer safe.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,759
My master knows

81
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,720
you're hiding here.

82
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,079
You should head back
to Qianchun Mountain soon.

83
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,160
What do you want, Si Ming?

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,160
Don't tell me

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
you're trying to help me here.

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,560
For one last time.

87
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,240
You're wasting your time here.

88
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm leaving with Shen Wangchen.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,839
I love him.

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,199
I'm going back to Demon Fort with him.

91
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,439
I think he loves me too,

92
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,000
so there's no way
I'm leaving him alone.

93
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,199
A human and a demon's union

94
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,759
is destined to be
the cause of all the trouble.

95
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,000
By then,

96
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,079
Shen Wangchen will be

97
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,959
in deep water,

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,240
getting despised and reprimanded
by everyone in the city.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,759
All this has nothing to do with me.

100
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,000
I think

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
he's having a hard time here.

102
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,759

Shen Wangchen.

130
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,039
Are you really going to marry her?

131
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,440
Yes.

132
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,720
Fine.

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,399
After the wedding,

134
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,360
you'll return to Demon Fort
and be my consort.

135
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't you get it, Fan Dayao?

136
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,000
With what you have,

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,970
you're never going to become formidable
and lead the Demon Fort.

138
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,759
Stop kidding yourself.

139
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
They've bowed down to you

140
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,759
simply because

141
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,360
they're not able to put up a fight.

In reality,

143
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,919

of your foolishness

145
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000

Since the moment

152
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,320
I stepped foot in the Demon Fort,
it had been an elaborate plan of mine.

153
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
I did what I did

154
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,360
to use you

155
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,120
and eradicate the Demon Fort.

156
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
Now you know it.
