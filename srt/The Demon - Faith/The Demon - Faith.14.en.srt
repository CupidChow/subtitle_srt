3
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,719
Gosh, Chen.

4
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,680
Have you lost your mind?

5
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,159
You know full well

6
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,400
Princess Huaiyang

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,959
is spoiled and willful.

8
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,680
Chen,

9
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680
we have confirmed

10
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,599
Dayao's past.

11
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,359
She may be an orphan
from Qianchun Mountain.

12
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,280
But she's pure and kind.

13
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,959
We don't look down on her.

14
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,959
Besides, she saved you

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,799
and cared for you with all her heart.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
If you do this,

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,079
you'll break her heart.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,719
Young Master,

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,239
what's wrong with you?

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,359
Momo ignores me

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,879
because of you.

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,359
Father. Mother.

23
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,760
I have made my decision.

24
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,400
The unrest in Moyuan City

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,840
has drawn the court's attention.

26
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,400
If the Shen family doesn't act soon,

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
we may be executed.

28
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,640
Lord Huaiyang is powerful.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,599
By allying with him,

30
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,760
we can uncover the true culprit

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
and restore peace to the city.

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
What are personal feelings

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,000
compared to the safety

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,040
of the whole city?

35
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,920
I hope you'll see what truly matters.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,840
Chen,

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,480
I understand

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,879
your sense of duty.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,159
But you must know

40
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,240
that this marriage

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,719
sacrifices

42
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,039
not only your happiness

43
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,800
but also...

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
Also, Dayao's happiness.

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,960
What will become of her?

46
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,960
I'll make sure she's taken care of.

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,599
In times of crisis,

48
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,800
someone must make sacrifices.

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,919
Fan Dayao,

50
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,280
how dare you bewitch Shen Wangchen!

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
Such audacity!

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
I now command

53
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,960
that from this moment,

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,840
I banish you

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,039
from Moyuan City.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,680
You are never to return.

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,240
Who are you to say so?

58
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,840
What's between me and Shen Wangchen

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,159
is none of your business.

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,800
You...

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,879
What are you waiting for?

62
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,759
Throw this demon girl
out of the Shen Residence!

63
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,280
Go!

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,919
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,000
I believe

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,120
you would never harm anyone
for no reason.

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,560
But promise me

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,199
you won't use magic

69
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,599
so recklessly again.

70
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,759
Trust me.

71
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,400
Even without it,

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
I can still keep you safe.

73
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,560
Stop this!

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,960
Your Highness,

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,840
this is still the Shen Residence.

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,319
Acting like this,

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,199
isn't this far too...

78
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,240
Isn't this

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
making me lose face?

80
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
I beg Your Highness, show some mercy.

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,759
City Lord Chen.

82
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,759
If you keep interfering,

83
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,599
you're defying the imperial court.

84
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,319
You should consider carefully.

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,919
Shen Wangchen,

86
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,800
I'll give you a chance to explain.

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,919
Wangchen,

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,400
do you have anything

89
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
to say to her?

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,159
No.

91
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,240
Did you hear that?

92
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,719
Then get out of here!

93
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,159
Fan Dayao,

94
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,080
this is my last warning.

Moyuan City

96
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,319
is not where you belong.

97
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,280
Pack your things

98
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,479

I won't tell anyone.

00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,480
You know me?

You're Young Madam.

Aren't you afraid of me?

138

A few days ago,

139
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,839
my husband was sick.

140
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,920
You were the one
who secretly healed him, right?

141
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,879
Your husband was that old toad...

142
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,800
He's that Toad Spirit?

143
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,920
You're a human?

144
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
That old man is a demon?

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,399
Then both of you...

just pick

151
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,839
the hairpin you like.

152
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,720
When the Young Lord sees it,

153
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
he will like it as well.

154
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,759
Really?

155
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,639
But

156
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,839
we don't have any money.

157
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,639
It's fine.

158
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,279
It's free.

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
Why did you call me?

162
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
No, I didn't.

163
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,920
Yes, you did.

164
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
I really didn't.

165
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,079
I was calling the waiter.

166
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,839
So you did call me.

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
Waiter, a pot of Pu'er tea!

168
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,560

00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,720
Why are you calling me?

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,519
Waiter!

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,319
Stop calling me.

172
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,439

Waiter!

177
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,439
The geomantic compass must be broken.

178
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
Master, the compass is fine.

179
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Could it be

180
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,120
that she has cultivated more
than one demon core?

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,199
Stay here and watch the compass.

182
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
I need to pay a visit to an old friend.

183
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,600
Senior Brother,

184
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,519
I heard that demons
who reach the highest realm

185
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
can have nine lives and nine cores,

186
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,360
like the Cat Demon.

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,759
Is it true?

188
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,120
Junior Brother,

189
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,199
after all these years,

190
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,080
your obsession hasn't changed.

191
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,879
So you still refuse to help me.

192
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,759
A hundred years ago,

193
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,320
our sect lost countless lives

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,360
killing that Cat Demon.

195
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,000
Now that she has resurfaced,

196
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,600
how can you be so indifferent?

197
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,279
Junior Brother,

198
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,759
that demon is not evil.

199
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,559
Why must you hunt her down?

200
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,799
Not evil?

201
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,600
What a joke.

202
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,279
I will never forget

203
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,240
the pain of losing my parents
to the demon race.

204
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,519
I swore

205
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I would slaughter every last demon
in this world.

206
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,639
Dayao!

207
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,720
Well?

208
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960
Did you find anything to eat?

209
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,159
Look!

210
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,080
Look what I've got.

211
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,320
Where did you get these?

212
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,639
I didn't get these.

213
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,960
I brought someone.

214
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,399
Who?

215
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,120
He's over there.

216
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,480
What is he doing here?

217
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,399
Dayao,

218
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,639
he gave us the dried fish.

219
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,440
Tonight,

220
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,039
he's even finding us

221
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,799
a place to stay.

222
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,759
Him?

223
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,320
Come with me.

224
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,639
Let's go.

225
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,720
Why are you helping me?

226
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,679
You...

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,279
Does he have some kind

228
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,960
of speech impediment?

229
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,600
Dayao, I'm sure you don't know this.

230
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,840
In the demon realm,

231
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,039
a lot of little demons

232
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,039
ship you and Master Si Ming as a couple.

233
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,279
How about you consider him?

234
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,039
Nonsense!

235
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,600
A dignified demon king like me

236
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,720
can't be together with a demon slayer?

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,279
We're mortal enemies.

238
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,840
What are you thinking?

239
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,159
All right, then.

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,039
Dayao, you must be hungry.

241
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,480
Let's eat.

242
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,360
Yes, let's dig in.

243
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,440
In this world,

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,360
being rich or poor doesn't matter.

245
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,679
Where there's dried fish,

246
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,919
that's heaven.

247
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,039
I think

248
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,000
this fish is pretty tasty.

249
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,720
You don't like dried fish, right?

250
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,720
Never mind.

251
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Tomorrow,

252
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,399
I'll buy you some dried fruit.

253
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,120
It's okay, Dayao.

254
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,080
Right now, I really think

255
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
it's delicious.

256
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,320
I'll have two more.

257
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,639
See?

258
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,960
(Shen Wangchen was right.)

259
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,639
(If you care for someone,)

260
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,000
(you should be honest.)

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,320
(Sincerity for sincerity.)

262
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,960
I'll treat you well from now on.

263
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,799
No. Absolutely not.

264
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,639
Dayao, please!

265
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,240
Take me in.

266
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,919
Give me a chance,

267
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,279
and I'll give you a miracle.

268
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,600
As for the guardian post,
I can't allow that.

269
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,919
Why not?

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
What did I do wrong?

271
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,639
Just tell me.

272
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,360
I'll change.

273
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,679
Please.

274
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,000
It's only been a few days.

275
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,799
You dare question

276
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,200
my decisions?

277
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,840
Am I still your king or not?

278
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,879
If you keep this up,

279
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,240
I'll send you back to Qianchun Mountain.

280
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,000
Dayao.

281
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,279
What's gotten into you?

282
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,039
Again?

283
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,399
Dayao, just take me in.

284
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,919
Tomorrow, I'll have Master Si Ming

285
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,559
bring you more dried fish

286
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,799
of different flavors.

287
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,519
What do you say?

288
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,240
Really?

289
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,159
What flavors?

290
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,840
Tell me now.

291
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,919
Plenty.

292
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,240
Five-spice, cumin, garlic,

293
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,320
and many more.

294
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:53,919
(Xiao'er.)

295
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,600
Other flavors too?

296
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,759
So many?

297
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,799
(I don't wish for you)

298
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,200
(to carry some great destiny.)

299
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,120
(All I want is for you)

300
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,559
(to stay safe)

301
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,200
(and happy.)

302
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,519
That's it? No others?

303
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,519
No, no, no.

304
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,399
No.

305
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,279
Absolutely not.
