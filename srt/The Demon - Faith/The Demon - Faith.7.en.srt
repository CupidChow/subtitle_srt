1
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,480
You have

2
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,799
the kindest heart in the world.

3
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,519
Why not let everyone see it?

4
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,760
Xiao Er

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,079
W-what did you say?

6
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,359
Xiao Er? What do you mean?

7
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,480
Where is this Xiao Er?

8
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,120
I don't know anyone named Xiao Er.

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,599
I have no idea what you're talking about.

10
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,959
Darn it.

11
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't worry, Chief Fan.

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,159
I'll keep this a secret for you.

13
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,280
Get some rest.

14
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,120
Wipe it yourself.

15
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,879
What's wrong?

16
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
There are boundaries between men and women.

17
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,240
Did you know I'm Xiao Er?

18
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,000
So you won't give me massages anymore.

19
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,400
Alright, alright.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,240
Fine, no massage then.

21
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,199
It's not like we're

22
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,560
that close anyway.

23
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,919
But can you promise me

24
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,599
not to tell

25
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,120
anyone that my true form is a cat?

26
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,280
Can you keep it secret?

27
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,719
Sure, don't worry.

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,280
Now you know too.

29
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,599
As a demon,

30
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm flawed.

31
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,800
Can you promise me one more thing?

32
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,759
Just one request?

33
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,879
Don't hurt the other demons

34
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,960
in my clan.

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,240
If you want to kill, come for me.

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,199
Alright.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
No,

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,719
I mean,

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,199
I will never hurt you.

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
I said before,

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
whether it's me

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,360
or my father,

43
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,240
we never kill the innocent.

44
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
No matter if they're human or demon.

45
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,319
I trust you.

46
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,360
What I promised you

47
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,959
I will always keep my word.

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,399
Alright.

49
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,680
Then from today on,

50
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,079
you must listen carefully

51
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,000
to my guidance.

52
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,079
Okay.

53
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,279
Rong Momo.

54
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
Si... Siming.

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,160
Eldest Cousin Siming is here.

56
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,240
Don't make a sound.

57
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,839
I'm not here to cause trouble.

58
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,560
You know me?

59
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Everyone who enters the clan

60
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,879
gets a copy.

61
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,319
The King's enemy list.

62
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,000
You're ranked number one.

63
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,279
Who doesn't know you?

64
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
But, to be honest,

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,279
Everyone says you're handsome.

66
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,959
Didn't expect you to be this handsome.

67
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,720
I'm number one in her heart?

68
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,439
Yeah.

69
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,519
Wait, no.

70
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,240
Now it's Young Master Shen.

71
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
Shen Wangchen.

72
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,120
She put him first.

73
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,079
That's right.

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
What kind of person is he?

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
The King said,

76
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,879
Young Master Shen

77
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,519
is our greatest enemy.

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,439
He's very talented,

79
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,040
gentle as jade,

80
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
and also...

81
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,759
Gentle... gentle...

82
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,959
Give this to Fan Dayao.

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,639
This magic artifact

84
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,160
can hide all her demon aura.

85
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,399
Monster hunters won't be able to find her anymore.

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,439
Why?

87
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,120
Aren't you a monster hunter?

88
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,120
I am.

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
So I won't come here anymore.

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,759
Why did Siming give me this?

91
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,959
Could it be

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,319
he's plotting something against me?

93
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,639
Cousin.

94
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,639
I've tested this thing.

95
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,480
It really hides demon aura.

96
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a rare and valuable item.

97
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Something's off.

98
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,720
He must have other motives.

99
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,759
Don't let him fool you.

100
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,240
Cousin.

101
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,040
I think Master Siming

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,560
gave you this

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,279
because he truly cares about you.

104
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,360
And I think he likes you.

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
Likes me?

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
Then the monster hunter...

107
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,160
Chief Fan, from now on,

108
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
it's best to avoid contact with Siming.

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
Why?

110
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,240
He...

111
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,079
He's a Monster Hunter.

112
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,879
He's very dangerous.

113
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,639
But I think

114
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
he's different from other Monster Hunters.

115
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,839
He looks kind of clueless,

116
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,319
doesn't seem dangerous at all.

117
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,120
Alright, focus.

118
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,519
Starting tomorrow,

119
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,560
your Lesson in Dominance begins.

120
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,079
Cousin,

121
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,759
step aside.

122
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,319
Show your true face.

123
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
I think this outfit

124
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,959
isn't imposing at all.

125
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,319
I'd rather switch back

126
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
to what Shen suggested.

127
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,799
What's the point of practicing the Smile Technique?

128
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,679
It's a waste of my time.

129
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,200
Cousin

130
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,919
Can I refuse this severance pay?

131
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't want to leave.

132
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Momo,

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,799
About the Truth Water incident,

134
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,200
I don't blame you at all.

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
I actually want to praise you.

136
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,360
If it weren't for you,

137
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
If not for you,

138
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,000
I wouldn't have realized

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
my own shortcomings.

140
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,240
Cousin, are you alright?

141
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,519
Do your best.

142
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I believe in you.

143
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,039
A bright future is just around the corner.

144
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,120
Thank you, Cousin.

145
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,240
I'll complete the mission for sure.

146
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
No need to thank me.

147
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,480
Impressive.

148
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,279
When does Young Master

149
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,519
plan to return the Demon Core?

150
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
Young Master's health

151
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
I know what I'm doing.

152
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,960
But in this city,

153
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,799
who is really stirring up trouble?

154
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,360
What is his true goal?

155
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,679
In your opinion,

156
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,000
maybe all of this

157
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,840
is the work of one person.

158
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,000
This person is up to no good.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,679
There must be

160
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,960
a hidden secret behind it.

161
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,159
We can't let our guard down.

162
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,039
Really.

163
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,840
The King has learned

164
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
how to be considerate.

165
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,679
I think you all

166
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,879
should head back now.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Young Master Shen's plan worked.

168
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,120
He actually changed the King's attitude.

169
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,200
Got it.

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,279
We underlings really suffer.

171
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,679
Haven't seen the King for days,

172
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,919
I'm starting to miss her.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,720
Then let's go back today.

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
No way.

175
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,399
Young Master Shen said

176
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,559
if we want the King

177
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,120
to truly learn how to make friends,

178
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,879
we have to follow his advice.

179
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,200
You all

180
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,559
don't want the King to spend her whole life

181
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,519
without any friends,

182
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,320
and end up alone, right?

183
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,519
Who says the King has no friends?

184
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
I've seen Master Siming and Cousin

185
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,759
getting along really well.

186
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:20,879
Seriously,

187
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,080
I saw Master Siming give Cousin

188
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,679
a gift.

189
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,159
Really!

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,799
I told you, that guy

191
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,559
has ulterior motives for our King.

192
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,240
What kind of monster hunter visits so many times

193
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,919
and never takes a demon with him?

194
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,840
A monster hunter and the Demon Queen—

195
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,799
forbidden romance!

196
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,559
No, no, no.

197
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,000
I think

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,679
Young Master Shen and our King

199
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,720
are the best match.

200
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,759
Think about it—

201
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,879
if Young Master Shen

202
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,480
became the King's husband,

203
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,919
our Ao Wu Village would thrive!

204
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,559
It's just around the corner!

205
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,759
Our Young Master says

206
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,240
you can go back now.

207
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,840
Let me say one more thing—

208
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,679
Our Young Master

209
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,120
is elegant and brilliant.

210
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,720
He would never fall for

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
your boss, that

212
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,559
hot-tempered, brainless demon woman.

213
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,879
No one is allowed to speak ill of the King.

214
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,039
Go.

215
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,480
I'm off to find the King.

216
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,399
Going to find the King.

217
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,200
Momo.

218
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,039
Momo, they...

219
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,279
They're bullying me.

220
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,039
And they won't let me tell the truth.

221
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,320
That Da Yao...

222
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,440
Isn't she always fierce?

223
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,039
No one is allowed to speak ill of Eldest Cousin.

224
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,440
Come on, place your bets!

225
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,799
Here.

226
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,759
Place your bets, come on!

227
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,000
Come on, come on!

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,759
Get up.

229
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,639
Come on!

230
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,879
Put up everything you've got.

231
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,720
It's Siming, Siming!

232
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,039
Hurry up, hurry!

233
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,000
Bet on Young Master Shen.

234
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,840
What?

235
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
Who will the King marry as her consort?

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,279
It's not decided yet.

237
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,559
I'm betting on Young Master Shen.

238
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,559
You guys should bet too!

239
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,720
Come on.

240
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,039
Trust me, you won't go wrong.

241
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
Siming and our King

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,679
have been flirting for years.

243
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,879
But Young Master Shen

244
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,360
hasn't even been here a month.

245
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,919
He's way behind.

246
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,919
Bet on Siming.

247
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,279
Siming, of course.

248
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,080
I think Young Master Shen will win.

249
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,639
You've had a thing with Siming for years.

250
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
What do you mean by "a thing"?

251
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,799
Just wait, you'll lose.

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,720
Jiang Li.

253
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,639
Jiang Li bets on Young Master Shen.

254
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,919
Bet on Young Master Shen! Bet on Young Master Shen!

255
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,879
Young Master, I trust your taste.

256
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,759
That's right.

257
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,559
Great, everyone's back.

258
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,759
Shen Wangchen, you're amazing.

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,399
Young Master Shen! Young Master Shen! Young Master Shen!

260
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,360
That's it!

261
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,639
King.

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,279
Did you win over Young Master Shen?

263
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,320
Getting a man is no trouble at all.

264
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,639
Shen Wangchen, come here.
