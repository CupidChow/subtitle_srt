1
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,359
You’ve really got it tough.

2
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,239
This lousy place, Chicken Girl.

3
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:09,879
Do you really think

4
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,840
they’re willingly

5
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,280
serving you?

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,879
I can't stay here another day.

7
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,560
How dare you all act like this!

8
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,680
Leader Fan,

9
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,400
Why don’t we go somewhere else

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,799
to talk about divine power?

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,920
I can't do this anymore.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,159
Just you wait!

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,719
Shen Wangchen,

14
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,760
wait for me.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,400
What’s the deal with divine power?

16
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,159
Great, great!

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,560
You’re finally willing to tell me.

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,439
Come on, tell me quickly!

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,560
Where did you get your power?

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,799
Let me learn from you.

21
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,159
Leader Fan,

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
You’ve had a bit too much to drink.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
You’re not really sober.

24
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,439
Yeah, I’m not really sober.

25
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,920
Don’t rush things.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Let’s talk when you’re sober.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,040
I’m so anxious!

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,400
I’m about to die from anxiety.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,920
Since you want to know about divine power,

30
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,400
you have to answer a question first.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
Is your true form really a tiger?

32
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,439
Leader Fan,

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,719
How did this happen?

34
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,400
I only put it in the grilled fish,

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,479
just added truth serum.

36
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,000
Momo,

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,719
Is there anything I can help you with?

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,280
Can you take this over for me?

39
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,479
Truth serum.

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
Isn’t this the chili oil

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,479
I usually use when I cook?

42
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,639
Tonight’s dishes,

43
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,919
I put it in all of them.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,159
I’m doomed.

45
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,439
I messed up again.

46
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,759
My cousin definitely won’t want me now.

47
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,400
It’s okay.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,879
If that evil demon doesn’t want you,

49
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,400
I do.

50
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,759
Why?

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,879
Because I like you.

52
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,400
Actually,

53
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,800
from the very first time

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,039
I saw you,

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,759
I fell in love with you.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Leader Fan,

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,159
Leader Fan,

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,879
Fan…

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,919
When I was lonely as a child,

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
I often cried

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,160
to let out my feelings.

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,000
I’m crying now.

63
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,519
This truth serum

64
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,240
even makes you cry?

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,759
Looks like this truth serum

66
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,680
really makes people

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
reveal their true feelings.

68
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,759
Everyone has sorrow in their heart.

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
You used the truth serum

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
to let out your feelings.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,839
That’s a good thing.

72
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,399
Each time the Samsara Bell rings

73
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,399
it means a young demon has died.

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,360
When I arrived just now,

75
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720
it had already vanished.

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,959
I couldn’t protect it.

77
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,279
The last trace of its spirit

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,959
was seen by you.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Another young demon

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,879
was killed by the demon hunter

81
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,639
sent by your Lord of Moyuan City.

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,959
My father would never

83
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,000
give such an order.

84
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,759
Do you take me for a fool?

85
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,759
Within five hundred miles,

86
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,160
what demon doesn’t know

87
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
that your Lord of Moyuan City

88
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,439
wants to wipe out our kind?

89
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,399
What’s the point of mocking me?

90
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,079
But none of you demons

91
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,639
have ever seen the real Lord.

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,519
Isn’t that right?

93
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,680
There are good and bad demons.

94
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,959
Humans are the same.

95
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,600
On this trip, I discovered

96
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,920
that near Qianchun Mountain,

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,079
people keep attacking demons

98
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,920
without caring who’s innocent or guilty.

99
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,079
Just like demons in Moyuan City

100
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,040
committing crimes and killing innocents.

101
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,079
But as far as I know,

102
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,079
what happens in the city has nothing to do with you.

103
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,800
Nothing to do with me.

104
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,279
Demon girl! Monster!

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,639
She killed my husband!

106
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,600
Monster!

107
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,480
There’s a demon! A demon!

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,199
Run!

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,879
Are you saying

110
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
you trust me?

111
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,439
I trust you.

112
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,199
For hundreds of years,

113
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,360
no human has ever

114
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,199
been willing to listen to us demons.

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,399
Whenever they see us,

116
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,319
they either want to kill or destroy us.

117
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,079
That’s why I must become strong.

118
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,079
One day, when my power is limitless,

119
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,199
I can truly protect my kind.

120
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,319
We won’t be persecuted by humans anymore.

121
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,360
If you’re willing,

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,480
you can trust me.

123
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,279
My father would never

124
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,439
blindly

125
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,360
order the extermination

126
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,800
of all demons.

127
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,160
He’s just been searching

128
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,959
for the real culprit behind the strange murders in the city.

129
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Because the deaths are so strange,

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,480
it’s believed they weren’t caused by humans.

131
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,439
So,

132
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,160
do you really believe it has nothing to do with me?

133
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,439
Of course. I know you.

134
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,959
Those cases

135
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,720
were all very strange.

136
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,040
I think, Chief Fan,

137
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,959
you’re so righteous and honorable.

138
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,279
If we work together,

139
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,720
we’ll get twice the results with half the effort.

140
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,240
I also hope that from now on, Chief Fan,

141
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,879
you’ll listen to explanations

142
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,920
and not act on your own.

143
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,120
Alright.

144
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,000
Then tell me,

145
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
why are you looking for the cat demon?

146
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,120
I can’t tell you yet.

147
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,480
You—

148
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,360
Shen Wangchen.

149
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,639
My Lord.

150
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,839
We truly know we were wrong.

151
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,519
Please don’t drive us away, My Lord.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,279
Don’t drive us away, My Lord.

153
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,560
My Lord, we were wrong.

154
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,600
We were wrong, My Lord.

155
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,879
Please calm down.

156
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,959
We know we were wrong, My Lord.

157
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,399
My Lord, we were wrong.

158
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,360
Yesterday,

159
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,519
who said they wanted to quit?

160
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,000
Serving the Lord

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
is the highest honor.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,679
My loyalty to the Lord

163
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,879
is as clear as day and night.

164
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
I won't leave.

165
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,080
My Lord,

166
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
I really didn't mean it yesterday.

167
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,399
Silence!

168
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,120
You dare show your face to me?

169
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,399
My Lord,

170
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,080
Please don't kick me out.

171
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,200
All of you,

172
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,759
go to the forest

173
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,360
and do ten thousand squat jumps.

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
Don't come back until you're done.

175
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,879
Hurry! Toad Spirit, lead the team!

176
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,559
Yes!

177
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,639
You two, go as well.

178
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,720
My Lord,

179
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
Get out!

180
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,559
All of you...

181
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,960
You!

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,759
Yesterday, you took

183
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,879
a young demon from my camp.

184
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,840
And you dare show up today?

185
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,360
It wasn't me.

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,440
Ridiculous.

187
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,679
You've caused trouble here

188
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,240
again and again.

189
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
Do you really think I won't kill you?

190
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,759
Today, I'll avenge the young demon.

191
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,639
Leader Fan!

192
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,639
Why are you here?

193
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,759
Didn't you promise me

194
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,080
that if I stayed here,

195
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,279
you wouldn't hurt anyone anymore?

196
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
You're here to help him?

197
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,919
Fine.

198
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,200
Then I'll kill you too!

199
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,080
Watch out!

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,480
This person is clearly human,

201
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,200
so why does he have a demon core inside him?
