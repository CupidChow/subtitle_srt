3
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,560
Master.

4
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
What are...

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
You rogue.

6
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,439
Get out!

7
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,879
Master.

8
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,920
You're actually consuming
a demon's primordial spirit?

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,840
Why?

10
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,560
Are you disobeying me now?

11
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,319
From now on,

12
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,439
you are no longer my master.

13
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,520
What do we do?

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,960
It's been a month
since Her Majesty's return,

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
but she's been quiet.

16
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,240
What exactly happened?

17
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm worried sick.

18
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,479
Do you think Her Majesty has become

19
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,240
a mute?

20
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,159
Well,

21
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,879
you should stop talking nonsense.

22
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,080
If worse comes to worst,

23
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,120
give Her Majesty a performance.

24
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,199
After all, you're an all-rounder.

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm way less than you!

26
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,319
With your funny appearance,

27
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,390
you should give her a performance!

28
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:57,919
Enough!

29
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,000
Now isn't the time

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,240
to be joking around.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
I feel depressed

32
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,840

(One month later)

57
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,879
Why are you here?

58
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,240
Chief Fan.

59
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
I've brought Momo home.

60
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,959
Having learned

61
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,480
about her identity as a half-demon
on that night,

62
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,600
she couldn't accept it.

63
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,839
She then bumped into a demon slayer

64
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,360
and put up a tough fight.

65
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,170
Her true form was revealed
after sustaining a heavy injury.

66
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,519
Master Shang said

67
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,959
all 24 types of cooling herbs

68
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,920
are needed

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
to recover her human form.

70
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,990
I tried the herbs I came across
along the way,

71
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,000
but I ended up getting poisoned.

72
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,320
Luckily, I managed to make it back
to Qianchun Mountain.

73
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,079
I hope it's not too late

74
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
to save her.

75
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,360
Thank you for all the hard work.

76
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,290
Ask the Old Turtle
to help you get rid of the poison later.

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,319
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,000
Your Majesty.

79
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
Speak.

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,199
I sneaked into Moyuan City
and asked around

81
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,279
as you told me.

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
The people there said

83
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,959
the consort has been sent

84
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,199
to the suburb for recuperation.

85
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,120
They said...

86
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,079
Cut to the chase.

87
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,600
The consort has been in a coma,

88
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,040
and his days are numbered.

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,879
It's the demon core.

90
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Shen Wangchen!

91
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,680
Shen Wangchen!

92
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
Shen Wangchen!

93
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,879
Shen Wangchen!

94
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,680
Shen Wangchen!

95
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,079
(How could it be?)

96
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,000
She's fallen for it,
and she won't be able to move for now.

97
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,360
Hurry and catch her.

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,360
Mr. Zhen?

99
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,759
Zhen Gui.

100
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,079
I heard there's been some evil demon

101
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,001
in the city again.

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,279
Find out
that demon's whereabouts immediately.

103
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,160
Well, Young Madam,

104
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,240
just what's the matter

105
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,319
with Young City Lord?

106
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,759
You must hang in there.

107
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,360
You have our support,

108
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,439
so don't ever give up.

109
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,160
Why?

110
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,399
Shen Wangchen and his family

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
have been treating you well.

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,519
They're treating me well?

113
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I have

114
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,399
dedicated half of my life

115
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,639
to Moyuan City.

116
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,080
But what have I received in return?

117
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,840
All the glory

118
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,759
belongs to the Shen family!

119
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,640
The City Lord had been muddle-headed
and sheltering his people.

120
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,720
Before his departure,

121
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,279
he still insisted on making

122
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,240
his badly sick son

123
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,960
the next City Lord.

124
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,879
That is unfair to me!

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,120
The Shen family
is nothing but incompetent.

126
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,879
I should be

127
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,639
the City Lord instead!

128
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Now that

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,919
Shen Wangchen is gone,

130
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm blessed enough

131
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,600
to have the goods on them.

132
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,039
Tonight,

133
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,000
I shall eradicate the Shen family

134
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,559
after dealing with you.

135
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,120
Shen Wangchen.

136
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,720
Evil demon.

137
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,919
You will meet your demise today.

138
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:29,840
