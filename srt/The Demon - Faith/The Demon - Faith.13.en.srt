Awu,

13
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,959
from now on, you are my wife.

14
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,759
Demon,

15
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,719
face your fate!

16
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,400
No!

17
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,240
How could this be?

18
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,039
Exactly the same.

19
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,080
How can it be exactly the same?

20
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,520
Could that dream have been

21
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,639
from a past life of mine?

22
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,240
Qinghe!

23
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,719
Save… save yourself…

24
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,319
No, I won't!

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm not going anywhere!

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,759
We promised

27
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,439
we would be together forever!

28
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,520
Qinghe!

29
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,719
May we be together again
in another life…

Dayao.

73
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,839
Master.

74
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,319
My time is running out.

75
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,279
Once I return

76
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,839
the demon core inside me,

77
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,160
my life will end immediately.

78
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,360
She lost a demon core,
causing her powers to be unbalanced,

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,800
and her fear of water
even stronger than others of her kind.

80
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,040
That's why she transforms

81
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,199
during rainy days.

82
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,759
She is a rare Cat Demon
with two demon cores.

83
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,079
Though she is a demon,

84
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,839
she carries an extraordinary mission.

85
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,879
And you are destined

86
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,000
to be her tribulation.

87
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,959
That's why you sent me
to find the demon core.

88
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,120
Not to have her heal me,

89
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,079
but to use my life

90
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,720
to end this disaster.

91
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,959
My life was given to me by her.

92
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,000
Rest assured.

93
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,959
I won't sacrifice Dayao's happiness

94
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,279
for a fleeting moment of pleasure.

95
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,160
Nor will I abandon Moyuan City

96
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
and its people.

97
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,759
I accept my destiny,

98
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,240
and I want Dayao

99
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,199
to have a peaceful, complete life.

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you intend

101
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,439
to face this catastrophe

102
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,839
all on your own?

103
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,199
You might lose

104
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,639
everyone close to you.

105
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,279
When that happens,

106
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,879
you'll be all alone again.

107
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,480
The happiness you long for,

108
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
your loved ones…

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,759
It's all right.

110
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,919
I can bear it.

111
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,559
Shen Wangchen,

112
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,919
I'm giving you one last chance.

113
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
If you agree to marry me,

114
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,080
I will use all the power of my court

115
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,720
to eliminate the demons causing chaos

116
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,919
in the city.

117
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,559
I agree.

118
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,519
If you continue to be stubborn,

119
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,720
don't blame me for…

120
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,399
You…

121
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,200
You agree?

122
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,240
Did he say yes?

123
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,879
Was he speaking to me?

124
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,240
Yes.

125
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,480
Shen Wangchen,

126
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,480
I love you.

127
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,039
Dayao,

128
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,759
I've decided

129
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,799
to propose to Princess Huaiyang.

130
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,559
Looks like someone

131
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,240
still doesn't understand the situation.

132
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,080
Why are you proposing to her?

133
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,080
Are you that close now?

134
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,159
You shouldn't be

135
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,080
living here anymore.

136
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Pack your things

137
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,519
and return to the fort.

138
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,240
You…

139
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,639
- Mr. Shen…
- Young Master…

140
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Her Highness has spoken.

What's gotten into you?

143
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,840
I told you.

144
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,120
No one here

145
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,399
can harm me.

146
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,840

I would have already…
