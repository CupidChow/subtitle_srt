00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:07,025
(Moyuan City)

4
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,640
Come here!

5
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,840
Don't move!

6
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,840
Stop!

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,359
Come here!

8
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,120
Stop right there!

9
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,159
Hey, I'm talking to you!

10
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,640
Stay still!

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,840
Come here!

12
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,120
Yes, you!

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Look carefully.

14
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,120
Get over here!

15
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,000
Behave!

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,760
Who says you can leave?

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,480
Come here!

18
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,079
Look carefully!

19
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,920
Don't let my parents know

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,480
about the Cat Demon

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,400
when we arrive home.

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,719
Yes, Young Master.

23
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:58,825
(Shen Residence)

24
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,439
Young Master,

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,599
you've finally returned.

26
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,000
(Zhen Gui)
City Lord's health is...

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,799
Mr. Zhen,

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
take me to my father first.

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Young Master, come.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,400
This way, please.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,325
(Shen Residence)

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,599
Here.

33
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,240
Dear, take this medicine.

34
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:20,680
(City Lord of Moyuan City)

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,599
That's enough for now.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,479
City Lord!

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,319
Madam!

38
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,639
Young Master has returned!

39
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,240
Chen!

40
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,560
Chen.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,639
Mother.

42
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,360
Father.

43
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,560
I have returned.

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,360
Chen,

45
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,080
I am so glad to finally see you.

46
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,560
(Lady of Mo Yuan City)
They said

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,479
you were caught by a Tiger Demon

48
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,800
in Qianchun Mountain.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,039
I thought...

50
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,120
Forgive me for making you worried.

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm just glad you're back.

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,599
As long as you're safe at home.

53
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,919
Young Lord,
there's something you don't know.

54
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,599
While you were away,

55
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,479
demons kept appearing in the city.

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,319
The people here

57
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,960
would rather kill a hundred by mistake

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,599
than miss one.

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
Moyuan City

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,120
is in chaos,

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
making everyone on edge.

62
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,599
City Lord has been working day
and night,

63
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,199
which has worsened his old illness.

64
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,680
And your health is also...

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,479
Enough!

66
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,800
Chen just returned.

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
No need to say more.

68
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,120
Yes, Master.

69
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,719
Father,

70
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,599
I've been unfilial.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,479
I couldn't care for you
while you were sick,

72
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,479
and I couldn't share

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
the burden of the nation with you.

74
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,639
Chen, get up.

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
You're not to blame.

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,639
So tell me.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,280
Did your trip
to the Western Regions go smoothly?

78
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,840
Chen,

79
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,080
did you find the medicine

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,039
to cure your strange illness?

81
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,199
Don't worry, Mother.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
We have a lead.

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,479
That's great.

84
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,520
Zhen Gui,

85
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,120
go to Qianchun Mountain

86
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,639
and retrieve that medicine immediately.

87
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Mother, shouldn't we wait
until things are certain

88
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,080
before sending someone?

89
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,159
Why wait?

90
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,560
Bring the medicine back.

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
Once your illness is cured,

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,439
your marriage arrangements
will be easier.

93
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,479
When that time comes,

94
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,120
I want to hold grandchildren
in my arms someday.

95
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,879
But Mother...

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Then...

97
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,599
City Lord,

98
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,039
Princess Huaiyang sent an invitation.

99
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,970
She wants to invite Young Master

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,360
to have lunch
at Xiaguang Restaurant the next day.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
Princess Huaiyang?

102
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,479
It's something absurd.

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
Last year on Chinese New Year's Eve,

104
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,879
Princess Huaiyang came to Moyuan City

105
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,720
with officials
to hear the people's concerns.

106
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,279
She saw you

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
and...

108
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,519
She fell for you at first sight

109
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,800
and hasn't forgotten you since.

110
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,000
Not long after,

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,519
she personally came to find you.

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,839
Luckily,

113
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,120
you were here
because you were away looking

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,160
for medicine at the time.

115
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
It was absurd.

116
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,279
We told her

117
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,639
about your illness

118
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,720
to decline politely.

119
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,800
Do you know what she said?

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,639
She said you're handsome

121
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
and that seeing you every day
would make her happy.

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,439
What kind

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,399
of nonsense is that?

124
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,759
Princess Huaiyang

125
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,480
is extremely headstrong.

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,079
She's definitely not a suitable match.

127
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,279
Don't worry.

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,879
I'll go see her.

129
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
Those are my rabbits!

130
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,360
Give it back!

131
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,319
What if they are rabbit spirits?

132
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,279
No! Don't!

133
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,759
Don't kill my rabbits!

134
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,800
It's not a demon.

135
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
You're the demons.

136
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,720
Get away!

137
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,639
You demon!

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So it's you!

139
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,319
No!

140
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
You...

141
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,800
How dare you get in the way
of a demon slayer?

142
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
Stop it,
or I'll report you to the authorities.

143
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,399
You?

144
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,480
You can't even identify demons,

145
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
and you want to catch them?

146
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,879
The strongest demon

147
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,360
is right in front of you.

148
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,600
Yet, you're picking

149
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,879
a fight

150
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,959
with three kits?

151
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,800
Who are you insulting?

152
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
It seems like

153
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,519
you came to compete for the bounty.

154
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,639
Prepare to die!

155
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,480
What a trash.

156
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,920
A demon!

157
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
The demon has killed someone!

158
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,120
Demon!

159
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,560
That's right.

160
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,639
I am the strongest demon

161
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,519
in the world,

162
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,560
Fan Dayao.

163
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Go and tell your family.

164
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,079
Yes, it is I,

165
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,839
Fan Dayao.

166
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,720
The strongest demon in the world!

167
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,959
Pleased to meet you.

168
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,920
Pleased to meet you.

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
We should leave.

170
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,480
Go home.

171
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,120
Let's go.

172
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,662
(Bai)

173
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Why aren't you running?

174
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,439
Aren't you afraid I'll tear you apart?

175
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,319
Dayao,

176
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,800
I think you're so cool!

177
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
I really like you.

178
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
You like me?

179
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,199
Thank you for saving my rabbits.

180
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,720
Aren't you afraid of me?

181
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
No,

182
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,480
I like you.

183
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,879
(Like me?)

184
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,639
(This kid)

185
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,439
(somehow reminds me)

186
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,839
(of Shen Wangchen.)

187
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,920
(Maybe she's Shen Wangchen's ally.)

188
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,759
Tell me!

189
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,879
Where's Shen Wangchen?

190
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,879
Dayao,

191
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,439
we're going home for lunch.

192
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,240
See you again.

193
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,639
Humans, huh?

194
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,000
If it keeps raining,

195
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,120
I won't last much longer.

196
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:56,262
(Princess Huaiyang)

197
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,680
I've heard you have a strange illness.

198
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,839
But your complexion and appearance

199
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
are flawless.

200
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,680
Your Highness, you flatter me.

201
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
We do make

202
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,480
a fine pair.

203
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,959
Don't you think so, City Lord?

204
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you for your praise,
Princess Huaiyang.

205
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,279
Now that the Young Lord has returned,

206
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,320
pack your things,

207
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,559
come back to the capital with me,
and tell my parents...

208
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,159
Your Highness,

209
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,720
I already have someone I love.

210
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,480
Who?

211
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,720
A princess?

212
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,720
A royal princess?

213
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,600
Or…

214
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,639
To you, Princess,

215
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,799
she's only an ordinary person.

216
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,159
To me,

217
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,679
there's no one like her.

218
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,960
I ask you to be magnanimous.

219
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,960
Shen Wangchen!

220
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,159
Those who caught my eye

221
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,320
have no right to refuse me!

222
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,639
Someone!

223
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,440
Yes, Your Highness.

224
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,759
Take him back.

225
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,080
No.

226
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,840
Absolutely not.

227
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,039
Dear,

228
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,799
calm down.

229
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,120
They are all royal guards.

230
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,000
If a fight breaks out,

231
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,679
it would offend the Emperor
and bring trouble

232
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,919
to everyone in Moyuan City.

233
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,000
They can't get near Chen.

234
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,679
He knows what he's doing.

235
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,840
Where's that wretched Shen Wangchen

236
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
hiding?

237
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,720
With all this southern rain,

238
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm glad I moved to the northwest.

239
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,399
I have to be careful.

240
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,039
I can't turn into a cat again.

241
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,519
This mission is serious.

242
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:43,960
Everyone, come!

243
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Look at this.

244
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,879
What is it?

245
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,159
Let me see.

246
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,559
Let me see.

247
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,799
Why is there a crowd?

248
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,080
Could Shen Wangchen be there?

249
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,360
All right, then.

250
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,759
For the demon core,

251
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,039
I'll give it my all.

252
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,625
(Xiaoyao Inn)

253
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:14,600
(Xiaoyao Inn)

254
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,879
Look! Look!

255
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,480
Stop looking.

256
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,120
The City Lord's son

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,039
is marrying the Princess.

258
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,240
A perfect match.

259
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,320
You see.

260
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
The Young Lord and the Princess

261
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
are a pair of talent and beauty.

262
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
They're absolutely perfect together.

263
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,679
Yes, it's quite the celebration.

264
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,600
Young Lord? Is it Shen Wangchen?

265
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
I can go with you.

266
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,320
