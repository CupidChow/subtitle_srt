[Expose the Disguise]

4
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,200
I witnessed you assassinating Shenghan.

5
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,070
Don't think
the Prime Minister can save you.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,390
How arrogant are you!

7
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,750
Old Madam.

8
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,430
I saw Xin

9
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,000
carrying a basin of blood.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,240
General's injuries must be severe.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,670
Xu Qingqing.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,920
You've been relying on
your status in Prime Minister's Manor.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,200
Since you became part of our family,

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,110
I have ignored many of your actions.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
But now that you've harmed Shenghan,

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,230
you no longer deserve
to be my granddaughter-in-law.

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,760
I'll give you two options.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,070
First,

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,710
divorce Shenghan.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,560
Second,

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,920
stay as the General's wife,

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,640
but receive 100 lashes as punishment.

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,350
Fate determines if you live or die.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,790
I haven't obtained the token yet,

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,760
so I can't leave here.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,640
I am willing
to abide by the family rules.

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,710
Grandmother.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,040
Qingqing was framed.

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,560
Shengming.

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,950
Why would you say such things?

31
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,840
It was me who injured Shenghan.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,480
Stop making a scene.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
You've always been honest and kind.

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,790
How could you easily hurt someone?

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,920
It was just a trial between us,

36
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,950
but I accidentally hurt him.

37
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,190
I am willing to be punished.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,280
Shengming, you don't
need to take the blame for me.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
This matter started because of me.

40
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

41
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,750
Each person
is responsible for their actions.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,590
Qingqing, you don't need to say more.

43
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,280
Shengming.

44
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,150
I saw this with my own eyes.

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,910
It must be
Xu Qingqing who instigated you

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,190
to come to defend her.

47
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,430
Every word I say is true.

48
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,080
I wasn't influenced by anyone else.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,960
Enough.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
Xu Qingqing.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,750
Since you married
into the General's Manor,

52
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,870
there have been many incidents.

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,030
I'll fulfill your wishes

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,710
since you all are eager to be punished.

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,520
Each of you
shall receive 50 lashes. Start now.

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,030
It's my fault you got hurt.

58
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,430
Stop!

59
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,680
Shenghan, you're finally awake.

60
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,000
You're badly injured.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,310
You should rest adequately.

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
How did you end up here?

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,430
Qingqing didn't mean to hurt me.

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,280
It was all an accident.

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,470
No one

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,150
is allowed to lay a finger on my wife.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Take Madam away.

68
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,080
Yes.

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,630
Madam.

70
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,710
Keep hitting him.

71
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,840
Until he comes to his senses.

72
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,310
How many people did this woman deceive?

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,040
I won't let you off the hook!

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,750
Shenghan, you're here.

75
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,870
I could overlook
all those little schemes

76
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,680
you pulled in the manor.

77
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,750
But you dared to harm her.

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,070
Do you

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,000
still want your face?

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,750
Shenghan.

81
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,390
Shenghan, I know I was wrong.

82
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,750
I won't dare to do it again, Shenghan.

83
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,190
Please spare me.

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
She's just a fake. Why?

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,680
Why?

86
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,750
If I say she's real,

87
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,390
then she's real.

88
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,040
Be careful, Madam.

89
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,480
I'll take my leave.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,360
General.

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,120
Shengming is still being punished.

92
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Please, General.

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
You should take care of yourself first.

94
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,630
Please, General, save Shengming.

95
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,310
You actually went to the extent

96
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,390
of begging for his rescue.

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
I am indebted to him.

98
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,040
He once saved me from Mu Yuexi.

99
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,160
Now he takes the blame for me.

100
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
I can't just ignore him.

101
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,720
Since he could save you,

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,190
he should be capable of saving himself.

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,160
General.

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,720
He'll be left with severe aftereffects

105
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,000
after 50 lashes.

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,040
He'll be bedridden
for the rest of his life.

107
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,190
So, you feel sorry
for him being in pain.

108
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,070
Then I'll make sure
he suffers even more.

109
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,000
I can only take a gamble now.

110
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,430
If you don't save him,

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,750
I'll publicly expose
your faking of injuries.

112
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
You dare to threaten me?

113
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,270
You're willing to do anything

114
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,070
for Gu Shengming.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
General, if you don't believe me,

116
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,040
you can try me.

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,430
I'll have someone rescue him.

118
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,190
Your tendons and bones are not hurt.

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,480
You should recover

120
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,040
in about half a month.

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,510
I wonder why Mu Yuexi
hastily left the General's Manor.

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,120
Without her meddling,

123
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
your days here should be better.

124
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,510
Avoid getting your wound wet.

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,800
And try to prevent
excessive movements.

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,070
You are the only one
concerned about my safety.

127
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm the one who caused you trouble.

128
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,120
I should be taking care of you.

129
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,830
What's wrong?

130
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,430
Come with me.

131
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,830
Shenghan, you're hurting Qingqing.

132
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,440
Let go of her.

133
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,440
Stop pretending.

134
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,440
I've seen enough of this act.

135
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,440
Gu Shenghan.

136
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,670
Why are you
so cruel to your own brother?

137
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,510
You say I'm cruel?

138
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Then let me show you

139
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,840
what true cruelty is.

140
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,440
You...

141
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,600
Let go of me!

142
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Shenghan.

143
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,960
Qingqing is so kind.

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,910
Why are you treating her so harshly?

145
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,320
She's my woman.

146
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,510
It's none of your business

147
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,390
how I treat her.

148
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,910
Gu Shenghan.

149
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,480
Let go of me.

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,600
What are you doing?

151
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,360
Gu Shenghan.

152
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,600
One day,

153
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,790
everything you have will be mine.

154
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,150
Let go of me.

155
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,120
Gu Shenghan.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,840
You are my wife.

157
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,200
Everything of you belongs to me.

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,550
Tonight, we'll complete
our wedding night.

159
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,270
Gu Shenghan.
