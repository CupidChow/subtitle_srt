I have a question for you.

10
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,390
Three years ago,

11
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,220
were you my patient?

12
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,860
No.

13
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,110
Then, how did you
find out my real identity?

14
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,030
The strength of my viewing platform

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,830
is not in killing,

Finding someone is not difficult.

18

that you're so capable.

You infiltrated
my manor and tried to kill me.

22
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,670

That's why I deliberately
saved you time after time,

so you can't bring yourself to hurt me.

38
