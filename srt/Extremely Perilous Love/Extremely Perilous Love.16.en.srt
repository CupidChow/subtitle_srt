Long time no see.

Xu Qingqing.

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,420
Your face that looks exactly like mine

7
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,900
is really despicable.

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,180
Stop!

9
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,340
Gu Shenghan.

10
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,820
General.

11
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,740
I am the real Xu Qingqing.

12
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,900
I'm afraid you've been
mistaking me for someone else all along.

13
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
Gu Shenghan.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,740
Shenghan.

15
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,380
You don't seem surprised at all.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Did you already know
the secret behind all of this?

17
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,620
Prime Minister, I'd like to question you.

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,700
She was married to me
from the Prime Minister's Manor.

19
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,300
You said she's a replacement.

20
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,900
I wonder if you
deliberately replaced her

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,180
and sent a spy instead.

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,060
I've been deceived too.

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,300
Think about it.

24
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,460
If I wanted to
investigate the General's Manor,

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,660
would I make such
a big plan just for that?

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,620
It doesn't matter if General
can tell the real from the fake.

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,620
What matters is that

28
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,460
everything should
return to the starting point now.

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Qingqing has been found.

30
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,820
Hurry and take her
back to the General's Manor.

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,740
Don't let her suffer anymore.

32
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,860
What are you trying to do?

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,180
Do you feel sorry for her?

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,820
This woman has
deceived me time and time again.

35
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,060
How about I take care of her for you?

36
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,380
She had the guts
to pretend to be the General's bride.

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,660
I see no reason to keep her alive.

38
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,380
Don't dirty your
hands for someone like her.

39
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,940
Let's take her back to
the manor and torture her slowly.

40
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,460
Since you have said so,

41
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,140
why not leave her to me?

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,220
Is that okay?

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,580
Only a true
Prime Minister's daughter like you,

44
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,620
is worthy of being married to me.

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,740
I'm willing to rekindle our past

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,500
and marry you again.

51

General.

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,220
Back then, you didn't want
to get married to me.

53
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,500
Why are you so driven now?

54
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,700
General.

55
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,420
I was not in my right mind at that time.

56
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,460
Now,

57
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,740
I just want to be a good wife to you.

58
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,100
I still have work to attend to.

59
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,980
Rest well.

60
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,860
Are you still attached to her?

61
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,020
She's just a replacement bride.

62
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
Could it be

63
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,660
there's something special about her

64
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,700
that makes you treat her this way?

65
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,060
She's just a mere doctor.

66
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,700
Why would I care about her?

67
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,780
If you dislike her,

68
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,260
then find someone to get rid of her.

69
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,020
It seems like I've found your weakness.

70
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,540
My jewelry is missing.

71
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,580
Search.

72
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,420
Yes.

73
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,660
I've never been to your room.

74
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,260
How could I possibly steal from you?

75
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,740
The jewelry that's missing

76
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,300
is a betrothal gift
that General gave me.

77
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,540
A hairstick adorned with malachite.

78
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,140
It's extremely precious.

79
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,500
Madam, I've found it.

80
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,020
It's right under this wench's bed.

81
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,100
You're caught red-handed.

82
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,020
Do you have anything else to say?

83
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm speechless.

84
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,060
It seems you won't tell the truth

85
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,300
unless you're tortured.

86
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,460
Falsely accusing me and abusing power.

87

Xu Qingqing.

88
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,820
Aren't you afraid
of facing consequences?

89
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,700
Consequences?

90
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,900
General has given you to me as a gift.

91
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,860
Now, even if I
were to torture you to death,

92
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
no one would dare to intervene.

93
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,180
Take her away.

94
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,380
General left you in the manor,

95
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,340
so I can take my time to torture you.

96
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,620
There's no chance
anyone will come to save you.

97
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,660
Still trying to resist?

98
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,140
Seems like you're
really sick of being alive.

99
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,340
Stretch out your hand.

100
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,660
Stop!

101
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,980
Why are you here, General?

102
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,260
She's just an insignificant person.

103
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,260
Why bother yourself with her?

104
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,060
Torturing her is quite amusing.

105
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,020
Why don't you come
and witness this with me, General?

106
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,060
I'm not interested.

107
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,620
Are you not interested,

108
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
or do you still harbor sympathy for her?

109
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,340
Are you feeling sorry for her?

110
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,220
Gu Shenghan.

111
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,140
You know it.

112
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,300
I would never...

113
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,540
Don't let her affect your mood.

114
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,500
General, you truly have your way.

115
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,740
You've helped me to vent my anger.

116
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,700
Let's go.

117
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,460
Why haven't you left yet?

118
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,460
I've said it before.

No matter what happens,

120
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,460
I'll face it with you.

121
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,580
Now that you're
facing many difficulties,

122
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,260
I can use the tiger token
to help you summon the old troop.

123
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,900
The tiger token is useless to me now.

124
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,700
Now that I've remarried Xu Qingqing

125
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,380
and earned the trust of Xu Guoru,

126
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,260
I'll definitely
have a chance to rise again.

127
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,620
Shenghan, I know that

128
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,940
you must have your reasons
for marrying Xu Qingqing.

129
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,340
You have your plans.
