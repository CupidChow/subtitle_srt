Yingying and Qingqing are twin sisters.

5
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,790
Hence they resemble each other.

6
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,480
She and the second young master
of the General's Manor, Gu Shengming,

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,400
are engaged.

8

The wedding date will be decided.

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,400
I didn't know

about this marriage

Without my permission,

how could you get married?

16
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,870
I've seek permission from Grandmother.

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,560
She has agreed to our marriage.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,200

I will not let you marry him.

24
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,430
Is it because

25
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,400
I look a lot like my elder sister?

26
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,760
That's why you mistake me for her?

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,840
But my elder sister and I

28
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,470
have extremely different personalities.

29
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,560
Is it because of your selfish desires

30
