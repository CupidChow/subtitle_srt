00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,900
The key is hidden so discreetly.

5
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,410
It must unlock something important.

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,820
She took the key to the token.

7
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,980
But if I had the key

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,900
and stole the token,

9
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,980
could it harm Gu Shenghan?

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,820
Why do I still sympathize with him?

11
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:16,980
Shenghan.

12
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,380
You lost.

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,210

00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,050

20
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,490
So you know her identity.

21
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,180

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,460

but now I'm sure.

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,770

but her father's murderer.

why not leave her to me?

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,660
I can offer her

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,500

but it's better than
the deceitful love of a spouse.

Since you're injured,

80
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,490
you should rest in your room.

Why did you summon me, Grandmother?

Now that you've married
into the General's Manor,

84
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,410
you must abide by the rules

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,290
Last time, you accused me
of plotting against the General

90
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,660
and the family rules
were employed recklessly.

91
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,250
What have I done this time

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,490
to violate the family rules?

93
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,290
Exceeding
the boundaries with brother-in-law

94
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,660

98
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,250
Qingqing is not
well-versed in family rules

99
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,490
and has not learned
proper female virtues.

100
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,410
I am willing to go to
the ancestral hall to transcribe

101
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,580
as a way to apologize.

102
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,290
Please forgive me.

103
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,580
Since you sincerely want to amend,

104
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,980
kowtow before the ancestral tablets,

105
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,410
making thousands of bows,

106
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,100
and pray earnestly

107
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,930

108
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,780
Grandmother, you...

109
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,540
Silence!

110
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,140
There's nothing between me and Qingqing.

111
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,250
We just share common interests.

112
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,850
Silence!

113
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,250
If you genuinely
want to protect her, then do nothing.

114
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,020
She belongs to your brother.

115
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,660
I'll arrange a marriage for you soon.

116
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,610
Settle down and behave.

117
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,290
Why does everything

118
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,540
favor Gu Shenghan?

119
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,020
Yet I have to endure

120
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,050
and accept all the arrangements.

121
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,370
She belongs to you,

122
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,250
and so does the tiger token.

123
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,100
No.

124
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,020
I can't accept that.

When you finish kowtowing 1,000 times,

127
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,290
you can leave.

128
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,050
So, this is the ancestral hall
of the Northern General's Manor.

129
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,850
There's a faint scent
of incense on the key.

130
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,660
Year-round, only the ancestral
hall has continuous incense burning

131
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,020
and is located in a remote area.

132
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,930
The token may be hidden here.

133
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,250
Shengming, what brings you here?

134
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,250
Grandmother is resting.
I brought you some food.

135
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,700
There's only this left in the kitchen.

136
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,900
Please bear with it for now.

137
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,540
I'll get you some good dishes tomorrow.

138
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,340
This is good enough.

139
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,410
Thank you.

140
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,900
You never have to

141
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,170
be polite to me.

142
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,730
I was too presumptuous.

143
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,730
I was often reprimanded by Grandmother

144
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,370
and locked in this ancestral hall.

145
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,220
Perhaps

146
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
this is the trouble
of being born into a prominent family,

147
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,060
often restricted
by rules and traditions.

148
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,420
So, the days in
the thatched hut three years ago

149
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
were the most carefree days
I've ever had.

150
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,730
Are you thinking of the thatched hut?

151
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,650
Yin.

152
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,980
I've never forgotten this name.

154
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,530
in the thatched hut.

155
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,370
I have more important things
to take care of now.

156
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,010
Let's treat
what happened three years ago

157
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,220
as beautiful memories.

158
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,940
You've always kept her in your thoughts.

159
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,530
Yin is truly fortunate.

160
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,490
Why doesn't this trick work on her?

161
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,730
Did she discover my pretense?

162
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,700
General.

163
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,610
Second Young Master
just left food for Madam.

164
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,940
This woman.

165
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,530
She can't behave
even in the ancestral hall.

166
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,180
I fear she has ulterior motives
for visiting the ancestral hall.

167
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,060
How could I not know her little schemes?

Pass token for the viewing platform.

169
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,340
Finally, I found it.

170
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,700
General, what brings you here?

171
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,370
The ancestral hall is so quiet.

172
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,130
I thought you
would be hungry and cold here.

173
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,890
I worried too much.

174
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,980
Shengming sent these snacks over.

175
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,820
Don't forget that you ended up here
because of him.

176
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,300
It seems that family rules
can't make you learn your lesson.

177
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,530
I came to
the ancestral hall voluntarily.

178
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
It's peaceful here,

179
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,490
much better than
the chaotic surrounding outside.

180
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,010
It looks like someone isn't sincere,

181
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,610
falsely claiming
to be copying scriptures

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,130

if I risk my life to save you.

185
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,060
I'll be your hero.

186
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,730
I thought this old incense burner

187
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,940
might need some tidying up.

188
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,730
General, why do you care
so much about this incense burner?

189
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,580
Is there anything special?

190
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,060
There's nothing special about it.

191
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,980
No matter
how much effort you put into it,

192
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,530
it won't make any difference.

193
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,180
Don't worry, Yin.

194
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,130
This is just a bit of smoke.

195
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,460
I'll save you soon.

196
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,610
It's on fire!

197
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,300
The door is locked.

198
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,650
How did it suddenly catch fire?

199
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,460
Qingqing.

200
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,250
Qingqing.

201
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,490
Are you inside?

202
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,700
Shengming, I'm inside.

203
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,730
And...

204
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,250
You hold on.

205
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,300
I'll come to rescue you now.

206
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,490
It's on fire!

207
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,220
Servants must be outside
trying to extinguish the fire.

208
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,300
Push me out later.

209
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,220
Remember,

210
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,130
you must keep the fact
that my leg is not lame a secret.

211
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,940
General, you are indeed cautious.

212
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,180
Even in such a dangerous situation,

213
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,700
you are still skilled in scheming.
