00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,440
[I Protect You,
Solely Because It's You]

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,740
You think you're worthy of

5
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,980
marrying into
the Northern General's Manor?

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,980
I was Miss Xu Qingqing's nursemaid.

7
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,940
I can prove

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,420
that she is not Xu Qingqing at all.

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,980
Why do you say that?

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,100
Mere words are not evidence.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,700
Do you have any proof?

12
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,460
Old Madam.

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,100
I raised Miss Qingqing
since she was a child.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,580
Her skin is delicate and flawless,

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,700
without a single scar on her body.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,500
How could she have rough skin?

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,740
On the day of the wedding,

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,140
I noticed a noticeable scar

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,940
on her left wrist.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,220
Afterward, she hurt
herself on purpose to cover it up.

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,500
Is it real or fake?

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,860
Everyone can tell at a glance.

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,500
Stop.

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,060
She is my lawfully wedded wife.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,620
How can you make a scene
based on the words of an old servant?

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,660
She is the fake Xu Qingqing.

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,980
Don't let her deceive you.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,700
Whether she's
real or fake, I will judge for myself.

29
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,180
Let me ask you.

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,700
Are your words

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,300
completely true?

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,100
If there is a single falsehood,

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,740
beware of your head.

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,340
Every word I said is true.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,660
But...

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,940
But I left
the Prime Minister's Manor a year ago.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,260
But based on the level of care

38
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,980
for Miss Qingqing
in the Prime Minister's Manor,

39
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,500
she shouldn't have
any scars on her body.

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,780
Shouldn't have?

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,100
This scar of mine

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,180
was from an accident half a year ago.

43
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,180
You're defaming
me with baseless accusations.

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,380
Is it because you were
expelled from the Prime Minister's Manor

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,940
that you hold a grudge against me?

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,660
Take this wretched servant
down and execute her.

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,260
Miss Yuexi.

48
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,900
It was you
who gave me money to identify her.

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,340
You can't abandon me, Miss Yuexi.

50
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,020
Shut up.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,620
You foolish servant.

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,180
Miss Yuexi.

53
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,500
Miss Yuexi, save me.

54
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,140
Miss Yuexi.

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,860
You must be wearing a human skin mask.

56
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,820
It will wrinkle and deform
when exposed to hot water.

57
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,540
Now, reveal your true face.

58
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,220
Yuexi, stop it.

59
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,420
How could this happen?

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,660
Maybe the water wasn't hot enough.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,340
That's enough.

62
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
Stop causing a scene.
What kind of demeanor is that?

63
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,620
Take her away.

64
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,580
Lock her up in the ancestral hall

65
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,480
for reflection on her mistake.

66
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,180
Yes.

67
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,860
I'm not wrong. I'm not leaving.

68
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,100
Let's go, Miss Yuexi.

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,260
Don't pull me.

70
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,900
Let's go.

71
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,220
I'm not wrong. Let go of me.

72
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,540
Let go.

you're afraid of
offending the Prime Minister's Manor?

Regardless of your identity,

90
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,060
I'm willing to do this

91
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,380
for you.

92
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,300
Then it's because you're afraid

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,860
that I'll have

I won't make things difficult for her.

97
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,060
Your injury is severe.

98
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,660
You should have
applied ointment promptly.

99
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,500
Tomorrow is the day
to return to my home.

100
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,660
According to the rules,

101
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,100
we have to return
to the Prime Minister's Manor

102
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,000
to see Father.

103
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,420
You can make the arrangements.

104
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,580
Tomorrow is just a family banquet,

105
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,220
there's no need to make a big fuss.

106
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
Father specifically instructed

107
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,180
not to bring too many attendants.

108
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,900
Keep it simple.

109
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,420
General.

110
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,900
If we go to
the Prime Minister's Manor tomorrow,

111
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,220
it's like putting
ourselves in a treacherous situation.

112
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
How could you agree so easily

113
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,460
and not bring any guards?

114
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,660
Since she went to such lengths

115
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,820
to impersonate Xu Qingqing and marry me,

116
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,220
then let her
do a good job of killing me.

117
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,500
But you're not her father's killer,

118
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,140
and three years ago, you already...

119
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,940
You should tell her the truth.

120
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,540
I can't.

121
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,020
Have you forgotten her true identity?

122
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,540
Otherwise, our careful arrangements

123
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,500
a year ago would be in vain.

124
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,260
General.

125
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,260
It's because of my poor medical skills

126
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,740
that I can't completely
remove the poison in your body.

127
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,820
I can only suppress it temporarily.

128
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,980
Mr. Xu.

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,460
I know you've done your best,

130
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,820
but I hope

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,180
you can take Yin

132
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,980
and leave this place
of trouble as soon as possible.

133
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,580
Xu Guoru's ambitious
intentions are revealed clearly.

134
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
If he finds out

135
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,500
that Yin is
General Feng Ming's child,

136
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,060
do you think she can survive?

137
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,060
You're right.

138
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,460
Oh no.

139
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,540
Your identities may have been exposed.

140
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,180
I'll escort you out immediately.

141
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,660
Yin hasn't returned
from gathering herbs on the mountain.

142
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,340
Besides,

143
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,700
the Prime Minister's
lackeys are everywhere.

144
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,420
Once we are targeted,

145
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,780
we'll have nowhere to escape.

146
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,380
These two pills
are breath cessation pills.

147
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,420
I planned to

148
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,700
let you and your daughter
fake your deaths and escape.

149
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,260
But now the situation is urgent.

150
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,580
We can only
go with the flow and take a gamble.

151
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,060
I didn't expect the poison
to act prematurely that night,

152
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,460
almost injuring her.

153
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,540
Just let her treat me as her enemy.

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,580
She can only stay by my side

155
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,100
for me to protect her better.

156
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,640
- Come and see.
- Buy some.

157
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,160
Sugar-coated haws.

158
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,780
It seems that you are
really eager to return to your home.

159
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,260
After all, it's been
a long time since I saw Father.

160
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,580
General, Madam.

161
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,900
The crossbeam of the carriage broke,

162
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,700
so we can't move forward.

163
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,220
It may take about an hour to fix it.

164
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,700
Tomorrow is
the best opportunity to kill him.

165
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,700
I can't fail again.

166
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
The Prime Minister's Manor
is only about a hundred steps away.

167
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,540
I know a small path

168
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,820
that can get us there in a moment.

169
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,780
Please lead the way, Qingqing.

170
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,860
If you escape,

171
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,980
your fake limp will be exposed.

172
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,420
But if you don't escape,

173
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,700
you'll be burned alive.
