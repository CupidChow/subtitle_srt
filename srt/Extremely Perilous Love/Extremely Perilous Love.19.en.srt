56

No, he didn't.

attacked during the Lantern Festival,

you are, you're still a girl.

were sought from the city,

to prepare for the worst.

There are two identical
jade pendants looking like this.

of the General's Manor each have one.

the piece belonging to
the First Young Master

150

was broken and then
fixed when he was a child.

This is the one.

152
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,700

Both jade pendants
are in Gu Shengming's hands.
