in the study without my permission.

7
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,820
I'm just studying pharmacology here.

8
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,180
Who are you guarding against?

9
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,140
I'm guarding against
people like you, thieves.

10
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,860
Take out what you have behind your back.

11
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,540
You're being
defensive because you're guilty.

12
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,980
And yet you turn the tables on me.

13
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,740
This sketch was clearly stolen by you.

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,340
The entire
General's Manor belongs to me.

15
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,300
Is there a need for me to steal?

Moreover,

this shoddy sketch

18
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,980
is obviously the work of Gu Shengming.

19
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,060
What's so special about it?

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,300
There's nothing special about it.

21
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,620
Exactly.

22
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
It's just an ordinary thatched hut.

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,460
I can draw the same thing,

drawing skills than Gu Shengming.

25
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,860
Would you

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,300
treasure it like this by then?

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,740
Why are you competing with a drawing?

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,580
I am not competing with a drawing.

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,900
It's just that in this world, truth
and falsehood are hard to discern.

will always be counterfeits.

I'm afraid Xu Guoru's spies in the manor

can also sneak into

72
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,220
Has she become suspicious of something?

73
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,460
I've been wearing
this jade pendant since I was young.

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,500
It has never left my side.

75

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,300
This pulse condition
doesn't feel like angina.

79
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,580
It seems more like a mild poisoning.

80
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,340
Who would poison you?

81
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,740
In this manor,

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,260
who else would
find my presence intolerable?

83
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,300
Are you suspecting Gu Shenghan?

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,420
My current condition

85
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,460
was caused by the assassins he sent
three years ago.

86
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,060
Those assassins

87
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,420
were all elite soldiers
he secretly trained.

88
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,220
Could it be the viewing platform?

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,020
Do you have
any evidence for the things you said?

90
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,940
He always does things covertly,

91
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,780
and those experts
maintain a low profile in the city.

92
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,540
However,

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,580
I noticed he often
goes to a certain pharmacy.

94
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,900
Most matters in the General's Manor

95
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,260
are handled by the household manager.

96
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,900
Why would he go to the pharmacy?

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I didn't find
Gu Shenghan in the pharmacy.

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,620
Where did he go?

99
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,900
Qingqing, why are you here?

102

strikes while you're outside.

Thank you, Qingqing.

General, what are you doing?

110
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,540
It's been damp and rainy recently.

111
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,540
There have been frequent
outbreaks of scabies among the refugees.

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,840
Give them some herbal medicine

113
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,860

114
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,820
We have medicine.

115
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,060
We have medicine.

116
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,580
There's medicine.

Were these saltpeter prepared for them?

118
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,780
The pharmacy doesn't welcome refugees

119
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,860
as they are afraid of infection.

120
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,540
Saltpeter is difficult to obtain,

121
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,580

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
Give her some more help.

180
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,940
Yes.

181
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,340
It's so beautiful.

182
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,460
Let's go over there to take a look.

183
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,540
It's really beautiful.

184
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,060
Yes.

185
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,940
Father?

186
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,340
Back then, at the unmarked graves,

187
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,020
I didn't find Father's body.

188
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,860
Could it be that he is still alive?

189
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Thank you, General.

190
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,060
As long as my daughter and I
can catch a glimpse of each other,

191
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,260
I will feel at ease.

192
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,020
On her birthday,

193
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,700
seeing her longed-for family

194
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,700
would bring great joy to her.

195
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,900
Yin.

196
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,300
This is my birthday gift for you.

197
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
Do you like it?

198
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,780
God in heaven.

199
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
I pray for your blessings
that my father is still alive,

200
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,020
safe and sound.

201
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Get lost, all of you!

202
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,500
Go away!

203
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,460
Leave here quickly!
