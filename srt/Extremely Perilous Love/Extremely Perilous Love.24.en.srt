all belong to me.

10
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,500
You've already hurt him like this,

11
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,980
and he's already notorious outside.

12
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,020
Aren't you satisfied yet?

13
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,500
I want to completely ruin him

So, you married me

I have never lied to you.

28
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,260
From the moment I first saw you,

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,220
I fell in love with you.

30

32
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,660

I've been too lenient
with you since we were young.

I knew your body was weak,

114
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
you were afraid of
pain, and cried easily,

115
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,580
so I never let father
force you to learn martial arts.

116
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,260
But in your eyes,

117
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,660
it turned into neglect and oppression.

118
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,220
Also,

119
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,660
the agate chess pieces from back then

120
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,220
were set up by the late emperor
for the Crown Prince's reading partner.

121
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,740
If you excelled at chess,

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,180
you would forever
be the Crown Prince's slave,

123
