Were all your promises to me fake?

16
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,260
You saw it all.

17
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,180
I only care about that face.

18
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,340
As for the position of my wife,

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,420
anyone can hold it.

20
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,740
Then why did you
save me again and again?

21
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,500
You even lied to protect me.

22
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,180
My feelings for you

23
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,540
were just temporary sympathy.

I'm sorry.

28
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,740
and leaving me,

29
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,620
would you be best protected.

Father.

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,260
Let's leave this place together, okay?

Did you take breath cessation pills?

37
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,340
You're just
pretending to be dead, right?

38
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,140
Father.

39
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,300
Father.

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,300
Father.

41
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,260
Father, wake up! Father!

42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,100
Father.

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,020

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,260
Father, please wake up.

Father.

46
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,900
Father.

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,660
Mr. Xu.

48
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,980
At last, Gu Shenghan

49
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,660
still resorted to murder.

50
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,620
It couldn't be him.

51
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,620
That's impossible.

52
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,060
Ever since I was stopped by Gu Shenghan

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,700
when I went to Anfu Hall last time,

54
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,820
I had felt that something was fishy.

55
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,860
I've been secretly investigating,

56
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,020
and I found out
that your father didn't die.

57
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,380
Gu Shenghan has kept him confined here.

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,660
I followed Xin
and discovered this place.

59
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,060
Since then, I often
came here secretly to visit him,

60
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,540
hoping to rescue him.

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,780
Mr. Xu also revealed
many things to me because of this.

62
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,380
What did my father tell you?

63
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,220
He said

64
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,740
you are General Feng Ming‘s child.

65
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,660
The tiger token on your body
can summon the old troop.

66
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,100
Thus, it will attract calamity upon you.

67
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,580
Your father saw through
Gu Shenghan's scheme.

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,940
He said he was protecting you,

69
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,180
but he was actually
using your father to coerce you,

70
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,820
to achieve the goal of
controlling the old troop.

71
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,220
Your father
was worried about your safety,

72
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,380
so he didn't dare to tell you directly.

73
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,980
That's impossible.

74
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,540
Recently,

75
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,180
all he wants is to send me away.

76
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,700
His brilliance lies in this.

77
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,180
The so-called sending you away

78
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,780
is just to avoid Xu Guoru's attention.

79
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,580
Your father
secretly told me all of this,

80
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,140
so that you wouldn't
be manipulated by Gu Shenghan.

81
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,740
Once you lose your value

82
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,860
and become an obstacle to him,

83
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,780
your fate will be
the same as your father's.

[*Crystalline Mirabilite]

85
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,740
This should be a clue

86
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,900
left by your father before he died.

87
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,900
Indeed, I guessed it right.

88
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,820
It was Gu Shenghan!

89
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Gu Shenghan.

90
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Gu Shenghan.

91
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,500
Why?

92
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,780
Why did he do this?

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,540
Gu Shenghan.

[Tomb of the Late Father, Xu Liulang]

95
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,580
Father.

96
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,820
After much difficulty,
we were finally reunited,

97
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,660
but now we are separated again, forever.

98
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,820
I will definitely seek revenge for you.

99
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,180
It seems that Gu Shenghan
really has no feelings for Xu Yin.

100
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,460
In that case,
I can't use her to threaten him.

101
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,500
I can only find the tiger token myself.

102
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,700
General.

103
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,060
We're newlyweds,

104
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,060
and yet you're
always staying in the study.

105
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,260

107

108
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,620
Isn't it time for us
to consummate our marriage?

109
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,660
You're the Prime Minister's daughter.

110
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,420
This kind of behavior

111
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,700
doesn't suit your status.

112
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,700
But

Since you are my wife,
you should know that

116
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,300
I have no interest in sexual relations.

117
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,580
How dare you treat me like this?

118
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,980
Trust me, I'll tear
this General's Manor down.

119
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,500
Go ahead.

120
