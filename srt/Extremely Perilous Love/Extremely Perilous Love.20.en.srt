[The Actual Murderer]

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,160
Gu Shengming.

5
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,850
If that young female doctor discovers

6
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,930
you killed her father,

7
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,760
do you think she'll still trust you?

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,400
How did you find out?

9
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

10
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,320
You're

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,690
not sent by Yin.

12
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,800
She's so important.

13
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,490
How could I allow you to take her away?

14
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,360
Your scheme is effective.

15
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,010
I'm guessing that girl now believes

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,880
Gu Shenghan is responsible
for her father's death.

17
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,570
She must intensely
hate Gu Shenghan now.

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,440
I don't mind

19
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,600
this outcome.

20
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,160
What's your real intention?

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,930
I told you

22
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,240
I wanted us to collaborate.

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,010
Our goals align perfectly.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,800
We both want to bring down Gu Shenghan.

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,320
How do you propose to collaborate?

26
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,410
The foundation
of collaboration is trust.

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,440
Regarding Xu Yin's true identity...

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,290
How much do you know?

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,200
His reaction was so intense.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,600
Look like my guess was correct.

31
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,250
She's General Feng Ming's child, right?

32
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,200
Otherwise,

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,410
why would you and your brother

34
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,040
fight over her so fiercely?

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,040
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,010
She's just someone I'm fond of.

37
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,530
I can't simply
hand her over to Gu Shenghan.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,290
Gu Shengming.

39
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,570
You don't need
to pretend in front of me.

40
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,530
You're not some lovesick fool.

41
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,320
We're alike.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,010
We'll do anything to achieve our goals.

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
I don't believe it's love.

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,250
Since you know that,

45
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,010
be smart.

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,250
As long as you don't harm her,

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,530
she's bound to become

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,530
a deadly weapon against Gu Shenghan.

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
What's your plan for collaboration?

50
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,250
Collaboration?

51
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,640
You think you're worthy?

52
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,530
You're just
a concubine's child of General's Manor.

53
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,370
Killing you, for Prime Minister's Manor,

54
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,720
is as simple as killing an ant.

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
I just wanted to know

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,040
Xu Yin's true identity.

57
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,530
Now I know.

58
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,090
You're of no use anymore.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,570
Gu Shengming.

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Young lady.

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,970
Where are you in such a hurry to go?

62
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,410
I'm a Miao traditional doctor
who came to treat the Old Madam.

63
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,640
I just got lost in the manor earlier.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,160
I'm leaving now.

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,970
I went to great lengths

66
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,320
to bring you to the manor.

67
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,320
How could I let you escape so easily?

68
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,520
You intentionally
poisoned the Old Madam.

69
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,760
Speak up!

71
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,400
Tiger token?

72
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,130
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Then I'll have to do it personally.

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,440
The Prime Minister's men
dared to attack General's Manor.

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,050

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,520
I want to inform you

114
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,840
of the truth behind Xu Qingqing's death.

115
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,840
The truth?

116
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,320
Gu Shenghan murdered Xu Qingqing

117
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,610
because he wanted to make way for

118
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,000
Xu Yin, who disguised as Xu Qingqing,
to take the General's wife's position.

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,440
Why did you tell me all this?

120
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,320
I have

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,170
admired Xu Yin for a long time.

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,930

about the General's Manor in the future

126
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760

127
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:23,810
Sure.

128
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,130
Alright.

129
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,840
Tell me your conditions.

130
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,880
I have just one condition.

131
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,040
I want to marry Xu Yin.

132
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,280
Here you go, Sheng Ming.

133
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,450

Yin.

135
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,680
Did you hear about
the incident at the General's Manor?

136
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,280
Xu Qingqing is dead.

137
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,330
It's definitely Gu Shenghan's doing.

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,040
He's bloodthirsty.

139
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,970
Yin.

140
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,490
I know you hate Gu Shenghan.

141
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,920
Don't worry.

142
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,880
I'll arrange for
your immediate entry into the Manor

143
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,640
to get close enough
to assassinate Gu Shenghan.

144
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,800
How do I get inside?

145
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,400
Now that Grandmother is critically ill.

146
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,400
If I marry you

147
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,490
in the name of warding-off illness,

148
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,680
no one will dare to question it.

149
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,370
Yin.

150
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,880
Even though this wedding

151
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,370
is for you to seek revenge,

152
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,800
but I genuinely want to marry you.

153
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,730
I hope we can be together for life

154
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,370
after your revenge.

155
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,880
Gu Shenghan.

156
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,520
You've already done too much for me.

157
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,330
Let me do

158
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,450
this last thing for you this time.

159
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,560
Alright.

160
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,610
I promise you.

161
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,850
But I need a legitimate identity.

162
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,970
I want to marry
from the Prime Minister's Manor.

163
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,490
Xu Yin.

164
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,040
You've got some nerve.

165
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
I've never betrayed you.

166
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,730
I fell into
Gu Shenghan's trap previously,

167
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,560
which caused your misunderstanding.

168
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,090
I heard about Miss Xu's tragic fate.

169
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,040
I wish to continue serving you

170
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,330
and take down Gu Shenghan.

171
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,520
Why do you want to work for me?

172
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,280
I know that

173
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,920
I alone

174
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,450
cannot take revenge.

175
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,280
Among all the officials,

176
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,640
only you can stand against Gu Shenghan.

177
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,730
I am just seeking refuge.

178
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,610
Do you have such a great hatred

179
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,370
toward Gu Shenghan?

180
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,970
It's hatred of killing my father

181
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,010
and the shame of humiliation.

182
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,130
This hatred
is enough to get things done.

183
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,880
However,

184
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,240
I always

185
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,680
reward success

186
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,210
and punish

187
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,800
failure.

188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,450
My loyalty to you

is unwavering.

190
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,330
How do you plan to help me?

191
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,920
I want to return
to the General's Manor openly.

192

Qingqing married you
in less than half a year

196
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,800
and passed away.

197
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Do you have an explanation for me?

198
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,130
Due to health reasons,
I've neglected Qingqing.

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,970
Please forgive me, Father.

is returning home today.
