[Tiger Token Revealed]

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,440
You are my wife.

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,010
Everything of you belongs to me.

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,640
Gu Shenghan.

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,840
You...

8
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,710
This is

9
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,350
the tiger token.

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,430
Say.

11
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,230
What did you see?

12
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,760
I didn't see anything.

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,230
You won't spill it
until you see the coffin, I see.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,680
I will say.

15
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,120
I will say.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,590
I saw General's legs...

17
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,560
You're from
the Prime Minister's faction.

18
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,840
Since you know what you shouldn't,

19
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,870
I can't keep you around.

20
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,590
Stop!

21
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,120
Gu Shenghan.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,400
You're a heartless devil
who kills without a blink.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,070
She's just a servant to me.

24
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,070
If you have any issues, come at me.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,950
Are you just realizing

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,680
what kind of person I am?

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,070
I want to kill everyone around you,

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
leaving you isolated and alone.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,070
So you better
stay away from Gu Shengming.

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,040
Or else

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,350
the next one will be him.

32
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,840
He's innocent.

33
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,870
Don't you harm him.

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,310
You better listen to me

35
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,710
to avoid implicating others.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,520
Otherwise,

37
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,800
be prepared for his burial.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,240
If you don't want
to expose your identity,

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
you better put away your tricks

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
in medicine and poison.

41
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,430
You already knew?

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,240
I know everything you've done

43
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,150
since you arrived.

44
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,800
Don't think
I don't know what you're up to.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,680
With such bloodthirsty cruelty,

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
I shall kill you a thousand times

47
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,750
without a second thought.

48
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,840
Gu Shenghan.

49
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,280
Since we've both revealed our secrets,

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,310
we're now even.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,310
From today on,

52
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,280
we'll play the role
of a couple in public

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
and mind our own business.

54
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,430
Qingqing.

55
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,470
Is my brother giving you a hard time?

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,630
No.

57
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,960
But someone took the blame for me.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm glad

59
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,590
to see you're safe.

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,680
I want to kill everyone around you,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
leaving you isolated and alone.

62
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,710
So you better
stay away from Gu Shengming.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,680
Or else

64
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,000
the next one will be him.

65
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm sorry, I'm feeling a bit tired.

66
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,430
I want to call it an early night.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,870
Today, Gu Shenghan
and I had a falling out.

68
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,160
Now I don't know how to approach him

69
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,240
to get the token.

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,920
The tiger token isn't just an object.

71
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,950
It's a living person.

72
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,160
The General Feng's wife

73
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,600
planted the token on Yin.

74
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,160
It becomes visible
when her emotions are stirred.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Won't this put Madam
in even greater danger?

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,920
We can't let
Xu Guoru find out about this.

77
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,560
The body has been taken care of.

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,430
But rumors are spreading like wildfire.

79
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,480
They're saying you went mad

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
and killed a servant.

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,870
People in the manor are uneasy.

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm willing to do

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,830
whatever it takes

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,070
as long as I can protect Yin.

85
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,270
What happened last night?

86
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,040
It was so terrifying.

87
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
Could it be the General...

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
If you want to
keep your tongue, then keep quiet.

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,240
Remove the body.

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
I must find
the token as soon as possible

91
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,190
and get rid of Gu Shenghan.

92
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,190
Otherwise,
more innocent people will suffer.

93
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,600
You want to make a deal with me?

94
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,950
Yes.

95
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,310
Since you
now know I'm not Xu Qingqing,

96
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,870
I no longer need to hide anything.

97
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,160
I was a female doctor

98
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,390
forced to impersonate Xu Qingqing.

99
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,270
But I want to leave all this behind

100
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,480
and propose a mutually
beneficial deal with General.

101
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,950
I'm curious

102
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,070
to hear more about your deal.

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,870
General, are you
affected by a bewitching poison,

104
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,270
making you ferocious and uncontrollable

105
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,120
on full moon nights?

106
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,950
You're using this
as leverage to threaten me?

107
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,680
No.

108
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,190
I want to cure you.

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,720
I happened to become
a disciple of Poison Mistress.

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,390
I not only know medicine,

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
but I'm skilled in detoxification.

112
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,430
I'm confident

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,190
I can cure you of the poison.

114
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,160
Really?

115
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,310
What's your condition in exchange?

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Once you're cured, you'll divorce me

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,830
and set me free.

118
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,600
You're so eager to leave?

119
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,040
Living under
a false identity for too long

120
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,190
will cause one to lose their true self.

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,630
General, you often disguise yourself

122
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,630
and should understand
the underlying truth.

123
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,630
Alright.

124
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
Your wish is granted.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,390
I don't think you'd want others

126
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,630
to know about your treatment.

127
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,070
The secret chamber

128
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,310
enables discreet antidote creation.

129
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,390
You may access

130
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
my secret chamber if required.

131
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,240
Very well.

132
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,070
I can obtain the token sooner

133
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
once I gain Gu Shenghan's trust.

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,920
But I have a condition.

135
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,270
While you're at the General's Manor,

136
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,480
you should play
the role of the General's wife

137
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,720
and fulfill the duties of a wife.

138
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
What do you mean?

139
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,950
Complete what you left unfinished.

140
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
What do you think?

141
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,830
General, the poison
afflicted you crucially.

142
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,630
It should be
treated as soon as possible.

143
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,000
You must be curious

144
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,920
why my garments

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
were tainted with poison.

146
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,160
And not just one type of poison.

147
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,670
Furthermore,

148
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,480
even the things I use

149
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,000
and the people around me

150
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,720
could be
potential sources of the poison.

151
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,480
I've gotten used to it.

152
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,600
Instead of trying to
identify different poisons,

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,600
it's more beneficial
to become immune to all of them.

154
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,490
