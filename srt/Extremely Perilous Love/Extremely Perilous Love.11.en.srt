Do you need me to call a doctor?

she would be
so concerned about my injuries.

Without a doubt,

28
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,220
it must be Xu Guoru's doing.

29

But why would
he make such a deadly move?

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,780
All the techniques
and weapons used by those assassins

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,500
could only injure me

32

but not kill me.

33
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,700
I suspect they only wanted to wound me,

34
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,900
so that Yin could seize the opportunity.

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700

for Madam to steal the token?

Now,

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,100
it all depends on Yin's decision.

You are just acting
out of your doctor's instincts.

Don't forget that

there's a deep hatred
separating both of you.

use to negotiate with me?

63

Since you're injured,

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,740
it seems that you'll have to

65

concerned about my military affairs.

68
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,980
If he stays in the manor all the time,

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
how can I search for

His name is Xu Liulang.

93
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,100
He is a doctor.

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,180
He used to run
a hospital in the city

95
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,460
called Anfu Hall.

96
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,980

97
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,520
Is that the place where Gu Shenghan

98
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,580
cruelly slaughtered people a year ago?

99
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:52,900
Yes.

100

onto a glimmer of hope that

101
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,700

It seems you have
a deep connection with him.

109
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,220
But with my current status,

110
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,980
it's not appropriate
for me to search for him myself.

Since I've already been married to him,

According to our investigation,

Xu Liulang didn't have a wife.

132
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,020
That girl was his adopted daughter.

After Gu Shenghan slaughtered them,

134
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,300
how did he dispose the bodies?

135
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,980
His subordinates dumped
all the bodies in an unmarked grave.

136
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,700
There are countless
bodies in the unmarked grave,

137
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,140
so their whereabouts should be unknown.

138
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,940
You may leave.

139
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,980

Can you help me

If Xu Qingqing is Xu Yin,

143
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,860
then everything makes sense.

144
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,140
His name is Xu Liulang.

145
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,900
He once owned a hospital in the city

147
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,980
Not only is she Xu Yin...

but she's also General Feng's child
with the tiger token.

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,860
That's why last year,
Gu Shenghan had to set up a scheme

151
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,260
to fake their deaths.

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,460
It has been many years

157
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,100
since we played chess together.

158
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,860
You called me here just to play chess?

159
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,380
Shenghan, do you still remember?

160
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,380
When we were young,

161
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,820
Father brought back
a precious set of agate chess pieces.

162
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,100
Father, these chess pieces
are truly exquisite and extraordinary.

163
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,140
Indeed, they are quite beautiful.

164
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,380
Father, can you give them to me?

165
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,420
If you like them, just take them.

166
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,300
Also,

167
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,700
you and Shengming
can practice your chess skills.

168
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,380
Boring.

169
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,980
I'd rather practice martial arts.

170
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,460
Such trivial matters,

171
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
how would I remember them?

172
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,940
That's you, Shenghan.

173
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,020
You obtained everything too easily,

174
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,820
so you don't know how to cherish them.

175
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,540
Everyone in the manor knows I'm frail.

176
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,300
They assumed that
the angina is a disease from childhood,

177
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,020
but only I myself know that

178
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,620
it's a mental problem.

179
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,620
I've been inferior to you
in everything since childhood.

180

Grandmother and Father
gave all the good things to you,

while I could only act silly and cute.

182
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,940
Sometimes, I have to go all out

183
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,340
to fight for the slightest benefit.

184
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,420
Moreover,

185
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,580
I am a son of a concubine.
