1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The End

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We can't take Li Zhiyan to the Pacific.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Why?

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What if he finds out about our plan?

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't think so.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I believe men and women can be smart.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Besides, he's blind.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Even if he's lost, he'll say that his father is looking for him.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He'll torture me if I can't find him.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He loves me so much.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He'll say that he's scared of the dragon.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What if he's not?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are you in love with him?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're really interested in that blind man.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Chen Lang, why are you kidding?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Prince Qi is a wooden pigeon.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He doesn't even like women like me.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why does he look like Li Zhiyan?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He's right.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Prince Qi is worried about Li Zhiyan.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's the point of this?

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's even more handsome than me.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then we'll have a secret plan this afternoon.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Chen Lang!

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Chen Lang!

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you doing?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Get ready for the temple.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hurry up.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's see what's going on.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's go.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Kuang Zifei.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Why is it so hot?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I heard that you were hit by a eagle in the temple a few days ago.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You were burned to death.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Almost cried.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's get to the temple.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't come back.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now I'm banned from heaven after

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
being exposed from heaven.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Let her be.

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Nobody went to see me issues

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
Why do people coment that I...​

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:12,480
So Yina,�� Оконч senior석 Loverscze

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Nobody mentioned that I 好多女人們ある

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,320
Doesn't seem like she don't have a pair.

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's go in.

61
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,660
Where were my babies?

62
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,640
So many.

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Just take a look.

64
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,840
Tell us the details.

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,540
The priority is odors while the dat супер is is inaudible...

66
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,840
It'll be better if we yard them from소.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,060
It'll eventually reach in the ten legs of we broils.

68
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,980
Yes.

69
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,420
Do you find something?

70
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,420
The blood of the dead is very strong.

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,420
The blood of the tiger in the soul is the medicine for the spirit.

72
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Now, the disease in this house needs medicine.

73
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm afraid it's only the blind man.

74
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
Li Zhian?

75
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,420
Your brother is so concerned.

76
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
You even came here to beg for medicine.

77
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,420
I didn't need it.

78
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,420
I didn't.

79
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,420
You two are the same.

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,420
One is a sick ghost, the other is a sad spirit.

81
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,420
Or else,

82
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,420
I'll give him the reward.

83
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
He's blind anyway.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,420
I can't tell who he is.

85
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,420
Brother Feng didn't go to the city.

86
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,420
Li Zhian hasn't said that Long Yi is buried.

87
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,420
He can't die.

88
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
I can give him medicine.

89
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,420
But...

90
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
I'm still here.

91
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,420
Father Laurent has a tempting gift.

92
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
The cement is clean.

93
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
I überset it once.

94
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,420
It's a gentle massage.

95
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,420
I can treat you with attention and care.

96
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,420
You have to keep your eye on my body.

97
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,020
but I'm sure that he didn't treat her nice.

98
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,860
What I want to say to that is You know I got it.

99
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,940
Have you understood what he was talking about?

100
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,500
Have you accepted him?

101
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,620
What did he say?

102
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,340
For the sake of not맛.

103
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,100
Besides he is brave and powerful.

104
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,060
For you he wont need the truth.

105
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,420
But for brothers as well as others.

106
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,020
Let me say it.

107
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,980
You believe me?

108
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,260
That means

109
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Hey.

110
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,260
Mr. Xi.

111
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
You're a good man.

112
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
You're the best for Sansa.

113
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Thank you.

114
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
You're doing this to me.

115
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
I'm so sorry.

116
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
I'll get you back to the hotel.

117
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:53,260
The End

119
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
The third prince suddenly wants to take you to the temple.

120
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
The servants are really not ready.

121
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
I should have a meal at the temple.

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
I'll go get ready now.

123
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
He's a temporary suspect.

124
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
You don't have to be nervous.

125
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,260
Get ready for the meeting.

126
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Yes.

127
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
It smells so good.

128
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Princess, are you okay?

129
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Princess, I brought you a bottle of medicine.

130
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
It will be better if you put it on your hand.

131
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Who are you?

132
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Why did you send me medicine?

133
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm just a little girl.

134
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
I have to go now.

135
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
Otherwise, I'll be found out.

136
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
It's the scent of the rotten plum.

137
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,260
It turns out that the person who gave me the medicine is him.

138
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
It's Hua Mei.

139
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Hua Mei, are you hurt?

140
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Come here.

141
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
It's all my fault.

142
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
I've changed my life.

143
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Hurry up.

144
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
Don't care about your life.

145
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Don't look at the wound.

146
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
If you get infected with the dirty house,

147
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,260
it will be troublesome to use the window.

148
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Princess, I...

149
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
I have medicine in the box I bought.

150
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,260
You can go back and wipe it yourself.

151
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Princess, you are so nice to Hua Mei.

152
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
I should be nice to you.

153
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Hua Mei,

154
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,260
you are probably the only person I can trust in the Royal Manor.

155
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Would you like to do me a favor?

156
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Of course.

157
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,260
I'm the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's loyal to you.

158
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
I'll do it now.

159
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,260
Princess, this is the medicine you gave me.

160
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
I came back to see it.

161
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
No one saw it.

162
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Help me prepare it.

163
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
Go to the temple.

164
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Oh, right.

165
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Princess,

166
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
I just heard the maid in the mansion say

167
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,260
that it seems that the temple is running out of water.

168
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
You don't have to go there.

169
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
The temple is running out of water?

170
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,260
I remember that the temple is running out of water.

171
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
The water is not burned.

172
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
It's useless to take my soul.

173
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Damn it.

174
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
I was born like this.

175
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,260
I was born with the spirit of the Ghosts.

176
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
What's going on?

177
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
Who did it?
