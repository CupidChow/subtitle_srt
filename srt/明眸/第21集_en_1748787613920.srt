1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
necessity

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
America

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,060
Episode 21

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Prince No. 13,

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,060
no wonder you named her Classics King.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,360
I didn't know that you

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,500
came so hastily to meet me,

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,980
what do you think?

23
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,620
How could you be with Prince Qi?

24
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,620
I didn't want to be with Prince Qi.

25
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,620
But since he's here, I'll be his witness.

26
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,420
Zhu Huai Chen bullied me.

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,220
He asked Prince Qi to pretend to be with me.

28
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,260
I can't bear to be humiliated like this.

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,220
Princess is old enough to be with me.

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,740
Please help me contact the Li family.

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,340
I want to be reasonable.

32
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,940
Prince Qi is making you witness.

33
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,500
He admitted this to you personally.

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
You finally grew up.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,860
Since you all know that you're the Nanyang royal family,

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,300
you're indeed a perfect match.

37
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,500
Royal Consort, you're not a person's attitude.

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
I don't want to be a royal consort.

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,700
Don't be too naive.

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,500
I was still thinking about you before I was born.

41
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
I didn't expect you to be like this.

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
It seems that I really begged wrongly.

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Do you always miss me?

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Xiao Lang!

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Your poison has already entered your heart.

46
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
It's fine.

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
There are always some things in life.

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
There are always some things in life.

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
But Xiao Lang has been waiting for too long in heaven.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Please hurry and change me.

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
What are you saying?

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Why is Princess poisoned?

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Tell her.

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
You always want to protect her.

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
But she's trying to pursue the truth with her heart.

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
You don't have to hide it.

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
General Xiao is your uncle.

58
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
You should know how he died.

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Ten years ago,

60
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Nanyang found out that there was a Beijing spy in the palace.

61
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Nanyang destroyed the alliance and two countries' war.

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Uncle Xiao led soldiers to kill the general.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
But if I tell you,

64
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
there's no such a Beijing spy.

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm not a spy.

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm a spy.

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm a spy.

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
How do you remember the time when you were still alive?

69
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
I don't know.

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
I don't know.

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
He told me about this.

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Under my investigation,

73
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
everything about Beijing's spy was just a lie.

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I found out about this by the emperor.

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
He was afraid that I would attack the world.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
So he poisoned me.

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm so stupid.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm so stupid.

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
If it wasn't for him,

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
what would Xiao Lang and I do?

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
So...

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
So everything was Nanyang's scheme.

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
He was to make a war with Beijing?

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Yes.

85
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Father is the one who can be a man who can be a man of wild ambition.

86
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
The two countries' war was a long-term battle.

87
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Nanyang and Beijing were seriously injured.

88
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,500
People couldn't get along.

89
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Later, the two countries' war was over.

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Zhu Huaizhen went to Beijing to marry you.

91
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
It's getting worse.

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
It's just that father's illness.

93
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Not only that,

94
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
he also wanted to take away your family's wealth.

95
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
So he wanted to kill himself

96
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
and hurt the people.

97
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
So Nanyang was the most guilty one.

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
He was the real enemy of my family.

99
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Look.

100
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Princess, I know it's true.

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Could you help me contact Li's uncle

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
and help me get rid of the suspicion of the Yellow Hall?

103
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I've contacted them.

104
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I've tried.

105
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
But I've tried it before.

106
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I've already tried Xiao Lang and Xiao Lang's relationship.

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I'm afraid you'll have to do something else.

108
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
What are you talking about?

109
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Xiao Lang!

110
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Your Highness!

111
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I'll handle it.

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I'll get rid of you.

113
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Princess, I have orders.

114
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
No one can get out of here.

115
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Don't force me to kill.

116
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Your Highness, you've made a mistake.

117
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
You dare to kill me?

118
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Princess, I just want to see you.

119
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm going to be made by these scoundrels.

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Go back. I don't want to see you.

121
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I can go back.

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I'll hand Li Zhi An and Zhu Huai Jin out.

123
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I know they're here.

124
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
You want to take someone back?

125
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
You thought he'd come to me

126
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
when you were doing it with him.

127
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I'm going to stay with him.

128
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I'll keep this person.

129
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
I'll report to the brother about the divorce.

130
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
You can go back.

131
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Li Zhi An lied to me that

132
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
he wasn't here to see Long Yu.

133
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
He was here to see my aunt.

134
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Is she here to kill me by his father?

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
You and Zhu Huai Jin

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
hid Li Zhi An here.

137
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I'm afraid it's not simple.

138
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
You hid your Li family's old house.

139
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
What did you do?

140
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
To avenge the Li family who killed the whole of Beijing.

141
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Now Li family's old house is in Beijing.

142
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
It's a traitor.

143
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I won't protect them.

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Who can avenge Li family?

145
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Zhu Huai Jin is still in the big screen.

146
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,500
It's him who killed my Li family.

147
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
He even saved my Li family

148
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
and became a traitor to the whole of the Empire.

149
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Now I can't contact Li family through Princess.

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I can't let Zhu Huai Jin get away.

151
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
I have to go back.

152
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Your eyes...

153
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Li family...

154
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Zhi An, I knew you were here.

156
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Zhi An.

157
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I don't know

158
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
what happened to Li family.

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
So,

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
you did all this

166
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
to avenge Li family.

167
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I've been in love with you.

168
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Everything is not important now.

169
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
As long as you can avenge Li family,

170
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm willing to go back with you.

171
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Long Yu,

172
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm willing to leave it to you.

173
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Are you sure?

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Thank you for your help.

175
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Take care.

176
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Zhi An.

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Go back to your mansion.

178
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Your Highness, where is the prince?

179
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Zhu Huai Jin is not well in my mansion.

180
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Let him stay here.

181
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Where is he?

182
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
He went back with Zhu Huai Jin.

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Yes.

184
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
The third prince has ordered

185
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
that after the seven princes meet with the princess,

186
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
they will not be in the same boat.

187
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,500
They will fall into the cliff and die without a single drop.

188
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Zhu Huai Jin,

189
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
you have a second heart.

190
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
The third prince will not stay here.

191
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
You want to kill me?

192
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Just do it.

193
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Kill!

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
