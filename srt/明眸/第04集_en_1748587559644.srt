1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Part Three

2
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,460
so

3
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,560
That blind thing

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,580
is beyond my ability

5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,840
Now is no time for you to假 Details

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,480
Yes

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,200
It doesn't hurt

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
This is your 50th.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
If you find Long Yixia,

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
it will be more useful for you.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Thank you, brother.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
You are still smart.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
When you return to Nanyang,

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
continue to be my manager.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Help me to control this bastard.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Pudau

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,480
1 year ago

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,100
Did you...

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
meet your father?

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,900
It is me.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,700
I...

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
He is Zhuhuai neighborhood.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Why would I lie to him?

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I was his sister-in-law.

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
He dare to send me on a carriage.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,840
I don't feel like trying to reasons with you entering the outer space of my mind.

27
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,200
So I'm seeing him as demanding of you.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,720
Is it possible for you to create a相liness source hard?

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
What can I say for that?

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Right, my trans Arena odyssey is not the issue.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,220
You need to just ease that snugly,

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,220
You're so mean to me, Zhuhai.

33
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,220
Zhizhen, your arm is so weak.

34
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,220
What's this?

35
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,220
This is my mother's.

36
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,220
I thought I'd leave home and miss you.

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,220
Don't worry. I'll take good care of you.

38
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,220
Okay.

39
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,220
You're a fool. You can't die.

40
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,220
Zhizhen, you're so gentle to me now.

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,220
I'm so gentle. I don't know how you can be so stupid.

42
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,220
I'll take you here. Go in yourself.

43
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,220
My boy.

44
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
Why did you live like that?

45
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,820
Aren't you cold?

46
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,220
I'm wet.

47
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,520
What's up?

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,220
It's asا after onnggar-seshka.

49
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,220
It's his first night so he changed back home.

50
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,220
I'll comb his hair first.

51
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Hugs every evening.

52
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
That's next tea time.

53
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,220
So?

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,240

71
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,620
Good.

72
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,580
Lord of demons, stop your act!

73
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
I'm the head of the Dangan family.

74
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,460
I'm in charge of the division.

75
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,460
You can call me mom.

76
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,460
I'll see you in ten days.

77
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,460
Your Highness, you've been working hard on your journey.

78
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Have some tea.

79
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Have some tea.

80
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,460
So you treat me like this.

81
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
Have some tea.

82
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,460
From now on, you're mine.

83
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm a warrior.

84
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,460
I've seen the life and death of the battlefield.

85
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,460
I know that the so-called high and low-ranking swords are all good.

86
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,460
People are good.

87
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,460
As long as you're alive, you'll have the chance to change your life.

88
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,460
I know that the servants in the Imperial Courtyard are always busy with their work.

89
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
They're self-sufficient.

90
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,460
You don't have to do that in my room.

91
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,460
I can't see it, but I can't tolerate the people who are so good.

92
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,460
I'll never let go of the people who hurt me.

93
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,460
I'll do my best to protect my people.

94
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,460
From now on, you'll have the ability to live and work.

95
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,460
Leave now if you don't want to do it.

96
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,460
If you're old enough and don't want to serve in the future,

97
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
I'll give you some money to raise.

98
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,460
But remember, you're all mine.

99
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
I've made it clear.

100
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Huang Zifei is a good man.

101
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
If I were born in the early age of twenty,

102
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,460
I'd ask you to give me a good man.

103
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,460
You'd better have some tea first.

104
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,460
Huang Zifei, the tea is cold.

105
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
I'll get you another one.

106
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,460
It's okay.

107
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,460
If you're here, you'll have to drink this tea.

108
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,460
But...

109
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,460
Let's call Huang Zifei to make an appointment.

110
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
What's your problem?

111
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,460
What's wrong?

112
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,460
Why are you kneeling down?

113
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,460
I'll get you another cup of tea.

114
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,460
Why are you crying?

115
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,460
No one is here.

116
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
What's wrong with you?

117
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,460
No one's here.

118
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,460
You're a scoundrel.

119
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,460
You're the servants of Huang Zifu.

120
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,460
You're so good at it.

121
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Give me the blinds to accompany me.

122
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,460
I'll get some for you.

123
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
Don't move.

124
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,460
Don't move.

125
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Don't move.

126
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,460
Why is this woman so powerful?

127
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
Is she...

128
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,460
Is she a scoundrel?

129
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Come on, have some tea.

130
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,460
What are you doing?

131
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Where are you taking me?

132
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
I'm going back to Huang Zifei.

133
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,460
I'll take you to the way to Huang Zifu.

134
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
This way.

135
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
I'm so stupid.

136
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,460
If I stop, he'll know I'm watching.

137
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
But if I continue...

138
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,460
I'll see if you're a real scoundrel or a scoundrel.

139
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
I'm so stupid.

140
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,460
I'm so stupid.

141
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
I'm so stupid.

142
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
I'm so stupid.

143
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,460
I'm so stupid.

144
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm so stupid.

145
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
I'm so stupid.

146
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,460
I'm so stupid.

147
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
I'm so stupid.

148
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
I'm so stupid.

149
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
I'm so stupid.

150
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,460
I'm so stupid.

151
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,460
I'm so stupid.

152
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,460
I'm so stupid.

153
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
I'm so stupid.

154
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,460
I'm so stupid.

155
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
I'm so stupid.

156
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,460
I'm so stupid.

157
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
I'm so stupid.

158
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm so stupid.

159
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,460
I'm so stupid.

160
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm so stupid.

00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I'm so stupid.

167
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
I'm so stupid.

168
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
I'm so stupid.

169
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
I'm so stupid.

170
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I'm so stupid.

171
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
I'm so stupid.

172
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
