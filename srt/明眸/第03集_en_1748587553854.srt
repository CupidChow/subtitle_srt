1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Still complete the leben

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,780
Not bad

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,240
I was so surprised

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,640
This piece will win

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,540
I know

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,180
Two Survival books

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,180
The End

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,180
Episode 1

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,180
Who set that sword?

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,180
Is there anyone else who wants to destroy Chen's life?

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,180
Maybe they have something for me.

12
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,180
Who is it?

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,180
Is it you, my husband?

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
Catch the assassin!

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,180
How do I remember this guy?

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
He looks so sick.

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,180
Did he always pretend to be me?

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,180
He hid the treasure to kill Zhu Huai Chen.

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,180
He's a good man.

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,180
Life is different from what we have.

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,180
Don't say that the future is different.

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,180
If you have a choice, you'd better be safe.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
Catch the assassin!

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
Search the place.

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Search the place.

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,180
How is it?

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,180
No.

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,180
Why is he wearing a wedding dress?

30
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,180
Let go of me!

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,180
Don't touch the rabbit.

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Go away!

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,180
That mad woman

35
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,180
dare to scare my eyes.

36
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,180
I'll kill her right away!

37
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,180
Chang Lang, don't be angry.

38
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
If we kill her now,

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,180
it's not a good deal.

40
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
Before,

41
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,180
the enemy of the martial arts court hasn't been reported.

42
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
She made you

43
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,180
lose face in front of His Majesty and Prince Zhong.

44
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,180
We just have to keep her.

45
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,180
We have to take her down slowly.

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,180
Besides,

47
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,180
we have to find a dragon-died Xia Long.

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Let her die.

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
It's a good deal.

50
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
I want her to die.

51
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,180
That's right, Chang Lang.

52
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,180
And Chang Lang said that

53
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
Li Zhi An

54
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,180
and his family's old department

55
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,180
are still in good health.

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,180
If they can get their own dragon-died Xia Long,

57
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,180
they can't get the dragon-died Xia Long.

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
That's right.

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,180
They can't get the dragon-died Xia Long.

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,180
But they can't get the dragon-died Xia Long.

61
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,180
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,180
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,180
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,180
If they can get the old department's soldiers,

68
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,180
they will be very helpful to your father.

69
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,180
There is a treasure map

70
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,180
on the Li family's left.

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,180
It says that the world

72
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,180
can only be truly

73
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,180
moved by the treasure of the dragon-died Xia Long.

74
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,180
It seems that they are looking for the dragon-died Xia Long.

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,180
Third Prince.

76
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Did you find it?

77
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,180
The patient is not in the room.

78
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
Go down.

79
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,180
Yes.

80
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Hua Chen, is it you?

81
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,180
Zhi An, it's me.

82
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,180
I burnt my husband yesterday.

83
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,180
I burnt my husband yesterday.

85
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,180
I don't know how you got hurt.

86
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
I'm fine.

87
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,180
You don't have to worry.

88
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,180
Come on.

89
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,180
Prince Fei is awake.

90
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,180
It's better to pack up and go.

91
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,180
My husband, you can wait for me.

92
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,180
You must be taking me, right?

93
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,180
No.

94
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,180
By the way, Zhi An.

95
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,180
The important thing that

96
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,180
Lord Yuezhang gave you

97
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,180
is to take care of it.

98
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
You have eyes.

99
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
If it's not convenient,

100
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,180
you can take care of it.

101
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,180
You want to trick me into giving it to you?

102
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,180
But you don't even know

103
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,180
what Lord Yuezhang is.

104
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,180
If it wasn't for the previous life's harm,

105
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,180
I wouldn't have known.

106
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,180
The important thing?

107
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
I've thought about it.

108
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
My father said that

109
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
the most important thing he has is me.

110
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,180
Now I'm your wife.

111
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
You just have to protect me.

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Isn't it the most important thing?

113
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
Brother Li,

114
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
Lord Li's subordinate

115
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,180
is here to send Brother Li and Miss Li.

116
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,180
We don't want them to wait too long.

117
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
I won't let you get away with it.

118
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
The whole General's mansion is locked up.

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,180
There's no Long Yu's whereabouts.

120
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,180
You're a bunch of trash.

121
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,180
Get out!

122
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
Yes.

123
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Brother Hong,

124
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,180
the Northern Emperor is trying to rob Long Yu.

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
He's been drunk for a long time.

126
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
He's been out of the house

127
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
after General Li's full-time job.

128
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Now the north and the old are waiting outside.

129
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
They want to see Li Zhi An

130
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
leaving Beijing.

131
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,180
It's so hard to get rid of these old people.

132
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
Brother Huang,

133
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,180
you can let them go for a few more days.

134
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,180
When the time comes,

135
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,180
after the new people

136
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
who have been married

137
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,180
and the generals

138
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
who have been killed

139
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
one by one,

140
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
they won't be afraid

141
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,180
that these soldiers won't return to you.

142
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,180
Is your plan

143
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,180
feasible?

144
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
I've been with my aunt.

145
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,180
I shouldn't be hurt.

146
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
But those generals

147
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,180
have kept Li Zhi An

148
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
from being taken by the enemy.

149
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Besides,

150
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Brother Huang has put a lot of effort

151
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
into this for her.

152
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,180
They won't suspect anything else.

153
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
Zhi An,

154
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,180
your parents don't know how to distinguish you.

155
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,180
I didn't ask them to send you to the capital.

156
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Hua Chen,

157
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
I'll sit here

158
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,180
and tell my parents.

159
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,180
Now,

160
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
we only need to take out

161
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,180
Li Zhi An's secret talisman.

162
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
Only then

163
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,180
can we find out

164
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
what's going on.

165
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
We can't stop Li Zhi An.

166
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
But Zhu Hua Chen

167
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,180
can't tell her sister.

168
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Miss Li is leaving

169
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
for the wedding today.

170
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
We'll wait for her

171
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,180
to come out with us.

172
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,180
Miss Li is leaving.

173
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
I can't let them

174
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
tell Li Zhi An

175
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,180
that I'm a traitor.

176
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
Uncle,

177
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
you've seen Zhi An grow up

178
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
and protect her.

179
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,180
Zhi An will be grateful

180
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
to you

181
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
for your kindness.

182
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
If she's happy,

183
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,180
she'll be thankful again.

184
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I haveDone

185
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
everything

186
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
for her.

187
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
During the ceremony,

188
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,260
I accused

189
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,220
Zhu Hua Chen of

190
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,180
doing something wrong.

191
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
Qu Yuan.

192
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,180
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,180
Doctor Zhu Hua Chen

194
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
is now

195
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,180
the такимa Elixir 꺼aking master.

196
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,780
Project.

197
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,120
What's this?

198
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,580
I don't know if the world is willing to be safe

199
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,500
or not

200
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,820
The red pig is greedy

201
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,740
I have no feelings for you

202
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,020
The same soul is broken

203
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,860
I want to see you

204
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,980
Even if we are together, love will never change

205
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,180
The sword of the sword is more powerful than the wind

206
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,220
My hands never let go

207
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,340
Even if we are together, our eyes will never change

208
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,500
The wind is blowing slowly, the fire is burning

209
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:05,300
I will always believe that the summer light is shining
