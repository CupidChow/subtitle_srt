1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The End

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Stop!

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Mother Qin,

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
what are you doing?

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind is blowing.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Close the door.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't let the earth

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
destroy the eyes of the prince.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Eat with me.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Princess, the rules in the mansion

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
can't be used with the master.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You've hurt us.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Someone asked me.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I told you.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There's no poison in the food.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It seems that Zhu Huaijin really

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
has a bad reputation.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If so,

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
why don't I let Zhu Huaijin

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
use what I have?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why is he here?

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Who?

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Madam.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's me.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Chen An,

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you're really in a hurry today.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I have to find a reason to escape.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My husband,

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm a little tired.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can't go out.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I can't go out.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't go out.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want to go back and rest.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Chen An,

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
my room

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
is your room.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My husband,

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm not feeling well today.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's okay.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Prince Zhang,

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
is there any medicine?

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll go and get it.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Prince Zhang,

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the Western Regions are here.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Come.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The Western Regions' envoy and Li's army

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
are his biggest enemies.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Zhu Huaijin's plan is already out.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have to make a few steps.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Princess Nanliang and Princess He

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
almost got married to my uncle, General Xiao.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You two have a special way of contacting.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When you find him,

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you'll be able to contact Li's uncle.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Princess Guang.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you know Princess Jinghe?

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Princess Jinghe.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is he in our mansion?

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Princess Jinghe?

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He didn't come to the Prince's Mansion.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But he's a kind person.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He'll be in the palace

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to save the wounded and ill people

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
every month.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The first wife?

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's just tomorrow.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Princess,

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll go back to the garden

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and clean up.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll come back to pick you up.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Actually,

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Li's army has entered Nanliang's territory.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If Princess doesn't help,

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll hang this secret talisman

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
on the street.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then I'll have a chance

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to let Li's army see it.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Good morning, Miss.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why do you want to come out today?

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm here in Nanliang.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want you to come with me

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and walk around.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Nanliang, Beijing,

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
is a war-torn country.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not easy to get rid of it.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Nanliang is in the capital.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Nanliang is in the capital.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a great place to live.

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No wonder they'll send a war-torn army

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to the capital.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wake up.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's wrong?

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's the refugees and beggars

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
who escaped from the border.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Nanliang, Beijing,

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
has been in war for many years.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's hard for the refugees to see it.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This should be

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Princess Jinghe's place.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can you take me

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to see Princess Jinghe?

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Come here.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Be careful.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Everyone, get out of here.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There might be a food stall.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We need to take care of it.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Didn't you hear what the princess said?

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Get out of here.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Get out of here.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The four enemies are not in the way.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Get out of here.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Get out of here.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Zhiyan, it's a sudden attack.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We can only take Princess Jinghe

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
with us another day.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Now,

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
we can only rely on Li family's secret talisman.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Zhiyan, are you okay?

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Although I'm not familiar with this place,

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't tell you

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
what's going on.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not familiar with this place,

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
but I feel that the refugees here

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
are like Beijing.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They are all miserable.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you miss home?

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Of course I do.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I also think

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that as the daughter of General of Beijing,

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
after I married Nanliang,

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the two countries will be safe.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's the point

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
of my sadness?

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I really thought it was like this.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I didn't expect that

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
we would be the same.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's all because of Zhu Huaichen.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My husband,

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
this is the letter of peace to Beijing.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you want to hang it

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
in the private place for me?

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
For Nanliang and the people of Beijing,

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and the soldiers,

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I hope that the war will never end.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Drink it.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Drink it.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The war will never end.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't want to be a widow.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to be a lover.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't want to be a loser.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Zhiyuan,

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
can you give me

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the last letter of peace?

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You are the emperor.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are the son of the emperor.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What do you want him to do?

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Everyone in the world has it.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's my honor.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You are so good at acting

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
as Zhu Huaichen.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You don't like him.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's my little sister's gift.

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll hang it up.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Wait.

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you want to take it,

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
just take it.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I just think

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the clothes that Cong Cong made

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
are not so rough.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's not worth your liking.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll give it to you.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You give it to me.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's the best.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What?

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Li Mei is gone?

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, Kuang Zifei.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, no.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Did Zhu Huaichen

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
find anything?

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
All the letters are missing.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It seems that Zhu Huaichen

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is acting with me

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
in the daytime.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He is saying that he cares about me.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He is still suspecting me.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is your husband back?

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll do it for you.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No need.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll do it myself.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you have any new things?

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just fear that you will be too tired.

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How could you?

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The peace dress you gave me today

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
looks so unique.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I've never seen it before.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The pictures of the peace dress

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
are all different.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What's wrong?

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't you like it?

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why don't you like what you gave me?

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You want me to be healthy

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and healthy every year.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No one has ever blessed me like this.

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He will definitely bless me.

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Since you took the peace dress

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and hung it on the wall,

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
why did you have to

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
do it again?

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He must be testing it.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
My husband is talking about

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
these things that make people blush.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's late.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You should rest early.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I still have some evidence to get rid of.

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I still have some evidence to get rid of.

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,360
I have to clear the way.

227
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,220
I just feel the needle in.

228
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
It's a stone.

229
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,940
I feel it's better.

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,120
I'm going to be right out.

231
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,380
I remember the night is about just the beginning of this.

232
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,640
Your sense of tension seems to have been lost.

233
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,640
If we can find the book he's trying to use to find out the truth,

234
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,640
we can find a way to tell him to lose everything.

235
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
What are they doing in Zhu Huai Chen's room?

236
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Prince Qi.

237
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
What's wrong?

238
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Nothing. I just got burned.

239
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Duan Yu Rou.

240
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Is it convenient for Prince Qi to help me take your poison?

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Go find the painting.

242
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Where's the letter?

243
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,640
This is the letter of Zhu Huai Chen and the deceased Prince Qi.

244
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,640
This letter was found in the house of the cat.

245
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,640
My father said it was the deceased's letter.

246
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Why did Duan Yu Rou listen to Zhu Huai Chen's words?

247
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
She even gave Zhu Huai Chen some evidence.

248
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Is Duan Yu Rou Zhu Huai Chen's person?

249
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Is Duan Yu Rou Zhu Huai Chen's person?

250
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Although this can explain why mom Qin was killed,

251
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Duan Yu Rou is not well.

252
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
But it's not right.

253
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Zhu Huai Chen was killed by Duan Yu Rou.

254
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,640
What's going on?

255
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
In this world,

256
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,640
we must not let Zhu Huai Chen and the deceased Prince Qi cheat.

257
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,640
The night is silent.

258
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,640
The old days are cruel.

259
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
The wind blows through the trees.

260
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,640
The past is cruel.

261
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,640
The world is not far away.

262
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
The past is cruel.

263
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,640
The world is not far away.

264
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,640
The world is not far away.

265
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
The past is cruel.

266
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,640
The past is cruel.

267
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
The red pig is greedy.

268
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,640
I have no feelings for you.

269
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
The same soul is broken.

270
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I want to see you clearly.

271
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Even if love will never change,

272
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,640
the light is bright and the snow is clear.

273
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,640
My hands never give up.

274
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Even if I can't change my promise,

275
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,640
the wind blows slowly and the firefly is burning.

276
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:22,640
I will always believe that the summer light is shining.
