1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,460
Because other ads don't have plans

2
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,120
They don't care if we buy bad things

3
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,400
We should ask a councillor

4
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
How is he?

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,000
He has grown up.

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,800
He can't be your wife anymore.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
He is still like this.

8
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,800
He didn't give up.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because you are my wife!

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,800
I don't want to die.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
I have your money!

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,400
Because I'm your own son.

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,000
All the risks of being killed

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
are for you.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,200
You deserve it!

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Go! Go!

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I deserve it!

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
If you come back this time,

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
I'll kill you again!

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Star Media

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,880
Part one

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,760
At the King

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,200
Episode One

24
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,660
.

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,420
In front of the river, we promised to make peace

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,720
If I'm a nice girl, you'll love me

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,520
Agreed

28
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,000
Who are you?

29
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,720
It's my friend

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Is it husband?

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,980
Directly

32
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm so scared

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,040
I heard that he had a woman talking to me.

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,440
And then I don't remember anything.

35
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,440
It's okay. It's okay. I'll be there.

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
I'll protect you.

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Okay. That's all.

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,640
Ask me what happened to the man who was born.

39
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,440
Don't you really believe that Li Zhiyan was born by Zhuhuaishen's mother?

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,440
How is that possible? There are really ghosts in this world.

41
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,640
His whole family's ghost soul has already been kicked out and killed.

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
It's useless to keep him in such a hard-working way.

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,040
There's nothing impossible.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Zhiyan is the one who has the world.

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,440
Even if he is reborn, he won't be affected.

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,540
I can be reborn.

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,440
There's nothing impossible in this world.

48
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,040
You...

49
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,240
Okay. I'm not afraid of you.

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
He really believed that?

51
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,640
Yes, he did. I heard it myself.

52
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,040
I...

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Third Prince said that you are the most powerful person in the world.

54
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,240
That's why you are scared of this.

55
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm not as smart as I thought.

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,640
I think he was blinded by love.

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,640
As long as Prince Fei says so, he will believe it.

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,240
How is that possible?

59
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,040
The Emperor and the Emperor are all kind of people.

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,840
All kind of people are just tools for fighting for power.

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,840
How is that possible?

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Since Prince Fei saw it so clearly, why would he marry Third Prince?

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,240
I think that the whole day...

64
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,640
He and the Prince are in love.

65
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,040
He must be married to a true heart.

66
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,040
I am indeed a true heart.

67
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,440
Who are you? Why are you hanging there?

68
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,740
Don't come over. Hurry and go.

69
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,440
Are you okay?

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,040
Be careful!

71
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,140
Hello?

72
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,840
My eye...

73
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,940
I can't see anything.

74
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,740
43

75
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,840
Your foot is a little bit poisonous, so it has a little bit of an effect on your eyes.

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Who are you?

77
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm the one who just saved you.

78
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Your foot was bitten by a poisonous snake.

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
So I took off your shoes and put them on you.

80
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,640
If you need to be punished, don't blame me.

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,440
I... Do you know who I am?

82
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,440
I... Miss Li, I just took the herb.

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,040
Oh, right.

84
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
This is your pen.

85
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,440
Who are you? How did you know me?

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,640
Miss Li, don't panic. You and I are old friends.

87
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,040
Oh, right. This is the golden grass I just picked for you.

88
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
It has an antidote.

89
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
There is no other medicine now.

90
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Let's take this medicine.

91
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
It's all my fault.

92
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,640
I let Miss Li wait for so long.

93
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,440
I remember that the golden grass was on the cliff.

94
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,640
Your legs were hurt. How did you know?

95
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,040
How did your hand get hurt?

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
It's okay. I'm sorry.

98
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,040
There is no other way.

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,040
We still have time to go down the mountain tomorrow.

100
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,040
I'll go find something to eat. You go to rest.

101
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Miss Li.

102
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,040
You can only eat some fruit.

103
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Why did your hand get hurt again?

104
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
It's okay. You go ahead.

105
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I'll give this to you.

106
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Protect yourself. Don't get hurt.

107
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Thank you, Miss Li.

108
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Even if we can't make up our minds,

109
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,040
we can't hide our feelings.

110
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,040
We will always believe that we can be together.

111
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Miss Li, what's wrong?

112
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Let's go down the mountain to find the doctor.

113
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
You will never know what kind of purpose the person who approached you

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
was.

115
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,040
You only remember the peace and sweetness of the time.

116
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,040
But in the end, you may find that everything is a lie.

117
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Zhai.

118
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Zhai.

119
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Zhai.

120
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
My eyes...

121
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
I can't see anything.

122
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Miss Li.

123
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Li Huang.

124
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Who are you?

125
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I'm the third prince of the south.

126
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Chu Huaichen.

127
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,040
I think the person who approached you

128
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,040
is not the person in front of you.

129
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Princess, actually, the person who was always with you...

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Are you sitting on the ground?

131
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
It's cold. Get up.

132
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
No, princess. Listen to me.

133
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
The person who was always with you...

134
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I know.

135
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Hua Mei, listen to me.

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,040
In this world, there are many interesting things.

137
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Some people think that they are clever and can hide the past.

138
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,040
But the world is full of secrets.

139
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Although I'm blind, I'm not.

140
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I know who is true and who is false.

141
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
You mean you know...

142
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,040
I know. I know.

143
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,040
I know you are good to me.

144
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I treat you as my good sister.

145
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Princess, I'm so happy to see you.

146
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm so sorry to see you like this.

147
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Good sister, you're right.

148
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
I'm a little sleepy.

149
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Can you sleep with me tonight?

150
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Yes.

151
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Hua Mei, I'm a good person.

152
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,040
I appreciate your sincerity.

153
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,040
But I can't make things complicated.

154
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,040
I want to be good to you.

155
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
I'm a good person.

156
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
I'm a good person.

157
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm a good person.

158
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm a good person.

159
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm a good person.

160
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm a good person.

161
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm a good person.

162
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm a good person.

163
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm a good person.

164
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I'm a good person.

165
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm a good person.

166
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm a good person.

167
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I'm a good person.

168
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm a good person.

169
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
I'm a good person.

170
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm a good person.

171
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
I'm a good person.

172
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
I'm a good person.

173
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
I'm a good person.

174
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
I'm a good person.

175
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm a good person.

176
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm a good person.

177
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm a good person.

178
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
I'm a good person.

179
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm a good person.

180
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
I'm a good person.

181
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm a good person.

182
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm a good person.

183
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
I'm a good person.
