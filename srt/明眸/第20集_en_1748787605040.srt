1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
simplify the fashion

2
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:59,040
win

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If I was more than you, why would I understand you?

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Brother Qi, are you feeling better now?

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm just going to move on.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm just going to stay in the dark.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't want to be alone.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You saved me.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can't stand it anymore.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Just take it as my true intention.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What do you mean?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That year, the Third Prince used gold and silver to seduce me.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He took care of me with the spirit of a gentleman.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's why I fell in love with him.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But why didn't he recognize him today, but you did?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I...

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How long are you going to lie to me?

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You saved my life.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You took care of me too.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Zhu Huai Chen, why did you let all of this happen to Zhu Huai Chen?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I always thought it was him.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But actually, it's never him.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Zhi An, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why did you do this?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't have any reasonable explanation.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But there are things I shouldn't have kept from you.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If I hadn't been able to break his silence that day,

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
my fate might have been a different situation.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But if that's the case, I wouldn't have seen you again.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I won't regret it.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Then, I was controlled by Zhu Huai Chen by the Five-Sisters.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I did everything for him.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When I first met you, you seemed to have lost your way.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You were in my way of life.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I loved you and loved you.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I did anything for you.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But then, I hurt you with Zhu Huai Chen.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You were poisoned by the poison.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It wasn't a coincidence.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It was a trap for Zhu Huai Chen.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I...

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was a helper.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't have the right to love you.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I just wanted to stay with you.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It was my fault.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Zhu Huai Chen is a little brother.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So he hates you.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He used me to deceive your feelings.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And kept me with you.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So his purpose is to make you happy.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But I won't help you get rid of Long Yu.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm here to protect you.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Zhi An, you can trust me.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You've been lying to me for so long.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And you want me to trust you.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Zhu Huai Chen,

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
is this all you've hidden from me?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Nothing else.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I...

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have...

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have the secret of my life.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have the secret of my life.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I have the secret of Zhu Huai Chen.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How can I tell you this?

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Zhi An, I...

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have the secret of my life.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I trust you.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But I don't trust you.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't believe you.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The moon is in the wind

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
My hands are never free

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Miss

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is the token of the princess and General Xiao

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please give it to the princess for me

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Li Zhi An is in a serious condition

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, wait a minute

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Fortunately, I prepared it early

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The princess will see Ling Bai

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Zhi An

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Zhi An

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Zhi An

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Zhi An

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The princess said she was tired today

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She saw you were in a hurry

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You went out to the mountain to see me off

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why?

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ling Bai

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You have to forgive her

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She came with me

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You are too much

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So this lady is the prince of Qi

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Please come with me

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
How did you get here alone in the mountain?

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What if you are in danger?

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't you want me?

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The prince of Qi is in danger

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can see the princess with your eyes

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why do you have to make yourself suffer

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
by my side to play your enemy?

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Princess

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You are the woman who asked for the token of General Xiao

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I will go to the mountain to see you

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Your shield is so famous

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Commander

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Your hat

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,900
Yourוה

130
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,620
You are the one that asked meเ��

131
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
To see the princess

132
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,500
The light is bright, the snow is clear

133
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,500
My hands are never loose

134
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Even if I can't change my promise

135
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
The wind is blowing slowly, the fire is burning

136
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I will always believe that the summer is coming

137
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,500
The wind is blowing slowly, the fire is burning

138
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I will always believe that the summer is coming

139
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I will always believe that the summer is coming

140
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I will always believe that the summer is coming

141
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
I will always believe that the summer is coming
