00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,320
suitable for Volanova

2
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,620
Are you insane?

3
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,040
Did he feet the patients from the field?

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,260
You've got everything

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,180
word must be Furun Jade螢幕

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,720
AI.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Shit ακ

8
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,800
It is

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:27,080
Did you recognize the

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,360
Cheney, I think I sat at the Hall of Seven Qigales too.

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,480
I haven't noticed anything or even felt bad about him for so long.

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,000
No sign of the quantum energy.

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
Cheney, like he said,

14
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Li Zhijin is a gunner.

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,540
Why don't we bring him somewhere else?

16
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,340
It's time for LYe Get enjoyed.

17
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,780
He never escaped this tavern.

18
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,040
You died at his place!

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
isch.

20
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,760
I took you to the temple.

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,040
Okay.

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,760
Is the temple burnt?

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,800
You you wallets el造

24
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,160
called the temple lost?

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,040
What is gone ...

26
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,320
Why?

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
My lord!

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,860
My lord!

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,600
Moscow!

30
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,060
Ok!

31
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,440
No!

32
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
My lord.

33
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Why didn't you give it to me?

34
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,440
I... I heard that the temple is flooded.

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,880
But I don't know why.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
I need to take the princess to the temple.

37
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Isn't this the place of the master?

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
You made such a big circle.

39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
So you're going to bully me and I can't see the road.

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm so sorry that you can't figure it out.

41
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,440
Princess, it's so wonderful.

42
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,440
But I have to thank you.

43
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Otherwise, the magic powder will be useless.

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
It's also very pretty.

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
I love you, Princess.

46
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Hello!

47
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Cream spester!

48
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,240

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,600

We welcome men, and you have come to allow here

Why...

55
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,520
You are at fault

56
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,120
Come!

57
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
If you still don't let Long Yu come his way

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,120
I will take you to the 18th noblest want

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,880

60
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,060
several years after 17 bloggers

61
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,040

62
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,280

63
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,040

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,180
China

67
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,740

69
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
in 20 million

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,460
You dept me so good

71
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,860
I must die

72
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,760
Because things are about to kick ass

73
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,860
What's wrong?

74
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,760
I knew you'd be alive

75
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,060
Junior吳先

76
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,340
Junior

77
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,580
Junior

78
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,540
Junior

79
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,760
I know you like the new world.

80
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
I want to be with you.

81
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I want to be with you.

82
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I want to be with you.

83
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,760
I know you want to meet me and the new world.

84
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,760
But the new world is not reliable.

85
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
How does Zhiyan know Zhuhai Chen's full plan?

86
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
And his secret?

87
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Why is my hand so small?

88
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,760
I'm on the battlefield.

89
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Zhiyan is in my arms.

90
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Now...

91
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Am I reborn?

92
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
What are you doing?

93
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Qian'er, I'm your mother!

94
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,760
The next day

95
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
You're a prince. I can't kill you.

96
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
I'm your special sister.

97
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
I believe you.

98
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Listen to me.

99
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Father.

100
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,760
It's the first time you come to me.

101
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Tell me, what's the matter?

102
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Father, Zhuhai Chen's mother is the one who killed me.

103
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
I saw it myself.

104
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Any evidence?

105
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
As long as we find the scar on the body,

106
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,760
we can find the match with the sword of the third brother.

107
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,760
And I can be a witness.

108
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
The third brother is a good man.

109
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
He's ruthless. He can't stay in the palace.

110
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
He can't let him get away with it.

111
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
If I tell you,

112
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
his mother is from the West.

113
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,760
So you know it all the time.

114
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
It's useless to be a monster.

115
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,760
The palace is always weak.

116
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,760
You have to fight with your own power.

117
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Although the third prince is a mother,

118
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
he's hard to handle.

119
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
He's a big man.

120
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
He's a little bit aggressive.

121
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I won't just beat him.

122
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
I'll still reward him.

123
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
If you want to move him,

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
you have to use your own power.

125
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
When I'm out of the palace,

126
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I'll try to protect you.

127
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
I understand what happened to the father.

128
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Why?

129
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Why does the body have a heart?

130
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
And the whole world is destroyed?

131
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,760
The world is not far away.

132
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,760
The darkness is not far away.

133
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,760
The moon is not far away.

134
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,760
The red pig is greedy.

135
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,760
I have no love for you.

136
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,760
The soul of the same soul

137
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,760
wants to see you.

138
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Even if love will never change,

139
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,760
the light is strong.

140
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
The snow is gentle.

141
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,760
My hands never give up.

142
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Even if I can't change my promise,

143
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
the wind is strong.

144
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
The firefly is wild.

145
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:54,760
I will always believe that the summer is over.
