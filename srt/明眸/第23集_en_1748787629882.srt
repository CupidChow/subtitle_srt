1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,740
You didn't throw yourciu away?

2
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,320
If so, you should have given it to her.

3
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,840
Where is the Taric?

4
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,220
How many cards will I give her?

5
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,880
What are you fighting right now?

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
I'll give you the dragon fish.

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
You've been hiding it from me for so long.

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
You want me to let you go?

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Let me go!

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,880
No!

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Since I'm here,

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
I'll give you the map.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
The map is on me.

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,880
No!

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,880
I didn't expect that

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,880
under my skin,

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,880
I can't be so easy to die for.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Dragon Fish is buried

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
right on your body!

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
How about this?

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,880
When the pig is pregnant,

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,880
you can't walk forward.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,880
You can just take off your clothes.

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,880
How?

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,880
No!

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Don't!

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
No!

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
He loves you so much.

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Just take it.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Okay.

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
I promise.

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Go!

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,880
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
I'm not!

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Don't eat!

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Don't eat!

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Don't eat!

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
You're not worthy.

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Even if I survive this life,

40
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
I'll take you out.

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
I don't want you to die.

42
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
I want you to live.

43
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
The last arrow!

44
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Take it off!

45
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Mister!

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Mister!

47
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
You're lying!

48
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Go!

49
00:04:51,880 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll leave you alone before you get your own ear from Dragon's will.

50
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,880
I've killed everyone!

51
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
We have no chance

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,880
to catch out on those who decent in the closet.

53
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,880
He gets us to work at the confusion.

54
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,060
They will learn about the Land Enchantress.

55
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,500
I will not let anyone who love me or me

56
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,080
to die in difficulty.

57
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,920
I will not abandon Ye fusion anymore.

58
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,800
Let's move on.

59
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,860
OK?

60
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
What?

61
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,060
How did I find

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,640
what you give me?

63
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
It's nothing.

64
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
You knew Long Yu was behind you.

65
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,880
It seems that God has given us a chance to live a lifetime.

66
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
So it is.

67
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,880
No matter how I think, I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

68
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,880
But you knew the truth long ago.

69
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,880
So I, Si Qian, am the one who was with me till the end.

70
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Right?

71
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,880
Zhai. Zhai.

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Huai Zhen.

73
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Zhai.

74
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
It's you.

75
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Zhai.

76
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
I'm not Zhuo Huai Zhen.

77
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
It's me.

78
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Zhai. Zhai.

79
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Zhai.

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Zhai.

81
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Zhai.

82
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Zhai.

83
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Zhai.

84
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,880
All my life, I will be alone.

85
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
I will be alone.

86
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,880
I will believe that the summer is coming.

87
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Duan Yu Rou killed you.

88
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,880
I didn't protect you in this life.

89
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,880
I killed him last life.

90
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
You were born in the age of young.

91
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
You could have left this world.

92
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
But you were chosen as me.

93
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
You even suffered a torture.

94
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
You even lost your life.

95
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
I can't keep guessing.

96
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
I can't let you suffer less.

97
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
I...

98
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Don't say that.

99
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
I just thought I could protect you.

100
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
But I didn't think about it.

101
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
You saw how scared I was when I saw Zhuo Huai Zhen.

102
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
You didn't believe me.

103
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,880
And I didn't know you were alive.

104
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
What do you mean?

105
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
You can't take your life as a life.

106
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
We are all living in the same world.

107
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
You tell me it's not worth it.

108
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
God gave you this life.

109
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
You just want to see yourself.

110
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
I did this for you.

111
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
You want to live for yourself.

112
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
If you don't care about your life,

113
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
you can just die without caring about your life.

114
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
You want me to suffer alone?

115
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
You are so reckless.

116
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
This is the way you love me.

117
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Zhen, you are right.

118
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I am not.

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
You are right.

120
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,880
If I die, you will suffer a life.

121
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
You like me.

122
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
You have me in your heart, right?

123
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
You are right.

124
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I am not a bad person.

125
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
As long as you like me,

126
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
I will live well.

127
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
You will live well.

128
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Even without me,

129
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
you will live well.

130
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
If I don't have you,

131
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
I will live well.

132
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,880
The most important thing in life is yourself.

133
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
God gave us a chance to be reborn.

134
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
We shouldn't use the past to hurt and hate.

135
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
When this is over,

136
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
I want to see the future of the sword.

137
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I want to see

138
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
what kind of person we are.

139
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
In this world,

140
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
many people choose to live in the world

141
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
and be the heroes of the world.

142
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Then someone should be able to

143
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
change everything and change the world.

144
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
If the world is golden,

145
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
you and I are the same.

146
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Even Zhuhai Zhen may be different.

147
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,880
Maybe we are the late Fan Hua Si Jin.

148
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Maybe we are like the mountains and rivers.

149
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,880
You should have another heart.

150
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
You should know your true worth.

151
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Let me be the one who can change everything.

152
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Yes.

153
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Will you be with me?

154
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
I will.

155
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
I will.

156
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Yes, I will.

157
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Duan Yurou, what's wrong?

158
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
He left.

159
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
The princess sent news that

160
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,880
the old department of Li family has gone to the capital.

161
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Finally.

162
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
The princess sent news that

163
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880

180
