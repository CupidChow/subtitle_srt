1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
Different & Comfortable

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,360
Re Bun

3
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,820
That can connect to more than one data.

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,840
Chen Lang, My dear.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Is it a headache?

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Where is this?

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is in your room.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll press it for you.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why did Li Zhi An know my full plan?

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Chen Lang, don't panic.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've already seen the wolf I've been trusting.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Li Zhi An has lost because of too much of a surprise.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He also said something he doesn't remember at all.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He definitely didn't pretend.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So he really was my mother?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Although this is a miracle,

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we can't afford to tolerate it anymore.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now, Li's uncle and Long Yue are still in the same boat.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Chen Lang, don't panic.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Zhu Huai Qi was against the Taimiao plan yesterday.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Later, he saw Li Zhi An.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where is he now?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ask him.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Taimiao was defeated by the former master of Li Zhi An.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
His Majesty thinks this is not right.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
When Chen Lang was asleep, he asked someone to ask him.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The former prince was in charge of Chen Lang's crime.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's gone.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Put him in the cell.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Father.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How dare you burn Taimiao and ruin my country?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I know my mistake.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is this for the Northern Lady?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Father.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're a great master.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You must not be so tired.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You should understand.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I allowed him to come to Nan Liang

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
just to protect the Long Yu family.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What you want to do is to hand over the Long Yu to me.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If anything goes wrong,

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will solve it.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't get the treasure.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No one in the world will get it.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Father.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I didn't mean to hurt Li Zhi An.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's just that I'm in a hurry.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Zhu Huai Chen has colluded with Xi Yu.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If he finds out that the Long Yu treasure is gone,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
then the consequences will be nothing.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is the evidence that Zhu Huai Chen and Xi Yu colluded.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Please forgive me.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You want to kill my son with my hand?

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is your plan.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I dare not.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What you want to do is not only to lead your opponent,

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
but also to protect Nan Liang's reputation.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you really have the heart of the Hu State,

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you must solve the problem from the bottom.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is the command of the Imperial Army.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I hope you won't let me down.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You may leave.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I thank you for your kindness.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will do my best to protect you.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will do my best to protect you.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I will do my best to protect you.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will do my best to protect you.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I thank you for your kindness.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will do my best to protect you.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I will leave.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Your Majesty, you clearly helped the seven princes deal with the terrible traces.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You also got the evidence of the three princes colluding with Xi Yu.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why didn't you punish them?

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The princes I attacked were Huai Chen.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But he was born in Beijing.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He was pregnant and grew up in the Jia Feng.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He was sent to the south to be the heir to the country.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But he is not strong enough now.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Huai Chen is his best knife-shipper.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In a few days, Huai Jin will cut off this knife-shipper.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He will be the one to protect Nan Liang's reputation.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your Majesty is wise.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll see you later!

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
tijd.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hua Mei,

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
who are you?

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'd better go back and ask for the medicine.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll take the medicine for you.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you dislike me?

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll go back and ask for the medicine.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Xiyu's heart is not strong.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He just came out of the palace.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is he really leaving it to Nanyang?

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But Nanyang knows Zhu Huai Chen has a relationship with Xiyu.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's impossible not to move.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Unless he has a plan.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But why?

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know.

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost.

103
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is the token of the imperial army.

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
When will Zhu Huai Chen join the army?

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is he the one who changed his letter to the imperial army?

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why is Nanyang so strange?

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He must hit him.

108
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He must reward him.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He's so heavy.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I grew up with my father in the imperial army.

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I closed my eyes and touched his wound.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
His wound is like a military spell.

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When Hua Mei sent you here,

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I heard that you were hurt because of me.

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why?

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't listen to him.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's none of your business.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You didn't tell me the truth.

120
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I...

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I...

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I...

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I was in the imperial army.

124
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was in a hurry to save you.

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So I hit Zhu Tai.

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I was in the imperial army.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
My father was so angry.

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I punished him.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's none of your business.

130
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't bother him.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So he was the one who hit you.

132
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why did he hit you?

133
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it because of me?

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Be careful not to hurt your husband.

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's okay.

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't hurt him.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Zhu Huaiqing.

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Did I tell you what happened to me?

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I've done it.

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.
