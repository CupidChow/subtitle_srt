1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,560
a

2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,140
Web is too youthful

3
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,840
to go with you

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,080
Ná ...

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,660
I was playing a couple with

6
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:55,960
nặn

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,760
she knew

8
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,080
nelly

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,080
It's the Duan Yu Rou who saved Qin Luo.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,080
How did this become the Duan Huai Jin?

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Hua Mei, where is the Duan Guanyi's house?

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,080
In his room. No one is allowed to enter.

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Is Princess looking for her?

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Why is no one allowed to enter?

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
You don't know that the Duan Guanyi is under Prince III's control.

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,080
He didn't even have the face to look at the light.

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,080
If the room is not in the right place, he will take everyone out and take the medicine.

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Duan Guanyi.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Who?

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Duan Guanyi.

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,080
Don't go out if you are blind.

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,080
What... what did I do?

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
If you are blind, don't go out.

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,080
What did I do?

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Duan Guanyi got hurt?

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
I grew up in the army.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,080
I can touch whatever wound you are suffering.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,080
I'm afraid that you won't be able to take the medicine.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
I brought the best medicine.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
Let me help you.

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,080
No need to worry.

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,080
You don't need to take the medicine anymore.

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,080
He... he is really taking the medicine for me.

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Why?

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Except for Prince Qi, no one else is alive.

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm not a spy.

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
You have something to say?

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
You think too much.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
I'm just a woman.

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,080
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Who can put the Duan Guanyi in this state?

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
You don't need to go.

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
I know Prince Qi saved you.

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
But you don't have to be so bullied.

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Nonsense.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Prince Qi is not like this.

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Who is holding his hand behind his back?

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
You are holding him like this.

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
But you are so heartless.

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
If he even saved you,

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
he was also designed to save you.

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Then you must be really wrong.

53
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
No way.

54
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Don't be so unreasonable.

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,080
You don't know what was the situation.

56
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
You are so stupid.

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
You are so stupid.

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
You are so stupid.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Who?

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
You two go with me.

61
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Go.

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Follow me.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,080
He is not just someone who saved him.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
He loves anyone.

65
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
He is willing to sacrifice his life for him.

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
In the past, he was a pig.

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Now he is a pig.

68
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,080
He is afraid of himself.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
The house is not accessible to the ordinary.

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Prince Qi is like coming for me.

71
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
It seems that we should meet like destiny.

72
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,080
He came here for you.

73
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I didn't expect Zhu Huai Jin would be so stubborn

74
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
before he was born.

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Zhu Huai Jin used his heart to treat him.

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,080
He is so hard-working.

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,080
This means that Zhu Huai Chen used me.

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,080
He is so heartless.

79
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,080
He is so heartless.

80
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Do you really love him?

81
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Do you really love him?

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
People should be careful.

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
If they are wrong,

84
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
they will be in trouble.

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
You are blind.

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Why are you trying to hurt me?

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Prince Qi didn't love me.

88
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
He didn't cherish me.

89
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
It seems that we are together.

90
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Sit down.

91
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
I have something to tell you.

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,080
I only need you to tell me the truth.

93
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
You can tell me everything.

94
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I can listen to your reason.

95
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,080
If you keep lying to me.

96
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Zhi An.

97
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,080
I was wrong about the past few days.

98
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Don't be angry, okay?

99
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,080
I will tell you everything.

100
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I am not angry.

101
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
I am just a little bit confused.

102
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,080
It seems that the people who were in a relationship with me

103
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
are not you.

104
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
We are close.

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
We are warm and considerate.

106
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
We take care of each other.

107
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
The one I love

108
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
is not the one who is like me.

109
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,080
It is the one who has protected me.

110
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Protected me.

111
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Did you say it clearly?

112
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Prince Qi.

113
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Prince Qi.

114
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Prince Qi.

115
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Prince Qi.
