Episode 1

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't know if my brother will see me.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's the first time I've seen you so confused.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm so lucky to be with you.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry for the sudden appearance of your lover.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please forgive me.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, I won't.

Episode 1

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Good!

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Your Highness, you're not only a good person,

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but also a good person.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not bad at all.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have some feelings for the dance.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How about we take a seat?

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What do you want?

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want to be a good person.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your Highness, you're really good at dancing.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Can you teach me?

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Of course.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What about Roi's?

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What has Roi done?

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
As she got punished,

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
she shouldction the female body.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,080
She's this girl,

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
this isarmize.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Jin Hanien!

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Jin Hanien!

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Where are you going?

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You still want to run, Prince Qi?

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Prince Qi, I've been so loyal to you.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But you still care about me.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Prince Qi, you're still a man this time.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Stop!

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Who?

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's you and Zhu Haichen Ling who killed my life in the north.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're as good as a killer.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're a man of your word.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're the third prince.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're not a scoundrel.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He might not know about this secret.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You have no chance to tell him.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Western Emperor was really killed by Yan.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Speak!

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't be angry, Chen Lang.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's the right thing to do.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Speak!

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I went back to the room last night.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was so tired.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I didn't know anything about the past.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was in a bad condition the day before.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was pregnant last night.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I have no strength in my body.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I only remember that when I was conscious, he was still alive.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't believe that he's really that unlucky.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's drunk and has lost his mind.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's trying to fool me.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Xirou, check it out!

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's this?

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a soul.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's the blood of the North.

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Could it be...?

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's the blood of the North.

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The End
