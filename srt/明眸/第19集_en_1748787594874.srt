1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,420
I will never be alone

2
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,540
Until then

3
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,120
I don't believe I belong to the wrong side

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,720
Let's move

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,040
Let's go

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,800
Let's cross three

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,660
Get in

8
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,700
Get in

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,700
If you have any difficulties, you can tell me.

10
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
But don't lie to me.

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,700
You don't have to know.

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm not letting you down.

13
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Zhen An, I'm your husband.

14
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Why did you recognize me as your brother?

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
I was drunk yesterday.

16
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,700
You're not a ghost.

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
It seems you choose to continue to lie to me.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
But I almost lost my true heart.

19
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,700
It's so unfortunate.

20
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,700
It seems I misunderstood you.

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
I'll accompany you to the doctor.

22
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
If you don't stay and rest,

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
I won't sleep well.

24
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Tonight,

25
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,700
I'll stay and accompany you.

26
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Are you okay?

27
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
I'm fine. I'll come by myself.

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Father, you didn't let me touch you.

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
You're still blaming me?

30
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
No.

31
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,700
You're drunk. Go to sleep.

32
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Father, where are you going?

33
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,700
You've become a woman.

34
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
You're still a man.

35
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
You don't look like me.

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
I can't touch you.

38
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
I can't touch you.

39
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Including me.

40
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
You're drunk.

41
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
Go to sleep.

42
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
Why don't you beg me?

43
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Zhu Huaijie,

44
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
if you have no right to do anything,

45
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,700
I'll take care of you.

46
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,700
What do you want to do now?

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
No matter what you do,

48
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
I'll take care of you.

49
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I'll remember it myself.

50
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
What?

51
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Longyi is in Nanshan?

52
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,700
I'm not sure of Bao Zang's location.

53
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
I just remember

54
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
the Nanshan in Nanyang and the north.

55
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
It's okay.

56
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Send someone immediately.

57
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
We'll go to Nanshan.

58
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Nanshan.

59
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
It's getting dark.

60
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
We'll rest here tonight.

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
We'll search the mountain tomorrow morning.

62
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Yes.

63
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Why are you picking these grass?

64
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
These are golden grass.

65
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
We must be careful.

66
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
We must be careful.

67
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
We must be careful.

68
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,700
We must be careful.

69
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
We must be careful.

70
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
We must be careful.

71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
We must be careful.

72
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Why doesn't Zhu Huaijie know the golden grass?

73
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
In the cave,

74
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,220
he used these grass to

75
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,700
poison the human body.

76
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Who are you?

77
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
How did you know me?

78
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
I...

79
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
We're old friends.

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Anyway, I won't hurt you.

81
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
This is the golden grass.

82
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
It has a poisonous effect.

83
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
There's no medicine on the mountain.

84
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
I'll help you.

85
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
It's getting dark.

86
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
I must find a way to leave

87
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
and go to Princess Shanzhang.

88
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Put this on.

89
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
It's not poisonous.

90
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
I want to go to the convenience store.

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Okay.

92
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
I'll go with you.

93
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Princess.

94
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
You're so kind.

95
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Call me when you're done.

96
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Okay.

97
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
It's so dangerous.

98
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
If you lose,

99
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
you'll be in trouble.

100
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I'll go with you.

101
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
I can't stay here.

102
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
But I really want to thank you, Duan Yurong.

103
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
This...

104
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Who is it?

105
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Is it my husband?

106
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm Huaijin.

107
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
You just got caught by a trap.

108
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
But it's okay now.

109
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Are you following me?

110
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Prince Fei has found it.

111
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
You go first.

112
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
I'll go with you.

113
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
I'll go with you.

114
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
I'll go with you.

115
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
I'll go with you.

116
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
I'll go with you.

117
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Yes.

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I didn't think of following you.

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
But I'm worried about you

120
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
because you're not well.

121
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
So I followed you to see

122
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
that you've gone far away.

123
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
It's too dangerous.

124
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
I'm worried about my husband.

125
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
You're in trouble.

126
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
I'm Sanyi.

127
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
I'm leaving now.

128
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
He can't drink it.

129
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
I might only have

130
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
a chance to contact Uncle Li.

131
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
I'm Sanyi.

132
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
I'm Sanyi.

133
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm Sanyi.

134
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm Sanyi.

135
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm Sanyi.

136
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
I'm Sanyi.

137
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
I'm Sanyi.

138
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
I'm Sanyi.

139
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
I'm Sanyi.

140
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I'm Sanyi.

141
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
I'm Sanyi.

142
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I'm Sanyi.

143
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm Sanyi.

144
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm Sanyi.

145
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
I'm Sanyi.

146
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm Sanyi.

147
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
I'm Sanyi.

148
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
I'm Sanyi.

149
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
I'm Sanyi.

150
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
I'm Sanyi.

151
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I'm Sanyi.

152
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
I'm Sanyi.

153
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm Sanyi.

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,700
I'm Sanyi.

155
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
I'm Sanyi.

156
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
I'm Sanyi.

157
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,700
I'm Sanyi.

158
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm Sanyi.

159
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
I'm Sanyi.
