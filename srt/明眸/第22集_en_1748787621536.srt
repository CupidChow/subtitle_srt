1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Zhiyuan, our misunderstanding has finally been solved.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was wrong.

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I was just thinking about

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
how Chengquan is so loyal to you.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I didn't think that he would hide his feelings.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't worry.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I've killed him.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll avenge Li's death.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Tell me,

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
where's Longyi?

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's dead.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The one who betrayed me must die.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, he won't.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why would he die?

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He must be the one who lied to me.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's wrong?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You won't be moved by him, right?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He lied to me.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I won't be moved by him,

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but you've also lied to me.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, I've already been a part of him.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, I can't trust you anymore.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you really want to avenge Li's death,

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
take me to see the old man.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Otherwise, even if I take Longyi and Xia Huangquan

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to see my parents,

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I won't let them go easily.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Zhiyuan, remember,

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm your only trust member.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mingwu, I'll take you to see the old man.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Zhiyuan.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Zhiyuan.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Third Prince,

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but Li's family is not coming.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Miss,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I finally see you.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Uncle Chen, it's you.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Are you all okay?

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We're all okay.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Third Prince has taken us to a safe place.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, the old man is waiting for revenge for our Li's family.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why did he attack Zhu Huaichen so hard?

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Could it be that

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I've been wondering

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
how the Li's family would be so easily defeated

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
if they had so many people in their family?

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It turns out that there's a spy.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Uncle Chen,

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
why is it you?

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't let you two be together.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Uncle Chen,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I must revenge for Li's family.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But,

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I really don't know the exact location of Longyu's treasure.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You and my father are living and dying.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You must have clues to tell Third Prince, right?

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I...

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't hear your father say it before.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's all my fault.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's all my fault.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't hide anything from Third Prince.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't think about using him to protect your military power.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Although our Li's family is in a wrong place,

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
one day, we'll have to take a rest.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
By then, you're still the main star of our Li's family.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't use the wrong means.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What else did you tell me?

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I didn't.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Third Prince, you must believe me.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I...

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I said I had clues about Longyu's treasure.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I thought Li would treat her daughter as a treasure.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I thought Li Zhi An was the real treasure.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's...

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Forget it.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you marry me,

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will take good care of her.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Zhi An is our Li's mastermind.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You were a manly son.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No matter what, you can't be with her.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But she's lost her mind.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She's insisting on marrying you.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm warning you.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If you don't treat her well,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
my Li's family won't be jealous.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's useless to think you're a royal family.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But you two are close.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You'll find out she's a precious treasure.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I understand.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll try to be her treasure for the rest of my life.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A blind man is a treasure.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Could it be that Longyu's treasure map

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
is Li Zhi An's body?

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Is Zhu Huai Jin really dead?

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How could he die?

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's just like me.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Li Ying can avoid all the threats.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is it because I made her a nuisance?

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Zhi An.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're still up?

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm not.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Who misses you?

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why are you here?

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I know where Longyu's treasure is.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Really? Where is it?

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You don't know?

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Longyu's treasure is on your body.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're Longyu's treasure.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I guess

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Longyu's treasure is on your body.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Where is it?

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where is it?

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Li Zhi An.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Li Zhi An.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Longyu's on your body, right?

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've been looking for Longyu for so long.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Longyu and you can only be mine.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Li Zhi An.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're so generous.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Li Zhi An.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm going to kill you.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Li Zhi An.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Li Zhi An.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Where are you going?

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Longzhi.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sister Zhu Huai.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sister Zhu Huai?

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're not dead.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And you.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Longzhi.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're not dead.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I...

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If I was blind,

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
how could I see this evil person?

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're all lying to me.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Xiao Ji.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Someone's coming.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hua Mei, take her away.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll take you to a place.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't let her be here alone.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hua Mei.

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hua Mei.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Huang Zi Fei.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're finally awake.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Where are you, Hua Mei?

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Where's Zhu Hai Jin?

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is Hua Mei's mother's residence.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hua Mei told me that you're blind.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't believe it.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is great.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Prince Qi...

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Prince Qi is in Zhu Hai Chen's hands.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We have to go to save her.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You go to a place with me first.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Prince Qi told me that

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
if you come here one day,

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
no matter what happens,

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
you'll be in danger.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you come here one day,

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
no matter what happens,

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
you'll be in danger.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He's been trying to

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
control my family's reputation

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
of being killed by the Tu Sha.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Could it be that

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
he did all this

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to avenge me?

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He even

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
protected me

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and wanted me to stay away from him.

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Now he's trying to

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
kill me again.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Why is he so stupid?

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Why didn't I have a father and a mother?

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Sister.

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Sister.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sister.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You guys are still here?

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Your eyes are so beautiful.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm with you.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You're taking back your blood.

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry that Prince Qi

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
has arranged for me.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
In the play,

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
there are two people who are

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
in danger.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm the one who has to take responsibility.

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Zhi An.

196
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This blood-sucking revenge

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
is not good.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is my family's tiger-fist.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No one is in danger.

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The swordsman must obey.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Although Prince Qi

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
saved me and protected me,

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
but Li's family has internal power.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
if I take these soldiers,

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll be punished.

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
if you take this tiger-fist,

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
the key is two things.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Li's family can't be changed.

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
How is Zhu Hai Chen?

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You really didn't think about it.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's not the time to say this.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Zhu Hai Chen controlled Prince Qi.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He wanted your dragon-fist treasure

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
as a lesson.

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
He wanted to let go of people.

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But if Zhu Hai Chen

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
gets the dragon-fist,

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
with his ambition,

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
he will definitely fight back.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If he takes the throne,

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
with his ambition,

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
he will also meet the North.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Then people in the world

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
will be in trouble.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
if Prince Qi is here,

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
he will definitely die.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He won't agree to give you the dragon-fist.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Zhi An.

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Prince Qi can't be saved.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Prince Qi.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Red pig greedy.

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I have no feelings for you.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The same soul is broken.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I want to see you clearly.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Even if the cycle of reincarnation

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
will never change.

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The light is strong.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The snow is more beautiful.

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
My hands are never loose.

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Even if the cycle of reincarnation

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
will never change.

248
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The wind is strong.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The fire is strong.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I will always believe that

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
the summer light will shine.
