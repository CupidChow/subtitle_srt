1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
you

2
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,240
will expose

3
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,120
what

4
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,920
this

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Chi An, it's me!

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Chi An, it's me!

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Father...

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
I just wanted to walk out, but I lost my way.

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,920
My hands... my hands hurt.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
I know. I know. I'll take you to the doctor.

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Li Zhi An is always in danger.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Even if he dies, he'll still be alive.

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,920
And... these safety services are problematic.

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,920
I don't know why Prince Qi believes in them.

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Husband...

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm afraid it hurts. Be gentle.

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Okay.

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
You can't see.

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
I have to let Hua Mei with you.

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
I don't want to see her hurt.

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Okay.

22
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Why did you go in there?

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Why did you go in there?

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,920
I was near. I was so exhausted.

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,920
It's just that the guards are too nervous to do some work.

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
I see.

27
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,920
You're so considerate of the people.

28
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
You're also a good person.

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,920
You're busy with business every day.

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
You should take care of yourself.

31
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Okay.

32
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Zhi An, I'm busy with work today.

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I have something to discuss with you.

34
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Maybe I'll be too busy.

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Husband said that as long as Zhi An can help,

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,920
he'll be fine.

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,920
There's a woman in the north who's not well.

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
She's a vice-president.

39
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,920
She's been working hard in the murder house.

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Zhi An.

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,920
She's been working hard for ten years.

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
But later,

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
she finally found out the evidence of the murder.

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
What made me confused was that

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,920
she obviously had the chance to meet the murderer.

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Why didn't she choose to take care of him?

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Zhi An.

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
If...

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,920
If your family is in danger,

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,920
will you choose to just stay in the bloodbath or stay in the house?

51
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
If it were me,

52
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
I wouldn't have just asked for the murderer.

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
That would be a life-and-death situation.

54
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,920
The family's protection would have been meaningless.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I'll definitely push the murderer's whole plan

56
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,920
to make his true face public.

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Only then can he experience the pain of the living.

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,920
I'll also give my family a full chance.

59
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
He's a justice.

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Of course.

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,920
If you have a wife like him,

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,920
you'll definitely give your wife a justice.

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
What's wrong with him?

64
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
He's looking like a real criminal.

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm... I'm sorry.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Hua Mei! Hua Mei!

68
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
The palace's own emperor

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
is trying to meet the murderer.

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
It's not like he's not here.

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
He's just here to save himself.

72
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Zhi An.

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
My husband.

74
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
You called me?

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
My husband.

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
But you don't feel well?

77
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
It's okay.

78
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm fine now.

79
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
That's good.

80
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,920
According to the time, the western emperor will be here soon.

81
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I wonder what Zhu Huaiji will do with those letters.

82
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Will he send Zhu Huai Chen to the court?

83
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Commander Duan.

84
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,920
I heard that the prince was injured last night.

85
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I think he's recovered.

86
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Please don't worry.

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm fine with the letter that my husband took care of last night.

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
The prince just got here.

89
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
He doesn't know the rules.

90
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
He'll be injured if he goes out of the palace.

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
I came here to tell you that

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
in the prince's mansion,

93
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
you need to be in the court.

94
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,920
You can't go out of the palace at night.

95
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Commander Duan is a great man.

96
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,920
He doesn't look like a legend

97
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,920
but he's not good at making people's hands dirty.

98
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Commander Duan.

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
You did pretend last night.

100
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
You can tell by your look.

101
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
So what?

102
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
That's just my feelings for my husband.

103
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Instead of my husband's idea,

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,920
why don't you go and keep an eye on the prince?

105
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Why are you so stubborn?

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
I was thinking for you.

107
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Maybe you can make a name for yourself.

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Why don't you say something?

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Maybe the prince has rejected you.

110
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Of course not.

111
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I was in the trouble of the prince before.

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
I was the prince's savior.

113
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I remember that it was Duan Yu Rou who saved him

114
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
while he was in the brothel.

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
You guys,

116
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
hurry up and take the prince to the palace.

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,920
The prince will take the prince to the temple in the afternoon.

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Did you hear that?

119
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Yes.

120
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,920
It turns out that the prince saved Duan Yu Rou

121
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
so he was the one who was killed.

122
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,920
So what will happen to the prince's heart

123
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
this time?

124
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
I don't know.

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I don't know.

126
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
I don't know.

127
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I don't know.

128
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
I don't know.

129
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I don't know.

130
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
I don't know.

131
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
I don't know.

132
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
I don't know.

133
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I don't know.

134
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
I don't know.

135
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I don't know.

136
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I don't know.

137
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
I don't know.

138
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I don't know.

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
I don't know.

140
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I don't know.

141
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I don't know.

142
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
I don't know.

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
I don't know.

144
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
I don't know.

145
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I don't know.

146
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
I don't know.

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I don't know.

148
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
I don't know.

149
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I don't know.

150
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I don't know.

151
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
I don't know.

152
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
I don't know.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
I don't know.

154
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I don't know.

155
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
I don't know.

156
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
I don't know.

157
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
I don't know.

158
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
I don't know.

159
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
I don't know.

160
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
I don't know.

161
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
I don't know.

162
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I don't know.

163
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I don't know.

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
I don't know.

165
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I don't know.
