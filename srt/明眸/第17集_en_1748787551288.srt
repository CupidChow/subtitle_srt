Jongbo,

Good job.

27

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
I want to have the hang in there a little.

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
The water is all muddy.

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,940
Let's get a red car now.

32
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,760
Come on, let's go get it.

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,080
Congratulations!

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,580
I'll get you a new car.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,720
We'll find a new car in the future.

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,180
You're awake now.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,840
What's up, meinen?

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,100
These are my pets' confidence thi.

39
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,380
Keep watching and find the new world.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,380
I'm afraid...

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,380
But you have a self-defense system.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
I'll control it with you anytime.

43
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,380
I know.

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,380
So I'll give you the ability to use my self-defense system.

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Mom.

46
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,380
Mom.

47
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,380
Mom.

48
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,380
Mom.

49
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,380
Yingdao.

50
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,380
Hurry up and move.

51
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Kill me.

52
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,380
I killed him.

53
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
I killed so many people.

54
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,380
I'm not worthy of being alive.

55
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Blood and leaves are like a force to the soul.

56
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,380
The one who kills is the force that the heavens and earth cannot remove.

57
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,380
You are just a weapon that can be used to kill people.

58
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
If the heavens and earth have me,

59
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,380
I can kill you for all the power.

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Even if you die, there will be another weapon.

61
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:40,380
This is a water that can be used to make a plant.

62
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,380
It can suppress the force.

63
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:57,380
If there is a day when I lose control again,

64
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,380
you must kill me.

65
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,380
Hurry up and kill me.

66
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
My child.

67
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
Grandpa is leaving.

68
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,380
Grandpa.

69
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
What should I do now?

70
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Lord Yingdao.

71
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,380
The statue of the King of the Ghosts.

72
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,380
My child.

73
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
My child.

74
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
My child.

75
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
My child.

76
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,380
My child.

77
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,380
My child.

78
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
My child.

79
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
My child.

80
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
Lord Yingdao.

81
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Lord Yingdao.

82
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
Lord Yingdao.

83
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
Lord Yingdao.

84
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,380
I don't want you to leave.

85
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Lord Yingdao.

86
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,380
Lingling.

87
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
I won't go to the human world anymore.

88
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
I won't go to the human world anymore.

89
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
Okay?

90
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Lord Yingdao.

91
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,380
My child.

92
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
Lord Yingdao.

93
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Lord Yingdao.

94
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Lord Yingdao.

95
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
My child.

96
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
My child.

97
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,380
My child.

98
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,380
My child.

99
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
My child.

100
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
My child.

101
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
My child.

102
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,380
My child.

103
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,380
My child.

104
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
My child.

105
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
My child.

106
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
My child.

107
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,380
My child.

108
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
My child.

109
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
My child.

110
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,380
My child.

111
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,380
My child.

112
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
My child.

113
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
My child.

114
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
My child.

115
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,380
My child.

116
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
My child.

117
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
My child.

118
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,380
My child.

119
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
My child.

120
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,380
The saddest thing in life.

121
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,380
The two birds with the grass.

122
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,380
Love.

123
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,380
Love.

124
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
Love.

125
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Love.

126
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Love.

127
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
If...

128
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
If one day,

129
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,380
I'm in this world,

130
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,380
you will kill me.

131
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,380
I'm not that capable.

132
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,380
But,

133
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
I have a way.

134
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Love.

135
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,380
Do you hate him?

136
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
I know

137
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,380
he was controlled by Li Qisuo.

138
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,380
He was so naive.

139
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
But,

140
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
he killed my master.

141
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,380
I killed my brother.

142
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Heng was controlled by Chenghuang.

143
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,380
He was so naive.

144
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,380
I had to kill him in the bed.

145
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
He was so naive.

146
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
After I knew the truth,

147
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,380
I was looking for the way to break the law.

148
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,380
I didn't want to be in trouble with my brother.

149
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
I was in this world.

150
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
But I've forgiven you.

151
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
Zhao Yanzhou took my last trip.

152
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
I went back to the sacred stone bowl.

153
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,380
He was buried on the tomb.

154
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
This is not simple magic.

155
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
He had a thousand years of magic power.

156
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Do you have any hidden source?

157
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,380
I don't know.

158
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
I'm not sure.

159
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
I know.

160
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
But,

161
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,380
I don't know.

162
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,380
I don't know.

163
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,380
I want to protect you.

164
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
Sister,

165
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
cry as you like.

166
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,380
I can't cry.

167
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,380
Because I can't see tears.

168
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,380
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,380
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,380
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,380
I'm sorry.

178
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,380
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
I'm sorry.

181
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,380
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,380
Zhu Yan,

185
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
you bastard.

186
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
You haven't learned to control your strength.

187
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
You just run off.

188
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
I...

189
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
You dare to protect me?

190
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
I've learned it.

191
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,380
You're a bastard.

192
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
You...

193
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,380
bought it for me.

194
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,380
I'll cut it for you.

195
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,380
But if you have the will,

197
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,380
I'll always be controlled by you.

198
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
I know.

199
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
That's why I'll give you

200
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
the ability to fight for my will.

201
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,380
How long can you last?

202
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
Just wait.

203
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,380
I'll fight for you.

204
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I'll fight for you.

205
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
I'll fight for you.

206
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
I'll fight for you.

207
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
I'll fight for you.

208
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
I'll fight for you.

209
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,380
I don't know.

210
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
Yong Yuan

211
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
He was so proud of me.

212
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,380
He even gave his weapon to the other person.

213
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
I don't understand.

214
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
He didn't give you a weapon,

215
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,380
but gave you a weapon to fight him.

216
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,380
I don't know.

217
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Where are you going?

218
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,380
Do you hate him?

219
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Of course.

220
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Zhang Yanzhou once gave me a bag of fried lotus root.

221
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
I saw the sun was shining on the mountain.

222
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,380
I almost lost my teeth.

223
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,380
I knew at that time

224
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,380
that not every lotus root was as thin as paper.

225
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,380
The lotus root he gave me was all over the place.

226
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,380
He chose it carefully.

227
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,380
How can a soft lotus root

228
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
be as bad as a demon?

229
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
I'm old.

230
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,380
I'm not very strong.

231
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,380
I hope that this last bit of strength

232
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
can help you.

233
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
I've learned how to use my sword skills.

234
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
I'll kill him myself.

235
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Mr. Zhang,

236
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380
I'm older than you.

237
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
I'm more than happy to have you.

238
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,380
I know you hate Yilan.

239
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Zhang Yanzhou is also a pitiful person.

240
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,380
He's been tortured and tortured these years.

241
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,380
If you don't believe him,

242
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,380
find a chance to see his back.

243
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,380
You understand.

244
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
I can use all my power

245
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
to suppress Zhang Yanzhou's strength.

246
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
But time is limited.

247
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
It's only a month.

248
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
Are you here to kill me?

249
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Do it.

250
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,380
It's time to make our agreement.

251
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
If you don't believe him,

252
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,380
find a chance to see his back.

253
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
You understand.

254
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,380
I'll kill you.

255
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
What's the agreement?

256
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,380
It's my punishment.

257
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,380
I'll regret it.

258
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,380
Even if I die,

259
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,380
I'll still be a traitor.

260
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
You don't need to be so cruel.

261
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
You're a traitor.

262
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,380
I've been a traitor for eight years.

263
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,380
Eight years.

264
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,380
I'll kill Yanzhou every year.

265
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,380
After that,

266
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,380
I'll ask for the money from the Taoyuan Village in Tiandu.

267
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,380
I won't see anyone.

268
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
I won't go back to the King.

269
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Until I get the message from Ying Zhao,

270
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
I'll come out.

271
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,380
You don't kill me?

272
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,380
You think I'm moved by you?

273
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,380
Zhang Yanzhou was killed by fate.

274
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,380
He's innocent.

275
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
He's heartbroken.

276
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,380
You think he's so pitiful?

277
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
I'm sorry.

278
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,380
I'll forgive you

279
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
for being so pitiful.

280
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Really?

281
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
No.

282
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
You're pitiful.

283
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,380
You have a hateful side.

284
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
You should hate me.

285
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
I hate you.

286
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,380
You think you can live

287
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
with my sword?

288
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,380
You can't live with your sacrifice?

289
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,380
Can't you keep the tears of the soul?

290
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,380
Can you use your master's life to protect him?

291
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,380
My father, my brother,

292
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
my brother

293
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,380
can come back to me.

294
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,380
No.

295
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,380
No.

296
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
No.

297
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,380
No.

298
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
No.

299
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
No.

300
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,380
If you want to die now,

301
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,380
and understand all the grudges,

302
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,380
and clear all the blame,

303
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,380
you can't match the tears of the soul,

304
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
the blood of the soul,

305
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,380
and the death of the soul of the Ying Zhaoshan.

306
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
Zhang Yanzhou,

307
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,380
if you really have a heart,

308
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,380
you should do something that can really make up for you.

309
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
When you're back,

310
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I'll tell you the truth.

311
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,380
But the Bai Zilin is gone.

312
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,380
I can't deal with the divorce.

313
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,380
Bai Zilin can be repaired.

314
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,380
You've already prepared for sacrifice.

315
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,380
So you can repair the way for Bai Zilin.

316
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,380
Tell the Ying Lei to go to the Great Wall

317
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,380
and find the demon and the godmother.

318
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Then you can repair Bai Zilin.

319
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,380
Zhou Yanzhou,

320
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,380
the divorce is your destiny.

321
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,380
His goal

322
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,380
is always yours.

323
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,380
You must face it.

324
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
I'll tell you the truth.

325
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,380
I'll tell you the truth.

326
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
I'll tell you the truth.

327
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
I'll tell you the truth.

328
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,380
I'll tell you the truth.

329
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,380
I'll tell you the truth.

330
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
I'll tell you the truth.

331
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,380
I'll tell you the truth.

332
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
I'll tell you the truth.

333
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
I'll tell you the truth.

334
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,380
I'll tell you the truth.

335
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
I'll tell you the truth.

336
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,380
I'll tell you the truth.

337
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,380
I'll tell you the truth.

338
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,380
I'll tell you the truth.

339
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,380
I'll tell you the truth.

340
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
I'll tell you the truth.

341
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
I'll tell you the truth.

342
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,380
I'll tell you the truth.

343
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,380
I'll tell you the truth.

344
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,380
I'll tell you the truth.

345
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,380
The beautiful girl in the water

346
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,380
is her.

347
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Her eyes are beautiful,

348
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
but her fingers are long,

349
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,380
and her eyes are not.

350
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
Yinglei,

351
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
stop.

352
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,380
Don't talk to me again.

353
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,380
I hate this place.

354
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,380
I'm so mad.

355
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,380
I'm so mad.

356
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,380
I'd rather die here.

357
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
My dear,

358
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
it's not scary to die.

359
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,380
It's not the end of everything.

360
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,380
Don't talk about death.

361
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,380
It's good to die in the wrong way.

362
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
Grandpa,

363
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,380
I don't want to live like I'm dead.

364
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
I like the world.

365
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,380
I like the things here.

366
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
I like the village.

367
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,380
I like the beauty.

368
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
I like to be a god.

369
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
I like to be an ordinary person.

370
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,380
Grandpa gave Kunlun to me.

371
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,380
But I don't regret

372
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,380
the power of the will to sacrifice.

373
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,380
It's the glory of the mountain.

374
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
But grandpa

375
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
also respect your decision.

376
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
You can be a god,

377
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,380
or an ordinary person.

378
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,380
There are many monsters in the world.

379
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,380
The last word in the middle of life

380
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,380
is simple.

381
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,380
Three words.

382
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,380
There are many choices.

383
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,380
Grandpa,

384
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
I can't let you know

385
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,380
the glory and pride of the mountain.

386
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Take care of yourself.

388
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
If you have any trouble,

389
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
go back to Kunlun Mountain

390
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,380
and see grandpa.

391
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,380
I want to go back to the village.

392
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
You're old.

393
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
You can go by yourself

394
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
on the way to the future.

395
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,380
I know the way.

396
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
The water is clear.

397
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
It's her.

398
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
It's her.

399
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Her voice is never sad.

400
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:49,380
Her bones are only my way.

401
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Yilai,

402
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
I don't know how to cook.

403
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
I just took some fruits.

404
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,380
I just tasted a sweet one.

405
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Thank you, Xiaoqiu.

406
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
You're welcome.

407
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,380
Xiaoqiu's fruit.

408
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
Xiaoqiu, do you want to try it?

409
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
I gave it to you.

410
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
Eat it.

411
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
The fruit is so high.

412
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
It's so high.

413
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,380
It's so high.

414
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
It must have been for a lot of effort.

415
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
When I was a kid,

416
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
the fruit was so high.

417
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,380
It was so hard

418
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
to get it.

419
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Now it's not here.

420
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,380
It's not here.

421
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,380
It's not here.

422
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
Xiaoqiu,

423
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,380
it's not here.

424
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,380
I don't have a grandfather.

425
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
I don't have a family.

426
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,380
After my father passed away,

427
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,380
I lost all my family.

428
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
Lord Xiaozhu,

429
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,380
your heart must be hurt.

430
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,380
My brother told me

431
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,380
that time is hard.

432
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,380
It can make people feel hurt.

433
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
But if there is a place

434
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
that is hurt and damaged,

435
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,380
it will be tough and strong.

436
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
At that time,

437
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
I held my brother's hand

438
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
and said,

439
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
I know this is a knot.

440
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,380
Brother Teng told me

441
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
that the place he said was not a knot.

442
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,380
The place I said was not a knot,

443
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,380
but a heart.

444
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Brother Teng,

445
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
please look at your son,

446
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,380
let's see the whole world.

447
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
Abancurinfall,

448
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,380
Teng'an Aga,

449
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,380
he spent all his life

450
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,380
with this girl.

451
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,380
Love you

452
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,260
You won't say,

453
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:20,620
있다

454
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,180
Why are you laughing so much?

455
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,780
I'll burn my whole body and body with incense.

456
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Okay.

457
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,660
Primarily.

458
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,660
Look.

459
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,460
Pei money Лю.

460
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,940
Take a look.

461
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
I can't stand it.

462
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,620
If I fall into the cliff,

463
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,620
I can only chase after the secret tentacle.

464
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
That's when

465
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
we'll want a tree.

466
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
In the past,

467
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,620
even a cloud could help us.

468
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,620
You helped me find out the truth behind Ah Heng's murder.

469
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
To me,

470
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,620
it's like giving a crisis to temporarily pass on the past.

471
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,620
And you

472
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
are Zhao Yanzhou's uncle, He Yu.

473
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
I'm sorry.

474
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
It's okay.

475
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
I can't get rid of someone

476
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
who is destined to fall.

477
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,620
I can't forgive him,

478
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,620
but I can't hate him either.

479
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
I can only hate myself.

480
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
If one day,

481
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I hide a big secret like Zhao Yanzhou,

482
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
will you hate me?

483
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
You won't.

484
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
I'll do it.

485
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
Congratulations,

486
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,620
you successfully destroyed Bai Ze.

487
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,620
Next,

488
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,620
we'll wait for Zhao Yanzhou's spy.

489
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
I think we can't complete the mission.

490
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Mr. Lan's great-grandfather,

491
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,620
you must succeed.

492
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
I'm so hungry.

493
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,620
I should have left more fruits yesterday.

494
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Brother Xiao Shu.

495
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,620
I brought you something to eat.

496
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,620
Yonglei said

497
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,620
this is a great food.

498
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,620
It's for you.

499
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
Are you still angry?

500
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,620
I'm not a little person who is suspected

501
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,620
of being respected by the private family.

502
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,620
I'm really angry.

503
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
Brother Xiao Shu,

504
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
do you think I respect you?

505
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
I don't think so.

506
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
I'm a red-banded man.

507
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Eat it.

508
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Yonglei said

509
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,620
it's a kind of plant that grows in the West Sea.

510
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,620
It's eaten up and never gets hungry.

511
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,620
I'm hungry.

512
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,620
Come on, eat something.

513
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,620
I'm worried that Bai Ze is hungry.

514
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,620
I've made some jade beans.

515
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,620
Try it.

516
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,620
You...

517
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
Didn't you ask us to eat jade fish?

518
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Just eat it with your hands.

519
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,620
It's worth it.

520
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
It's okay.

521
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Brother Xiao Shu, I'll be in the middle of the night.

522
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
Shut up.

523
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
Okay.

524
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
I'm hungry.

525
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
I'm hungry.

526
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
I'm hungry.

527
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,620
I'm hungry.

528
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,620
I'm hungry.

529
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,620
I'm hungry.

530
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,620
I'm hungry.

531
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,620
I'm hungry.

532
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
I'm hungry.

533
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,620
I'm hungry.

534
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,620
I'm hungry.

535
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,620
I'm hungry.

536
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,620
I'm hungry.

537
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,620
I'm hungry.

538
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,620
I'm hungry.

539
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,620
My lady.

540
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
It seems that you've made a choice.

541
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
Little Shanshan,

542
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I didn't expect you to be so good at riding.

543
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,620
You look like a model today.

544
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,620
You look a little kind.

545
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
Is that so?

546
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,620
This is your first compliment.

547
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
I've decided to stay here.

548
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
To guard Kunlun.

549
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
To remember my grandfather's misdemeanor.

550
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,620
To use my little Shanshan's face to touch here.

551
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
To guard Kunlun's family.

552
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
You want to stay here?

553
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
Yes.

554
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
I won't go with you to Dahua.

555
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,620
Everyone,

556
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
we have a chance.

557
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
I will work hard to be a Shanshan.

558
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Let me be proud of my grandfather.

559
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,620
Your grandfather

560
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,620
has always been proud of you.

561
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,620
Yinglei,

562
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,620
take care of yourself.

563
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,620
Okay.

564
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,620
This.

565
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620
This.

566
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,620
This is for you.

567
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,620
The road is long.

568
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
I hope you can take a photo of the scene.

569
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
You will be running away from death.

570
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,620
Take care.

571
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,620
Remember to cook the best food for me next time.

572
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,620
I'm still a little bit used to it.

573
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,620
Indeed.

574
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,620
This dress,

575
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,620
I'm really not used to it.

576
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,620
I feel like I can keep my beard.

577
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,620
Otherwise, I would wear your clothes like a child.

578
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,620
I'm not used to it.

579
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,620
I'm not used to it.

580
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,620
Although you are a little bit too much,

581
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,620
you are annoying.

582
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,620
Forget it.

583
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,620
At least,

584
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,620
when Brother Xiao Zhuo is not around,

585
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,620
I'm afraid

586
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,620
I can still hold you,

587
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,620
hold you,

588
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,620
hold you.

589
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,620
Then I'll give you 100 yuan.

590
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
If you are still afraid,

591
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,620
you can still make it.

592
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,620
I'll be by your side with you.

593
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
I don't want that.

594
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620
There is a saying in our world,

595
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
the word of the flower is the word of the flower.

596
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,620
I don't want to be a person who is very lucky.

597
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,620
Xiaojiu,

598
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,620
you will definitely become

599
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,620
the best doctor in the world.

600
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,620
Come on.

601
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,620
I will do my best.

602
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,620
I will miss you.

603
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620
Hu Yitang.

604
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,620
I will see you again.

605
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,620
I will see you again.

606
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
I will see you again.

607
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,620
I will see you again.
