00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 21

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,840
I am sorry, but don't forget this

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,340
why we have first date just this past day.

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,340
You took me away from the fire.

34
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,340
I got a chance to expand the world.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,340
What's so good about the chaos in the world?

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,340
Don't come.

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,340
And every time you come to the human world,

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
you have to cover up for such a place.

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,340
It's so annoying.

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,340
Look.

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,340
What is this?

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,340
What's this?

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
It looks so good.

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,340
This is not a hairpin.

45
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Go back.

46
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,340
It's not fun.

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,340
How fun is this?

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,340
Where do you get these?

49
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,340
Who cares?

50
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
This is a windmill.

51
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
It will turn when the wind blows.

52
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
It's so powerful.

53
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,340
I'm so happy.

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
It's so annoying.

55
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,340
It's because of the wind.

56
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
It's so noisy.

57
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,340
We can't drink anything.

58
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
So they are so smart.

59
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,340
They can think of this method

60
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
without magic.

61
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Why do you always help human beings?

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
Why?

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
Okay.

64
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,340
The world is divided.

65
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
The world is divided.

66
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
So humans will do magic.

67
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
els were Mozart.

68
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,340
They wanted the Dow caniff to touch.

69
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Then the分享 was inside.

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
Ironically,

71
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,340
soを切ぐです。

72
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
You have to first metalh Itsuki.

73
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Only then.

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
Stories should Network 10 nature to

75
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
the future world,

76
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
so that

77
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,820
human beings can be

78
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,140
or actually just the knife and knife?

79
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,780
Lilydride,

80
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,120
have you ever thought that

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,280
once the king was alone

82
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,740
the far-off demon

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,760
couldn't remain in human form.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,140
He needs to escape away from the world Yoo,

85
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,680
the coming of the Frank.

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,140
He will hit the wall,

87
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,140
Once the Star Formation is done, it will be useless.

88
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,140
Zhao Yanzhou, your day is coming.

89
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,140
I know.

90
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,140
You won't die.

91
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,140
I won't die than you.

92
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
Okay.

93
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Please don't talk nonsense.

94
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
Let me die first.

95
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Yinglei,

96
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
please do it tomorrow.

97
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,140
The future of the Great Red is up to you.

98
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,140
I will definitely go to the Great Red.

99
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,140
I will go to the Great Red.

100
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,140
I will definitely go to the Great Red.

101
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,140
But I still don't believe

102
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,140
that Zhu Yin and my grandfather have been together for so many years.

103
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Why did he...

104
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
I saw Zhu Yin

105
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,140
and his power that was surrounding me.

106
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
I know someone better than me

107
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
about this power.

108
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Lord Xiao Zhuo,

109
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,140
I will leave Yinglei's safety to you.

110
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
But remember,

111
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,140
don't come too early.

112
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
I still want to know

113
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,140
what the hell they are up to.

114
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,140
Then how do I judge whether I am early or not?

115
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,140
Listen to me.

116
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
Yinglei, go!

117
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
Lord Xiao Zhuo, be careful.

118
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,140
Grandpa!

119
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
I'm coming!

120
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
Li Zhen,

121
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,140
I will do my best to prove my innocence!

122
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,140
I will definitely do my best to prove my innocence!

123
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
Zhu Yin,

124
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,140
I have to admit that I can only admit my guilt.

125
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
Don't forget

126
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,140
that I have a God here.

127
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,140
It's really hard to resist.

128
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,140
I can't even resist.

129
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,140
I can't even resist.

130
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,140
This is not the time to be a hero.

131
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
I'm just trying to protect myself.

132
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
I can't resist.

133
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
I can't even resist.

134
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,140
I can't even resist.

135
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,140
I can't even resist.

136
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
I can't even resist.

137
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
I can't even resist.

138
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
Lord Xiao Zhu, you can't resist.

139
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,140
I can't even resist.

140
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
I can't even resist.

141
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,140
I can't even resist.

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
I can't even resist.

145
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,140
I can't even resist.

146
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
I can't even resist.

I can't even resist.

149
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,140
I can't even resist.

150
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I can't even resist.

153
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,140
I can't even resist.

154
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,140
Shanggu Long Shen.

155
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Open your eyes and close your eyes.

156
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,140
Looks like you finally realized it.

157
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,140
I thought that you have lost a thousand times.

158
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Why didn't you figure it out?

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,820
If you only knew where that waterfall is,

160
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,640
it could light way beyond the peaceful enlightened world

161
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
and give 8 quality landscape to było.

162
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,640
So that you may get to listen to the events before nightfall.

163
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,640
Look.

164
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,540

169
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,100
Wait a moment

I'm over there

171
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,640
OK

172
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,620
Ok

173
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,280
It's not easy

174
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Ready, right?

175
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
I don't know.

176
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
If Gao Xiao Yang asks what they're doing,

177
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
you'll be in danger.

178
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
Xiao Jiu.

179
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Don't shoot!

180
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Then you'll be beaten.

181
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Xiao Yan.

182
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Xiao Yan.

183
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Xiao Yan.

184
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Chen Yuezhao.

He will be punished every day.

361
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
But for him, who is free to me,

362
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,360
he might be more miserable than the Soul-Dragging Puppet.

363

Long flowers

433
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Thousands of flowers

434
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Time flows

435
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Like a war

436
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,360
No need to cry

437
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,360
The wind blows

438
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,360
What does it mean?

439
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,360
The wind blows

440
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,360
The wind blows

441
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:57,360
The wind blows

442
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,360
The wind blows

443
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,360
The wind blows

444
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:18,360
The wind blows

445
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:26,360
The wind blows

446
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,360
The wind blows

447
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,360
If one day you find out that I did something that I can't forgive

448
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
What will you do?

449
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Most of the time, it's all about the forgiveness

450
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,360
It's because I can't understand why the other person did this

451
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
That's why I can't be sure

452
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
If you're willing to tell me the reason

453
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
Maybe I'll understand you

454
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,360
If Zhao Yuan Zhao really killed Master Wen Xiao

455
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Why didn't you say it before?

456
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,360
If you really want to know the truth

457
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
What else do you want?

458
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,360
If you hate Zhao Yuan Zhao

459
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,360
You can't be with him anymore

460
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Then Bai Ze Ling will never be able to heal

461
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Then I will never be able to destroy him

462
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
If you want to destroy Bai Ze Ling

463
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,360
You need to use your power to heal the world

464
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
When blood moon appears

465
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,360
You need to use your power to heal the world

466
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,360
But now Bai Ze Ling is divided

467
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
And he is in the hands of two people

468
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
What should we do?

469
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,360
We need to let Bai Ze Ling's two people

470
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Have the same heart

471
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Why do you know so much?

472
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
I'll tell you the truth

473
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
I'll tell you

474
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Do you know where Bai Ze Ling is?

475
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Bai Ze Ling is in the heart of the world

476
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
On you

477
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
You can't be healed

478
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
What is the reason?

479
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,360
The reason is in heaven, in the palace, in the law

480
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
I only know the reason in my heart

481
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Thank you

482
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,760
Finally, they didn't think that i suffered a loss, but they'll still keep the captain's cause

484

491
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:32,620
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

492
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:42,620
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

493
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:52,620
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

494
00:36:52,620 --> 00:37:02,620
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

527

538
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,380
Is it powerful enough?

539
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,780
I promise it.

540
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,780
Are you sure?

00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Zhao Yanzhou...

546
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,580
