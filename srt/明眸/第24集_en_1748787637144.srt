1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,040
Father!

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,080
Do not grudge against me O二

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,840
Father

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,960
O

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,640
Dad

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,040
Dad

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,640
Dad

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,160
Come up here

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,240
Don't work

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,280
We can't enter the palace.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,360
Isn't that Miss?

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,040
Yes.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,840
She's standing in front of the Imperial Palace of South Liang.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,200
What's going on?

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,440
Don't be fooled by this woman.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,840
She's been captured by the Imperial Emperor of South Liang.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
The Great Chou Yun of the Qilin Family is in danger.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,840
Now she's going to arrest us.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,840
We only have to follow Zhu Huai Chen to kill the Imperial Palace of South Liang.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,240
Let her be the emperor.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Then we'll go to the imperial palace and avenge the soldiers.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,440
You can't say.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,040
Zhu Huai Chen,

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,640
how can I have the chance to kill my family?

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
It turns out to be the spy.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
What did I say?

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Do you recognize Li Jia Hu Hu?

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,240
No.

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,640
That's impossible.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,440
That's impossible!

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
My father is still alive.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,640
It's a deal.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,240
Zhu Huai Chen,

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
you did it!

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Brothers,

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,240
pull out the sword and kill this woman!

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Kill!

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
Li Jia Jun, listen to me!

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,640
Zhu Huai Chen,

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
kill all of my family members!

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,040
Kill all of them!

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,240
Kill!

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
Zhu Huai Chen,

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,840
you can't escape now.

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,640
Today is your death anniversary.

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,240
My biggest advantage is that you don't have to die!

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
My father is still alive.

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,640
She didn't even touch me.

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Li Jia Jun,

65
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
don't be afraid.

66
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,260
You know everything from the lie about you.

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,920
Christopa is towards me.

68
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:44,420
You think I cannotカ whose words alreadySi Tu's words.

69
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,700
Phoenix, how do you feel?

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,700
Lao Zi,

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,240
how do do I feel of you?

72
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,580
You will disappear in the former world.

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,280
Nyon.

74
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Nyon.

75
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,300
Answer me.

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,980
Who is your father?

77
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,460
I am Tzu's mother.

78
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,820
Tong Chuan sees me.

79
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,320
In your sleepers as well.

80
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
My father is in Twins' army.

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,420
He surprised Ge謝謝奶奶.

82
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,020
Look, I really want to go inside.

83
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,980
This is your son.

84
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,900
See.

85
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Prepare to seal the throne as the crown prince.

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,900
The throne is the emperor of the south.

87
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,900
In the future, you will surely conquer the world and conquer the north.

88
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,900
And you must die.

89
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,900
I have sent people to the palace where you were with your parents.

90
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,900
You are always in the palace.

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,900
I will personally serve you.

92
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,900
With this wine, you can become the crown prince.

93
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,900
And your parents can also live.

94
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
Don't worry.

95
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,900
I will bury you in the name of the empress.

96
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
You won't do that.

97
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Why lie to me?

98
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Are you afraid that I will be a ghost and kill you because I am not willing to?

99
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,900
If so, are you afraid of the ghost of Zhu Huai Chen's mother?

100
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
How do you know?

101
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,900
You are so ambitious for your own imperial power.

102
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,900
You designed your own people to force your son to be a wife.

103
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
You have served your own sister.

104
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,900
You are so desperate and stubborn.

105
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,900
You even hope that the imperial power you have built will be stable.

106
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,900
You are really a man of wisdom.

107
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
You are a man of death.

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,900
You are a man of the world.

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
How dare you!

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Come here!

111
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,900
Come here!

112
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
Do you feel very sad?

113
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Are you surprised that I didn't get the right idea?

114
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,900
You are the one who is the most capable and brave.

115
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
How can you be so kind?

116
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Don't you think the fragrance in the incense is special?

117
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
You poisoned me!

118
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,900
You only know to give up your life.

119
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,900
I, Zhu Huai Yu, bow to father.

120
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Father should not remember the maid who gave birth to me.

121
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
Her name is Yan Gu.

122
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,900
She wanted to take good care of her sister in the palace.

123
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,900
But I didn't expect you to be the one who planted the dragon seed.

124
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
After mother gave birth to me,

125
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,900
I was troubled and difficult to recover.

126
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Fortunately, the emperor asked me to come to the world to learn and teach me to study.

127
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Today, father conferred me as the crown prince.

128
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,900
After I got the throne, I will definitely return to my mother and visit the palace.

129
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
I will be with the empress dowager.

130
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,900
Father, you should be at ease and be a crown prince.

131
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Li Wen!

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
You have calculated your life.

133
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
You should also rest.

134
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Brother.

135
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
I will leave it to you.

136
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Alright?

137
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
There are no more in char my eyes

138
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Looking forward to my current life

139
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
I'm willing to be safe

140
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
I'm willing to be safe

141
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
I'm willing to be safe

142
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm willing to be safe

143
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm willing to be safe

144
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
I'm willing to be safe

145
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm willing to be safe

146
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm willing to be safe

147
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm willing to be safe

148
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
I'm willing to be safe

149
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
I'm willing to be safe

150
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
I'm willing to be safe

151
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
I'm willing to be safe

152
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
I'm willing to be safe

153
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,900
The light is gone

154
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
The snow is falling

155
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,900
My hands are never loose

156
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,900
Even if the wheel is broken

157
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Even if the wheel is broken

158
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
The wind is blowing slowly

159
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
The firefly is flying

160
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
I will always believe

161
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,900
The summer light is shining

162
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
I will always believe

163
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
The summer light is shining

164
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
I will always believe

165
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
The summer light is shining

166
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
I will always believe

167
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
The summer light is shining

168
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
I will always believe

169
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
The summer light is shining

170
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
I will always believe

171
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
The summer light is shining

172
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
I will always believe

173
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
The summer light is shining

174
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
I will always believe

175
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
The summer light is shining
