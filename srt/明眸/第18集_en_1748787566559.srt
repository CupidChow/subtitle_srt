1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,340
The Great Saeran

2
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,980
Bobby and Peter are no more

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,100
WWET has just been announced

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,840
Wow

5
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,380
Tr prices are being adjusted

6
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
Jesus

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where is Li Chen?

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,520
Where is Li Chen?

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
Chen!

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Li Chen!

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Young Master, what are you doing?

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
I'm going to kill you!

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Catch!

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Where are you?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're drunk.

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
What's wrong?

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,880
Come on, let's go back and rest.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're not going to kill me?

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You want to kill me?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Young Master, you can't.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not a weak and weak person.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You said you love me.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now you're trying to fight me because of the dragon.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If my husband has been so mean to me,

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
he will be so angry with me.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not going to kill you.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not going to kill you.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can't do anything to me.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you're angry with me,

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll be angry with you too.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Today, I'll kill you.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll kill you.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're going to kill me?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Zhu Huijie!

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Did you fall in love with him?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Brother, you're drunk.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If this is the case,

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if it's the father and the people,

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm afraid it's not good.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Come on!

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Send Brother back.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Chen.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Chen.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you for your help.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I won't let this go.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Please contact my family

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and discuss the matter.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are you okay?

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you okay?

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The medical treatment for the patient is very effective.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's okay.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hua Mei.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Help me go back.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're touched by my woman.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Zhu Huijie.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I must be dead.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Brother.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Brother!

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Brother!

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Brother!

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Brother!

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Brother!

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother!

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Brother!

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Senior Fendou.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Catch the assassin.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The assassin just now

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
is Zhu Huijie.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He killed Zhu Huijie.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sister.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Where is the third prince?

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Zhu Huijie is dead.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There was an assassin

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
who took away the third prince's hand.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is he getting married for me?

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're useless.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're useless.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You must find that assassin

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and get him to the grave.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Chen.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't be angry.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've found the most powerful

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
man in this world.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I've made a silver ring for you.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
As long as you wear it,

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you can have no grudge with the commoners.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can also hurt people without a reason.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This time,

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
maybe you'll be blessed.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm such a good kid.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Every time,

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you're so stubborn

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and dare to lie to me.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This time, you dare to lie to me?

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Maybe

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you're also the assassin's accomplice!

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Chen.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Forgive me.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm not you.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How could you think of me like this?

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't forget

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
your real son.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Calm down, prince.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Chi Yu will investigate the truth as soon as possible.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Get lost!

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I know.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I know.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I know.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I won't let you get hurt again.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I know.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why did Zhong Huaijin

119
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
blow out the candles?

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Does he know

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that the last time

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
he was hit by a rock

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and caused a fire?

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Did he also get reborn?

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I know.

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I know.
