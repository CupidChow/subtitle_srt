[My Wife is A Thief]

[Episode 4]

4
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,470
How do I play the next one?

5
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,990
What comes next?

6
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,270
Why did she stop?

7
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,780
Why did she stop playing?

8
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,270
What's going on?

9
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,470
What happened?

10
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,550
Why did she stop?

11
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,190
I broke the string

12
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,720
and changed it afterwards.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,070
Could she tell?

14
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,470
What should I do?

15
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,210
That was great!

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,790
The music is echoing around the roof beams unceasingly.

17
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,750
Miss Zhen indeed possesses profound musical skills,

18
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,480
and lives up to her reputation.

19
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,850
Even if she's Duke Su's daughter,

20
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,460
there's no need to flatter her to this extent.

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,790
Exactly.

22
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,380
She's lying through her teeth.

23
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,590
Zhen.

24
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,790
Play.

25
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,329
Should I just say I don't know how to play?

26
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,550
No.

27
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,590
Wouldn't I be openly admitting that I'm a fake?

28
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,430
Why don't I play badly

29
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,770
and leave the problem to Madam Gongyang?

30
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,920
No.

31
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,990
I can't use the same method twice.

32
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,080
I wish I could find a hole in the ground and crawl into it.

33
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,470
Honey,

34
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,660
I'll tune it for you.

35
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,870
Old Madam.

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,090
Young Master came back from the administrative office.

37
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,680
Madam Gongyang, I wonder why

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,870
you brought this out-of-tune thing

39
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,590
to my residence?

40
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,140
I... I...

41
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,630
My wife hasn't played anything

42
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,589
and yet you said that the music is echoing around the roof beams.

43
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,870
Did you want my wife to take this

44
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,310
and ruin my reputation?

45
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,800
I definitely didn't mean it like that.

46
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,390
Since you gifted us this instrument

47
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,920
to celebrate our marriage,

48
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,640
I don't want to spoil the fun.

49
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,450
We'll play an evening song

50
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,450
as a return gift.

51
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,390
Okay.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,260
We agreed on this rule.

53
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,590
To maintain our image as a couple when we're around other people.

♫I'll land on your heart even if I have to keep circling♫

90

Muchen and Zhen are really a good-looking couple.

91
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,290
Look at them sitting there,

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,240
it's as if they walked out of a painting.

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,960
That was great!

104
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,670
Great!

105
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,060
I didn't expect that

106
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,190
an untuned instrument

107
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,630
could produce

108
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,740
such a unique melody.

109
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,070
Exactly.

110
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,870
The evening song

111
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,000
not only evoked the beauty of the flowers and the full moon,

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,460
but also captured the harmony of the couple.

113
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,670
Madam Gongyang.

114
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,670
What do you think?

115
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,590
I'm happy to see that Chen and Zhen

116
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,340
are so well-matched.

117
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,900
Sister Xu,

118
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,820
you seem to be in a good mood.

119
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,430
You must be very lucky.

120
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,880
It's rare that we got together today.

121
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,230
My hands are itching.

122
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,990
Why don't we play two rounds,

123
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,990
and get some luck from Xu's Mansion?

124
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,820
Sure.

125
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,470
Yeah.

126
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,310
It's been a while.

127
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,640
Yes, my hands are itchy.

128
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,470
Sister Xu, play your hand.

129
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,830
Come on.

130
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,309
Don't rush me.

131
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,630
Mrs. Xu, play your hand.

132
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,190
Wait.

133
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,750
Tea.

134
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,590
Does mother have a grudge against mahjong?

135
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,390
No.

136
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,350
Family scandal.

137
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,870
6 Circles.

138
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,790
I win!

139
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,440
Wait.

140
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,860
My Pearl and Jade give me three dragon tiles,

141
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,170
so it's double the pot.

142
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,510
Madam Gongyang.

143
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,630
You are so lucky.

144
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,280
Thanks to my lucky bracelet.

145
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,190
I've never lost with it.

146
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,190
She's lost five rounds.

147
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,150
How long will this take?

148
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,430
3 Circles.

149
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,570
Do you want to take it?

150
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,790
Don't rush me. Wait.

151
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,050
How much is my husband's monthly salary?

152
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,990
She's losing almost 100 taels.

153
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,970
Look at Madam Gongyang's demeanor,

154
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,760
Old Madam can't refuse just like that.

155
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,110
Sister Xu,

156
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,120
it's been so long since we last played.

157
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,590
Yes.

158
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,720
No one is allowed to leave before dark.

159
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,630
Madams,

160
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,170
would you like some cakes?

161
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,040
-No, thanks.
-We don’t need that, we're playing.

162
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,870
Mother.

163
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,510
I think you must be tired after a long day.

164
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,630
How about I play a few rounds for you?

165
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,290
Zhen, you're so considerate.

166
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,030
It's just that I haven't seen them

167
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,050
and played with them for a long time.

168
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,390
I don't think it's good to leave now.

169
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,270
How about this?

170
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,470
I'll sit next to you and give you advice?

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,430
Is that appropriate?

172
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,070
Right?

173
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,430
Mother,

174
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,390
I'm not good at playing mahjong.

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,790
If I sit next to you,

176
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,550
I can only be a lousy advisor.

177
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,150
Let her sit.

178
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,810
It's rare for someone to be so filial.

179
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,640
Sit.

180
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:23,910
Come on.

181
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,550
Come on.

182
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,990
Go.

183
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,800
Go to the side.

184
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,510
Hurry up.

185
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,830
Come, Zhen.

186
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,550
Sit here.

187
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,110
Okay.

188
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,630
This one.

189
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,230
This one.

190
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,950
Play this one.

191
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,680
Nine Characters.

192
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,030
Miss Su is so filial.

193
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,040
Six Characters.

194
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,800
Six Characters.

195
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,320
Four Dots.

196
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,140
Take that one.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,980
I won!

198
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,430
I drew the winning tile.

199
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,390
Pay up.

200
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,190
Hurry up.

201
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,790
Mrs. Xu.

202
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,980
-You finally won.
-You’re so lucky.

203
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,310
You are so lucky.

204
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,070
Mrs. Xu,

205
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,820
your luck changed.

206
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,450
Come on.

207
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,810
Well,

208
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,290
Zhen plays mahjong in Su's Mansion too?

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Not very often.

210
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,370
I'm just lucky.

211
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,700
You sure are lucky then.

212
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,320
Yes.

213
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,670
You guys let me win.

214
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,490
That's what we should do.

215
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Four Bamboos.

216
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,190
I drew the winning tile!

217
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,360
I won!

218
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,670
Pay up.

219
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,710
Another round?

220
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,190
Yes.

221
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,030
Sister Xu, your luck has really changed.

222
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,750
Come on.

223
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,620
Give it to me.

224
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,230
Once Zhen sat next to you,

225
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,110
your luck started to change.

226
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,240
This is great.

227
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,060
I drew the winning tile, I won.

228
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,790
This...

229
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,780
I won!

230
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,520
Three dragon tiles.

231
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,550
-Pay up.
-You won again.

232
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,150
Here.

233
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,190
You're amazing.

234
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,950
I won.

235
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,550
Thirteen Orphans.

236
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,150
Sister Xu is so lucky.

237
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,870
Yes.

238
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,190
I lost all my money.

239
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm almost out, too.

240
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,110
Servants.

241
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,870
Yes, Your Ladyship.

242
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,930
Where is the money?

243
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,070
Your Ladyship,

244
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,830
that's all we brought today.

245
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,030
Well,

246
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,510
let's end it here.

247
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,470
Let's go eat.

248
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,190
Let's go.

249
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,190
No way.

250
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,710
You think I don't have money?

251
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,310
I'll use this.

252
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,950
Madam Gongyang.

253
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,950
Your jewellery

254
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,070
is all pretty expensive.

255
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,150
We don't have anything to offer you.

256
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,870
Yes.

257
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,600
Let's call it a day.

258
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,080
Let's end it.

259
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,870
It's okay.

260
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,510
Madam Gongyang.

261
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,500
If you really want to play,

262
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,100
everything on your arm is too expensive.

263
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,300
That bracelet looks nice.

264
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,480
It's lucky,

265
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,110
but it should only be worth 10 taels.

266
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,970
Why don't you bet on that?

267
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,390
How can I bet on this bracelet?

268
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,670
This is my lucky bracelet.

269
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,030
Well...

270
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,200
Why don't we go eat then?

271
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,910
Let's eat.

272
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,790
Let's go.

273
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,630
Let's go.

274
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,350
Let's go.

275
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,980
Wait!

276
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,910
Wait, wait.

277
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,640
I'll put it down.

278
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,990
Is this bracelet too bright for me?

279
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,120
No.

280
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,560
It suits you perfectly.

281
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,630
Look at you guys. What's the rush?

282
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,450
You're leaving without eating,

283
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,400
Madam Gongyang.

284
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,280
I'm not eating.

285
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,530
My chest hurts a little.

286
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,200
Go home and have a good rest then.

287
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
Let's play again next time.

288
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,290
We'll have a good time.

289
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:34,200
[Live with integrity and purity]

290
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,900
We're leaving.

291
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,270
See you, Mrs. Xu.

292
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,740
Goodbye, Madam Gongyang.

293
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,350
Don't bring loose taels next time.

294
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,440
Notes will do.

295
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,790
I don't know what's wrong with my luck today.

296
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,670
Yeah.

297
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,310
238 taels.

298
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,150
How much?

299
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,270
238.

300
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,790
Zhen.

301
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,590
You really helped Mother

302
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,850
let out my anger today.

303
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,350
You won all these.

304
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,230
Take them.

305
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,470
No way.

306
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,590
This is too much.

307
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,120
Mother should be in charge of the money at home.

308
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,910
Take them.

309
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,680
Am I someone who covets my daughter-in-law's money?

310
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,470
Take them.

311
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,110
We're a family.

312
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,990
Take them.

313
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,700
Do my words not work?

314
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,590
I told you to take them.

315
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,700
Mother.

316
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,510
This is really too much.

317
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,750
I have nowhere to spend this even if you give them to me.

318
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,370
If you really want to reward me,

319
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,550
you can give me some

320
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,870
jewellery that's not too valuable

321
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,150
or accessories

322
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,680
as a token of appreciation.

323
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,400
Chen really married a good wife.

324
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,630
I'll reward you.

325
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,470
I should.

326
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,630
These are all my mother's treasures.

327
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,800
Take a look,

328
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,240
pick whatever you like.

329
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,310
That's all?

330
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,200
Is there nothing you like?

331
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,430
No.

332
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,810
I just think these are all too expensive.

333
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,630
This one's solid gold.

334
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,750
This was my favorite when I was young.

335
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,620
Try it on.

336
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,390
Mother.

337
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,510
This is too ornate.

338
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,920
Only you can pull it off.

339
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,450
It doesn't look good on me.

340
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,540
What about this?

341
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,480
Pearls?

342
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,320
I don't think it's suitable for my age.

343
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,830
Well...

344
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,360
Then...

345
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,790

This is the token of the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom.

688
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,070
Oh no.

689
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,460
Everything is over.

690
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,550
Manager Zhou. Manager Zhou,

691
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,290
calm down.

692
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,820
How about this?

693
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,620
You can start by detailing what happened that day.

694
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,150
The Nanxiang Kingdom often sends envoys here.

695
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,430
Each time, they offer a lot of tributes.

696
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,060
The envoy would always

697
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,310
keep several treasures for himself

698
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,140
and ask me to help him convert them into money.

699
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,550
This time, as per usual,

700
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,820
I dealt with his gifts as I always do.

701
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,430
I went to get the money I got last time

702
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,050
to give it to him.

703
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,760
As soon as I got back, I realized that a fire had broken out.

704
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,390
As soon as I realized there was a fire,

705
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,690
I brought my men

706
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,190
and rushed in to save the envoy.

707
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,520
B-B-But...

708
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,670
The fire was too strong.

709
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,670
We had no choice but to escape.

710
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,030
Wasn't there anyone else there?

711
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,050
The envoy arrived at night,

712
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,530
and no one else was here.

713
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,510
If the one who died is really the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom,

714
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,900
Mu Chen, do you think

715
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,460
I should just visit His Majesty,

716
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,720
and ask to retire early and return home?

717
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,920
There hasn't been a fire in the Treasure Pavilion in years.

718
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,190
Why did something happen at the very moment the envoy arrived?

719
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,870
My Lord. My Lord.

720
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,590
This was found in the ruins.

721
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,260
This is a Willow Leaf Dart.

722
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,370
Could this be

723
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,900
the work of the Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

724
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,590
This...

725
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,659
Willow Leaf Thief Liu only steals things and never kills.

726
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,850
Why did they kill the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom?

727
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,590
Why did they burn down the Treasure Pavilion?

728
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,320
It's them.

729
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,400
The murderer is Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

730
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,830
As a thief,

731
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,750
what reason do they need to

732
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,570
do things like murder and arson?

733
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,949
My Lord.

734
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,790
My Lord!

735
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,909
My Lord, please help!

736
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,469
Manager Zhou.

737
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,510
I can't take the blame for such a huge crime

738
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,469
as murdering an envoy.

739
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,429
Manager Zhou, get up first.

740
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,510
Help me! Help me!

741
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,389
Manager Zhou. Manager Zhou.

742
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,739
Get up and talk. Get up.

743
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,630
Let me tell you.

744
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,550
If the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom

745
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,710
really died,

746
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,470
I'd be in trouble too.

747
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,650
How about this?

748
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,320
Let's trust Xu, okay?

749
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,590
There are too many things that are suspicious in this case.

750
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,070
Judging from the current evidence,

751
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,270
we can't be sure that the deceased

752
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,330
is the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom.

753
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,740
Let's wait for the autopsy

754
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,720
before we come to any conclusion.

755
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,470
Well said.

756
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,710
Well said.

757
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,190
Your analysis is perfect.

758
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,500
Just follow your train of thought and investigate this.

759
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,790
The rest of our lives

760
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,660
depend on you.

761
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,240
I...

762
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,410
Do you have wine?

763
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,380
I need to calm down.

764
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,920
Get two pots, two pots.

765
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,840
Let's go.

766
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,650
Come on.

769

If it isn't Lord Xu!

770
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,610
Why was the Ministry of Justice alerted to

771
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,510
a small matter like a store fire?

772
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,390
Muchen, you did well.

773
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,070
You arrived even earlier than the Ministry of Justice

774
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,270
to protect the scene.

775
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,590
I appreciate it.

776
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
The 12 districts outside the palace

777
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,720
are under the Zichen Department's jurisdiction.

778
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,780
What does it have to do with the Ministry of Justice?

779
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,730
The store fire

780
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,960
obviously has nothing to do with the Ministry of Justice,

781
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,180
but what about the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom?

782
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,790
You're the Ministry of Justice indeed.

783
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,270
You are well informed.

784
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,860
After all, the safety of the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom

785
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,750
is a matter of diplomatic relations

786
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,590
and the fate of the people of both countries.

787
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,750
The Ministry of Justice naturally has to

788
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,310
put in tons of effort,

789
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,870
unlike some government officials

790
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,660
who can't even protect one person

791
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,070
and made the envoy

792
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,780
lose his life in front of the Emperor.

793
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,390
Lord Gongyang, tread carefully.

794
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,110
We can't jump to conclusions

795
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,550
about the life or death of the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom yet.

796
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,410
We can't jump to conclusions yet?

797
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,170
Weren't you guys supposed to protect him?

798
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,420
Where is he now?

799
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,950
The Zichen Department will find the envoy as soon as possible

800
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,210
and find out the truth.

801
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,090
It’s a pity that you don’t have the chance.

802
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,960
The Nanxiang Kingdom case has reached the Emperor

803
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,490
and His Majesty is furious.

804
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,360
He ordered the Ministry of Justice to investigate this case thoroughly.

805
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,920
From now on, the Zichen Department

806
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,940
is not allowed to intervene in this case.

807

A woman?

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,990

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,830
be a thief?

857
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,370
They have to get married and take care of the family.

858
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,080
Only someone like her

859
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,130
whom nobody wants

860
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,270
would go sneaking around.

861
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,800
Exactly.

862
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,590
Yes, you are right.

863
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,710
Now she even dared to kill the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom.

864
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,590
In my opinion,

865
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,710
she's trying to start a war between the two states

866
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,800
to torment the people!

867
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,530
How vicious!

868
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,550
Yes.

869
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm going home.

870
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,120
It's not safe outside.

871
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,300
Let's go.

872
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,050
Let's go.

873
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,500
Let's go.

874
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:45,270
[Catch-and-kill order] [Bounty on arrest]

875
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,990
[Pharmacy]

876
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,310
Why is Master in such a hurry to see me?

877
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,260
Is anything the matter?

878
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,670
To be honest, I don't know.

879
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,320
Look,

880
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,560
she asked Mumu to come back too.

881
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Senior is back?

882
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,590
Let's go find her.

883
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,710
Great!

884
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,600
Bravo! Bravo!

885
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,310
Who else?

886
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,270
Me! Me! Me!

887
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,950
Me! Me! Me!

888
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,520
You, come here.

889
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,500
Okay.

890
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,520
Are you okay?

891
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,860
How is it?

892
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,080
Senior,

893
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,510
you've gone too far.

894
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,600
That's right.

895
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,980
That's too much.

896
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,720
Yeah.

897
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,530
What's wrong?

898
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm doing this for his own good.

899
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,510
Master said

900
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,250
you have to train like you're on a mission.

901
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,690
You can't be distracted.

902
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,680
You were a little heavy-handed, no?

903
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,720
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

904
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,390
Yes.

905
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,890
I have more.

906
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Do you want to try?

907
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,350
Go! Go!

908
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,110
Don't be afraid. Junior.

909
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,720
Go! Go!

910
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,670
Go! Go!

911
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,990
I'll try.

912
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,350
Come on, Junior.

913
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,790
Come on! Come on!

914
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,710
We support you.

915
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,680
Come on, Junior.

916
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,680
Come on! Come on!

917
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,110
Junior. Junior, are you okay?

918
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,950
Are you okay, Junior?

919
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,790
How is it?

920
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,310
Junior,

921
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,590
is this all you've got?

922
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,740
Junior, are you alright?

923
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,710
Mumu.

924
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,990
Why did you hit so hard?

925
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,180
What?

926
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,380
She's the one who has inferior skills.

927
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,190
How do you figure this?
