[Episode 5]

4
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,950
Rong, are you okay?

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,950
Mumu.

6
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,530
Why did you hit her so hard?

7
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,470
What?

8
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,080
It's she who is inferior to me in martial arts.

9
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,110
Then what should the result be?

10
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,750
Master also said

11
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,280
that according to Article Seven of the Sect Rules,

12
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,870
one shall never lose his or her personal belongings.

13
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,590
Otherwise, the whereabouts will be exposed.

14
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,950
You often lecture us

15
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,710
with the Sect Rules.

16
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,070
How can you forget it now?

17
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,710
Yes.

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,790
According to the Sect Rules,

19
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,030
Rong should be the winner.

20
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,670
That's right.

21
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,310
Rong should be the winner.

22
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,770
Rong should be the winner.

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,670
You...

24
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,630
Rong won.

25
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,430
Master.

26
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,510
Master is here.

27
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,470
Master.

28
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,110
Master, you are back.

29
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,950
Stand still.

30
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,340
I was only away for a few days.

31
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,930
You brats!

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,360
Are you going to turn the world upside down?

33
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,910
You fought in private

34
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,510
and disregarded the Sect Rules.

35
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,670
Do you want me to step down

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,270
and hand the Sect over to you?

37
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,350
Master.

38
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,670
My juniors

39
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,310
just wanted to improve their skills

40
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,590
by practising martial arts with each other

41
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,830
so as to lessen your burden.

42
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,590
It's inevitable that they might have overstepped the boundary.

43
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,510
Given their good intentions,

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,800
please forgive them.

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,670
Please don't be angry.

46
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,270
Anger will hurt your health.

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,060
You two, come with me.

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
The rest of you may leave.

49
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,670
Go practise your martial arts.

50
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,040
Yes, Senior.

51
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,190
Let's go.

52
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,310
Master.

53
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,510
You were thoughtless and reckless.

54
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,350
Master.

55
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,990
It's not like that.

56
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,910
I found clues pertaining to the jade pendant

57
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,230
in Xu's Mansion yesterday.

58
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,590
I wanted to explore more clues at the Treasure Pavilion.

59
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,790
But unexpectedly...

60
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,670
In order to escape,

61
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,630
I left evidence in a hurry.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,560
Let Mumu deal with

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,950
the Watermill case.

64
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,450
Don't interfere.

65
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,720
Find out where the jade pendant is.

66
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,160
Mumu, you may leave now.

67
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,510
Yes, Master.

68
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,990
Rong.

69
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,350
Come here.

70
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,990
Let me see

71
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,270
if you are hurt.

72
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,870
I'm fine, Master.

73
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,390
So clumsy.

74
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,829
Can you be more careful next time?

75
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,390
Got it.

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,230
Biased.

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,540
[Zichen Department]

78
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,960
My Lord.

79
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,270
As you ordered,

80
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,550
the men guarding the rest station

81
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,950
brought everything left

82
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,010
by the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom.

83
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,680
Go back to work.

84
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,310
Yes.

85
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,710
This is the Willow Leaf Dart.

86
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,710
Could these

87
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,330
also be done by Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

88
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,040
Was she really the one who killed the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom?

89
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,310
If she is the girl

90
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,790
who saved me back then,

91
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,170
should I follow the law

92
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,300
or my heart?

93
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,910
Lord Gu.

94
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,760
Wu Zhao.

95
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,670
Get a glass of water for me.

96
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,230
Yes.

97
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,990
Lord Gu, you are back.

98
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,710
How was the morning meeting?

99
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,670
Not good.

100
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,110
They argued a lot, making it a mess.

101
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,030
I haven't seen

102
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,430
such a heated discussion for so many years.

103
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,090
They argued?

104
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,720
Lord Gu.

105
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,250
What did they argue about?

106
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,280
The envoy died in the capital.

107
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,430
Their king was furious.

108
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,350
He said

109
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,590
if we couldn't catch the murderer in ten days,

110
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,870
they would start a war with us.

111
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,030
The officials argued

112
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,290
if we should wage a war first against the Nanxiang Kingdom.

113
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,280
This is our fault.

114
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,590
It will be shameless

115
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,790
if we wage a war first.

116
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,070
The war between two countries

117
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,430
will cause many casualties.

118
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,390
Even a country may perish.

119
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,910
If that happens,

120
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,710
there's no need to care about morality or decency.

121
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,170
Who advocate waging a war?

122
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,190
Officials from the Ministry of War.

123
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,050
And, by the way,

124
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,760
your father-in-law.

125
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,070
Duke Su?

126
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,630
Yes.

127
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,190
He was a soldier.

128
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,520
It's reasonable for him to advocate a war.

129
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,310
When two countries fight, one is sure to lose.

130
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,110
Even if we win by a narrow margin,

131
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,600
the Yue Kingdom in the south

132
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,390
will also be eager to make a move.

133
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,560
If we were attacked by them,

134
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,159
our country might be doomed.

135
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,350
Now I only hope the Ministry of Justice

136
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,990
can do something.

137
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,110
The key is to

138
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,370
investigate the case.

139
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,360
Young Madam.

140
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,110
Why are you here?

141
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,960
I brought you some food.

142
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,950
Help yourselves.

143
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,870
You worked so hard.

144
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,730
Help yourself.

145
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,909
Thank you.

146
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,840
You're welcome.

147
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,110
Have some desserts.

148
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,590
It looks delicious.

149
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,190
Okay, thank you.

150
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,200
You've been working hard.

151
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,830
Help yourself.

152
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,030
Thank you. Thank you.

153
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,920
We haven't eaten yet. You got here at a right time.

154
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,910
Don't be so polite.

155
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,710
You've taken care of my husband.

156
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,190
Any goody here?

157
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,070
Look.

158
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,610
Let me take one.

159
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,370
Take it slow. You have it there.

160
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,000
Why isn't it here?

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,750
Try this.

162
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,270
Try it.

163
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,720
What are you doing here?

164
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,910
I'm taking it.

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,160
Darling.

166
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,470
You didn't come back last night.

167
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,030
You must be busy with the case.

168
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,760
So I brought you desserts here.

169
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,430
Su...

170
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,950
Honey, you don't have to do this.

171
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,710
It's my duty to take care of you.

172
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,270
It doesn't matter if you thank me or not.

173
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,510
You can apply yourself to the case if you want.

174
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,170
But you can't starve your men.

175
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,470
Here.

176
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,550
I saw the arrest order of Willow Leaf Thief Liu

177
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,610
when I was on my way here this morning.

178
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,470
Isn't she a righteous thief?

179
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,630
How could she commit murder?

180
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,760
Don't you remember our rules?

181
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,220
Don's ask me about my work.

182
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,070
I'm worried about you.

183
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,230
Didn't you try to arrest her in the Duke's Mansion?

184
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,120
Now

185
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,430
she even committed arson and murder.

186
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,100
Isn't she openly provoking you?

187
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,320
I'll take the desserts.

188
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,550
Miss Su, you may go back.

189
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,150
Wu Zhao.

190
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,790
My Lord.

191
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,360
Send Young Madam back.

192
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,990
I...

193
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,320
Isn't this Young Madam?

194
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,270
It's been a few days since we met last time.

195
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,230
You look prettier.

196
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,390
I am flattered, Lord Gu.

197
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,870
Since I married Xu Muchen,

198
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,510
we are a family now.

199
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,550
You can call me Jinzhen.

200
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,210
It... It...

201
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,960
It would be my great honor to call you by your name.

202
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,790
Jinzhen.

203
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,990
I've heard

204
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,950
that you are gentle and intelligent.

205
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,360
You deserve your reputation.

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,350
Speaking of you,

207
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,789
not only does Muchen speak highly of you at home,

208
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,549
but my father praises you.

209
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,470
I'm flattered by Duke Su.

210
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,330
I'm flattered.

211
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,750
Xu Muchen.

212
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,510
If you want to praise me,

213
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,550
you can tell me

214
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,710
directly.

215
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,970
I won't be complacent.

216
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,710
Here, Jinzhen.

217
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,390
Come here.

218
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,630
Have some tea.

219
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,030
Make tea.

220
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,550
Wu Zhao.

221
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,150
Yes.

222
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,990
Come in, please.

223
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,510
OK.

224
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,110
Lord Gu,

225
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,680
Isn't Willow Leaf Thief Liu a righteous thief?

226
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,250
Why did she commit arson and murder?

227
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,260
Don't be fooled by those rumors.

228
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,440
A thief is a thief.

229
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,500
There's no righteousness in a thief,

230
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,350
especially for a rat like Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

231
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,480
You can't imagine what she dares to do.

232
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,790
I think it's fishy.

233
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,230
If she were a villain,

234
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,490
why wouldn't she tamper with other cases

235
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,450
but an important one like this?

236
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,240
Look, this...

237
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
This is our business.

238
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,150
Don't ask too much.

239
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,720
Go back with Wu Zhao.

240
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,380
What are you talking about?

241
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,980
Let Jinzhen finish.

242
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,870
Here, Jinzhen.

243
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,750
Go on.

244
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,830
I guess

245
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,190
that Willow Leaf Thief Liu

246
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,430
might just pass by that day.

247
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,600
She is not the murderer.

248
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,150
She

249
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,160
is quite pitiful

250
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,590
for being wronged.

251
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,200
Young Madam.

252
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,630
Do you mean

253
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,390
there was another person at the scene?

254
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,830
This is only my presumption.

255
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,080
Is there really another person?

256
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,810
Young Madam.

257
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,240
You must have read many storytelling scripts.

258
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,350
I didn't expect you

259
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,630
to offer ideas for us.

260
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,030
Those are just my presumptions.

261
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,990
Don't laugh at me

262
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,990
if I am wrong.

263
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,350
Don't say like that.

264
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,110
We are just

265
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,110
chatting now.

266
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,050
Just chatting.

267
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,940
Aren't you working on the case?

268
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,390
No.

269
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,030
The case has been handed over to the Ministry of Justice

270
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,240
and the body has been delivered there.

271
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,400
There's nothing we can do even if we want to.

272
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,580
Can't you think of another way?

273
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,300
We can't do anything about it.

274
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,790
Fine.

275
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,160
I'll leave you to it.

276
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,870
I should go back now.

277
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,350
You haven't had the tea yet.

278
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,670
I've been here for too long.

279
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,150
My husband will be unhappy.

280
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,990
I'm leaving.

281
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,400
Xu Muchen is really...

282
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,110
I won't disturb you.

283
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,790
See you later.

284
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,350
Remember to have some desserts.

285
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,280
Young Madam, let me see you off.

286
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,020
No, thanks.

287
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,910
Go on with your work.

288
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,640
I'm leaving.

289
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,110
I know what you're thinking.

290
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,150
Stay here.

291
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,720
Don't go anywhere.

292
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,130
Not even have a thought of going to the Ministry of Justice.

293
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,830
Since the body is in the Ministry of Justice,

294
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,030
I'll go there and investigate tonight.

295
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:29,300
[Ministry of Justice]

296
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,630
[Ministry of Justice]

297
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,470
He is the one who was strangled to death in front of me that day.

298
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,400
Why did the murderer burn the body?

299
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,230
Why is he here?

300
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,200
His neck was broken.

301
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,070
The Nanxiang Kingdom values tin the most.

302
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,630
They cap their teeth with prosthetic moulds made from tin.

303
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,350
But the dead had gold teeth.

304
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,350
Poison?

305
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,570
He hid poison in his teeth.

306
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,870
He was an assassin.

307
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,210
Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

308
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,030
That's strange.

309
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,270
I saw someone.

310
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,950
Where is he?

311
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,110
There's nothing here.

312
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,570
You just scared yourself.

313
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,960
I'll throw it to you if you come closer.

314
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,400
There's noise inside.

315
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,350
Go in and have a look.

316
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,150
Yes.

317
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,990
Someone broke into the Ministry of Justice.

318
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,550
Search!

319
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,110
Yes.

320
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,270
Willow Leaf Thief Liu! Stop!

321
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,510
What's in it for you to stop me?

322
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,430
Check over there.

323
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,110
Yes.

324
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,470
Did you kill the person in the Treasure Pavilion?

325
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,190
I didn't kill anyone.

326
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,030
I was just passing by,

327
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,470
witnessing someone committing murder.

328
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,599
The evidence is on the body.

329
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,190
You've already checked it, haven't you?

330
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,190
Over there! Go after him!

331
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,940
Yes.

332
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:20,910
Split up!

333
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,430
Stop!

334
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,510
The dead is not the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom.

335
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,510
He is an assassin.

336
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,750
I believe the envoy is still alive.

337
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,440
What?

338
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,000
I believe you visited the morgue at night

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,470
for the truth

340
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,000
and for clearing your name.

341
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,590
Why don't we make a deal?

342
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,480
You go and investigate the envoy's whereabouts.

343
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,630
I'll clear your name at the Zichen Department.

344
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,350
Why?

345
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,210
You have no choice but to trust me.

346
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Deal.

347
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,130
I'll distract them.

348
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,470
He must be in the yard.

Kind of.

How is the harvest?

693
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,320
Not good.

694
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,550
The number of officers has increased.

695
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,570
They don't let us go out during the day.

696
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,550
I have some taels of silver here.

697
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,560
It may support your life for a few days.

698
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,310
Thank you.

699
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,710
Help me find someone

700
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,030
from the Nanxiang Kingdom.

701
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,830
He's about 6 feet tall with curly hair

702
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,710
and whiskers.

703
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,080
Tell me when you find him.

704
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,870
Don't worry.

705
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,550
I'll go and find him now.

706
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,910
I'll let you know as soon as I get the clues.

707
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,480
Let's go.

708
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,090
Hurry.

709
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,850
I've never seen someone like him.

710
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,840
Look carefully.

711
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,190
Absolutely not.

712
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,190
No.

713
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,560
You're here.

714
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,030
Yes.

715
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,990
Please come in.

716
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,800
[Not in brothels]

717
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,190
No clue has been found.

718
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,550
We've searched the whole capital

719
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,670
but found nothing.

720
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,830
Could it be possible

721
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,030
that the envoy has already left the city

722
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,190
when the Ministry of Justice was off guard?

723
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,370
The city gates are all closed.

724
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,700
He can't leave the city.

725
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,690
If you were him,

726
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,880
what would be your first step

727
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,030
in such a situation?

728
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,810
He can't hide for a long time

729
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,190
without money or acquaintances.

730
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,030
If I were him,

731
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,120
I might be a part-timer for a living

732
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,680
and not take any action for the time being.

733
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,340
But the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom

734
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,790
is a high-ranking official living an affluent life.

735
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,230
Moreover, he doesn't speak our language.

736
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,230
That's why he can't be a part-timer.

737
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,930
But if that's the case,

738
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,350
where can he get enough money for a shelter?

739
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,790
The pawnshop.

740
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,850
What would you like to pawn?

741
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:00,680
Manager.

742
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,650
Have you seen him recently?

743
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,750
No.

744
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,920
No foreigner has pawned these days.

745
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,130
Did any suspicious person come here?

746
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,480
I run a legal business.

747
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,400
There's no suspicious person.

748
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,710
Manager, do you need to think twice?

749
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,710
My Lord.

750
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,370
I...

751
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,790
Tell me what you know!

752
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,100
My Lord.

753
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,680
I remembered.

754
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,850
A few days ago,

755
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,040
a suspicious guy came here

756
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,310
to pawn a jade ring.

757
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,180
He ran away with the silver

758
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,300
the moment that I offered him a price.

759
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,550
Where is the ring?

760
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,230
The ring...

761
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,710
My Lord.

762
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,710
How much did you offer?

763
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,600
Two taels of silver.

764
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,060
Two taels of silver?

765
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,510
But the jade

766
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,700
is a premium one made in the Nanxiang Kingdom.

767
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,960
You only offered him two taels of silver?

768
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,740
My Lord.

769
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,040
That man wore a mask.

770
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,150
I couldn't figure out what he was up to.

771
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,470
He left with the money.

772
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,230
I just wanted to make money.

773
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,000
In what direction did he go?

774
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,750
He went west

775
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,950
after leaving here.

776
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,770
Take care, My Lord.

777
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:32,890
My Lord.

778
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,030
In that case,

779
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,510
the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom did go to the pawnshop

780
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,670
after he escaped.

781
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,790
But two taels of silver

782
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,120
is not enough for him to spend so many days.

783
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,070
Two of you, right?

784
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,430
Yes.

785
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,290
Please come in.

786
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,790
Sir, please come in.

788

Sir, do you want a bet?

789
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:56,930

Please come in.

My Lord.

800

Have you gotten any idea?

I think I've known the answer.
