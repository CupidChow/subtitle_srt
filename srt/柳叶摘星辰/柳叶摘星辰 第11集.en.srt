00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,250
Senior, thank you for your help.

175
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,150
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

176
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,350
Maybe Xu Muchen

177
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,430
would let you off the hook

178
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,950
considering your marriage.

179
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,360
You...

180
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,080
What?

181
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,010
All right.

182
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,110
Master.

183
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,790
Rong acted recklessly

184
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,430
for the image

185
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,870
of Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

186
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,420
Besides,

187
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,790
with Mumu being out there to assist,

188
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,450
no big trouble will be caused.

189
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,870
Rong.

190
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,590
Your priority now

191
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,110
is to find the jade pendant

192
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,840
and get out of there safely.

193
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,900
Mumu.

194
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,990
You still need to keep Gongyang under control

195
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,590
to prevent him from causing more trouble.

196
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,190
Yes.

197
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,590
Master.

198
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,530
I'll go back to the Embroidery House and arrange it.

199
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,310
Master.

200
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,390
I searched everywhere in Xu's Mansion,

201
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,790
but I couldn't find it.

202
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,750
Maybe the jade pendant

203
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,950
is not in the mansion.

204
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,950
Things are hidden away by people.

205
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,830
Your aimless search is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

206
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,910
Why don't you search it on people?

207
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,910
To search it on people?

208
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,760
Junior.

209
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,510
This is the potion I've developed

210
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,770
over the past few days.

211
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,760
It's called True Heart.

212
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,610
Just pour it into Xu Muchen's wine.

213
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,380
When he gets drunk,

214
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,230
more or less, his true thoughts

215
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,430
will be exposed.

216
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,080
Senior, you're amazing.

217
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,870
What secret can't I get

218
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,650
with such an amazing potion?

219
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,030
More or less.

220
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
It's just "more or less".

221
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,690
However,

222
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,120
it also depends on the respondent's willpower

223
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,110
and the guidance of the questioner.

224
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,710
Anyway, be flexible.

225
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,510
Whose family is this young master from?

226
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,630
He's so handsome.

227
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,620
Exactly.

228
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,560
What a handsome young man.

229
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,440
Thank you for your compliment.

230
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,190
Excuse me.

231
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,430
Please make way.

232
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,550
Get out of the way.

233
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,870
My Lord.

234
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,960
I can do it myself.

235
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,620
Why do you have to come with me?

236
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,190
Now that you're here, you are also not helping me make a selection.

237
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,470
I don't know about this.

238
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,270
Pick quickly.

239
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,630
Let me have a look when you're done.

240
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,440
My Lords, welcome.

241
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,840
Help yourself.

242
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,110
We have products of all price points

243
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,260
and all kinds of styles.

244
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:15,990
Ma'am.

245
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,990
Do you have any recommendations?

246
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,430
Yes.

247
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,600
Come in. They're all inside.

248
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,240
Come on.

249
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,750
Ma'am.

250
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,400
Didn't you say you have recommendations?

251
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,470
The front row consists of the best-selling ones.

252
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,010
But you two...

253
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,970
This one. This is a new design.

254
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,100
And this.

255
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,810
And this. Try them all.

256
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,290
Which one do you think looks better?

257
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,080
I don't know about these, either.

258
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,430
As for rouge,

259
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,750
you have to try it on your face

260
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,110
before you know if it fits.

261
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,150
Which one of you wants to apply it?

262
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,970
Not for us.

263
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,630
Ma'am, go ahead.

264
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,240
We'll take a look on our own.

265
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,910
Okay, you guys go ahead.

266
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,250
I'll leave you alone.

267
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,630
How can we try it on?

268
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,230
We can't ask Xiao Qiu to come.

269
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,030
I can't believe they have such a fetish.

270
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,350
I'm an imperial official.

271
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,550
It's inappropriate for me

272
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,150
to apply the rouge in public.

273
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,510
An imperial official

274
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,360
came to buy cosmetics on duty.

275
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,640
It's inappropriate.

276
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,570
How about this?

277
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,310
You resign.

278
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,910
Don't come to Xu's Mansion again.

279
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,640
And don't see Xiao Qiu anymore.

280
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,840
But I'm willing to try it on

281
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,830
for you.

282
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,880
Look at this side of my face.

283
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
Do I need to try again?

284
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,790
How is it?

285
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,230
You're too dark.

286
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,370
But My Lord, you're white.

287
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,390
I've decided.

288
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,450
I'll take this one.

289
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,510
Ma'am.

290
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Two boxes of this.

291
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,900
Okay.

292
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,970
Darling.

293
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,110
You're back.

294
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:29,910
Have a seat.

295
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,570
Let me pour you some tea.

296
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,200
Actually,

297
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,550
I've reflected on myself today.

298
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,580
I didn't listen to you a few days ago.

299
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,280
I went down the mountain

300
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,930
and got mad at you.

301
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
It was my fault.

302
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,180
So I

303
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,710
prepared some dishes

304
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,910
as an apology.

305
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,110
I don't think it'll work.

306
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,950
It doesn't suit my temperament.

307
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,110
Xu Muchen.

308
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,430
Although you left me

309
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,830
alone in the mountains

310
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,510
which was an inhumane action,

311
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,950
I'm broad-minded.

312
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,690
How about this?

313
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,430
After you drink this,

314
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,430
I'll forgive you.

315
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,210
Not really.

316
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,550
Wu Zhao.

317
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,270
It's been almost a day.

318
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,270
Why don't you remove the rouge on your face?

319
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,240
Why remove it?

320
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,150
I must let Xiao Qiu see it.

321
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,310
I did this for her.

322
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,990
For her?

323
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,810
What if she sees you like this?

324
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,390
She will be so touched

325
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,120
and fell in love with me deeply.

326
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,550
Young Master.

327
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,750
Give this rouge

328
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,590
to Young Madam later.

329
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,670
She must be happy.

330
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,110
Nonsense.

331
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,090
Did I say I would give it to her?

332
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,540
Did you buy this rouge

333
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,670
for yourself?

334
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,140
Or is there another girl out...

335
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,230
Stop analyzing blindly.

336
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,070
Go send the rouge.

337
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,640
Xiao Qiu.

338
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
Why are you here?

339
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,050
Wu Zhao.

340
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,190
Which brothel did you go fooling around in again?

341
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,870
I didn't.

342
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,030
Brothel.

343
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,000
Fooling around.

344
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,750
The opening is inappropriate.

345
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,970
I did apply it myself.

346
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,950
Didn't you say you ran out of rouge a few days ago?

347
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,150
I happened to pass by a rouge shop today.

348
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,830
So I selected a box for you.

349
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,630
To try this rouge...

350
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,470
Didn't you say

351
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,950
you ran out of rouge?

352
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,620
I happened to...

353
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,400
Just to show you...

354
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,030
No.

355
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,190
Zhen didn't say that a few days ago.

356
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,960
Is it okay?

357
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,860
You remember that?

358
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,000
How can I forget about your things?

359
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,790
How can I forget about your things?

360
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,830
It sounds so frivolous.

361
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,030
You're glib-tongued.

362
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,780
It smells good.

363
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,240
Right?

364
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,230
How is it? Do you like it?

365
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,990
I picked it carefully.

366
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,250
It was carefully selected by me.

367
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,579
You picked this shade for me?

368
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,630
Do you know what the shade is called?

369
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,869
It's called Nine Hells Banana Pink.

370
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,590
-Banana Pink.
-Doesn’t the name...

371
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,510
Sound good?

372
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,970
It's from a famous poem.

373
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,870
The passing of time easily leaves people behind,

374
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,870
making the cherries red and the bananas green.

375
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,760
This shade will make people

376
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,990
look pale,

377
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,600
like dying men.

378
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,790
Wu Zhao.

379
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,470
You picked this shade for me?

380
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,510
What do you mean?

381
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,320
Well, Xiao Qiu.

382
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,670
Young Master picked this for me.

383
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,590
You're so good at shirking responsibility.

384
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,630
You just said you picked it.

385
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,430
I'll kill you today.

386
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,830
Come back!

387
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,390
Xiao Qiu.

388
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,030
-Stop!
-Listen to me!

389
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,470
-It’s really Young Master who picked it.
-Wu Zhao.

390
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,550
Such an ugly shade.

391
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,390
This Wu Zhao...

392
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,710
What does he mean?

393
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,230
How could you

394
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,750
pick this shade for me?

395
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,590
What's wrong?

396
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,150
Who made you angry?

397
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,460
It's Wu Zhao.

398
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,830
He said he picked a rouge for me.

399
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,550
This is what he picked.

400
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,570
Young Madam.

401
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,730
Do you think he believes I'm so ugly

402
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,760
that I only deserve this color?

403
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,870
Is it ugly?

404
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,200
I think the shade is not bad.

405
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,510
Not bad?

406
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,360
Let me apply it and show you.

407
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,510
Do I look good?

408
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,230
I'm speechless.

409
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,160
How could he pick this shade?

410
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,780
Young Madam, let me tell you.

411
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,400
As girls,

412
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,910
we can care nothing else.

413
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,790
But in terms of cosmetics

414
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,040
and clothes,

415
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,350
we can't compromise.

416
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,110
A man who gives you this shade of rouge as a gift

417
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,590
can never

418
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,760
be accepted.

419
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,920
[Xu's Mansion]

420
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,590
I cooked all these.

421
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,550
They're just so-so.

422
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,610
Please don't mind.

423
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,110
Thank you.

424
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,340
Before dinner,

425
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,860
let me give you a toast.

426
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,920
It was awkward

427
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,590
that I sent you white chrysanthemums.

428
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,110
It's my fault.

429
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,810
I apologize.

430
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,150
Since the misunderstanding has been resolved,

431
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,950
I would say it was not your fault.

432
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
Even if it wasn't my fault,

433
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,650
I caused the misunderstanding.

434
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,040
If you don't drink this cup of wine,

435
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,500
I will feel bad.

436
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,320
I feel so guilty.

437
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,970
I thought it over and over again. I thought...

438
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,510
Cheers.

439
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,660
This is the potion I've developed

440
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,790
after these days.

441
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,960
It's called True Heart.

442
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,910
Just pour it into Xu Muchen's wine.

443
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,530
When he gets drunk,

444
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,600
more or less, his true thoughts

445
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,640
will be exposed.

446
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,110
I wonder if it works.

447
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,680
I need to test him first.

448
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
You can't just drink.

449
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Have some dishes.

450
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,340
Try this.

451
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,590
Okay.

452
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,250
How is it?

453
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,770
Delicious.

454
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,520
It's delicious.

455
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,470
This dish is so salty but he says it's delicious.

456
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,070
Looks like he didn't take enough of the potion.

457
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm making the second toast

458
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,670
because you left me alone in the mountains.

459
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,520
But I'm broad-minded.

460
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,670
After you drink this,

461
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,670
I'll forgive you.

462
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,590
This is called using a cup of wine to resolve grievances.

463
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,150
Okay.

464
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,930
Using a cup of wine to resolve grievances.

465
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,060
He drank two cups.

466
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,830
It should be effective.

467
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,870
You can't just drink.

468
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,710
Have some dishes.

469
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,590
Try this.

470
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,110
How is this one?

471
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,760
It's a little...

472
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,020
Not bad.

473
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,350
It's good.

474
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,030
It's so spicy.

475
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,110
But he's still not telling the truth.

476
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,080
The third cup...

477
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,870
-Honey.
-Is…

478
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,630
I can't drink as much as you thought.

479
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,360
Let's take a break.

480
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,610
What if the potion efficacy wears off after a break?

481
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,850
Yes.

482
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,730
We need to take a break.

483
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,210
I just

484
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,880
killed her mood, didn't I?

485
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,530
But this is too important.

486
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,510
The misunderstanding has been resolved,

487
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,750
and the suspicion has been eliminated.

488
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,990
Let's have a drink

489
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,440
and get along with each other.

490
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,250
Right?

491
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,310
She is giving me an out.

492
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,010
I need to drink this.

493
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,130
Let's get along well.

494
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,760
Let's get along well.

495
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,100
I told you not to just drink.

496
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,150
Have some dishes.

497
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,350
Try this.

498
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,920
It tastes terrible.

499
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,990
What did I say?

500
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,750
The potion is taking effect.

501
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,500
Darling.

502
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,840
Honey.

503
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,720
Do you have any secrets?

504
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,710
Secrets?

505
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,110
She still remembers the time I went to the brothel?

506
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,750
Yes.

507
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,030
What secret?

508
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,560
For example, something so precious

509
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,510
that can't be given away easily.

510
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,950
Yes.

511
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,270
Where is it?

512
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,990
What is this?

513
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,160
You said the wrong line.

514
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,520
You should ask me

515
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,320
which brothel I went to fool around in.

516
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,230
I didn't.

517
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,980
Then you should ask me,

518
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,350
"What is this?

519
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,120
Did you apply it yourself?"

520
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,190
You did apply it yourself.

521
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,110
A few days ago,

522
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,110
you said you ran out of rouge.

523
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,750
I happened to pass by the rouge shop today,

524
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,610
so I specially picked one for you.

525
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,560
When... When did I say that?

526
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,890
How could I forget about your things?

527
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,720
You should ask me for the rouge.

528
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,350
Can you give me the rouge?

529
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,750
I carefully selected it for you.

530
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,570
See if you like it.

531
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,410
A man who gives you this shade of rouge as a gift

532
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,110
can never

533
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,330
be accepted.

534
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,470
But why is this rouge so precious

535
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,720
and can't be given away easily?

536
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,230
Wu Zhao gave it to Xiao Qiu.

537
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,430
Xiao Qiu was unhappy.

538
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,590
I don't want you to be unhappy.

539
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,990
You... You don't want me to be unhappy?

540
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,920
I always made you angry.

541
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,070
I was wrong.

542
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,340
Why?

543
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,680
Because I've fallen in love with you.

544
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,460
Why is he talking about that?

545
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,150
I have to find out where the jade pendant is.

546
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,760
Have a seat, Darling.

547
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,780
Let's sit down.

548
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,360
If you want to make me happy,

549
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,550
you can give me something I like.

550
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,600
Like jewelry,

551
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,500
or small pendants.

552
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,440
For another example...

553
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,960
Another example, a jade pendant.

554
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,320
Okay.

555
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,490
What jade pendant do you want?

556
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,590
The precious ones

557
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,240
that are kept for a long time.

558
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,260
Or the ones

559
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,510
given by your father.

560
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,830
My disobedient mouth

561
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,360
said the wrong thing again.

562
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,070
Are you alright?

563
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,790
I miss my father.

564
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,720
Well...

565
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,460
I'm sorry.

566
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,050
I'm a little drunk.

567
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,830
I need to go back to sleep.

568
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,670
Well...

569
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,730
Why are you leaving?

570
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,710
Why are you lying down?

571
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,830
You just had a few drinks.

572
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,870
You want to pretend to sleep?

573
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,990
No way.

574
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,750
Get up.

575
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,310
Xu Muchen.

576
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Get up.

577
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,790
Get up and drink three more cups.

578
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,530
You're not getting up?

579
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,270
Are you getting up or not?

580
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,050
Are you getting up or not?

581
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,480
Are you really asleep?

582
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,160
So fast?

583
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,470
Did I put too much potion?

584
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,480
Senior Moyan was so careless.

585
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,690
He didn't tell me the dosage.

586
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,430
Not only did I fail to get the truth out,

587
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,760
but will it make him die?

588
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,310
Father.

589
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,550
Father.

590
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,550
I'm here.

591
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,630
Good boy.

592
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,160
I've got a son after drinking with him.

593
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,160
It's not a loss.

594
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,710
You're good-looking.

595
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,510
But as a man,

596
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,040
why did you apply the rouge?

597
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,020
Let Daddy remove it for you.

598
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,470
Father!

599
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,670
Let go!

600
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,750
I miss you.

601
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,030
Why are you acting so miserably?

602
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,750
My father is gone too.

603
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,900
You're awake.

604
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,280
Why are you here?

605
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,030
Why am I here?

606
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,850
I fell asleep here last night.

607
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,760
Then why did you keep...

608
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,480
What?

609
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,790
Don't get me wrong.

610
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,390
I didn't want to hold you.

611
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,260
You were drunk yesterday

612
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,070
and kept holding on to me.

613
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,870
Do you think I want to sleep here?

614
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,030
Impossible.

615
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,030
I don't remember I was drunk.

616
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,390
Try to recall it.

617
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,710
Last night,

618
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,470
you were so drunk and crying.

619
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,950
Recall what you did.

620
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,880
I remember you said to use a cup of wine to resolve grievances

621
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,350
and let's get along well in the future.

622
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,070
Yes, after that?

623
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,420
You don't remember, do you?

624
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,830
You can't even stand

625
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,990
three cups.

626
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,840
Don't be so confident anymore.

627
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,680
Did I do anything when I was drunk?

628
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,350
You want to know?

629
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,350
Guess.

630
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,390
What time is it?

631
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,720
Why don't you go to Zichen Department?

632
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,430
I took a leave from Lord Gu today.

633
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,370
So I won't go.

634
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,110
What's your plan today?

635
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,040
I...

636
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,920
Logically speaking,

637
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,950
you finally don't have to work,

638
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,190
and you drank too much last night,

639
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,930
I should stay with you.

640
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,990
But I promised Xiao Qiu yesterday

641
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,870
to buy storybooks with her.

642
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,070
I'll have to leave you

643
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,470
to take care of yourself.

644
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,470
Here.

645
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,670
Okay.

646
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,800
Thank you, Darling.

647
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,110
Well,

648
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,880
let me ask you something.

649
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,110
Go ahead.

650
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,990
Did you see a box of rouge?

651
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,790
Rouge?

652
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,120
You mean this?

653
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,120
Yes.

654
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,150
You carefully selected this one

655
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,110
and gave it to me as a gift.

656
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,510
How can I return it to you?

657
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,949
I have to use it properly.

658
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,110
I've never seen such a beautiful shade.

659
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,750
Well.

660
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,150
Stop standing here.

661
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,199
I need to change.

662
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,320
If Rong uses the rouge,

663
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,610
she would definitely want to divorce me.

664
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,870
I need to find a way to make up for it.

665
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,840
My Lord,

666
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,750
our men of the Zichen Department are ready.

667
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,750
Tomorrow at 7 p.m.,

668
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,550
Liufang Pavilion will be a trap.

669
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,190
Good.

670
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:04,910
My Lord.

671
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,910
I'll go back if there's nothing else.

672
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,590
Wait.

673
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,890
Have a seat.

674
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,960
What's the matter, My Lord?

675
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,630
Li from the Zichen Department

676
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,190
told me yesterday

677
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,790
his wife had a quarrel with him

678
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,150
and wanted to divorce him.

679
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,880
He asked me how to stop his wife.

680
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,430
Which Li?

681
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,550
The one you rarely see.

682
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,620
Li has asked you for advice.

683
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,630
He must like his wife very much.

684
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,870
What do you mean by likes?

685
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,200
It's not serious at all.

686
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,280
Husband and wife should respect each other

687
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,540
and grow old together.

688
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,440
They can't just divorce each other like that.

689
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,150
Right?

690
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,630
Yes.

691
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,990
Did Li do

692
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,070
something wrong

693
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,670
or go somewhere he shouldn't have gone?

694
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,130
It's unavoidable for us from the Zichen Department

695
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,150
to go to some inappropriate places.

696
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,090
But it's all for our missions.

697
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,630
We're sacrificing ourselves for noble causes.

698
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,270
Yes.

699
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,870
That makes sense.

700
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,910
It's just that when the wife found out...

701
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,430
Well...

702
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,280
Did Li explain to his wife?

703
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,800
He did.

704
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,870
But she didn't believe it.

705
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,200
How is that possible? Young Madam is so...

706
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,790
Mrs. Li likes Li so much.

707
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,110
Really?

708
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,990
When you just got married,

709
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,990
Young Madam was so enthusiastic about you.

710
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,630
I saw that.

711
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,430
You must be too cold to her

712
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,470
and make her sad.

713
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,310
Is that so?

714
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,120
There's another possibility.

715
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,630
What is it?

716
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,360
My Lord.

717
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,090
I still have a pill called Butterfly's Love here.

718
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,080
Do you want to try it?

719
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,190
Why should I?

720
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,780
We are talking about Li.

721
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,670
Yes, Li.

722
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,790
If you ask me, My Lord,

723
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,590
you should...

724
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,140
No, I mean Li.

725
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,870
It's not enough to just give gifts.

726
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,510
He should also

727
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,190
show his manliness.

728
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,990
Why is she leaving?

729
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,790
I haven't finished yet.

730
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,510
Women

731
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,170
also lack a sense of security.

732
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,130
You should stay with her more.

733
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,150
Even if you're not by her side,

734
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,110
you need to report

735
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,970
your schedule to her all the time.

736
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,440
Let me report to you.

737
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,960
I need to go to the study to work.

738
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,160
Does Senior's potion have such strong side effects?

739
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,430
Did it harm his brain?

740
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:16,870
Honey.

741
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,710
Eat this.

742
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,550
Here.

743
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,960
You finally look like a husband.

744
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,490
Enough.

745
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,810
Thank you, Darling.

746
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,390
Does he think

747
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,370
his wife's death is more dignified than divorce

748
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,100
so he wants to stuff me to death?

749
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,440
Women can't stand gifts.

750
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,980
If Li prepares a gift with care

751
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,140
for his wife,

752
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,970
I'm sure his wife will be happy.

753
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,860
Do you like it?

754
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,310
Is he testing me?

755
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,270
Why did you give me this?

756
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,830
How can you give this as a gift to a girl?

757
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,790
It's ominous.

758
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,150
This is my favorite item that I've kept for years.

759
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,750
I'm giving it to you as a gift.

760
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,160
So weird.

761
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,190
Women

762
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,750
need tender care.

763
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,190
Your care for her

764
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,150
should be demonstrated in every detail

765
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,990
of life.

766
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,510
This is...

767
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,310
Mother asked you to send it here?

768
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,290
Let me have a taste.

769
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,320
Why are you smiling?

770
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,990
Luckily you've got a good mother.

771
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,750
Take it in.
