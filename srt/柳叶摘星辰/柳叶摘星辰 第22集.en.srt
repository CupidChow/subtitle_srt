It's normal for Duke

176
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,190
to be worried now.

177
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,590
Send a reply to Duke.

178
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,510
Tell him the small Zichen Department

179
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,310
won't be able to cause us trouble

180
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,110
in Taizhou.

181
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:55,470
Well,

182
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,820
what about the business partners?

183
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,660
Let Accountant Li select the business partners.

184
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,270
He knows everything about the business.

185
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,790
I will

186
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,890
invite the business partner to dinner some day.

187
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,950
Yes.

188
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,410
[Li's Tongren Pharmacy]

189
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,310
Mr. Moyan.

190
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,730
Have a seat.

191
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,429
Mr. Moyan.

192
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,690
Since Lu Rongchang got arrested,

193
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,789
it has been difficult for us to sell Moon Star Herb pills

194
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,470
in the capital.

195
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,270
We overstocked lots of the pills

196
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,070
and suffered great losses.

197
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,380
Do you know how to help us out?

198
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,720
Duke sent me here

199
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,650
to solve this problem.

200
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,220
I went to the pharmacy.

201
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,750
The formula for the pills sold in Taizhou

202
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,950
can be improved

203
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,310
so the pills can have stronger effects.

204
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,630
Then put the new pills into the water source of the city.

205
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,990
So everyone in Taizhou will take pills from the water

206
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,270
and they'll get addicted to the Moon Star Herb.

207
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,110
In this way,

208
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,050
they'll have to buy the Moon Star Herb pills.

209
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,290
Mr. Moyan.

210
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,390
But...

211
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,230
This is a short-sighted solution.

212
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,510
The people of Taizhou

213
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,600
don't have much money left now.

214
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,730
I didn't expect you to care about the people of Taizhou.

215
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,400
Do you want me to compliment you on your kind heart

216
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,550
in front of your boss?

217
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,070
No.

218
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,910
Follow this formula.

219
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,510
Go.

220
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,520
Senior Brother.

221
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,630
Rong.

222
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,110
You're back so early.

223
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,190
I'll ask someone to cook something for you.

224
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,120
Senior Brother.

225
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,320
I heard the conversation between you and the guy from the Zhao family.

226
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,160
Rong.

227
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,270
We used to collaborate with them

228
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,150
because Master said

229
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,790
though the Moon Star Herb was prohibited,

230
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,870
it could help the people in Taizhou.

231
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,830
But now you've seen

232
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,150
what people of Taizhou are suffering.

233
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,950
Why are you still helping the Zhao family do bad things?

234
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,630
Rong, keep your voice down.

235
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,450
I have my reasons.

236
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,670
I can't explain to you now.

237
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,190
Because you know you're doing a wrong thing, right?

238
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,910
I'll catch Mr. Zhao and send him to the government now

239
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,900
so they won't be able to do business anymore.

240
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,470
Stupid!

241
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,150
What's the point of catching the son of the Zhao family?

242
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,030
Government officials in Taizhou are all corrupt now.

243
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,830
As long as the water passages are controlled by the Zhao family,

244
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,030
there will always be Moon Star Herbs in Taizhou.

245
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,830
Senior Brother, you...

246
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,750
Rong.

247
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,310
I'm doing what Master ordered me to do before she died.

248
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,640
I have to obey her order.

249
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,690
Master would also make mistakes.

250
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,070
Rong.

251
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,070
Rong.

252
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,680
Young Master.

253
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,080
I've brought you the person you want to see.

254
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,590
What is his background?

255
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,750
He's from the Liu family who runs the logistics business on waterways and roads in Zhuozhou.

256
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,550
In my early years,

257
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,670
-I got to know the manager of their family business.
-Mr. Zhao.

258
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,400
His son is here today.

259
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,470
-Have you ever seen him before?
-Hi, Mr. Zhao.

260
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,350
No.

261
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,030
But he brought the seal of the Liu family with him.

262
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,270
I deliberately made several mistakes

263
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,190
when describing his family business.

264
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,190
And he pointed them out one by one.

265
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,490
There should be no problem with his background.

266
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,490
Where is he?

267
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,230
He’s waiting in the room.

268
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,830
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhao, I'm from the Liu family.

269
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,280
Nice to meet you too, Mr. Liu.

270
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,940
Have a seat.

271
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,350
Did you arrive in Taizhou today?

272
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,790
I've been here for a few days.

273
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,030
What do you think about

274
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,920
the customs in Taizhou?

275
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,200
No one commits crimes here.

276
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,530
Everyone obeys the law.

277
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,330
It's the perfect place where we can do business.

278
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,960
You're quite interesting.

279
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,510
Let's talk about the business first.

280
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,310
I'll hold a banquet for you tonight.

281
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,550
Let's get drunk.

282
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,750
I'll be there, thank you.

283
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,830
I've been busy in the accounting room all day.

284
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,830
Give me one pill.

285
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,470
The accountant only gave me two pills.

286
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,670
They're not enough for me.

287
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,950
Just give me one.

288
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,760
No way.

289
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,910
You're so stingy.

290
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,550
Tell me.

291
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,790
Where is the Zhao family's ledger about their smuggling business?

292
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,830
How dare you!

293
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,190
Do you know where this is?

294
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,630
Cut the crap and tell me.

295
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,350
You're not allowed to get the ledger

296
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,820
hidden in the secret box.

297
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,950
How can I open the secret box?

298
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,110
I've been a servant of the Zhao family for ten years.

299
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,910
I won't tell you

300
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,910
that the key is with my young master.

301
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,190
Where is he?

302
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,950
You want to get close to him?

303
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,870
Dream on.

304
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,990
My young master is having dinner in the front hall with guests.

305
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,430
The hall is heavily guarded.

306
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,550
No one can enter

307
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,550
except the dancers who got invited.

308
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,270
The Moon Star Herb is really harmful.

309
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,730
His brain is damaged because he took many Moon Star Herb pills.

310
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,260
Let's welcome Mr. Liu.

311
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,660
Let's raise our glasses.

312
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,920
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

313
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,310
Mr. Zhao.

314
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,550
Here.

315
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,270
Please.

316
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,430
Mr. Zhao.

317
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,550
A few years ago, I focused on preparing for the imperial examination for selecting officials.

318
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,030
I didn't handle my family business until recently.

319
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,270
The I got to know you.

320
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,470
I am so lucky to have you be my business partner.

321
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,110
Mr. Zhao.

322
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,950
I hope we'll have good collaboration

323
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,470
in the future.

324
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,700
No problem.

325
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,710
It's so generous of you

326
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,510
to let me have 40% of the profits.

327
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,550
Of course

328
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,350
I'd like to be your friend.

329
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,510
Mr. Zhao.

330
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,800
The details of our business

331
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,530
have basically been settled.

332
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,910
When will we exchange ledgers?

333
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,040
Mr. Liu.

334
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,390
I'm afraid I can't give you

335
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,550
the ledger right now.

336
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,150
Mr. Zhao.

337
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,760
You must be kidding.

338
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,470
When it comes to business collaboration,

339
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,670
business partners all need to exchange ledgers first.

340
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,470
Mr. Liu.

341
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,230
You know why I don't want to give it to you.

342
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,790
You know what business we're doing.

The illicit income we have

and the money we bribed the senior official with

346

can't be recorded in the ledgers.

Which senior official are you talking about?

Mr. Liu.

You shouldn't ask this question.

When you start doing the business with us,

Do you like the dancers I brought?

I'll let you pick one first later.

You may start.

Yes.

Where did you find that dancer?

360
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,190
She is a terrible dancer.

Well.

363
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,310
Maybe she is a novice.

364
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,030
So she can't cooperate with the other dancers well.

365

What should we do now?

366

Mr. Liu will laugh at us because of that terrible dancer.

367
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,940
Should we serve them the good things now?

368
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,610

No.

Mr. Zhao.

00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,250
Did you add the Moon Star Herb to your tea?

387
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,480
Of course.

388
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,630
Normally, people will be too weak to stand after taking Moon Star Herb pills.

She looks unfamiliar.

The guard found him when patrolling the yard.

Did he see who had knocked him out?

417
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,150
I asked him.

418
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,750
He said it was a female thief.

419

When I went there yesterday,

425
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,390
Mr. Liu was in his room.

426
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,270
But I asked the servants.

427
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,310
They said after the banquet last night,

428
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,350
nothing happened in Mr. Liu's room.

429
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,760
It seemed that he didn't go back to his room directly.

430
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,830
I've asked those of Chunfeng Brothel.

431
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,550
They said they only sent six girls.

432
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,350
So the one Mr. Liu took

433
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,630
wasn't from Chunfeng Brothel.

434

That woman knocked out a servant.

435
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,970
She must have an ulterior motive.

436

She even knows Mr. Liu.

Things are more complicated than we thought.

438

I'll find out more about her later.

Hopefully I'm just overthinking it.

nothing had happened

And the girl you took is also missing.

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,950
I asked her to go back.

463
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,150
I didn't let her sleep in my room.

It's okay. I'm a man. I know how you feel.

468
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,040
But you need to see a doctor because of it.

469
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,230
Coincidentally, a famous doctor has come to my mansion.

470
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,400
I'll ask him to feel your pulse

Why am I in the inn?

00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,630
Did you kill him?

486
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,240
No.

487
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,070
I went to Zhao's Mansion

and saw Xu Muchen.

489
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,210
Then I drank some tea

490
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,070
and passed out.

491
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,960
Liu Rong.

492
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,070
Can you find a better excuse?

493
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,910
Last time, you said you had passed out after drinking wine.

494
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,390
Now you would pass out too after drinking tea?

495
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,110
I think you still love him.

496
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,460
So you didn't kill him.

497
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,010
Senior.

498
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,710
There was something in the tea.

499
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,590
I think Moon Star Herb pills were added to the tea.

500
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,450
Moon Star Herb?

501
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,950
All pharmacies in Taizhou

502
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,390
sell Moon Star Herb pills now.

503

Only the Zhao family

504

knows the procedures of making those pills.

505
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,840
Senior Brother is also involved in the business.

506
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,590
That can't be his own decision.

507
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm sure Master ordered him to do that.

508
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,910
Could it be that

509
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,830
the Moon Star Herbs that were hidden in our places

510
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,490
were used to make those pills?

511
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,390
Where is Senior Brother?

512
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,310
I received a letter from him this morning.

513
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,310
He left in a hurry.

514
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,790
Letter?

515
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,800
Is it the Zhao family again?

516
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,070
Senior, wait for him here.

517
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,600
I'll go out and look for him.

518
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,110
Hello, Mr. Moyan.

519
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,040
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

520
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,670
Have you ever seen this gentleman?

521
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,390
No.

522
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,270
Who is he?

523
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,670
He is Mr. Liu from Zhuozhou.

524
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,150
He's here to discuss business collaboration with me.

525
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,090
Hello, Mr. Liu.

526
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,750
Mr. Liu.

527
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,990
He is Mr. Moyan from the capital.

528
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,270
Hello, Mr. Moyan.

529
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,870
Mr. Liu.

530
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,840
Mr. Moyan escaped from

531
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,150
the prison of the Zichen Department in the capital.

532
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,470
He saw officials of the Zichen Department

533
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,070
and the Ministry of Justice.

534
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,470
He even got interrogated by Xu Muchen.

535
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,190
He has been through a lot.

536
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,960
Mr. Zhao, you're wrong.

537
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,550
Xu Muchen is quite capable.

538
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,430
I was lucky

539
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,310
to have escaped from him.

540
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,830
Mr. Moyan, don't be too modest.

541
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,070
I'd like to know how you escaped from prison.

542
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,270
Please tell me about it some other time.

543
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,950
Mr. Moyan.

544
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,080
Is your new formula ready?

545
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,230
I asked the butler to make some new pills yesterday.

546
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,430
The effects of the new pills are not bad.

547
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,150
Young Master.

548
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,630
Mr. Zhao, do you want to try it?

549
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,030
We should give good things to our guests first.

550
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,870
Mr. Liu is our distinguished guest today.

551
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,070
Mr. Liu.

552
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,550
What do you think?

553
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,190
Mr. Zhao.

554
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,630
Actually,

555
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,550
the new pills have very strong effects.

556
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,470
If one has never taken Moon Star Herb pills before,

557
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,270
they may die

558
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,810
if they take the new pills.

559
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,570
Mr. Moyan, you must be joking.

560
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,150
If Mr. Liu has never taken the Moon Star Herb pills before,

561
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,510
how come he came all the way

562
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,770
to do the Moon Star Herb business with me?

563
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,190
Unless

564
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,110
he's not the son of the Liu family.

565
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,950
Am I right?

566
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,510
Mr. Liu.

567
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,410
Of course I take Moon Star Herb pills.

568
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,560
Mr. Liu.

569
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,110
Are you okay?

570
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,230
Yes.

571
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,730
The effect of the new pills is indeed 100 times stronger than old ones.

572
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,230
You are right.

573
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,230
Mr. Liu.

574
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,030
I didn’t lie to you.

575
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,500
From now on, we'll do the Moon Star Herb business

576
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,790
together in Taizhou.

577
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,570
Let's go. I'll show you the goods.

578
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,000
Greetings, Mr. Zhao.

579
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,590
Who are they?

580
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,670
Why are the two together?

581
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,190
Could it be that Senior Moyan secretly colluded

582
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,470
with the Zichen Department

583
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,390
and killed Master?

584
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,440
They asked me to help them make a living

585
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,550
so I let them be the guards in the mansion.

586
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,670
Now that you're here, work hard.

587
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,270
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

588
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,680
Xu Muchen?

589
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,310
Oh no.

590
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,280
You're Xu Muchen from Zichen Department?

591
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,870
Moyan!

592
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
How dare you betray the Duke!

593
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,090
Capture them!

How dare you...

611
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,230
You...

612

Xu Muchen.

I'll avenge my master.

Rong.

Liu Rong.

616
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,650
Kill him. Don't hesitate.

617
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,910
Xu Muchen.

618
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,910
It's time to tell her

619
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,950
Master is not dead.

620
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,880
Senior Moyan.

621
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,870
Look what you did today.

622
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,070
Do you think I'll still believe you?

623
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,950
Rong.

624
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,030
Master is not dead.

625
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,790
I'll take you to your master now.

626
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,790
Your master is inside.

627
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,910
Go in.

628
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,350
Master.

629
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,030
Master.

630
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,350
-Master.
-Master.

631
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,590
Alright, don't cry.

632
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,110
I'm fine.

633
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,710
I won't disturb you.

634
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,000
Master, what on earth happened?

635
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,130
It was my and Lord Xu's idea.

636
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,550
I was afraid Duke Su would see this through

637
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,680
so I didn't dare to tell you about this.

638
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,450
What was your idea?

639
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,970
That day, I tried to assassinate Lord Xu.

640
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,260
You're from Watermill?

641
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,600
Someone wants to kill Rong.

642
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,030
Protect her.

643
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,540
Who wants to kill Rong?

644
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,530
You're Rong's master?

645
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,200
Duke Su sent you here?

646
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,950
The one who wants to kill Rong

647
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,470
is Duke Su, right?

648
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,990
He's so cruel.

649
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,110
Why are you still working for him?

650
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,190
He did everything for Jing Dynasty.

651
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,990
Don’t slander him.

652
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,950
Fine.

653
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,270
Let me show you something.

654
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,350
You'll understand after you see it.

655
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,949
This

656
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,610
is what Duke Su wants the most.

657
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,730
It's also the ledger you asked Rong to steal.

658
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,989
But have you ever thought about

659
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:26,670
why Lord Hu and his family

660
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,870
got killed just because of this ledger?

661
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,030
[Duke Su conspired with the enemy. The evidence of his crimes is in Taizhou.]

662
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,150
It says that there are Moon Star Herbs in Taizhou

663
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,750
and that Duke Su is a traitor.

664
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,070
How did you get this ledger?

665
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,830
Lord Hu's daughter

666
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,270
risked her life to take this out.

667
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,510
[March 6, Year 8]

668
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,510
[February 1st, Year 8]

669
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,670
Do you know

670
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,870
[November 4th, Year 7]

671
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,870
[October 28, Year 7]

672
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,290
why Duke Su keeps growing the Moon Star Herb?

673
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,630
It's not a big deal if he just wanted to earn illicit money from it.

674
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,530
But I’m afraid he wants to shake Jing’s foundation.

675
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,270
How can I trust you

676
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,590
just because of this ledger?

677
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,520
This ledger was left

678
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,960
by my father when he was working on the flood control in Taizhou.

679
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,590
He died not long after that.

680
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,310
With so many evidences being here,

681
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,150
do you still think

682
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,010
Duke Su is devoted to the country?

683
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,130
If you still don't believe me,

684
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,650
we can go to Taizhou to find out the truth.

685
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,480
But before that,

686
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,610
please cooperate with me and make Rong believe I killed you

687
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,590
so that Rong will hate me.

688
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,710
Then Duke Su won't kill her.

689
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,790
So I asked Moyan to make medicines

690
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,850
which can make one's breath not felt.

691
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,310
You know

692
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,910
what happened next.

693
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,090
It was Master's order.

694
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,280
I had to obey it.

695
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,080
I came to Taizhou with Lord Xu this time

696
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,530
and let Moyan cooperate with Lord Xu.

697
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,710
What I saw in Taizhou

698
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,310
is the evidence

699
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,010
that we, the Watermill

700
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,760
has always been fooled and used by Duke Su.

701
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,710
So,

702
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,030
Duke Su planned all this?

703
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,910
Master, was it your idea to let Senior Brother

704
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,510
work with the Zhao's family?

705
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,690
After I feigned death,

706
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,590
Moyan understandably became Duke Su's pawn

707
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,430
to control Watermill.

708
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,070
So Mr. Zhao would listen to him.

709
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,600
What about the new pills Senior Brother made?

710
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,870
The pills he made are the antidotes to the poison of the Moon Star Herb.

711
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,190
If one takes the pills,

712
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,630
at first the pills will have similar effects as those of Moon Star Herb.

713
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,350
But if one keeps taking them for a long time,

714
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,680
they'll become less and less addicted to the Moon Star Herb.

715
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,670
Rong.

716
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,970
Lord Xu was worried about you.

717
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,290
He didn't want you to be in danger.

718
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,310
Go now.

719
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,970
He's waiting for you outside.

720
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,200
[Virtue and Morality]

721
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,280
[Virtue and Morality]

722
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:38,950
I'm sorry.

723
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,680
I'm sorry I made you sad.

724
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
Why didn't you tell me everything earlier?

725
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,290
Duke Su has many spies.

726
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,390
I was afraid he would see through us.

727
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,990
Besides,

728
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,040
Su Jinzhen was the one who divorced me,

729
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,950
not you.

730
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,070
What do you mean?

731
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,080
After we solve the case,

732
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,190
I have to marry another girl.

733
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,800
I'm talking about you.

734
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,270
Did mother get angry with me

735
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,950
because I left without telling everyone?

736
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,810
No, she didn't.

737
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,710
She scolded me instead.

738
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,470
Besides,

739
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,110
I came to Taizhou to do two things.

740
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,470
One is to investigate the case of the Moon Star Herb.

741
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,200
And the other

742
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,710
is more important.

743
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,910
What is it?

744
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,270
Are you going to catch Willow Leaf Thief Liu again?

745
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,500
[Virtue and Morality]

746
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,960
At my mother's request,

747
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,590
I came to Taizhou to take my wife back.

748
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,790
When I first came to Taizhou,

749
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,040
I also went to the river.

750
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,750
The place where we separated.

751
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,950
After we were separated that day,

752
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,170
I was rushed into the downstream forest.

753
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,550
Luckily, you taught me

754
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,830
how to identify the direction by observing stars.

755
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,190
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to get out of the forest.

756
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,950
After that, Master adopted me.

757
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,950
She saved my life.

758
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,270
Then I joined Watermill.

759
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,040
I was washed off the plank that day.

760
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,270
Luckily, the flood sent me to the river bed.

761
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,070
Some kind people saved me.

762
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,300
But when I remembered

763
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,030
that I needed to find my father,

764
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,910
I got the news that my father had died.

765
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,110
We promised to go see each other at the dock.

766
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,350
Did you go there later?

767
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,400
I went there once without telling my master about it.

768
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,600
But I didn't see you.

769
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,870
After I was saved,

770
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,400
I had a high fever every day.

771
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,300
When I could go out,

772
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,230
I waited for you there every day.

773
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,110
If you could wait a few more days,

774
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,280
the story of us would be different now.

775
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,110
I couldn't persuade Master to let me go back then.

776
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,370
I didn't dare to go out.

777
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,750
I could only pray for your safety.

778
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,950
I didn't expect to see you again.

779
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,610
Look at that star.

780
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,180
Its location changes every day.

781
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,530
[Virtue and Morality]

782
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,670
But after a year,

783
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,610
it would go around the moon again.

784
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,990
That's what stars do.

785
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,990
People are the same.
