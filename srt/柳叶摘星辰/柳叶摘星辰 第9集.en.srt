4
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,740
Concerning the case involving the Nanxiang Kingdom's envoy last time,

5
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,020
I already forgave you.

6
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,320
I won't easily forgive you this time.

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,270
I'm going to take back your title of Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

8
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,800
If you make a mistake again,

9
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,640
you will be punished severely.

10
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,720
Master.

11
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,979
Everyone, listen.

12
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,870
Yes.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,630
I've taken the title of Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

14
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,390
From now on, no one is allowed

15
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,070
to intervene in the case of Hu's Mansion.

16
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,800
Understand?

17
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,710
Yes.

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,950
Liu Rong.

19
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,270
Master,

20
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,940
I understand.

21
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,310
Master.

22
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:30,860
I...

23
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,590
Dismissed.

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
Yes, Senior.

25
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,150
Master,

26
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,220
although Rong made a mistake,

27
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,150
do you have to punish her like this?

28
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,750
Rong got hurt.

29
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,890
Go get her some medicine

30
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,690
so that she can heal completely.

31
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,930
Yes.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,060
What are you doing?

33
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,110
What can I do?

34
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,000
You can't handle this case.

35
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,180
Why not?

36
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,780
Do you know which case is related to Lord Hu's ledger,

37
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,150
which has been stolen?

38
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,760
I know.

39
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,410
Taizhou's water case.

40
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,880
Why... Why do you still want to meddle in it since you know?

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,030
The Xu family has a complicated relationship with this case.

42
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,750
Maybe the Ministry of Justice will...

43
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,070
What will the Ministry of Justice do?

Last night,

49
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,610
the Zichen Department guarded Hu's Mansion.

50
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,340
But Lord Hu and his family were murdered at night.

51
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,190
Don't you want to say anything?

52
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,910
I should take responsibility for this.

53
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,240
Since you plead guilty,

54
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,030
come with me to the Ministry of Justice.

55
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,430
The Ministry of Justice?

56
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,590
Why?

57
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,380
Although Xu Muchen

58
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,110
is guilty of incompetence

59
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,269
and negligence,

60
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,870
it's in the Zichen Department's purview

61
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,470
to hold him accountable.

62
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,510
Besides,

63
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,950
Xu Muchen has been suspended by me.

64
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,470
He's not an official now.

65
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,130
It's none of the Ministry of Justice's business.

66
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,710
But...

67
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,070
But Xu Muchen,

68
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,510
you want to catch Willow Leaf Thief Liu every day

69
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,470
to make contributions.

70
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,070
You fell into Willow Leaf Thief Liu's trap

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,470
and were lured away.

72
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,520
If you didn't think about catching the thief,

73
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,790
maybe the murderer couldn't have entered Hu's Mansion.

But now,

77
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,150
you are guilty.

78
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,950
Lord Gu,

79
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,610
don't change the topic in front of me.

80
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,080
The punishment for the crime of negligence

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,150
is not just suspension, right?

82
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,730
Lord Gongyang,

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,120
you're right.

84
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,190
Indeed, someone guilty of negligence

85
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,850
shouldn't only be suspended.

86
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,230
Look, yesterday,

87
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,680
the appearance of Willow Leaf Thief Liu

are responsible for catching Willow Leaf Thief Liu together.

92

But during the process of catching the thief,

93
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,070
due to your personal reasons,

94
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,910
you quitted temporarily

95
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,910
and didn't care about the mission of catching Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

96

Lord Gongyang,

97
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,640
is this negligence or not?

please don't make it difficult for us.

I just want to go in to mourn Lord Hu.

111

Lord Gu specially told us

112
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,190
not to let you

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,710
approach Lord Hu's mansion without permission.

Have you seen anyone suspicious recently?

We haven't seen anyone suspicious today.

119
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,550
I was removed from Watermill by my master

because of Lord Hu's murder case.

121

If I find out the truth,

122
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,470
she will definitely give the title of Willow Leaf Thief Liu

back to me.

124

Can you not make me worried?

If I didn't pass by,

141

from the prison of the Ministry of Justice?

145

Don't call me Jinning.

What do you plan to do next?

152
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,360
Of course I should find the murderer.

153
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,290
Otherwise, how can I gain a foothold in the martial world in the future?

Rong,

155
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,400
in my opinion,

156
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,950
you should do something relaxing.

157
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,350
You don't have to adventure in the martial world.

158
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,070
It's too dangerous.

159
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,310
It makes me worried.

160
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,630
You have a point.

161
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,470
Staying in Xu's Mansion is quite relaxing.

162
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,310
No way!

163
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,790
What I mean is

164
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,760
Xu Muchen is sinister and cunning.

165
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,780
If he finds out

166
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,390
you are not the daughter of the Su family,

167
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,630
he wouldn't allow you to stay in his mansion, right?

168
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,550
Also, if he finds out

169
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,390
you are Willow Leaf Thief Liu,

170
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,470
will he let you go?

171
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,750
What can I do?

172
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,030
Now I can't find anyone to help me.

173
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,920
I can help you.

174
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,730
Really?

175
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,039
Yes.

176
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,350
Leave the case of Hu's Mansion

177
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,110
to me.

178
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,950
Jinning,

179
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,390
you're a loyal friend.

180
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,909
Of course.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,110
I'm much more capable

182
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,110
than Xu Muchen.

183
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,170
Jinning, you're awesome.

184
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,700
Rong, I can help you.

185
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,310
Pat me gently. It hurts.

186
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,880
Okay.

187
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,910
It's a deal then.

188
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,370
See you.

189
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,750
How about letting me send you back?

190
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,870
Are these new storybooks of Baiyue Shop?

191
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,280
You're amazing.

192
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,670
You bought so many.

193
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,520
I'm familiar with the boss.

194
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,210
How come all the main characters are officials?

195
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,090
Boring.

196
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,520
Officials are good.

197
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,150
They are skilled in martial arts, intelligent,

198
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,470
gentle, and loyal.

199
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,470
Most importantly, they have steady incomes.

200
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,470
Look at this part.

201
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,890
The male lead gives a gift to a girl.

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,980
The girl doesn't like it,

203
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,740
but he keeps giving her gifts.

204
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,790
I think this storybook should change its name.

205
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,800
It should be renamed

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,330
Daily Skills for Getting a Wife Unsuccessfully.

207
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,910
[Live with integrity and purity]

208
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,530
Indeed, he is inflexible.

209
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,830
-He should give her what she likes.
-Wu Zhao,

210
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,830
come to the study.

211
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,270
Okay.

212
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,230
You read them first.

213
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,750
Go.

214
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,960
Xiao Qiu.

215
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,910
Is Young Master back?

216
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,550
Yes. He went to the study.

217
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,150
He pulled a really long face.

218
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,110
Isn't that normal?

219
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,790
That means he's in a good mood.

220
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,470
Young Madam.

221
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,710
Wu Zhao told me

222
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,310
Young Master has been suspended

223
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,470
because of Lord Hu's case.

224
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,910
Besides, Young Master Gongyang

225
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,990
of the Ministry of Justice is up to no good.

226
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,310
He wants to punish Young Master.

227
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,910
How can Young Master possibly be in a good mood?

228
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,430
Xiao Qiu,

229
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,500
are there pastries in the kitchen?

230
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,830
They made mint pastries today.

231
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,470
They said the pastries are for you.

232
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,270
I'm going to deliver them to him.

233
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,110
All of the Zichen Department's members

234
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,190
were punished

235
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,420
because of what happened today.

236
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,830
Lord Gu and Gongyang of the Ministry of Justice

237
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,950
are furious.

238
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,430
In this situation,

239
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,590
who do you think has the guts to help you steal the case file?

240
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,070
According to you, I should just stay at home

241
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,870
and do nothing, right?

242
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,200
What's wrong with that?

243
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,950
You can take the chance to accompany Old Madam and Young Madam.

244
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,430
Think about it.

245
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,750
Usually, you always stayed in the Zichen Department.

246
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm afraid if this continues,

247
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Young Madam won't be able to recognize you.

248
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,470
If you don't want to help me,

249
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,070
go back.

250
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:50,910
My Lord,

251
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,830
it's not that I don't want to help you.

252
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,270
We won't get any benefit if we handle the case properly.

253
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,780
It'll be our fault if we can't handle it properly.

254
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,950
Everyone else wants to avoid it.

255
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,470
Why do you insist on handling the case?

256
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,740
Since we've found out the murderer is Willow Leaf Thief Liu,

257
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,430
what does it matter if the murderer

258
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,690
is caught by you or not?

259
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,370
I don't think the murderer is Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

260
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,730
It should be someone else.

261
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,050
Why are you so sure?

262
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,600
Because I read her file before.

263
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,430
Willow Leaf Thief Liu only steals things. She doesn't kill people.

264
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,440
Besides, she was already exposed during the day.

265
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,270
If I were her,

266
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,930
I wouldn't come back to kill people at night.

267
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
I didn't expect

268
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,170
that he believes I didn't kill anyone.

269
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,050
Right,

270
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,550
there is her file over there.

271
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,750
Give it to me and I'll take a closer look.

272
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,210
Who is it?

273
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,550
Darling,

274
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,740
I'm worried you're too busy with work,

275
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,950
so I brought you some pastries.

276
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,550
Thank you, Honey.

277
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,350
Put them there. Go back and rest.

278
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Wu Zhao, have one.

279
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,790
Thank you, Young Madam.

280
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,800
These are your favorite mint pastries.

281
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,430
Why don't you eat one first?

282
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,670
Honey, I have work to do.

283
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,530
I'll eat later.

284
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,630
Then I'm putting them here.

285
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,560
Eat them when you finish your work.

286
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,040
Wu Zhao, take this away.

287
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,300
Send Young Madam back.

288
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,090
No need for that.

289
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,270
I can walk myself.

290
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,840
My Lord, what's wrong with you?

291
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,910
Young Madam just delivered pastries here

292
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,170
and you drove her away.

293
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,030
You disappointed her.

294
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,310
You sound like you understand her well.

295
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,510
I'm single.

296
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,270
I don't understand women's hearts.

297
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,130
But I'm slightly better than you.

298
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,470
Cut the crap.

299
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,440
I want all the files over there.

300
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,910
Wait.

301
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,360
Give it to me.

302
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,170
She has gone to bed?

303
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,660
She's gone to bed already?

304
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,570
♫The night was so quiet, with only the moonlight left♫

305
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,400
♫Lanterns were sunk in sleep under the eave♫

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,520
♫I looked into your eyes and forgot to speak♫

♫Love gradually grows♫

♫Turning the sunset into sweet words♫

319

325
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,970
Where's the quilt?

326
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,080
It was aired yesterday.

327
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,580
They took it to air it again today?

328
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,780
I was kind enough to deliver pastries to you,

329
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,290
but you gave me the cold shoulder.

330
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,820
You ungrateful man, I'll freeze you to death.

331
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,190
Let's see if you dare to bully me again.

332
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,510
Young Master, Young Madam,

333
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,740
have you gone to bed?

334
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,150
Old Madam suddenly wants to have black fruit tea.

335
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,680
She asked me to get it for her.

336
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,470
I'm... coming in.

337
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,420
Young Master, Young Madam.

338
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,950
I've found the tea.

339
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,910
I'm leaving.

340
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,630
I'm going back first.

341
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,310
Young Master, Young Madam,

342
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,310

No.

Leave if you don't want to make a tool.

Can't you see I have a lot of things to do here?

the clue he has found?

Of course I should investigate it.

I can't prove I'm innocent.

how can I get my title back?

how can I gain a foothold in the martial world

Are you really not going to help me?

629

It's not that I don't want to help you.

Fine. Since you won't help me,

I'll take this book back.

If Master asks,

638
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,190
just tell her I snatched it,

639

If I can't understand, I'll further study them.

I'll ask Xu Muchen for help.

649
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,270
The Zichen Department is knowledgeable anyway.

650
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,220
I'm sure he knows.

651

You can't do that.

I'll tell you.

this is the exclusive secret weapon of Hei Limao.

According to the clue given by the boss,

I got information in the black market.

00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,910
It's always been closed and strangers are not allowed to approach it.

681
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,340
It's very likely that he's hiding there.

682
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,150
Go.

683
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,150
Go to the Zichen Department and assemble our men.

684
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,620
Deploy them around Hei Limao's mansion.

685
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,390
But Lord Gu...

686
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,510
If we can catch him,

687
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,530
tell our men not to mention me,

688
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,590
so that they can be rewarded with some money.

689
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,670
But if...

690
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,870
There is no if. Go now.

691
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,030
Yes, My Lord.

692
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,350
You've been suspended, yet you're still thinking about the case.

693
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,270
Can you take a break?

694
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,550
And you, Zhen.

695
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,000
You're absent-minded too.

696
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,130
What is on your mind?

697
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,710
I'm thinking

698
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,510
about what happened to Lord Hu a few days ago.

699
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,710
I feel unsettled after hearing about it.

700
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,670
I want to go to Wanfo Temple tomorrow

701
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,790
to get a peace talisman for you and Muchen.

702
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,470
Indeed.

703
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,990
You are a girl.

704
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,430
It's normal for you to be scared after hearing about it.

705
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,830
You're very thoughtful.

706
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,550
Chen is on leave these days.

707
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,950
Let him go with you.

708
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,030
How can I investigate Hei Limao

709
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,550
if he goes with me?

710
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,550
No need for that.

711
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,770
I can go by myself.

712
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,550
Muchen is on leave.

713
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,670
He can take a rest.

714
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,310
Honey,

715
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,600
you said Wanfo Temple just now, right?

716
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,550
Yes.

717
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,710
That's great.

718
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,800
I'll go with you.

719
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,670
I also want to go out for a walk.

720
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,950
No, bro.

721
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,680
This is not the time

722
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,360
for you to show your love.

723
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,390
Okay.

724
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,760
It would be better if you go with me.

725
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,490

727
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,030
You don't have to follow us.

728
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,200
Just wait here.

729
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,040
Yes.

[Tianwang Hall]

732
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,030
Does he really want

733
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,990
to pray with me?

734
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,030
I have to get rid of him.

735
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,560
Honey.

736
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,030
I'm really sorry.

737
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,090
I'm supposed to pray with you,

738
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,150
but I have something urgent to do.

739
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,990
I have to go.

740
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,150
It's okay.

741
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,190
Go do your things.

742
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,150
I made an appointment with Ms. Wang to pray.

743
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,210
It'll take a while.

744
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,990
Okay.

745
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,450
Wait for me in the temple.

[Wanfo Temple]

747
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,350
Show yourselves.

748
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,180
Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

749
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,020
Why is he here?

750
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,230
Hei Limao,

751
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,350
why did you frame me?
