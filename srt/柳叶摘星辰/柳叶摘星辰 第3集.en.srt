[Episode 3]

4
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,750
I told you yesterday

5
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,320
that we are not a perfect match.

6
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,830
Why don't we divorce as soon as possible?

7
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,430
No way.

8
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,509
Not to mention His Majesty was the one who granted us the marriage

9
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,350
or whether the Su family can bear the consequences,

10
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,750
just speaking of myself,

11
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,950
if I divorce in less than three days after the wedding ceremony,

12
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,610
what will happen to my reputation in the future?

13
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,990
In that case, I have a suggestion.

14
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,090
Do you want to listen to it?

15
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,520
Go ahead.

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,530
Let's suspend the divorce

17
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,640
and establish three rules.

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,190
First,

19
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,990
even though we are in the name of husband and wife,

20
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,520
but we're not a real couple.

21
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,829
In Peaceful Residence,

22
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,390
we should always keep

23
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,320
a safe distance of more than 1 foot.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,530
Do we really have to do that?

25
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,230
Well, if that's the case,

26
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,150
only one foot away

27
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,910
may cause us to bump into each other sometimes.

28
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,960
How about making it three feet?

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,830
Deal.

30
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,980
But if we keep a distance of three feet,

31
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,110
we can't sleep on the same bed.

[Wedding]

33
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,200
Look at this small bed.

34
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,210
It's obviously inappropriate for me,

35
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,940
who is this tall, to lie in here.

36
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,890
I would suggest you...

37
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,050
Anyway, it's just temporary.

38
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,270
I'll make do with it here.

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,110
Go on with your work.

40
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll leave you to it.

41
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,990
Finally, I bought some time.

42
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,730
Master, don't worry.

43
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,150
Once I get the jade pendant,

44
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,590
I'll leave this place.

45
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,590
Where is the jade pendant?

46
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,030
The pillow and blanket,

47
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,080
one set for each of us.

48
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,680
Wait.

49
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,950
This is my territory.

if you face towards me?

55
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,080
You can just turn around.

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,030
When I turn around,

57
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,830
I feel someone watching my back.

58
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,040
Fine, I'll turn around.

59
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,430
Can you guarantee that you won't turn back all night?

60

If I wake up in the middle of the night

What do you want?

63
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,110
You can just move the bed aside.

why don't we divide the place

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,590
so that we can always be three feet apart?

It stinks.

173

What's this smell?

174
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,660

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,430
Do you really think

347
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,360
she's here for the Spring Banquet?

348
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,990
Let me tell you a secret.

349
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,430
Previously, Madam Gongyang

350
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,720
sent someone to the Duke's Mansion to propose marriage

351
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,950
but got rejected.

352
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,990
If so, is she here today

353
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,430
to make a scene?

354
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,790
[Zichen Department]

355
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,910
You two, take some men out of the city tomorrow.

356
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,510
Yes.

357
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,630
You'll enter through the west gate.

358
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,350
As for Wu Zhao, you lead your people to surround him from the north gate.

359
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,950
Yes.

360
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,390
I will go through the south gate and meet you guys.

361
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,710
Lord Gongyang is here.

362
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,430
My Lord.

363
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Gongyang is here.

364
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,750
Gongyang.

365
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,430
What is it?

366
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,180
Xu Muchen.

367
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,370
I'm at least one rank higher than you.

368
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,030
Shouldn't you people from the Zichen Department

369
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,870
at least address me as the Lord?

370
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,880
Lord Gongyang.

371
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,190
Lord Gongyang.

372
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,400
Rise.

373
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,080
Go back to your work.

374
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,040
Lord Gongyang, now can you tell me

375
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,390
why you are here?

376
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm here to collect the files of the Gold Inlaid with Jade Case.

377
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,630
The Gold Inlaid with Jade Case

378
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,430
has always been managed by the Zichen Department.

379
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,990
Why does the Ministry of Justice want the files?

380
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,550
Because you, Lord Xu, can't handle this case.

381
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,710
Why do you say so?

382
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,830
Did the owner of the Treasure Pavilion

383
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,150
give you 100 taels of silver to close the case?

384
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:14,790
He did,

385
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,440
but I didn't take it.

386
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,830
You didn't?

387
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,070
If so, where did you get the 200 taels

388
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,790
that you used to buy jade from Under-Secretary Li?

389
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,510
Why should I tell you?

390
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,190
Listen, Xu Muchen.

391
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,990
Now you're suspected

392
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,760
of taking bribes.

393
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,310
Today, I will not only investigate the files,

394
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,350
but also take your Lord Xu

395
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,270
away with me.

396
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,390
Lord Xu,

397
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,150
you sure followed your family rules strictly.

398
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,590
Like father,

399
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,910
like son.

400
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,750
Xu Muchen.

401
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,040
What?

402
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,030
Is corruption not enough?

403
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,220
Do you want to be charged with insubordination too?

404
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,590
-Mrs. Xu is here.
-Mrs. Xu.

405
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,350
Mrs. Xu.

406
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,870
Hello, Mrs. Xu.

407
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,870
You look great.

408
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,430
It's so lively today.

409
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,510
I haven't seen so many people

410
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,390
in a few years.

411
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,310
Sister.

412
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,500
Look at me.

413
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,410
I should address you as Princess.

414
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,350
Come on.

415
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,610
Greet to Her Highness.

416
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,630
Greetings, Your Highness.

417
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,390
Hold on, Madam Gongyang.

418
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,630
How can you address her as Princess?

419
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,710
Mrs. Xu

420
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,910
was demoted to a commoner ten years ago.

421
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,870
Oh yeah.

422
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,230
I have a poor memory.

423
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,910
Why do I always forget this?

424
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,040
You're a commoner now.

425
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,730
This must be Zhen.

426
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,690
Look at her, so young and pretty.

427
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,510
She's the Eldest Miss of the Duke's Mansion.

428
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,370
Servants!

429
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,110
This

430
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,470
is for you.

431
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,840
This

432
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,580
is for the Duke.

433
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,190
Please send my regards to His Grace.

434
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,720
Thank you, Madam Gongyang.

435
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,390
Duke Su has devoted his life to the country and the people.

436
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,110
Everyone knows that.

437
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,150
My husband and my son

438
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,350
admire His Grace very much.

439
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,050
If it weren't for the villain to interrupt,

440
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,430
we would have been relatives by marriage.

441
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,510
Madam Gongyang.

442
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,720
What do you mean?

443
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,030
What do I mean?

444
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,280
I'm praising Muchen for being capable.

445
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,950
They were not yet married,

446
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,710
but he broke into her boudoir

447
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,910
and forced her to get married.

448
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,870
Who wouldn't praise him for being

449
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,680
brave and resourceful after knowing it?

450
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
I'm afraid you've heard too much gossip

451
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,910
from those long-tongued women

452
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,510
and can't tell good from bad.

453
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,030
His Majesty granted them the marriage.

454
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,710
Could anyone say no?

455
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,430
But your son, Maocai, is more promising.

456
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,790
I heard your husband enrolled him in the Ministry of Justice.

457
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,440
He inherited his father's career.

458
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,190
That's good.

459
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,430
Don't mention it.

460
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,790
His rank's just a little higher than Muchen's.

461
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,190
And the salary is also a bit higher than that of the Zichen Department.

462
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,430
It's not a big deal.

463
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,590
Of course.

464
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,790
Muchen has no one to rely on.

465
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,110
He can only rely on himself.

466
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,070
But now, he's a fifth-rank official.

467
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,310
His Majesty also granted him the marriage.

468
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,540
In this case,

469
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,230
he's indeed more successful than your son.

470
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,590
That's true.

471
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,750
Previously, Duke Su

472
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,870
handled the case of Xu Chengsi by himself.

473
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,670
Now Muchen

474
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,030
can marry Jinzhen without any resentment.

475
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,950
He is really a capable man,

476
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,030
like his father.

477
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,590
Madam Gongyang,

478
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,480
didn't you bring some good tea?

479
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,030
Yes.

480
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,190
Let's taste it together.

481
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,000
-Mrs. Xu.
-Mrs. Xu.

482
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,670
Have some tea.

483
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,270
Yeah.

484
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,470
Why are you standing here?

485
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,870
Come in and enjoy the tea.

486
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,190
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

487
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,000
I heard Young Master Gongyang is here.

488
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:25,870
Hurry up.

489
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,930
Go back, all of you.

490
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,990
Young Master Gongyang,

491
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,630
it's been a few days.

492
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,830
You look more fresh-complexioned now.

493
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,870
Lord Gongyang,

494
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,110
I'm one rank above you.

495
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,250
Why don't you bow and greet me?

496
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,510
No need.

497
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,150
I heard you talking about

498
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,870
the 200 taels, right?

499
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,110
Xu Muchen

500
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,190
has always been impartial and law-abiding.

501
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,670
How could he take bribes?

502
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,110
The 200 taels you mentioned

503
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,390
is the salary Xu Muchen asked for in advance

504
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,110
for two years.

505
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,070
Come, look at this.

506
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,390
This is the IOU he wrote.

507
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,390
He even signed it.

508
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,140
[Now, I hereby advance two years' salary, totaling 200 taels of silver.]

509
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,150
Manager Zhou's money

510
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,410
was already sent back.

511
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,870
If you still have doubts,

512
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,830
you can go to the Treasure Pavilion

513
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,070
to ask around.

514
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:17,910
Right?

515
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,830
Lord Gongyang,

516
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,790
don't believe the statement

517
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,510
given by Under-Secretary Li only.

518
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,750
The first time I saw him,

519
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,410
I already knew he was a bad guy.

520
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,830
Under-Secretary Li is my uncle.

521
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,850
Actually, Under-Secretary Li is a good person.

522
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,260
Xu Muchen.

523
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,750
Don't let me get the goods on you.

524
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,110
Let's go.

525
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,150
Xu Muchen.

526
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,990
What's going on?

527
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,130
You didn't beat up his uncle, did you?

528
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,750
Under-Secretary Li is so old.

529
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,010
Why would I beat him up?

530
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,430
His men hit me,

531
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,600
so I defended myself.

532
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,950
I didn't expect him to be frightened and pass out.

533
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,950
You...

534
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,110
Young Master Gongyang

535
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,910
was playing tricks on you.

536
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,310
He might even get the Zichen Department involved.

537
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,190
Stop being unreasonable.

538
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,750
Hello, My Lord.

539
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,570
What do you mean by being unreasonable?

540
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,630
He was afraid that you might steal the spotlight

541
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,990
from the Ministry of Justice.

542
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,030
Do you know that?

543
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,990
Especially your father...

544
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,990
Behave yourself.

545
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,680
I didn't do anything wrong.

546
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,400
You're the one we looked for.

547
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,750
Let go of me!

548
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,390
It's true.

549
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:25,990
Let go of me!

550
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,920
Because of your father,

551
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,630
you can't get promoted, right?

552
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,950
But Young Master Gongyang

553
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,880
didn't benefit from it too, right?

554
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,550
He hates you the most

555
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,830
because you stopped him from getting promoted.

556
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,270
So you need to learn more.

557
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,950
These are the social norms.

558
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,080
Can you solve a case with social norms?

559
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,990
How dare you talk back to me?

560
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,590
You...

561
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,480
It occurs to me that

562
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,840
It's the third day of your wedding.

563
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,240
Why are you here again?

564
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,270
I'm leaving now.

565
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,090
Leaving...

566
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,470
This young man is very aggressive.

567
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,160
Like me.

568
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,870
Old Madam.

569
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,330
Everything is ready.

570
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,830
Got it.

571
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,960
Look at her clothes.

572
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,950
So beautiful.

573
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,070
They are pearls.

574
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,230
Yes.

575
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,980
Take it away.

576
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,670
I mean, take the tea away.

577
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,710
This is the Pu'er tea I've kept for years.

578
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,139
I brought it here today so that everyone can taste it.

579
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,820
Let's play a game.

580
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:39,110
If you can't tell what's good about the tea,

581
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,030
you will be punished.

582
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,190
What if we can tell?

583
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,870
I'll punish myself then.

584
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,030
Madam Gongyang wants to punish others just for having tea?

585
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,290
She's good at playing.

586
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,489
Let me do it.

587
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,510
Come on.

588
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,630
Have a taste.

589
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,750
Let's start with you.

590
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,230
The tea is clear

591
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,910
and fragrant.

592
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,990
Fresh and refreshing.

593
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,390
Such a poor evaluation.

594
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,000
Punish them.

595
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,520
Ten taels per person.

596
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,030
Ten taels.

597
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,570
Did she really mean it?

598
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,200
The Gongyang family is going to trick me again this year.

599
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,050
What should I do? It's my turn.

600
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,830
Mrs. Xu.

601
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,380
I would like to hear your opinion.

602
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,750
No matter what I say,

603
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,230
she will definitely humiliate me

604
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,690
and ask me to pay ten taels.

605
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,030
No matter what you say,

606
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,490
I will punish you for the ten taels of silver.

607
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,510
Zhen,

608
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,150
what do you think?

609
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,390
Me?

610
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,400
I only had tea at the roadside stands before.

611
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,660
I don't know anything about tea tasting.

612
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,670
Zhen'er has been drinking the finest tea

613
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,510
since she was young.

614
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,960
Ask her to judge it

615
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,670
is just bullying us.

616
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,200
Mrs. Xu.

617
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,610
Why don't you give your own judgment?

618
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,790
My daughter-in-law's judgment

619
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,110
represents my own one.

620
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,720
Didn't you bring the tea

621
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,510
for everyone to taste?

622
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,930
How can you treat everyone differently?

623
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,910
Zhen, tell me.

624
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,310
Judging from Madam Gongyang's behavior,

625
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,370
she's obviously here to pick a fight.

626
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,390
That's right, Zhen.

627
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,430
You're knowledgeable.

628
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,390
Just tell us.

629
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,630
Don't be shy. Tell us.

630
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,040
What should I do?

631
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,710
If I say something inappropriate,

632
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,240
they will find out I'm impersonating Miss Su.

633
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,510
Is a rich lady's life

634
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,350
so difficult?

635
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,510
Is there any other flavor

636
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,110
besides bitterness?

637
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,150
Glorious? Chivalrous?

638
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,870
What should I say?

639
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,610
Judging by her expression,

640
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,200
did my husband not keep the Pu'er tea well,

641
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,890
so it doesn't taste right?

642
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,590
It's getting more bitter

643
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,730
and astringent.

644
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,150
I, Liu Rong, can't go back

645
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,750
to see Master today.

646
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,510
Zhen,

647
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,690
we've been friends with the Gongyang family for generations.

648
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,230
Just talk turkey.

649
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,230
It's no big deal.

650
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,190
That's right.

651
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,190
Just say what you want.

652
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,790
What should I say?

653
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,510
Judging by the look on her face,

654
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,190
my tea must have gone bad.

655
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,550
Can I get another cup?

656
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,530
Of course.

657
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,670
It's just bitter.

658
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,630
Oh no.

659
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,350
I really can't taste anything else.

660
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,710
What should I say?

661
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,140
What an expert.

662
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,120
As the old saying goes,

663
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,750
if the tea has a strong aroma, drink three cups of it.

664
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,510
Amazing.

665
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,990
Am I right, Zhen'er?

666
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,040
Yes.

667
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,750
Zhen,

668
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,750
since you've drunk three cups,

669
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,110
tell us what you think.

670
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,760
After drinking three cups,

671
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,670
it quenches my thirst.

672
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,230
Why is Young Madam Xu's comment so vulgar?

673
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:07,950
Quench her thirst?

674
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,390
Yes.

675
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,590
It's not like a rich lady would say that.

676
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,990
Well said.

677
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,540
Tea is exactly used to appease thirst, isn't it?

678
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:16,740
Yes.

679
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,990
Miss Zhen.

680
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,950
Your review is so natural

681
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,410
and straight to the point.

682
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,310
Madam Gongyang, you flattered me.

683
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,080
I don't usually judge tea

684
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,630
and I'm not good at it.

685
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,230
You're being modest.

686
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,760
It's just that my tea is not worthy of the name.

687
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,910
Sorry for that, Miss.

688
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,330
You won

689
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,950
the 20 taels.

690
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,380
Any objections?

691
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,270
No, no, no.

692
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,350
No, no.

693
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,240
No.

694
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,190
It's yours.

695
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,200
Take it away.

696
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,420
Can I even win like this?

697
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,230
I'm so lucky.

698
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,430
Madam Gongyang,

699
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,990
I heard that

700
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,510
you brought the precious Fengwu qin here

701
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,240
to play against Mrs. Xu.

702
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,050
Exactly.

703
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,150
When Mrs. Xu and I were young,

704
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,990
we often played qin together.

705
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,990
We played together whenever we had time.

706
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,390
This time, we haven't seen each other for a long time.

707
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,650
Of course I won't miss this opportunity.

708
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,490
Miss Su is known in the capital for her qin and chess skills.

709
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,230
Sister.

710
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,240
Miss Su is more high-skilled

711
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,670
than us.

712
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,240
We are not at the same level.

713
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,390
It is better if it's just Sister and I

714
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,850
playing the qin together,

715
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,430
so that we can strengthen

716
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,050
the bond between us.

717
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,230
We've been playing qin together for so many years

718
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,270
that we're sick of it.

719
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,750
Why bother?

720
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,390
It's just that Zhen has married into my family.

721
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,190
She may have dealings with you in the future.

722
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,440
How about you two compare notes with each other

723
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,900
and strengthen your bond?

724
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,790
Forget it about me.

725
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,390
Let Miss Zhen perform a song for us.

726
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,350
It's our honor

727
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,710
to enjoy Miss Zhen's qin skills.

728
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,270
The delightful music will surely regale our ears.

729
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,790
Forget it about me.

730
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,030
Sounds good.

731
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,510
Zhen,

732
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,760
just simply play a song.

733
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,150
Don't be a wet blanket.

734
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,470
Miss Su is an excellent qin player.

735
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,470
We can enjoy it very much.

736
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,840
That's right, show us.

737
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,390
Yes.

738
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,450
Today, we can gain some insights too.

739
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,830
Miss Su, let's get started.

740
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,480
Please show us your wonderful qin skills.

741
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,110
Miss Su, don't just sit there.

742
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,190
Play it now.

743
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,170
That's right, start playing.

744
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,360
Yes.

745
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,670
We are all waiting for you

746
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,830
to show us.

747
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,620
What's wrong with them?

748
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,190
Haven't they heard of someone playing qin?

749
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,470
Yes, go ahead.

750
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,270
Was the harvest so good this year

751
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,530
that made you too full to do other things?

752
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,390
Oh no.

753
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,590
If I don't play a song today,

754
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,310
I'm afraid it won't end.

755
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,320
Hold on.

756
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,910
If I play it, I'll get caught faster.

757
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,990
If I knew this would happen,

758
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,190
I shouldn't have slacked off

759
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,470
when the Duke asked me to learn qin.

760
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,150
Zhen.

761
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,470
Play it.

762
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,940
Just say I don't know how to play qin.

763
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,310
No way.

764
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,230
Isn't that a public confession that I'm a fake?

765
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,150
Why don't I mess around

766
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,610
and leave the problem to Madam Gongyang?

767
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,710
No.

768
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,700
We can't use the same method twice.

769
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,590
I really want to find a hole to get in.
