00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,510
Not going?

176
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,560
Why not?

177
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,870
This is an assignment that I worked hard to snatch

178
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,190
from the Ministry of Justice.

179
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,600
Send this to the Grand Court tomorrow morning.

180
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,350
Yes, My Lord.

181
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,790
Instead of investigating the many unsolved cases,

182
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,230
you're going to be a bodyguard at a wedding.

183
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,030
If you want to go, go.

184
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,830
I'm not going.

185
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,590
Lord Hu is in the Ministry of Revenue.

186
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,000
He is in charge of dispensing military pay,

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,830
and even the Ministry of Justice is polite towards him.

188
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,030
Why aren't you going?

189
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,150
You're still being picky?

190
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,790
Brother.

191
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,280
This autopsy report

192
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,590
has no details at all.

193
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,830
You call this an autopsy report?

194
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,830
You have to rewrite it tonight, even if you don't sleep.

195
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,670
Got it?

196
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,230
Yes.

197
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,810
We, Zichen Department, keep the community safe.

198
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,630
We don't pander to imperial relatives or nobles.

199
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,830
Stop right there!

200
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,110
What's in that head of yours?

201
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,310
I've accepted the assignment for Zichen Department already anyway.

202
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:47,950
You have to go

203

no matter what.

204
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,230
Don't forget

205
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,790
you took

206
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,270
a 2-year advance on your salary.

207
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,130
You can't afford to offend the Ministry of Revenue.

208
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,790
Go back and rest early.

209
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,790
Tomorrow morning,

210
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,600
take your men to Hu's Mansion!

211
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,710

Everything is here.

214
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,190
Tonight, I'll go to Hu's Mansion to scout the place

215
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,450
and locate the ledger.

Where are you going with that?

219
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,060
We agreed not to intervene in each other's affairs.

Stop.

221
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,610
I thought we talked about this last night.

222
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,150
Actually, I have an appointment with Miss Qin

223
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,350
to learn embroidery.

224
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,770
The capital is not safe lately.

225
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,170
Don't go out if there's nothing important.

226
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,310
But I've already agreed to it.

227
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,710
I can't go back on my word.

228
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,520
Right.

229
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,990
I'll ask Wu Zhao to prepare a carriage

230
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,990
to send you there.

231

I got it wrong.

233

He asked me for leave.

234
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,270
I'll prepare the carriage.

235
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,400
I'll send you there.

236

Darling.

237
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,340
Actually, I don't have to go.

238
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,520
Didn't you agree to it already?

239
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,590
It's just embroidery.

240
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,850
I can learn it anytime.

241

My husband is more important.

242

You came back to get your things, right?

243
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,960
After you're done,

244
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,560
do you have to return to duty?

245
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,070
I'm off tonight.

246
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,950
I have an assignment tomorrow morning.

Is it very early?

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,650
How early?

251
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,470

Sure.

No.

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,070
Thank you.

349
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,240
So much medicine for a mahjong game.

350
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,310
Thank you so much.

351
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,470
Three Dots.

352
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,290
One Character.

353
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,850
Eight Characters.

354
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,260
Mother, I need to go to the toilet.

355
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,950
Xiao Dong, Xiao Dong.

356
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,990
Which one?

357
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,530
Your Ladyship,

358
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,880
I really have no solution for this.

359
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,310
I can't do more than a few rounds on my own.

360
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,150
Come back quickly.

361
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,010
Three Bamboos.

362
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,930
Take it. Four Characters.

363
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,830
Don't take too much time. Come back quickly.

364
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,830
Come back soon.

365
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,750
Hurry up, Mrs. Xu.

366
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,110
Don't be anxious.

367
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,840
You're going to win soon. How can I not be anxious?

368
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,230
Play that.

369
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,030
Okay, okay.

370
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,780
Xiao Dong.

371
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,030
Tell Young Madam to come back quickly.

372
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,550
Go.

373
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,550
Yes.

374
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,070
You

375
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,870
really can't live without your daughter-in-law.

376
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,320
Wait, wait.

377
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,990
Quick, play.

378
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,600
This...

379
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,670
Senior,

380
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,640
do you know where the ledger is?

381
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,900
Of course I do.

382
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,550
You wouldn't happen not to know, would you?

383
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,150
How could I not know?

384
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,390
I'm afraid of any discrepancies

385
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,590
between our clues,

386
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,050
so I'm just trying to compare notes with you.

387
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,530
Compare notes with me?

388
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,670
Okay, you go first then.

389
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,350
Senior.

390
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,450
I don't know, alright?

391
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,310
Xu Muchen didn't go out at all last night.

392
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,350
I didn't have the chance to scout the location.

393
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,550
Junior,

394
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,110
you've only married into the Xu family for a few days.

395
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,430
Have you forgotten everything

396
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,350
that Master taught you?

397
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,590
Alright, stop.

398
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,870
Just tell me where it is.

399
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,390
I'll just sneak it out.

400
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,990
I can tell you,

401
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,050
but you're going to have to give me the ledger once you sneak it out.

402
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,910
Also,

403
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,830
you have to admit to Master

404
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,350
that you failed at your job.

405
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,550
As for how Master decides to punish you,

406
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,750
it's her business.

407
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,420
There's no need for that.

408
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,690
Okay. Good luck to you then.

409
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,890
Fine, I'll give it to you after I steal it.

410
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,430
Deal.

411
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,870
Tonight,

412
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,230
I'll wait for you at the top floor of the Windswept Pavilion in Hu's Mansion.

413
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,960
The ledger is in the back study.

414
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,160
Go find it yourself.

415
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,150
Senior,

416
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,150
I have another favor to ask of you.

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,910
Nightwear.

418
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,070
You...

419
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,910
I'll go out first.

420
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,830
Come out later.

421
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,290
Don't follow too closely.

422
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,920
I finally handled Senior.

423
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,760
But then again,

424
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,070
Mother

425
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,070
can't leave me even for a moment now.

426
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,350
I've used all my

427
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,830
pretend-to-be-sick tricks from Master.

428
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,510
But Mother

429
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,750
is on another level.

430
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,810
Looks like I need to find another way.

431
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,350
I can pretend to fall into the water

432
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,680
and leave the main hall.

433
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,230
It's a little cold,

434
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,870
but for the mission,

435
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,830
Liu Rong, you can do it.

436
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,830
Go!

437
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,980
[Gentle breeze blows slowly]

438
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,350
Miss Su.

439
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,250
You must be Young Madam Xu.

440
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,600
Well, I don't know you.

441
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,260
There's a lot of food in the front yard.

442
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,830
Why don't you go eat something?

443
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,740
Just get on with your stuff.

444
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,480
-I...
-Brother Muchen is so lucky

445
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,560
to marry such a beautiful wife.

446
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,430
Who are you?

447
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,590
I'm Hu Shanshan.

448
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,590
Lord Hu is my father.

449
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,190
My sister is the one getting married today.

450
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,750
Don't tell me Brother Muchen

451
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,430
didn't mention me?

452
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,910
Are you close to Xu Muchen?

453
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,750
We grew up together.

454
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,670
That's great!

455
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,960
Xu Muchen is on duty in the front hall.

456
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:45,190
[Gentle breeze blows slowly]

457
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,330
You two go and catch up.

458
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,150
How could you not know

459
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,230
that Brother Muchen hates

460
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,390
to be disturbed when he's on duty?

461
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,590
If he were to be distracted by me,

462
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,550
he will certainly blame me.

463
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,510
We are all family.

464
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,670
What's there to blame?

465
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,630
This position is very important.

466
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,870
You two must keep an eye on it.

467
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,640
Xu Muchen!

468
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,560
Yes, My Lord.

469
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,320
Come here.

470
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,870
Look who this is.

471
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,280
Go.

472
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,350
Yes.

473
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,170
[Gentle breeze blows slowly]

474
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,120
Honey.

475
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,310
Greetings, Brother Muchen.

476
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,270
Miss Hu.

477
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,310
What's going on?

478
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,270
You used to call me Sister Shanshan.

479
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,830
Why are you so distant?

480
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,150
You haven't met for a long time, so of course you're distant.

481
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,060
The garden in front of your mansion is so beautiful.

482
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,400
You two should go for a walk.

483
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,330
You can catch up.

484
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,430
Once you've caught up, you won't be distant anymore.

485
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:26,950
Honey.

486
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,680
Did you misunderstand us?

487
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,420
Miss Hu and I

488
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,490
just studied for a few days together when we were kids.

489
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,220
There's no misunderstanding.

490
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,390
Childhood sweethearts who played together.

491
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,430
what's there to misunderstand?

492
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,750
You two go talk.

493
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,790
Sister.

494
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,430
The more you do this,

495
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,560
the more I think you misunderstood us.

496
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,670
I don't have time

497
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,190
to misunderstand your stupid affairs.

498
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,370
Fine, I misunderstood.

499
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,720
But it's not because of you.

500
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,930
[Gentle breeze blows slowly]

501
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,340
Xu Muchen.

502
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,590
If you don't explain

503
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,230
what your relationship is today,

504
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,750
don't even think of leaving.

505
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,350
Honey.

506
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,880
Didn't I tell you just now?

507
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,300
We only studied together for a few days.

508
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,770
Studied together for a few days?

509
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,510
You studied together for a few days

510
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,850
and you call her Sister Shanshan? Is that appropriate?

511
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,590
Sister.

512
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,270
It's not what you think.

513
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,390
I'm on duty.

514
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,550
Honey, knock it off.

515
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,750
You think I'm being unreasonable?

516
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,990
If you don't explain it to me today,

517
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,320
don't think of leaving.

518
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,400

00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,390
Go down now.

690
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,310
I don't know Miss Hu very well.

691
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,630
I'm not interested.

692
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,470
My Lord!

693
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,880
Lord Hu and his family have been murdered!

[Airy vermillion pavilion]

696
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,310
Last night, Hu's second daughter came home

697
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,350
to look for her father to pick out jewellery for her sister.

698
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,470
But when she pushed the door, she found

699
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,430
she found that her parents and sister had been killed.

700
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,560
We rushed here once we heard the noise.

701
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,650
According to the coroner's autopsy,

[The Hu Family Murder Case]

703
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,200
Their faces were pale and their lips were purple.

704
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,040
They had swollen abdomens.

705
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,910
[Autopsy Records of Hu's Mansion case]

706
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,630
The autopsy results show that they were poisoned to death.

707
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,110
The shallow cut on Lord Hu's neck

708
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,180
seems to have been made by an iron weapon.

709
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,790
Willow Leaf Thief Liu stole in the middle of the night

710
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,700
and then Lord Hu's whole family was killed.

711
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,050
There must be a connection.

712
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,030
But Willow Leaf Thief Liu's weapons don't carry poison.

713
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,720
She didn't kill Lord Hu.

714
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,790
Lord Gu.

715
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,560
Xu Muchen, why are you here?

716
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,480
There's a murder here, of course I'll be here.

717
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,990
Xu Muchen, Xu Muchen.

718
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,990
I gave you such a good job.

719
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,710
Instead of staying put and guarding Hu's Mansion here,

720
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,190
why did you go after Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

721
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,430
Have you ever

722
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,890
taken my words seriously?

723
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,010
I will find Willow Leaf Thief Liu as soon as possible.

724
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,430
Don't mention that name again.

725
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,270
Let me tell you.

726
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,870
You're not in charge

727
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,910
of that case anymore.

728
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,830
I'm giving it to someone else.

729
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,190
Go home now!

730
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,270
Go home and reflect on yourself.

731
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,680
Come back

732
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,110
when you've thought things through.

733
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,590
This case must be investigated to the end.

734
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,910
Willow Leaf Thief Liu showed up last night

735
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,350
and Lord Hu and his family were killed.

736
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,680
Even if she didn't do it,

737
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,700
it must be related.

738
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,630
Shut up!

739
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,190
From now on,

740
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,460
you're suspended.

741
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,830
Put down your uniform

742
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,920
and badge.

743
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,270
With your suspension, Zichen Department

744
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,730
has nothing to do with you.

745
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,470
Go back now!

746
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,810
Don't you understand?

747
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,030
Go!

748
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,510
Go back!

749
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,750
Stay here.

750
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,460
Go!

751
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,070
You may leave.

752
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,710
Yes.

753
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:29,990
Master.

754
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,570
How dare you come back?

755
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,870
I was careless

756
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,160
and caused trouble for Watermill.

757
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,090
But I also brought the ledger back.

758
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:43,870
Careless?

759
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,790
How big a crime is it to assassinate a court official?

760
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,910
Your carelessness

761
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,430
has brought Watermill

762
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,590
down with you.

763
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,310
Senior, I didn't...

764
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,910
Shut up!

765
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,990
Rong.

766
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,350
Yes.

767
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,260
You're now a wanted murderer.

768
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,550
You returning to Watermill

769
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,870
will only cause us trouble.

770
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,510
Master.

771
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,070
I just went to steal the ledger.

772
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,510
I didn't even see Lord Hu.

773
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,800
How could I kill him?

774
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,030
What's the point of telling me this?

775
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,310
Will the Ministry of Justice spare you

776
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,710
because of what you said?

777
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,070
But I didn't kill anyone.

778
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,040
Why don't you believe me?

779
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,770
Does it matter if I believe you?

780
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,190
The 8th rule of Watermill's Sect Rules,

781
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,750
disciples shall not be involved in murder.

782
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,390
I already spared you

783
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,840
for the Nanxiang Kingdom envoy case.

784
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,900
I won't let you off lightly this time.

785
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,810
I'll take your place as Willow Leaf Thief Liu first.

786
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,590
If you make a mistake again,

787
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,830
you will be punished severely.
