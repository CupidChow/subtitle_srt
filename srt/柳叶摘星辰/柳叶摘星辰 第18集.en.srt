He committed such a serious crime,

342
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,830
but His Majesty still pardoned you and your son.

343
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,230
He has already shown extreme forbearance.

344
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,470
Stop being unreasonable here.

345
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,940
Go back.

346
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,190
Your Majesty.

347
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,110
Chengsi is innocent.

348
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,360
Your Majesty,

349
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,590
please further investigate it.

350
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,950
Your Majesty.

351
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,620
Your Majesty.

352
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,220
Why haven't they carried out the execution yet?

353
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,950
My Lord,

354
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,340
it's time

355
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,620
for the execution.

356
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,350
Just kill him.

Ready to execute him.

00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,870
What are you doing?

359
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,850
I'm going to save him.

360
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,930
Do you want to die?

361
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,920
You want to save him alone.

362
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,580
Do you want to die for a man?

363
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,670
Why haven't they done it yet?

364
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,500

Execute him.

368
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,510
Execute him.

369
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,070
Kill this traitor!

370
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,230
Kill him!

371
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,910
Execute him.

372
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,550
What are you waiting for?

373
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,390
Traitor!

374
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,670
He betrayed the country and deserves to die.

375
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,530
Lord Gongyang,

376
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,990
I'm going to say it again.

377
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,460
It's time.

378
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,880
Order them to execute him.

[Behead]

Kill him! Kill him!

Gongyang Maocai,

383
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,430
this is my last warning.

384
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,790

There's an assassin.

Stop!

393
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,280
An imperial edict is here.

394
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,470
According to the emperor's edict,

395
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,710
in the case of the Ministry of War's stolen map,

396
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,170
there is a new witness now.

397
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,530
The treason of Xu Muchen, Governor of the Zichen Department,

398
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,770
is not true.

399
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,090
Thus, he has been pardoned from the death penalty.

400
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,550
The Zichen Department shall investigate this case thoroughly.

401
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,080
Xu Muchen shall atone for his crime.

402
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,950
Respect this.

403
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,150
Got it.

404
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,410
My Lord.

405
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,940
My Lord, you've suffered.

406
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,460
Let's go. Let me send you back.

407
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,010
My Lord, be careful.

408
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,980
Watch the steps.

409
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,320
Mrs. Xu,

410
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,810
my master wants to see you.

411
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,000
Mrs. Xu.

412
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,460
Lord Liu, you asked me here...

413
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,150
Xu Muchen was almost beheaded in public.

414
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,470
It made you worried.

415
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,530
This has something to do with us.

416
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,940
I invited you here

417
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,290
to specially apologize to you.

418
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,750
Yes.

419
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,680
My son

420
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,920
is loyal and diligent.

421
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,480
But in the end, he was accused of treason.

422
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,950
Lord Liu, are you familiar with this trick?

423
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,610
Someone powerful

424
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,810
has confused right and wrong.

425
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,090
All these years, I've been worried every day.

426
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,190
But it still happened.

427
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,320
You're still investigating

428
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,390
Chengsi's case, right?

429
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,170
Why?

430
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,420
Why can't you just give up?

431
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,360
I've already given up.

432
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,640
As long as the case's mastermind

433
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,700
is not brought to justice,

434
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,490
Chengsi's name can't be cleared

435
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,770
and it will be a hidden problem

436
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,400
to the court and the country.

437
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,270
Mrs. Xu,

438
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,220
we will do our best

439
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,870
and be cautious.

440
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,960
Back then, how many people died

441
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,670
in order to find out the truth?

442
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,880
Some were assassinated

443
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,670
and some were wronged.

444
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,820
I'm scared.

445
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,340
I really am scared.

446
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,960
I just want to be with my son

447
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,060
and keep him safe.

448
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,390
But he just wouldn't listen.

449
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,310
He insisted on getting involved.

450
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,540
Look at him now.

451
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,350
He almost lost his life.

452
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,830
Mrs. Xu,

453
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,360
even if... even if we give up,

454
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,330
do you think the mastermind

455
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,180
will let Muchen go?

456
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,760
You're back.

457
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,880
Did you ask His Majesty for the imperial edict?

458
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,320
I'm asking you.

459
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,110
Yes.

460
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,250
Anyway, he is Zhen's husband now.

461
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,600
The crime of treason

462
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,330
will inevitably implicate us.

463
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,750
You don't want our family to be implicated.

464
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,010
You've become more sensible.

465
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,730
But have you thought about it?

466
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,909
This

467
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,360
can make Liu Rong divorce him.

468
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,120
I do want them to divorce,

469
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,420
but I really don't intend to kill him.

470
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:37,050
You're too soft-hearted.

471
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,710
How can you be successful in the future?

472
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:41,909
Father,

473
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,090
I want to ask you something.

474
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,750
What you gave me is Lord Chen's file.

475
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,480
Why did it turn out to be the map?

476
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,500
[The Ministry of Justice]

477
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,310
The case handling process of the Ministry of Justice

478
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,640
is really complicated.

479
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,550
His Majesty has issued an edict,

480
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,760
but it still consumed much of our time.

481
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,630
My Lord.

482
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,510
-Watch the steps.
-The wound on your back

483
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,670
still hasn't fully healed,

484
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,530
but you suffered again in prison.

485
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,060
I'm fine.

486
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,010
Right, Lord Gu,

487
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,030
have you caught the person who stole the map?

488
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,150
Not yet.

489
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,480
Then why did His Majesty...

490
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,250
Turn yourself in?

491
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,930
Yes.

492
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,910
Jinning,

493
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,110
don't joke with me.

494
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,990
Xu Muchen

495
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,430
is accused of treason.

496
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,030
This is not a trivial matter.

497
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,600
I don't know about the treason.

498
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Xu Muchen has been mean to my sister,

499
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,170
so I asked a servant to imitate Willow Leaf Thief Liu's mark.

500
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,910
I asked him to make a box and hide it in Xu's Mansion.

501
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,930
I just wanted Xu Muchen to suffer in prison

502
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,920
by accusing him of colluding with Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

503
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,030
I didn't expect

504
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,160
that someone put the map in the box.

505
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,470
The new wound on the servant's finger

506
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,270
was left when he carved the mark.

507
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,200
My Lord,

508
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,580
I only carved the box

509
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,230
and put it among those gifts.

510
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,390
I really don't know about the map.

511
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,300
My Lord,

512
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
please investigate it thoroughly.

If that is the case,

since someone has taken the map,

515
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,290
he'll need to get it out of the city.

Don't worry, Lord Xu.

The Ministry of Justice has dispatched all men

Lord Gongyang,

I think His Majesty

525
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,070
ordered the Zichen Department

526
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,140
to handle the map's case.

527
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,790
The map's case concerns the country's safety.

Of course the Ministry of Justice can't sit by.

Now that we have a new clue,
