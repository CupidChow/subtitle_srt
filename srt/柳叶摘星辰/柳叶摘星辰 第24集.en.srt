My Lord.

00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,470
What's wrong?

7
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,729
Father.

8
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,750
Are you okay?

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,490
I'm fine.

10
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm just thirsty.

11
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,630
You leave with my father first.

12
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,829
Take good care of him.

13
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,670
I'll get some water and be back soon.

14
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,730
Yes, Young Master.

Duke Su.

21
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,610
You persecuted loyal men

22
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,390
by colluding with the enemy and betraying the country.

23
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,190
It's time for you to pay the price

24
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,410
today.

25
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,490

[Chen's Mansion]

for the past fifteen years.

29

Please accept my bow.

Nephew, please rise.

31
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,010
Your father has been wronged for fifteen years.

32
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,750
Now treacherous villains including Duke Su are rooted out.

33
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,950
Nephew.

34
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,470
You're a great young man.

35
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,510
Please accept my bow.

36
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,950
Uncle, please don't do that.

37
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,590
If it weren't for your persistence

38
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,720
and the sacrifice of other ministers,

39
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,070
it would be hard for me to reverse the case

40
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,350
even if I'm capable.

41
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,070
Nephew, don't worry.

42
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,760
I will hand over the ledger protected by Brother Chengsi

43
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,950
with his life to His Majesty.

44
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,350
Thank you, Uncle.

45
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,190
The journey back to the capital is far.

Don't worry, My Lord.

You can

51

count on me.

52

Uncle.

54

Here.

60
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,030
Ms. Yu Luocha, thank you for helping me

61
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,070
solve the case of Duke Su.

62
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,750
If it weren't for Lord Xu,

63
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,570
I would still be deceived by Duke Su

64
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,210
and even assist the evildoer.

65
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,210
Thank you, Lord Xu.

66
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,200
Master.

67
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,710
No need to be so polite.

68
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,570
We're a family.

69
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,070
How is that a family?

70
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,860
Didn't Lord Xu marry Su Jinzhen, rather than Liu Rong before?

71
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,880
Aren't you clear of that?

72
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,230
Be quiet and focus on your meal.

73
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,220
I'm telling the truth.

74
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,060
Don't deny it.

75
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,000
All right.

Ms. Yu Luocha.

Although I'm Mumu's master,

her marriage

88
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,230
depends on her own will.

You weren't like this before.

92

Mumu.

93
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,290
Please marry me.

94
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,310
I'm serious.

95
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,640
Can't you ask Master when there're only three of us?

96
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,020
Now

97
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,400
everyone is going to make fun of me.

98
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,640
Mumu.

99

I'm serious.

Young Master Gongyang.

101
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,540
Mumu didn't say no.

102
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,970
That means she agreed.

103
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,390
Isn't it obvious?

104
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,850
Isn't it obvious?

105
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,650
Mumu.

106
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,630
Is what he said true?

107
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,630
Be quiet and focus on your meal.

108
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,150
Here.

109
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,590
A toast to all of you.

110
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,789
Here comes the imperial edict.

111
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,830
Under the blessing from heaven, the imperial edict reads as follows.

112
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,520
The Yue State keeps causing disturbances on the border

113
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,430
and tries to invade our land.

114
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,640
Senior General in the South died on the battlefield.

115
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,820
The extreme grief in my heart

116
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,560
is beyond description.

117
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,610
Xu Muchen, Governor of the Zichen Department,

118
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,680
is an intelligent elite

119
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,510
of the country.

120
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,910
Therefore, I order Xu Muchen to lead 100,000 elite soldiers

121
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,540
to fight the Yue State in Taizhou

122
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,920
so as to solve the territorial crisis.

123
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,190
I look forward to

124
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,550
good news of victory.

125
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,150
That's all.

126
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,160
I will follow His Majesty's order.

127
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,830
Lord Xu.

128
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,000
To avoid any delay,

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,330
Lord Xu, please depart for the barracks as soon as possible.

130
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:16,990
Honey.

131
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,000
Is anything bothering you?

132
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,620
The Yue State has been coveting our country for years.

133
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,230
The enemy has the military map of our country.

134
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,270
Their military actions are gaining momentum.

135
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,430
I'm not sure

136
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,870
if I can repulse the attacks.

137
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,290
Don't worry, darling.

138
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,150
I'll always be by your side

139
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,910
no matter when.

140
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,590
No, you can't go with me to the battlefield.

141
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,350
Why?

142
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,880
It's too dangerous.

143
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,030
You'd better stay here

144
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,910
and wait for me.

145
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,830
No.

146
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,740
I must go with you.

147
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,270
Honey.

148
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,750
There's no game on the battlefield.

149
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,470
I'm not joking.

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,510
You're a talent of our country.

151
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,570
It's your duty to protect the people.

152
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,110
But I am your wife.

153
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,690
I should stay by your side.

154
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,550
Then promise me

155
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,550
you'll prioritize your own safety

156
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,990
no matter what happens.

157
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,430
Okay.

158
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,540
Also...

159
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,590
Don't worry.

160
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,390
I will protect myself.

161
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,170
I won't make you worry.

162
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,810
You don't believe me?

163
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,270
Let's set rules.

164
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,470
Xu Muchen, what are you doing?

165
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,930
Are you really going to write down the rules?

166
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,390
Rong.

167
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,030
Senior.

168
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,320
Why are you here?

169
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,590
What?

170
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,150
Can't I come?

171
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,210
I didn't mean that.

172
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,110
Are you really going to the battlefield

173
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,150
with Xu Muchen?

174
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,870
Yes.

175
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,270
We have a deal.

176
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,990
He protects the country

177
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,360
while I protect him.

178
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,150
But it's a pity

179
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,710
that I can't attend the wedding of you and Young Master Gongyang.

180
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,130
You are not into a banquet.

181
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,440
It won't be a pity.

182
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,910
But it's your wedding.

183
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,150
It's a pity

184
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,680
that I can't be with you.

185
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,470
It's your good wishes

186
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,150
that count.

187
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,990
Here.

188
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,710
Wear it when you leave.

189
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,150
Senior.

190
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,210
Why are you giving it to me?

191
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,470
You will risk your life to protect the country.

192
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,870
You need it more than I do.

193
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,350
Protect yourself.

194
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,610
I didn't expect

195
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,390
I gave you the credit

196
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,270
for protecting the country

197
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,950
after competing with you for so many years.

198
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,590
What?

199
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,350
Do you regret resigning?

200
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,240
No.

201
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,910
I speak highly of myself,

202
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,870
thinking that no one can be on a par with me.

203
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,270
You are not an exception.

204
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,710
I know that.

205
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,350
I used to wonder

206
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,920
why you, a sinner's son,

207
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,180
could live in such a carefree way.

208
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,590
That's why I always wanted to suppress your pride.

209
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,190
Now I understand.

210
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,070
You live freely

211
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,750
because you have a faith in justice in your heart.

212
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,920
I know that too.

213
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,420
Come on.

214
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,190
Muchen.

215
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,310
I don't want to be too emotional.

216
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,800
I wish you a triumphant return.

217
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,230
Thank you, Gongyang.

218
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,960
Now the enemy is stronger than us.

219
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,690
The soldiers are in low morale.

220
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,930
If the supplies cannot reach in time,

221
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,420
we can only hold on for five more days at most.

222
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,670
Wu Zhao?

223
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,550
Wu Zhao?

224
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,550
My Lord.

225
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,150
Young Madam.

226
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,080
Why are you here?

227
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,230
My Lord is ordered to lead the army.

228
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,960
How can I be absent?

229
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,200
I've reported to the court.

230
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,070
From now on,

231
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,270
I'm your lieutenant.

232
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,530
I even got half a rank higher than before.

233
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,790
I didn't expect

234
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,450
you were so ambitious.

235
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,540
I'll leave you to your work.

236
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,670
I'll go wash my face.

237
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,470
Wu Zhao.

238
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,870
How is Uncle Liu?

239
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,910
Don't worry, My Lord.

240
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,310
I have sent him

241
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,630
to the capital safely.

242
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,990
Lord Liu has handed over evidence regarding Duke Su

243
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,310
to His Majesty.

244
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,510
Xiao Qiu and I

245
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,430
came here as soon as possible

246
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,030
after we reported to Lord Gu.

247
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,270
Thank you.

248
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,480
My Lord.

249
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,630
How is the battle?

250
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,460
Not good.

251
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,150
The Yue State has occupied three cities of our country.

252
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,280
Now our army has been in a passive role.

253
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,710
Although the situation has been stabilized these days,

254
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,030
the commander-in-chief on the western front died

255
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,510
and there's no commander there.

256
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,570
I'm afraid we couldn't hang in there.

257
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,000
We've lost three cities

258
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,470
for the past few days?

259
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,150
The Yue State has the map of our military operations.

260
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,830
They know the way we arrange troops and deliver supplies

261
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,030
very well.

262
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,920
And their commander-in-chief

263
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,110
is familiar with our water routes.

264
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,470
They are attacking us in the dark.

265
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,160
Who's the commander-in-chief of Yue?

266
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,030
According to the information,

267
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,760
the commander-in-chief of Yue

268
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,590
is Su Jinning.

269
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,870
Su Jinning?

270
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,190
Why would he lead troops?

271
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,440
He was conferred the title of General

272
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
after sending the map to Yue.

273
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,380
After Duke Su's death,

274
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,230
he will definitely take this opportunity

275
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,960
to take revenge on our country.

276
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,870
How I wish that we could

277
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,110
kill him back then!

278
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,400
Don't tell Young Madam about this.

279
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,570
Don't worry.

280
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,450
I'm the most tight-lipped.

281
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,920
Take a rest if you're tired.

282
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,830
There's no rush in marching.

283
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,830
Thank you, honey.

284
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,490
I'll take a rest after finishing my reading.

285
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,070
My Lord.

286
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,150
According to your order,

287
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,869
the army on the western front

288
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,950
pulled five miles back.

289
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,470
Okay.

290
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,800
Are troops on all fronts at your disposal?

291
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,630
Yes.

292
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,710
The commander-in-chief changes most frequently.

293
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,030
The soldiers are dispatched

294
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,710
only by the tiger tally given by His Majesty.

295
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,630
Anyone who owns the tally is the commander-in-chief.

296
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,030
This time, the generals and soldiers on all fronts are at my disposal

297
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,109
because I have the tally given by His Majesty.

298
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,109
What about the Yue State?

299
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,349
Does it work the same for them?

300
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,990
The attacks of Yue have been well-prepared.

301
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,190
It's also the tiger tally that determines the deployment of troops.

302
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,150
I see.

303
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,670
It's the same as Master's token.

304
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,830
We must see the token

305
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,910
before we take actions

306
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,840
unless it's a face-to-face order.

307
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,070
What if there is no token?

308
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,830
No token,

309
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,310
no order.

310
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,430
Even Senior Moyan

311
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,690
can't order us around.

312
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,230
Thank you, honey.

313
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,310
You inspired me to defeat the enemy.

314
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,640
The enemy is stronger than us.

315
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,390
But if the they can't deploy troops,

316
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,120
no matter how strong they are, we will surely win.

317
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,550
My Lord, you mean...

318
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,750
Sneak in their military camp

319
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,280
to steal their tiger tally.

320
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,930
Once we get their tiger tally,

321
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,150
we will mobilize all our troops

322
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,270
to attack them.

323
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,590
They won't be able to deploy troops

324
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,740
and will be in chaos.

325
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,130
That's when we can annihilate them.

326
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,930
Wonderful!

327
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,400
Su Jinning doesn't know martial arts.

328
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,260
If we can steal his tiger tally...

329
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,110
Jinning?

330
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,830
Honey.

331
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,510
I'll steal the tiger tally

332
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,230
for you.

333
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,930
It's dangerous.

334
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,110
You can't go.

335
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,710
You are the commander-in-chief of the army.

336
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,980
If anything happened to you,

337
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,380
who would take command

338
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,480
and direct operations?

339
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,280
Besides,

340
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,440
I was the one who let Jinning go.

341
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,820
It's not your fault.

342
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,550
If it were me...

343
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,830
I am the one to blame.

344
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,910
I should bear the consequences.

345
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,110
Don't worry.

346
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,150
I'll leave once I get the tiger tally.

347
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,550
I won't waste time there.

348
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,150
Don't stop me now.

349
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,710
Fine.

350
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,970
But this is too dangerous.

351
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,370
You must be careful.

352
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,570
I'm good at

353
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,550
being a thief.

354
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,820
Besides,

355
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,950
I have this.

356
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,040
Didn't you say

357
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,200
you lost your rouge?

358
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,390
I happened to pass by a rouge shop today,

359
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,700
so I picked one for you.

360
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,350
You still remember that?

361
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,480
How could I forget anything about you?

362
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,330
Were you hurt?

363
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,630
Here.

364
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,020
Is it serious?

365
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,800
And here.

366
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,000
It hurts here too.

367
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Stop pretending.

368
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,590
Thank you for your help

369
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,490
so that I can clear my name

370
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,230
and be restored to my position in Taizhou.

371
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,840
Thank you, everyone.

372
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,380
You are welcome, Lord Chen.

373
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,710
We were deceived by Duke Su

374
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,690
and framed you.

375
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,830
It's our biggest wish

376
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,810
to clear your name as witnesses.

377
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,860
I invited you here today

378
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,880
because I have a request.

379
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,920
Go ahead, Lord Chen.

380
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,500
Under the order of His Majesty, I came back to Taizhou

381
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,490
to destroy the Moon Star Herb

382
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,610
and bring the people back to farming.

383
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,230
But the Moon Star Herb

384
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,610
is a drug that is consumed by ignition.

385
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,020
The amount of the Moon Star Herb we have seized

386
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,030
is so huge

387
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,330
that the poisonous gas it will release by the incineration

388
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,550
can harm all the people of Taizhou.

389
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,460
I wonder if there is

390
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,060
a better way to destroy it.

391
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,200
Lord Chen.

392
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,800
I have an idea. It might work.

393
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,680
Freeze!

394
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,530
Rong?

395
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,850
Are you here for Xu Muchen?

396
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,860
Also for the people of the Jing State.

397
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,880
I heard he became a general

398
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,050
and would wage a battle against me.

399
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,920
You know what?

400
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,320
He has no chance to win.

401
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,310
I will be the winner

402
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,340
this time.

403
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,510
Jinning.

404
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,560
Stop it.

405
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,310
Stop it?

406
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,790
Do you know what I have experienced

407
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,510
to become who I am now?

408
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,740
I risked my life to steal the map.

409
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,770
But my sister still died.

410
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,230
Zhen?

411
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,140
Is Zhen dead?

412
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,650
The Moon Star Herb was destroyed.

413
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,860
The people of the Yue State vented their anger on her.

414
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
Then why are you still helping them?

415
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Why?

416
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,440
Because I'm from the Yue State.

417
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,230
Only by destroying Jing

418
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,670
can I have a stable life

419
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,600
and have you

420
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,490
by my side again.

421
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,840
Jinning.

422
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,160
The war won't heal

423
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,730
the wounds in your heart.

424
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,230
It will only claim more lives.

425
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,190
Zhen wouldn't want

426
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,250
to see you like this if she were alive.

427
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,470
Do you want to see

428
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,390
the streets we used to play on

429
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,410
be trodden by horses

430
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,910
and turned into ashes in the war?

431
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,230
Or do you want to see Erxi and his friends

432
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,770
die young?

433
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,840
Stop it.

434
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,360
I must wage

435
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,590
this battle.

436
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,340
The Yue State is your home.

437
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,830
What about the Jing State?

438
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,660
You were born and raised in Jing.

439
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,630
Don't you have a sense of belonging to this country?

440
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,160
No.

441
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,830
Not at all.

442
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,830
I don't have any sense of belonging to it.

443
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,040
Not at all.

444
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,040
General.

445
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,590
How should we

446
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,550
deal with the spy of the Jing State?

447
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,700
Let her go.

448
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,500
General.

449
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,030
Let her go?

450
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,130
If we let her go...

451
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,450
I'm the general here.

452
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,320
I have the final say.

453
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,720
Let her go.

454
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,840
Yes.

455
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,010
Are we really going to let her go?

456
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,020
Of course not.

457
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,030
What if the general blames us?

458
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,490
What kind of general is he?

459
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,000
If it weren't for the map,

460
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,080
how would His Majesty give him

461
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,280
the title of General?

462
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,780
Once we capture Jing,

463
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,490
I'll get rid of him first.

464
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,780
That's right.

465
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,180
You are the real general of Yue.

466
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,380
Su Jinning was born and grew up in Jing.

467
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,510
It's impossible for him

468
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,150
to be truly loyal to Yue.

469
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,770
General,

470
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,230
this spy...

471
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,390
Go kill her.

472
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,080
I'll keep an eye on Su Jinning.

473
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,610
Yes, sir.

474
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,720
Be quick.

475
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,790
Yes, sir.

476
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,330
Get out of here now.

477
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,370
I can't let you die here.

478
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,230
I'm not leaving.

479
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,320
I can't go anywhere

480
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,260
until I get the tiger tally.

481
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,050
Kill Su Jinning

482
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,490
once he releases the spy.

483
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,870
Take it and go.

484
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,600
If you give it to me,

485
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,240
you will be in danger.

486
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,970
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

487
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,640
Su Jinning.

488
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,260
You colluded with the enemy and betrayed our country.

489
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,860
Guards!

490
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,480
Kill them!

491
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,630
Rong.

492
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,000
Rong.

493
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,360
Follow me closely.

494
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,190
Rong.

495
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,310
Leave now.

496
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,070
Let's go together.

497
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,790
Rong.

498
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,650
I don't have a home anymore.

499
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,100
You must live a good life.

500
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,240
Leave now.

501
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,190
Here you are.

502
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,450
[Timely wine]

503
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,530
Hold it tight.

504
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:50,930
Rong.

505
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,890
Here are some desserts I bought for you.

506
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,410
Thank you, Jinning.

507
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,800
Have some.

508
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,070
Rong.

509
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,570
Jinning, stop teasing me.

510
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,630
Stop!

511
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,780
Rong.

512
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,330
Wait for me.

513
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,140
Rong.

514
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,920
I want this.

515
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,760
Okay.

516
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,430
Thank you.

517
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,070
Slow down.

518
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,950
Thank you.

519
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,350
I want another one.

520
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,330
Delicious.

521
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,510
I want one more.

522
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,880
Look how slim you are. I'll give you two more.

523
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,930
I want one more.

524
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,130
Jinning

525
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,730
died in the camp of Yue

526
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,030
to cover me.

527
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,850
My Lord, you are indeed amazing.

528
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,520
Without the commander-in-chief and the tiger tally,

529
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,890
the Yue troops were out of control.

530
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,860
We fought a great battle.

531
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,200
My Lord.

532
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,040
Why hasn't Young Madam woken up?

533
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,320
She is too tired.

534
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,040
When she gets well,

535
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,730
we'll return to the capital.

536
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,950
I'll prepare for it.

537
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,030
Senior.

538
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,990
Will there be any problem

539
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,410
if the herbs are burned like this?

540
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,190
Don't worry.

541
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,960
I've processed the Moon Star Herbs

542
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,550
with medicine.

543
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,040
Even if it's burnt, there won't be poisonous gas

544
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,170
harming the people.

545
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,940
Everyone.

546
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,520
All the Moon Star Herbs in Taizhou

547
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,430
are gathered here.

548
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,510
The Moon Star Herb is extremely poisonous.

549
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,060
It caused a disaster.

550
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,990
The imperial court has ordered to investigate the case thoroughly.

551
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,590
From today on,

552
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,980
there won't be a blade of Moon Star Herb

553
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,260
in our land.

554
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,720
Bravo! Bravo!

555
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,870
Good job.

556
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,270
Light the fire.

557
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,330
Great job.

558
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,640
Master, what a great job!

559
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,230
[Respect the wise and intelligent]

560
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,720
Welcome.

561
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,590
Sorry for

562
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,430
not picking you up in person.

563
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,510
Uncle. Lord Gu.

564
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,050
Muchen.

565
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,440
His Majesty is very happy

566
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,550
that you led troops

567
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,190
to repel the Yue State.

568
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
I am here

569
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,020
to bring His Majesty's oral instruction.

570
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,630
It's as follows.

571
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,980
The battle in Taizhou has been settled.

572
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,140
The Yue State retreated to seek peace.

573
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,630
Xu Muchen has done a great service.

574
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,540
He is promoted to the fourth rank

575
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,980
and given a hundred taels of gold

576
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,040
since he has been a model example for all soldiers.

577
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,060
I

578
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,080
accept the decree and thank His Majesty for the award.

579
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,420
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

580
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,950
Nephew.

581
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,660
Here's one more thing.

582
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,780
Muchen.

583
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,010
I don't know

584
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,900
how to tell you this.

585
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,660
His Majesty

586
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,920
has known Liu Rong's real identity.

587
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,280
What did His Majesty say?

588
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,480
His Majesty said

589
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,830
as the Governor of the Zichen Department,

590
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,230
you knew

591
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,860
Liu Rong was Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

592
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,260
But you didn't report it.

593
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,960
Fortunately, you did a great job.

594
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,990
You can be pardoned.

595
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,150
But Rong

596
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,380
is guilty.

597
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,290
I'll take full responsibility.

598
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,150
I can give up

599
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,580
my position and rewards.

600
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,210
Could you please ask a favor of His Majesty

601
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,429
to spare my wife?

602
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,400
Muchen.

603
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,429
It's not up to me

604
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,730
alone.

605
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,580
You have no idea

606
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,230
how furious His Majesty was at that time.

607
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:23,989
Lord Gu.

608
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:24,889
Lord Liu.

609
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,520
My husband didn't know who I was back then.

610
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,230
I'll take full responsibility.

611
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,940
No.

612
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,460
Lord Liu.

613
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,560
How is it?

614
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,940
Am I right?

615
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,469
They

616
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,130
can't live without each other.

617
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,620
Alright.

618
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,790
Stop arguing.

619
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,830
You have already

620
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,350
been punished.

621
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,790
What do you mean?

622
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,420
His Majesty said

623
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,460
Liu Rong

624
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,199
contributed a lot

625
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,650
for taking a risk to enter the Yue camp and steal the tiger tally,

626
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,969
but she had to suffer

627
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,430
a little.

628
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,470
He asked me

629
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,500
to scare you two

630
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,950
and tell Rong

631
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,410
not to steal anymore.

632
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:07,730
Gu.

633
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,200
Why does it sound like you're the one who suggested it?

634
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,620
Yes.

635
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,290
I did give some suggestions,

636
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,670
but it was His Majesty who had the final say.

637
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,430
Rong.

638
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,710
Can I have a word with you?

639
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,610
This is a golden Willow Leaf Dart

640
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,390
bestowed by His Majesty.

641
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,480
Don't be a thief anymore.

642
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,530
Thank His Majesty.

643
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,730
Thank you, Lord Liu.

644
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,620
As long as there are no corrupt officials in the court,

645
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,790
there will be no Willow Leaf Thief Liu in the world.

646
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,590
Rong.

647
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,340
It's Xu Muchen's luck

648
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,920
to have you as his wife.

649
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,730
Lord Liu.

650
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,110
Here's one more thing.

651
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,990
Although my master and seniors

652
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,270
made a mistake,

653
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,030
they contributed a lot

654
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,280
to the settlement of the Moon Star Herb case.

655
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,140
I wonder if they can redeem themselves

656
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,800
by investigating in Taizhou.

657
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,750
That's a good idea.

658
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,330
But

659
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,630
we need to ask if Lord Gu will agree.

660
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,340
It's approved.

661
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,230
You haven't asked the Ministry of Justice.

662
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,030
What is the Ministry of Justice?

663
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,680
I've been promoted.

664
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,360

665
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,760
