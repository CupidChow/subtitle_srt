00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,350
But as long as you say you're not,

176
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,230
I would believe you.

177
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,000
But do you plan to lie to me forever?

178
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,030
Then...

179
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,670
it's over between us.

180
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,480
I'll pack my things

181
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,200
and leave Xu's Mansion.

182
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll leave you.

183
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,750
Right,

184
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,470
after I leave, make an excuse.

185
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,110
You can say I cheated on you

186
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,470
because I've fallen in love with someone else.

187
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,130
You can also say I've been kidnapped by bandits.

188
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,150
Anyway, don't make Mother worried.

189
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,880
There is a storybook hidden under the bed.

190
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,580
I wanted to give it to Xiao Qiu on her birthday.

191
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,810
But now it seems I won't be able to wait till that day.

192
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,530
Just make an excuse and help me give it to her.

193
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,510
And Xiao Dong.

194
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,250
She looks smart

195
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,069
and is old enough to get married.

196
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,170
Remember to remind Mother

197
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,839
to marry her off into a good family.

198
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,329
It's getting cold lately.

199
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,790
Remember to put more clothes on.

200
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,980
Don't catch a cold.

201
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,870
I'm being nosy.

202
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,590
Xu Muchen,

203
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,990
take care.

204
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,590
You're wearing your uniform.

205
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,640
You're here to arrest me, right?

206
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,430
Go ahead.

207
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,910
I don't want to arrest you

208
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,190
or let you leave me.

209
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,000

I'm Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

220
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,210
What's wrong?

221
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,340
In the Zichen Department,

222
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,880
you already knew I was in the wardrobe?

223
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,280
How did you know it was me?

224
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,270
You've been taking care of me these days.

225
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,710
The smell of medicine is all over you.

226
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,170
Of course I could smell it.

227
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,800
Really?

228
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,950
I should have

229
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,670
let you stay wounded.

230
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,210
Right, Honey,

231
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,190
you went to the Zichen Department last night

232
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,390
to steal Lu Rongchang's ledger, right?

233
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,500
Then why didn't you take it in the end?

234
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm a righteous thief.

235
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,070
Okay.

236
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,630
My righteous thief wife.

237
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,910
It's late.

238
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,450
Why don't we go home?

239
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,690
I want to sit here a little longer.

240
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,550
Okay.

My health is deteriorating.

244

If anything happens to me one day,

245
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,960
I'm not worried about Rong

246
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,350
because she has Xu Muchen to take care of her.

247
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,320
But you

248
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,040
are still single.

249
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,870
You're not feeling well?

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,020
Then I guess you can't eat

I'm going to throw it away.

Don't.

Don't waste food.

I just want you to be happy.

Give it to me.

257
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,050
You want me to be happy?

258
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,670
Take care of yourself first.

259
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,830
Just eat.

260
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,270
You're ungrateful.

261
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,830
Don't turn around.

Listen to me. Eat first.

Lord Gongyang,

264
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,500
why are you here?

265
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,030
I came to ask you something.

266
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,370
Let's talk downstairs.

267
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,030
What do you want to ask me?

268
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,400
Xu Muchen said

269
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,040
you're an accomplice of Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

270
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,300
Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

271
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,380
How could I have anything to do with her?

272
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,790
What about the one upstairs?

273
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,190
What's your relationship with him?

274
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,870
Oh no.

275
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,830
Does he already know who he is?

276
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,760
What on earth

277
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,610
is your relationship with him?

278
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,830
Him?

279
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,590
He's my brother.

280
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,990
Brother?

281
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,590
You're an orphan.

282
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,120
How come you have a brother?

283
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,750
We're not related by blood,

284
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,150
but we grew up together.

285
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,430
We often visit each other

286
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,590
and take care of each other.

287
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,350
We're closer than real siblings.

288
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,270
It's just that

289
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,870
you've never met each other.

290
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,190
You visit

291
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,480
and take care of each other.

292
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,150
Yes.

293
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,570
He's the closest to me in this world.

294
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,310
He's the closest to you in this world.

295
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,110
What about me?

296
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,350
What?

297
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,350
Qin Mumu,

298
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm from a noble family.

299
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,720
I have a strong family background and a promising future.

300
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,630
But you have made a fool of me.

301
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,030
What's wrong with you today?

302
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,670
What's wrong with me?

303
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,920
We were in sync with each other.

304
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,970
We had heart-to-heart talks.

305
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,870
We made vows.

306
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,360
Are they all fake?

307
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,070
Did you lie to me

308
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,950
to fob me off?

309
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,190
Actually...

310
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,830
Enough.

311
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,240
I understand your feelings now.

312
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,190
Since you have someone you like,

313
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,260
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

314
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,340
I...

315
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,020
He misunderstood, right?

316
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,710
He's jealous.

317
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:03,950
Look.

318
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,830
I'm not the only one wanting you to be happy.

319
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,990
You're being nosy.

320
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,900
Why are you here?

321
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,040
I came for you.

322
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,760
Why?

323
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,030
Don't you want to accompany your good brother?

324
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,080
I want to see you.

325
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,000
The night view of this street is very beautiful.

326
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,530
Let's take a walk together.

327
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,020
Don't you want to accompany your good brother?

328
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,740
Why do you keep mentioning him?

329
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,870
All he thinks about

330
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,280
is to marry me off as soon as possible

331
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,470
to get a bride price.

332
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,490
What kind of good brother is he?

333
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,290
He wants to marry you off as soon as possible?

334
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,600
He's daydreaming.

335
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,910
He should consider if there's anyone who wants me.

336
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:42,680
There is.

337
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,770
There is someone who wants you.

338
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,800
There is someone who wants you.

00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,550
I won't forget it.

517
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,270
You can't repay his kindness,

518
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,440
so you want to give yourself to him.

519

Mother,

520
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,640
Miss Hu has no one to depend on.

521
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,270
I want to let her live here for a few days.

522
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,390
Well...

523
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,850
We don't have a guest room in our mansion.

524
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,950
There are two rooms in the backyard.

525
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,430
Let Miss Hu live there.

526
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,030
I asked Xiao Dong

527
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,430
to make pickles in the rooms in the backyard.

528
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,200
They're smelly.

529
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,860
We can't make Miss Hu wronged.

530
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,560
I'll ask someone to clean them

531
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,880
and hire new servants

532
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,910
to specially take care of Miss Hu.

533
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,270
Zhen.

534
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,960
Where are you going?

535
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,150
I remember I stewed bones for the dog in the kitchen.

536
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,030
I think they are overcooked.

537
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,630
I'm going to throw them away.

538
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,260
Chen,

539
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,830
is there a misunderstanding between you and Zhen?

540
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,750
Mother, don't worry.

541
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,660
I'll explain to her.

542
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,450
That's good.

543
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,500
Miss Hu,

544
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,890
I'll ask Xiao Dong to serve you these days.

545
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,410
Just tell her if you need anything.

546
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,270
Thank you.

547
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,810
My father lost his life

548
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,870
in order to protect this wooden box.

549
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,600
But there is a locking mechanism in it.

550
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,840
I've never opened it.

551
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,480
This jade pendant

552
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,590
is my most cherished item all these years.

553
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,650
If I...

554
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,910
Keep it for me.

555
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,860
Since you're back safely,

556
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm giving this back to you.

557
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,700
This is something left by your father.

558
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,840
To you,

559
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,270
it must be more important than your life.

560
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,600
Indeed, it's more important than my life.

561
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,520
So I can only feel relieved

562
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,200
when it's in your hands.
