00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,670
Well...

173
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,030
Alright, let's go.

174
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,270
What idea can he get?

175
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,110
He has to do everything he can to ask me for help.

176
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,150
However,

177
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,870
if the envoy is really a heavy gambler...

178
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,550
I won.

179
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,880
It must be big this time.

180
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,950
Come on.

181
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,030
Ready.

182
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,870
Open.

183
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,350
Let's do it again.

184
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,610
Place your bet.

185
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,230
Come on.

186
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,190
What are you doing here?

187
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,550
Do you own this casino?

188
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,390
Why can't I be here?

189
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,390
I'm working.

190
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,320
Stop it. Go home.

191
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,330
We have the three rules. Don't question each other.

192
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,350
Place your bet. Hurry up.

193
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,390
Come on.

194
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:33,070
[Gambling]

195
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,390
Hurry up. Open it.

196
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,230
Open it!

197
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,230
Small.

198
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,679
It must be big this time.

199
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,830
Again. Let's do it again.

200
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,570
I'll go double.

201
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,630
Open.

202
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,150
Let's do it again.

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,640
I won.

204
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,030
She won again.

205
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,960
Not bad, girl.

206
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,870
Pay me up.

207
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,350
My Lord.

208
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,540
Young Madam is really good at it.

209
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,070
Let our men keep a close watch.

210
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,810
Yes.

211
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,080
Here, son.

212
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,870
Son.

213
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,750
Try this.

214
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,190
This is the new dish made by the cook.

215
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,910
I just tried it.

216
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,430
You'll like it.

217
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,910
Son.

218
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,080
Mother.

219
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,510
It's delicious.

220
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,370
What's wrong with you these days?

221
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,110
You've been absent-minded and have a low appetite.

222
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,710
Is something bothering you?

223
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,830
I'm thinking about the case.

224
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,030
Don't worry about me.

225
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,850
Stop thinking about the case. Let's eat.

226
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,270
Your father will help you with your career.

227
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,830
What I want most

228
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,710
is to see you get married and have children.

229
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,770
Then our family will have offspring.

230
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,030
That's what matters.

231
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,790
Mother,

232
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,190
I got employed by Ministry of Justice because I'm capable.

233
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,520
It had nothing to do with my father's help.

234
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,150
To get married and have children

235
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
is not something urgent.

236
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,630
How could you say that? I'm so anxious.

237
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,710
Xu Muchen

238
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,690
married the Duke's daughter.

239
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,110
Mrs. Xu

240
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,350
will probably have a grandchild next year.

241
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,680
She was being so complacent in front of me.

242
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,890
You should also get married soon.

243
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,790
Su Jinzhen?

244
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,630
Mother.

245
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,990
Do you think there is something suspicious about Su Jinzhen?

246
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,070
Yes.

247
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,190
I don't understand

248
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,230
why she would marry Xu Muchen.

249
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,750
Son, don't worry.

250
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,670
I'll ask Mrs. Wang, Mrs. Liu,

251
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,040
and Mrs. Zhao to come some other day.

252
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,340
I'll ask them to bring their unmarried daughters here.

253
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,150
By then,

254
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,110
tell me the girl you like.

255
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,710
I will arrange a date for you.

256
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,510
Mother.

257
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,240
I'll take care of it myself.

258
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,110
You don't have to do it for me.

259
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,870
Listen to me.

260
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,750
Young Master, Your Ladyship.

261
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,000
A lady surnamed Qin is at the door.

262
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,930
She said she came to deliver clothes to Young Master.

263
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,550
Miss Qin?

264
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,950
Let her in.

265
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,550
Yes.

266
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,670
Open it.

267
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,450

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,350
She won again.

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,470
Pay me up, come on.

Place your bets. Hurry up!

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,170
I won. Great Dragons!

275
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,430
Great Dragons?

276
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,070
How many times the stakes will she win?

277
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,470
256 times.

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,400
Heavenly Hand!

Thirteen Orphans!

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,530
Thirteen Orphans?

She is so amazing.

It's real. Look.

Here you are.

Pay me up.

You're so lucky.

I quit, I quit.

00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,720
How can we play after you leave?

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,350
-Who wants to join us?
-Do you want to play with us?

301
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,410
-Come on.
-I can't.

302

Come on, join us.

She is amazing.

Okay, let's play.

Let our men keep a close eye on them.

310
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,030
She even showed Heavenly Hand and Thirteen Orphans.

311
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,830
They still want to play with her?

312

Nine Bamboos.

313
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,840
His skills are good.

314
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,350
Looks like he's a master of Mahjong.

315
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,590
The mark on his hand

316
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,590
suggests that he always wore a ring.

317
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,320
Small.

318
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,900

Small. Big.

320
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,600
His figure is like the envoy's.

321
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,730
He must be the envoy.

322
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,300
He was the man who fought against me that night.

323

North.

324
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,490
He's been silent

325
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,250
because he's afraid his accent will betray him.

West Wind.

Eight Characters.

329
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,030
You are quite good at playing Mahjong.

330
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,680
But judging from your skills,

331
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,540
I don't think you're a local here.

332

Are you from the Nanxiang Kingdom?

333

Wu Zhao.

334
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,390
What's wrong, My Lord?

I brought the outfit myself

346
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,150
so that if the outfit doesn't fit,

347
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,710
you won't blame me

348

I went to the Embroidery House to investigate a case.

absent-minded and had a low appetite these days.

How could you say you were there to investigate the case?

Yes.

Let me tell you.

691
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,550
the envoy from the Nanxiang Kingdom

692
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,210
was hiding at Sanqing Casino.

693
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,630
Many of us went in but failed to find him.

694
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,690
Then Young Madam went in and gambled.

695
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,310
She won a lot and managed to

696
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,030
lure the envoy to her gambling table.

697
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,580
But...

698
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,050
Was Young Madam in danger?

699
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,520
It was dangerous but she remained poised.

700
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,970
You scared me.

701
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,740
But what were you doing?

702
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,320
How come you needed Young Madam to help you with the case?

703

What were you guys doing?

704

Who said that?

706
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,370
Later in the day I pretended to be the envoy

707
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,000
and met a bunch of assassins.

708
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,950
Luckily I stopped them.

Of course.

When I confronted the killers,

724
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,510
I beat them easily.

725

no match for me.

You are quite good at playing Mahjong.

But judging from your skills,

I don't think you're a local here.

the case was solved so quickly.

734

But she is a lady from Duke's Mansion.

I forgive him

for taking advantage of me last time.

The case is solved.

Why do you have to tell everyone

744
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,949
that the man wasn't killed by Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

745

She didn't kill the man.

There's no need to put up a notice saying that.

She is a thief and we are the officers.

prove a thief's innocence?
