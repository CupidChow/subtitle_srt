[Episode 16]

4
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,030
This time, I'm going to

5
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,289
Taizhou alone to take the post

6
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,509
in order to find out

7
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,830
the truth of your father's case.

8
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,830
I'm afraid I'm in danger.

9
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,950
I'll entrust the my wife and daughter's safety

10
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,750
to you and Lord Liu.

11
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,090
Are you just going to let it be?

12
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,850
We must keep investigating.

13
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
Otherwise, we can't bear to do it!

14
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,280
Listen to my advice.

15
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,590
If this matter is really involved,

16
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,460
the consequences may be more than you can bear.

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,750
The world is a chaotic place.

18
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,310
A righteous man

19
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,110
always has a hard life.

20
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,770
Only by willingly treading on thorns

21
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,190
can one find the light.

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,710
Chengsi, Chengsi!

23
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,030
Chen.

24
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,510
Come on.

25
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,320
Come in, Chen.

26
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,230
These two are Dad's close friends.

27
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,460
It's okay.

28
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,910
Chen,

29
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,070
can you go buy some candied haws

30
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,870
and help entertain Dad's friends?

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,670
We all like it.

32
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,130
Buy more sticks, alright?

33
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,630
Here.

34
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,030
Go.

35
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,660
You were the one

36
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,510
talking to my dad in the tent.

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,170
You remembered.

38
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,070
You're risking your life for my father.

39
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,310
If there's anything I can do,

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,310
I will do my best.

41
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,550
Thank you, Nephew.

42
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,670
Let me have a look.

43
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,310
Ladies, take your pick.

44
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,570
The things here are so exquisite.

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,070
Mrs. Xu,

46
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,930
let's take a look at that jewelry.

47
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,700
Your Ladyship, come and have a look.

48
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,550
Manager.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,860
See if there's anything you like.

50
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,070
They all look good.

51
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,690
Manager.

52
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,110
How much is this?

53
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,990
50 taels.

54
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,630
50 taels?

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,990
Are you trying to rob me?

56
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,370
What's wrong, Mrs. Xu?

57
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,470
You don't like it?

58
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,350
No.

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,519
It's too expensive.

60
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,190
These solid gold pieces inlaid with colorful stones

61
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,630
are all priced in this range.

62
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,390
Why don't you bargain with the boss?

63
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,480
No need.

64
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,830
Actually, I don't like it that much.

65
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,100
Manager,

66
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,390
do you have any other recommendations?

67
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,330
Your Ladyship,

68
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,180
look at these beads.

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
This is a new product from our store.

70
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,950
How much are these beads?

71
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,790
This one

72
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,340
is 100 taels.

73
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,440
100 taels?

74
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,390
The color is okay,

75
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,030
but they aren't very smooth.

76
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,990
Let me tell you, Manager,

77
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,950
this is your fault.

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,830
This is the daughter of Duke Su.

79
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,950
She has seen everything.

80
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,200
How could you try to fool her with something so ordinary?

81
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,290
I didn't recognize your prowess.

82
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,880
Miss Su, please forgive me.

83
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Please wait a moment.

84
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,590
I'll get the best ones for you.

85
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,710
No.

86
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,640
-Actually these…
-Take a look at these first.

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,630
Let him get them.

88
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,010
We can expand our horizons too.

89
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Look at this.

90
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,430
Uncle Chen.

91
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,910
I have a request too.

92
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,510
Nephew, go ahead.

93
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,990
Recently, Zichen Department

94
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,920
is collecting evidence of Moon Star Herb smuggling.

95
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,420
We have evidence that

96
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,770
the Moon Star Herb is from Taizhou.

97
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,540
But after entering the capital,

98
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,290
it disappears without a trace, like a clay cow in the ocean.

99
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,070
I hope you can investigate the local situation

100
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,930
when you go to Taizhou, Lord Chen.

101
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,200
Moon Star Herb.

102
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,210
I remember, in the last letter your father gave me,

103
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,720
Moon Star Herb was also mentioned.

104
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,500
Could the case

105
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,170
have something to do with Moon Star Herb too?

106
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,550
It's unclear.

107
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,590
Nephew, don't worry.

108
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,390
When I go to Taizhou,

109
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,960
I'll get to the bottom of this Moon Star Herb case.

110
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,090
If there's any news,

111
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,040
I'll contact you promptly.

112
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,020
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

113
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,430
This is our newest addition.

114
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,440
Ladies, please have a look.

115
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,550
This is indeed quite pretty.

116
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,590
Let me see.

117
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,400
The color, the quality of the jade.

118
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,770
I don't know what kind of jade it's made of

119
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,840
but it must be valuable.

120
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,310
Nanshan jade,

121
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,120
the icy type from the old mines.

122
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,030
Your Ladyship.

123
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,310
You've got a good eye.

124
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,909
How much is it?

125
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,800
500 taels.

126
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,320
-500 taels?
-500 taels?

127
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,990
I don't think it's expensive.

128
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,070
This quality

129
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,950
is worth 800 taels.

130
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,570
Mrs. Chen.

131
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,440
You keep jacking up the price, but you're not making any offers.

132
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,150
To be honest,

133
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,190
I have my jewelry

134
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,750
custom made by a master craftsman.

135
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,190
I'm just here to accompany you

136
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,160
to take a look at these ordinary finished products.

137
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,090
Mrs. Xu,

138
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,720
what do you think of this hairpin?

139
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,500
I think it does look nice.

140
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,430
Right?

141
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,390
Buy it then.

142
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,160
It really suits you.

143
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,400
-There's no need.
-Really.

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Actually, I don't really like jade.

145
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,430
If Miss Su were to buy it,

146
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,350
it's only 50 taels.

147
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,640
Why?

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,960
Our boss

149
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,150
is Young Master Jinning of the Duke's Mansion,

150
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,950
and Miss Su's brother.

151
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,620
Our boss said,

152
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,510
if Miss Su comes to buy jewelry,

153
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,850
we'll only charge 10% of the price.

154
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,350
Mrs. Xu really holds sway.

155
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,440
That's right.

156
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,230
Mrs. Xu,

157
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,470
just take it.

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,230
50 taels is so worth it.

159
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,780
Just buy it. Don’t hesitate anymore.

160
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,280
-Yeah. Buy it.
-I…

161
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,830
Honey.

162
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,070
50 taels is so worth it.

163
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,870
Why are you here?

164
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,390
Yeah.

165
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,670
You don't like bringing cash with you.

166
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,350
Show me if there's anything you like, and I'll buy it for you.

167
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,190
There's nothing.

168
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,070
Lord Xu.

169
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,630
Mrs. Xu had her eye on a hairpin just now.

170
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,350
It's only 50 taels.

171
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,230
I didn't have my eye on it.

172
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,490
I really don't like it.

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,190
You just said you like it.

174
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,430
Yes.

175
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,910
Lord Xu is already here.

176
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,030
You're a newlywed couple,

177
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,520
let Lord Xu buy it for you.

178

-Yeah.

Pack it up. I'll buy it.

if Lord Xu comes,

183
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,750
I must sell it at the original price.

184
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,470
This is my brother's business.

185
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,710
Let's not buy it.

186
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,940
It's just a hairpin.

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,789
The Xu family

188
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,320
doesn't need to take advantage of Jinning for this.

189
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,180
I’ll just pay the original price.

190

Honey,

195
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,680
this is 50 taels.

196
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,370
I'll wait for you downstairs.

197
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,880

Where is the hairpin?

203
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,210
I didn't buy it.

204
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,310
What kind of hairpin costs 50 taels?

205
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,350
I don't know what kind of money

206
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,590
Jinning is making.

207
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,630
If you like it,

208
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,550

They instigated it.

As a minister,

212
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,110
how much can Lord Chen earn in a year?

213
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,550
Mrs. Chen is such a big spender.

214
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,750
Zichen Department should investigate him.

215
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,080
Honey, you may not know,

216
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,030
but Lord Chen's honesty and thriftiness

217
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,030
are well-known.

218
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,150
But Mrs. Chen

219
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,270
is an ordinary country girl.

220
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,380
After entering the city,

221
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,310
she was surrounded by noble ladies

222
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,670
who tended to look down on her.

223
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,710
So her actions and behaviors, though somewhat contrived,

224
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,950
are understandable.

225
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,270
She spoke about jewelry with great knowledge,

226
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,510
and didn't sound at all like someone from the countryside.

227
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,910
Then I don't know how many books

228
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,550
Mrs. Chen read day and night

229
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,870
to recognize these jewelry.

230
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,400
Otherwise, how would she be able to fool them?

231
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,740
That must be hard on Mrs. Chen then.

232
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,750
Anyway,

233
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,880
thank you for helping me out, Darling.

Use it?

You go and have a good look around then.

Lord Chen is an important member of the court.

268
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,910
When did he become a suspected criminal?

269
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,670
Lord Xu,

270
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,350
this has nothing to do with you.

271
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,230
I'll just go with them and answer a few questions.

272
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,890
Since it's just questioning,

273
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,840
why are you wearing that iron yoke?

274
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,470
These are intended for use on serious offenders.

275
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,790
You haven't even questioned him yet

276
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,050
and you've already convicted Lord Chen!

277
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,480
Are you obstructing the Ministry of Justice's work?

278
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,010
Lord Xu, you're really good at defending your friends.

279
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,990
I just want to ask you

280
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,610
what crime did Lord Chen commit.

281
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,750
Why are you using such an instrument to apprehend him?

282
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,470
What crime?

283
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,400
Lord Xu, you know it well.

284
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,430
Why ask me?

285
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,190
What do you mean by that?

286
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,510
Nothing.

Don't slander a good man without any evidence.

I'm not afraid of being investigated by you.

292
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,150
I'm just concerned because Lord Chen is close to the Xu family;

293
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,480
it's inevitable that he might've picked up some bad habits.

He will be leaving for Taizhou soon.

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,070
How did he commit a crime all of a sudden?

299
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,450
Is there some kind of misunderstanding?

300
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:39,870
According to investigation,

301
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,230
Chen Ruohong, Minister of Personnel,

302
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,290
has been using his official position

303
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,870
to solicit bribes from those involved in various important cases

304
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,950
and embezzled public funds

305
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,590
amounting to 13,000 taels of silver.

306
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,600
The Ministry of Justice is hereby ordered to arrest and investigate.

307

If anyone interferes,

308
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,520
you'll be punished for the same crime.

309
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,270
Today, Lord Chen was catching up with you all.

310
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,100
I was ordered to search Chen's Mansion

311
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,900
and found a total of 8,000 taels of gold and silver.

312
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,080
8,000 taels?

Lord Gongyang.

314
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,670
The Ministry of Justice searched his warehouse

315

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,730
Do you have any witnesses?

Protocol wise,

318
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,460
it's hard not to suspect a setup, no?

319
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,520
Lord Xu, you're really interesting.

320
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,470
Technically, Lord Chen

321
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,330
is just an acquaintance of yours.

322

Why are you defending him so strongly?

323
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,590
Could it be that

324
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,120
this case has something to do with you too?

325

Thank you, Lord Xu, for speaking up for what's right.

The pharmacy was designed by Senior Brother himself.

343
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,780
It won't catch fire for no reason.

344
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,710
Oh no.

345
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,270
Just now, someone reported

346
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,790
that there was smoke everywhere in the pharmacy

347
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,790
and that it seemed to be on fire.

348
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,990
But when we came in to investigate,

349
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,790
we didn't find any signs of fire.

350
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,390
It's an urgent matter.

351
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,710
Someone has already informed Lord Gu.

352
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,630
He'll be here soon.

353
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,880
Anything else unusual in the vicinity?

354
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,670
No.

355
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,830
Remain on alert.

356
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,350
Yes.

357
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,990
So,

358
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,990
someone put a special smoke bomb

359
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,950
in here

360
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,230
to make others think there's a fire.

361
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,430
But our men have been guarding outside the whole time.

362
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,430
It's impossible.

363
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,620
That's right.

364
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,190
Unless there's another passage to this place.

365
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,720
What's behind this?

366
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,710
It's a couple of stores on the neighboring street.

367
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,910
They share a passage with the pharmacy.

368
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,380
Where does the passage go?

369
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,870
The passage is blocked off here.

370

The Meridian Chart?

371
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,090
Shouldn't this be hung in the front hall?

My Lord.

373

This spot seems to be touched a lot.

374
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,690
There is indeed a secret passage.

375
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,920

Where is my husband?

380
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,360
I think he went into the inner sanctum.

I'll go in and take a look.

there is a secret passage behind the pharmacy.

514
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,410
Xiao Qiu, hurry.

515
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,320
Old Madam, you're here.

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,440
Drink the medicine.

Lord Gu.

518
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,850
How dare you come here when my son is in such a state?

519
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,260
What did you promise me back then?

520
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,080
Old Madam.

521
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,230
Please don't be angry.

522
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,790
Getting angry is bad for your health.

523
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,990
I'm here to check on Muchen's injuries.

524
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,750
I-I-I specially asked him

525
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,610
not to come to Zichen Department.

526
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,260
He doesn't need to worry about

He just needs to focus on recuperating.

530
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,580
Zichen Department is in charge of trivial matters of the people.

531
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,430
At most, they handle martial-world bandits.

532

What kind of bandit

533

dares to set up and kill officials?

534

Well...

535
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,070
Mother, calm down.

536
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,930
Don't let anger harm your health.

537
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,150
I am getting older and my body is frail.

538
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,040
I just want to have my children and grandchildren around me.

539

Lord Gu.

540
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,070
Please spare our family.

541
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,790
Mother, I'm fine.

542
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,210
I'll be fine in a few days.

543

You're so badly injured and you're fine?

544

Do you want to die?

Inform the guards.

547
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,470
From now on, without my permission,

548
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,110
Young Master is not allowed to leave the premises.

549
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,830
If anyone from Zichen Department comes again,

550
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,890
do not accept them.

551

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,270
of killing him.

682
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,900
Then you have to accept Rong and Xu Muchen being together.

683
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,510
From now on,

684
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,520
don't mention it to me again.

685
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,320
[Xu's Mansion]

686
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,830
Don't worry, Mrs. Chen.

687
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,970
I will clear Lord Chen's name.

688
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,030
Lord Xu.

689
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,910
You're so seriously injured.

690
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,680
Why did you let her in?

691
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,200
I shouldn't have bothered you.

692
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,230
Young Madam, I couldn't stop her.

693
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,870
But

694
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,110
I have no other choice.

695
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,469
Please

696
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,699
save My Lord.

697
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,190
I'm kowtowing to you.

698
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,210
Mrs. Chen, no.

699
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,340
Get up, Mrs. Chen.

700
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,199
My husband has agreed,

701
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,810
so he'll definitely clear Lord Chen's name.

702
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,860
Thank you, Lord Xu.

703
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,710
Thank you, Mrs. Xu.

704
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,230
Xiao Qiu.

705
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,750
Go get Wu Zhao.

706
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,969
Young Master.

707
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,429
Old Madam said,

708
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,020
before you've recovered,

709
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,760
we can't let anyone from Zichen Department enter Xu's Mansion.

710
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't worry.

711
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,909
We will find a way.

712
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,340
Let me send you out.

713
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,960
Then I'm counting on you, Lord Xu

714
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,580
and Mrs. Xu.

715
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,270
This time, I'm going to

716
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,370
Taizhou alone to take the post

717
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,790
in order to find out

718
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,070
the truth of your father's case.

719
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,110
I'm afraid I'm in danger.

720
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,470
I'll entrust the my wife and daughter's safety

721
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,430
to you and Lord Liu.

722
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,860
Where are you going?

723
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,240
Just as well.

724
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,270
Help me up.

725
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,350
I'm going to Lord Chen's house.

726
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,710
There must be evidence that I haven't found.

727
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,110
You're so badly injured.

728
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,490
The doctor specifically told you not to move.

729
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,560
Rest properly.

730
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,880
Lie down.

731
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,110
Listen to me.

732
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,150
I'll investigate Lord Chen's case for you.

733
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:53,950
No.

734
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,750
You don't trust me?

735
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,550
I've read many storybooks about solving cases.

736
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,010
I know all the strategies.

737
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,550
No.

738
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,550
It's too dangerous for a girl

739
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,880
to be involved in a case.

740
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,510
You underestimate me.

741
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,430
I saved your life last night.

742
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,910
No, I have to go.

743
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,160
Fine.

744
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,030
I won't investigate, alright?

745
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,920
Don't move.

746
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,830
I'll pass a message for you.

747
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,910
Pass a message to Wu Zhao.

748
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,430
Get Wu Zhao to investigate.

749
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,490
Take the medicine.

750
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,030
Tell Wu Zhao

751
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,910
to check the rooms and warehouse carefully.

752
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,830
Record all suspicious evidence.

753
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,150
Okay.

754
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,790
Take the medicine first.

755
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,870
With the time it'll take to instruct Wu Zhao, I would've finished investigating.

756
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,470
Oh yes.

757
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,790
Ask him to ask about

758
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,290
the servants who were on duty that night.

759
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,270
I got it.

760
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,350
I'll be back soon.

761
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,610
Finish your medicine.

762
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:01,880
Here.

763
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,910
This is my warehouse.

764
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,760
8,000 taels of silver.

765
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,310
It's too much to fit in a couple of big boxes.

766
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,670
Without someone on the inside,

767
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,800
he won't be able to bring it in no matter how skilled he is.

768
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,150
This is where the guards' quarters are in our mansion.

769
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,550
They're the ones who are in charge

770
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,080
of guarding the warehouse.

771
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,090
Where are they?

772
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,370
They were taken away by the Ministry of Justice.

773
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,030
Other than the handymen,

774
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,000
who else frequents the warehouse?

775
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,870
There's...

776
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,000
There's also a schoolboy named Zhong Aba.

777
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,230
Where is he?

778
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,270
He has been with my husband since he was young.

779
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,550
I was worried that he would suffer with the Ministry of Justice

780
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,550
so I let him out to hide.

781
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,390
But he has been in the mansion since he was a kid.

782
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,030
He's always been honest.

783
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,310
[Xu's Mansion]

784
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,030
So Zhong Aba

785
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,670
is most likely their internal contact.

786
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,750
Wu Zhaodu has already asked around.

787
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,310
He used to be very thrifty

788
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,350
but now he spends his days in restaurants

789
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,960
and bought a new house in Taizhou.

790
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,320
Let me do it.

791
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,260
Don't move.

792
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,350
Lord Chen is in trouble,

793
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,110
yet he has money to drink and buy a place.

794
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,550
Did he get bribed?

795
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,400
Probably.

796
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,240
Wu Zhao found out all this?

797
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,710
Yes.

798
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,270
He told me that

799
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,980
word-for-word outside just now.

800
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,190
Lean back.

801
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,430
Get him to come in then.

802
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,690
I'll ask him in detail.

803
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,870
Forget it. I admit it.

804
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,980
I did it.

805
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,550
I knew it was you.

806
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,870
Don't move.

807
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,940
Are you okay?

808
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,270
Honey.

809
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,430
Didn't I tell you

810
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,090
not to get involved in this case?

811
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,420
What if it's dangerous?

812
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,550
I didn't face any danger.

813
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,510
Don't worry.

814
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,470
It's not as simple as you think.

815
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,510
If someone tries to hurt you,

816
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,880
I'm injured.

817
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,250
How can I protect you?

818
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,840
So you know you're injured?

819
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,630
Get well soon then.

820
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,350
Rest for a few more days.

821
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,150
You'll recover after some rest.

822
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,910
Since you're injured,

823
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,710
I'll let you off the hook.

824
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,640
Sleep on the bed.

825
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,980
You sleep on the floor.

826
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,290
You want me to sleep on the floor?

827
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,160
No way.

828
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,270
Move inside a little.

829
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,150
We'll squeeze a little.

830
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,010
I can take care of you more easily.

831
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,530
How can I sleep

832
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,950
if you keep staring at me?

833
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,710
I can't sleep.

834
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,410
You have to sleep even if you're not sleepy.

835
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,160
Turn around.

836
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,910
I'm injured.

837
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,830
I can't turn.

838
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,510
I'll turn then.

839
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,290
Didn't you say you'd take good care of me?

840
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,670
Sleep.
