Xu Muchen.

6
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,060
If we just hang here, neither of us can get out.

7
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,910
Let's work together to get out of here.

8
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,470
Okay.

9
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,950
I'll count to three,

10
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,300
and then throw you out.

11
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,550
One, two.

12
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,360
Three.

13
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,000
Get me out!

14
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,980
Answer my questions

15
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,630
and I'll help you get out.

16
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,910
What questions?

17
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,320
Did you kill

18
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,390
Lord Hu's whole family?

19
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,190
I'm a thief.

20
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,050
I only steal. I don't kill people.

21
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,530
Then why were you in Hu's Mansion that day?

22
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,870
I was asked

23
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,330
to steal something there.

24
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,350
Who asked you to steal there?

25
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,080
Someone paid me to steal there.

26
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,390
It's a rule that we

27
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,089
don't ask about the identities of those who pay us to steal.

28
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,209
Are you done?

29
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,079
One last question.

30
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,070
How did you get

31
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,590
the lock charm on you?

32
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,450
How come he knows about the lock charm?

33
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,510
You won't tell me?

34
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,710
I bought it at a street shop.

35
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,159
If you're interested in it,

36
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,230
I can give you one.

37
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,080
She wasn't the girl who saved me back then?

38
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,250
Have you ever been to Taizhou?

39
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,520
Have you ever saved a little boy from the flood there?

40
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,110
No.

41
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,590
Lord Xu, are you done?

42
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,270
If you keep asking me questions,

43
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,600
both of us will die here.

44
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,560
My Lord.

45
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,190
He committed suicide by taking poison.

46
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,160
My Lord.

47
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,780
I found this letter in Hei Limao's residence.

48
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,650
[I'll kill all the corrupt officials in the world. I'll have no regrets after I avenge my brother.]

49
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,390
I asked someone to check the old archives.

50
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,030
Lord Hu sentenced Hei Limao's younger brother to death by hanging

51
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,630
on the day when his brother got married.

52
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,490
He must have hated Lord Hu for that

53
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,190
so he chose to kill Lord Hu

54
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,790
on the day when Lord Hu's daughter got married.

55
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,310
My Lord.

56
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,590
Anything suspicious?

57
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,310
I'm not sure.

58
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,190
I feel there is something suspicious about the case.

59
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,990
Guys.

60
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,940
Take the corpse back to Zichen Department first.

61
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,550
Yes.

62
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,990
Take him away.

63
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,270
Yes.

64
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,610
Yes.

65
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,480
Hold my hand. Don't let go.

66
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,330
From now on, always wear this.

67
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,310
Then even if we drift apart,

68
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,640
I'll recognize you when I see this one day.

69
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,290
Let's make a pink swear.

70

Buddha, please bless us.

71
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,370
I hope she's still alive,

72
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,930
safe and happy now.

73
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,040
If she is really a thief now,

74
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,870
I will make her quit being one and get her to do good deeds.

75
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,070
Please don't punish her for what she did.

76
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,790
Just punish me.

77
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,890
This is my way to repay her for saving my life.

Ms. Wang.

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,130
Greetings, Lord Xu.

83
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,590
Why are you here alone?

84
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,520
Where is my wife?

85
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,530
I invited her to come to the temple with me

86
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,070
and I intended to ask her to live in the house at the back mountain with me.

87
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,720
But Young Madam suddenly said

88
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,950
she had a headache

89
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,710
and wanted to have a rest in the Buddhist chamber.

90
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,760
She said she would wait for you there.

91
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,890
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

92
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,590
Honey.

93
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,390
Didn't I ask you to wait for me in the Buddhist chamber?

94
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,920
Why did you come back alone?

95
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,870
What kind of husband are you?

96
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,950
You promised that you and Zhen would go to temple and pray together.

97
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,910
Where did you go?

98
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,830
You left her alone in the temple.

99
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,510
Do you know

100
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,110
Zhen was not feeling well today

101
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,150
but she insisted on going because she didn't want to let you down?

102
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,830
But you

103
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,560
left her alone in the mountain.

104
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,470
I waited there until it was dark.

105
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,680
Almost all the pilgrims left at that time.

106
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,670
It was not safe for a young girl to travel at night.

107
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,990
So I came back in advance.

108
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,030
I told you to wait for me in the temple

109
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,870
because I would go and pick you up.

110
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,350
How could you go down the mountain on your own?

111
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,720
What if you got in danger?

112
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,950
So you know it was dangerous.

113
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,790
Do you know

114
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,990
Zhen was almost kidnapped by bandits today?

115
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,430
If she hadn't been saved by a kind person,

116
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,190
how would I explain to the Su family?

117
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,250
Forget it, Mother.

118
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,310
It's all over.

119
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,990
I'm fine.

120
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,030
You met bandits?

121
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,950
Mother.

122
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,270
I'm a little tired.

123
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,310
I'm going to bed.

124
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,400
I don't want to blame you,

125
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,150
but how could you treat Zhen that way?

126
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,080
You left her alone in the mountain.

127
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,270
When she was in danger in the mountain,

128
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,670
she didn't know what to do.

129
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,270
How could you be so careless?

130
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,550
Mother.

131
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,680
I was working today.

132
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,160
Working?

133
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,030
You have been suspended.

134
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,550
How come you had work to do?

135
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,270
Besides,

136
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,130
no work is more important than ensuring her safety.

137
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,470
I can tell

138
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,780
Zhen really loves you.

139
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,510
Don't let her down.

140
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,600
I won't.

141
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,350
Sleeping so early?

142
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,190
Are you angry with me?

143
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,690
What are you doing?

144
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,910
Honey, what's wrong?

145
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,840
Did you get hurt?

146
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,390
No.

147
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,990
But just now...

148
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,240
Can't you tell I have a stomachache now?

149
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,360
Stomachache?

150
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,380
Did you catch a cold when you went down the mountain.

151
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,550
Are you interrogating a criminal?

152
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,010
Stop asking me questions.

153
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,790
Do you have anything else to do here?

154
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,910
If not, just leave.

155
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,410
But why do you have a stomachache now?

156
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,790
I'm sorry

157
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
for leaving you alone in the mountain today.

158
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,990
I'm sorry

159
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,150
that I didn't notice that you were sick today.

160
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,710
It's my fault.

161
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,790
Good for you to realize your mistakes.

162
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,110
But you shouldn't have begun to go down the mountain

163
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,510
before I went back to you.

164
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,830
So you think I deserved the bad luck?

165
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,510
I mean, as a rich lady,

166
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,310
you can easily be targeted by villains.

167
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,270
And you have no self-defense skills.

168
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,470
Those bad people can kidnap you easily.

169
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,430
You're saying I deserved the bad luck

170
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,390
and I was stupid.

171
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,870
I don't mean that.

336
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,460
Were the cakes bought from the shop I usually go to?

337
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,150
Yes.

338
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,830
I always buy the cakes there.

339
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,630
How come this one doesn't taste as good as those I ate this morning?

340
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,890
What are you thinking?

341
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,830
Nothing.

342
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,910
Here, this is for you.

343
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,030
This ointment

344
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,630
should be better than yours.

345
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,640
Rong.

346
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,870
Don't be so rash next time.

347
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,000
It was so dangerous.

348
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,390
It's not necessarily a bad thing

349
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,910
that Watermill took that title from you.

350
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,070
Just be a good girl

351
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,590
and focus on being the daughter of the Su family.

352
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,510
When nobody pays attention to those things anymore,

353
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,510
you and Xu Muchen go get divorced

354
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,630
and we'll leave the city and travel around the world.

355
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,630
Isn't that good?

356
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,030
Why did you have to get involved in those cases?

357
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,670
Do you know how hard it was for me

358
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,910
to get Master to make me

359
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,790
Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

360
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,850
How can I give up that title so easily?

361
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,670
What's so good about being Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

362
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,230
You got hurt a lot because of it.

363
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,490
Of course it's good to be Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

364
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,510
In the eyes of the people,

365
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,310
Willow Leaf Thief Liu is a heroine who robs the rich to help the poor.

366
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,630
Okay, okay.

367
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,510
You're a heroine.

368
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,440
You're the best.

369
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,590
It's getting late.

370
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,350
I have to go back.

371
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,750
Thank you for your ointment.

372
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,750
What would you like to eat tomorrow?

373
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,150
Well...

374
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,310
How about fried stinky tofu?

375
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,830
No problem.

376
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,750
By the way,

377
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,960
I remember you like durians.

378
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,030
I've asked my servants to go south

379
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,190
to transport them here as soon as possible.

380
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,120
Come and try them when they arrive.

381
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,520
Bye, Rong.

382
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,030
Young Master.

383
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,790
Next time, could you please

384
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,030
not agree to get Her Ladyship everything she asks for?

385
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,230
What she likes

386
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,950
is either foreign specialties

387
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,470
or the famous traditional dishes that few people know how to cook now.

388
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,510
If this keeps going on,

389
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,920
we'll be exhausted.

390
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,190
As long as she wants to eat it,

391
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,070
why not try our best to find it and give it to her?

392
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,230
Yes, you don't need to find it yourself.

393
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,590
We have to do it for you.

394
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,630
What a coincidence.

395
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,670
The evidence is complete.

396
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,800
Their inference also makes sense.

397
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,070
The whole family of the Minister of Revenue was killed.

398
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,150
Those from Zichen Department

399
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,080
solved the case in just three days.

400
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,870
My Lord.

401
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,670
I think Xu Muchen was anxious to

402
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,750
solve the case and show His Majesty that he's able

403
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,410
so he found a scapegoat and tortured him and made him plead guilty.

404
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,640
Let's go.

405
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,800
Let's go to Zichen Department for an autopsy.

406
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,110
This is the false tooth found in Hei Limao's mouth.

407
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,750
Wu Zhao.

408
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,270
My Lord.

409
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,190
What's wrong?

410
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,390
The coroner found a false tooth in Hei Limao's mouth

411
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,680
when he was performing an autopsy.

412
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,670
We smashed it

413
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,130
and found that in the tooth was white powder.

414
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:33,910
Wu Zhao.

415
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,270
Examine the powder now.

416
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,830
Yes.

417
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,470
Xu Muchen.

418
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,130
Lord Gongyang, it's so late now.

419
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,260
What brings you to Zichen Department?

420
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,750
Zichen Department

421
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,510
closed Lord Hu's case hastily.

422
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,070
The Ministry of Justice is here to review the case.

423
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,390
It's already midnight.

424
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,140
Even if the Ministry of Justice wants to review the case,

425
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,510
you'll have to come tomorrow during our office hours.

426
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,310
It's inappropriate for you

427
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,400
to come to Zichen Department without telling us.

428
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,670
Office hours?

429
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,350
Should I give you the time to cover yourselves

430
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,810
and destroy the evidence?

431
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,160
Fine.

432
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,820
Do what you have to.

433
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,280
Where is Hei Limao's corpse?

434
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,190
It's inside.

435
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,050
The coroner just examined it.

436
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,070
Guards!

437
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,880
Yes.

438
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,510
Take Hei Limao's body back to the Ministry of Justice

439
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,150
and examine it carefully.

440
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,670
Yes.

441
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,570
Has your coroner found anything new?

442
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,350
Yes.

443
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,950
A false tooth was found in Hei Limao's mouth

444
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,310
and inside the tooth is white powder.

445
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,370
Where is the tooth?

446
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,790
It's being examined.

447
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,430
He Wei.

448
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,090
Yes.

449
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,590
You go see

450
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,150
how the examination is going

451
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,200
on behalf of the Ministry of Justice.

452
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,790
Yes.

453
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,150
Xu Muchen.

454
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,270
You'd better wish that I won't find

455
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,270
that it has something to do with you.

456
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,270
Gongyang.

457
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,870
I advise you to spend more time finding the truth

458
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,800
instead of paying attention to me.

459
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,870
Bye.

460
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,030
Xu Muchen.

461
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,160
I'll get you punished sooner or later.

462
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,510
My Lord.

463
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,510
The poison taken by the killer in Hei Limao's case

464
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,710
and the poison taken by the killer in Nanxiang Kingdom's case

465
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,840
have been examined.

466
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,950
Their ingredients are exactly the same.

467
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,470
But most of the herbs that can be used to make that kind of poison

468
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,870
are quite ordinary herbs

469
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,990
that can be bought easily in all pharmacies.

470
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,430
So the poisons are not very important clues.

471
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,750
The most important ingredient of the poisons is Canglin.

472
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,910
It only grows in North Sea.

473
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,550
It's not a herb and it's not very useful.

474
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,040
It can't be found in the capital.

475
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,670
But I didn't give up.

476
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,870
I tasted the poison myself

477
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,240
and smelled the dregs of the decoction.

478
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,390
And I found the poison smelled and tasted fishy.

479
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,630
I found the smell was familiar.

480
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,830
My Lord, guess what?

481
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,830
Don't make me guess. Tell me.

482
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,950
Okay.

483
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,430
I thought hard

484
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,910
and then it occurred to me that

485
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,310
the smell was very much like that of Butterfly's Love,

486
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,830
an aphrodisiac

487
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,640
that is the most popular in Liufang Pavilion.

488
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,670
The pharmacist examined Butterfly's Love

489
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,200
and found Canglin in it.

490
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,520
Am I smart?

491
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,910
You're really good.

492
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,790
Of course.

493
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,750
More compliments?

494
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,230
Are you interested in Liufang Pavilion?

495
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,710
I read about Butterfly's Love in a storybook.

496
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,870
In a storybook?

497
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,750
The crucial ingredient of that highly toxic poison

498
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,080
is also the ingredient of an aphrodisiac.

499
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,370
I bet Zichen Department will never notice this.

500
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,550
This time,

501
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,880
we're going to win.

502
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,300
[A small amount of white powder in the right premolar is toxic.]

503

The poison that Hei Limao took

is the same as the poison taken by the killer

Could the two cases

be planned by the same organization?

How come he knows about the lock charm?

that I would meet him at the dock after we separated.

I have to warn you

that although those pills are good,

677
