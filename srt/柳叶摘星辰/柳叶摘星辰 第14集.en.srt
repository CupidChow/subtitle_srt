The male protagonist thought the female protagonist had an affair.

She felt wronged, so she told her mother-in-law,

78

but her mother-in-law...

79

Why is it good?

90
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,820
Because it...

91
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,530
Because it's thick.

92
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,300

105
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,230
these books that girls read are all the same

106
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,830
and nothing stands out?

107

It's a storybook about solving cases.

sell books on that subject matter?

something is wrong?

138

Something is indeed wrong.

Who filled the hole?

140
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,560
Young Master did.

141
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,510
He spent two hours on the wall.

142
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,540
What happened?

143
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,210

Young Master sealed it.

What's wrong with Xu Muchen?

147
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,830
Why did he seal the door?

148
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,590
Young Master said the Feng Shui master saw it

149
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,570
and said the door is not auspicious.

150
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,930
It's an easy target for thieves.

151
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,130
It needs to be sealed.

152
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,820
An easy target for thieves?

153

I must talk to him about this.

Young Master also said

157
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,710
there are pressing matters to deal with at the mansion

158
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,310
so he won't be able to host casual visitors.

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,690
Yes.

173
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,660
Take me back for dinner then.

174
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,000
I can meet Xiao Qiu too.

175
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,180
Not today.

176
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,230
Another day.

177
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,200
Lord Gu.

178
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,940
You were right.

179
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,110
How did you know that

180
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,400
His Lordship wouldn't take me home for dinner today?

181
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,570
You're still young.

182
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,490
You'll understand when you get married.

183
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,710
I have to go back too.

184
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,690
Bring me breakfast tomorrow morning.

185
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,859
Okay.

186
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,569
When I get married?

187
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,339
That'll depend on Xiao Qiu.

188
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,230
[Zichen Department]

189
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,990
[Zichen Department]

190
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,200
My Lord.

191
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,510
Good day, My Lord.

192
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,810
Take care.

193
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,040
Lord Xu, you're here.

194
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,700
Yes.

195
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,920
I'll pick some cakes.

196
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,970
They're for Young Madam, right?

197
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,150
These were just made today.

198
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,920
Have a look.

199
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,080
Boss.

200
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
This is pretty.

201
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,600
What is it?

202
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,600
This is peach blossom cake.

203
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,610
Okay.

204
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,910
Pack this for me.

205
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,410
Lord Xu.

206
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,610
Are you really buying this for Young Madam?

207
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,280
Miss Su of the Duke's Mansion?

208
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,390
Yes.

209
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,110
Lord Xu.

210
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,170
It seems like

211
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,150
you really don't know.

212
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,760
Young Madam can't touch peach blossoms at all.

213
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,930
Last year, the Duke's Mansion

214
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,310
sent someone to buy some of our peach blossom cakes

215
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,620
but after Miss Su ate it,

216
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,240
she had an allergic reaction.

217
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,900
It was almost a huge disaster.

218
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,820
Our little store almost closed down

219
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,590
because of this.

220
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,180
Okay.

221
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,210
I'll find something else then.

222
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,550
Lord Xu.

223
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,820
Why don't you take a look at this?

224
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,100
Miss Su's loves this

225
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,400
peanut pastry.

226
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,120
Peanut pastry?

227
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,740
Young Madam has a special constitution.

228
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,000
She can't eat peanuts.

229
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,810
She'll experience breathing problems if she eats them

230
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,920
and get rashes all over.

231
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,160
From now on,

232
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,380
you'll have to be more careful about what she eats at home.

233
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,390
You must be mistaken.

234
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,440
Just put it here.

235
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,110
Young Madam.

236
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,160
What special occasion is it today?

237
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,420
Why did you cook so many symbolic dishes?

238
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,100
Symbolic?

239
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,300
I just made them casually.

240
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,910
No.

241
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,720
The mixed vegetables, also known as "Heavenly Match",

242
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,520
symbolize the longing for a beautiful love story.

243
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,510
The honey chicken wings are also known as "Flying Together",

244
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,570
and represent they harmony and unity between spouses.

245
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,910
For the osmanthus glutinous rice lotus root,

246
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,880
the lotus root enjoys the fragrance of the osmanthus flowers

247
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,470
while the glutinous rice gets the flavor of the lotus root.

248
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,590
Two are intertwined

249
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,920
in the taste of the dish.

250
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,430
These are just some ordinary dishes.

251
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,750
It's not that deep.

252
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,350
Go check if the soup is ready.

253
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,150
If the soup is ready,

254
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,810
ask Young Master to come over.

255
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,030
Go.

256
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,120
Hurry up.

257
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,510
Young Master.

258
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,820
Why don't you go in?

259
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,790
I'll go in now.

260
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:05,970
Let's go.

261
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,740
You're here.

262
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,780
Have a seat.

263
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,850
Mother didn't come to dinner?

264
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,630
Old Madam said

265
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,440
Young Madam took the trouble to cook,

266
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,540
so she doesn't want to disturb your dinner.

267
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,660
Xiao Dong has brought her her share.

268
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,310
Young Master.

269
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,760
Young Madam made the dinner herself.

270
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,350
Every dish has a meaning.

271
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,850
Let me tell you.

272
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,450
Xiao Qiu,

273
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,110
if you have nothing else to do, please feel free to leave.

274
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,070
Go ahead.

275
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,240
I'll leave you two alone then.

276
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,800
Was it busy for Zichen Department today?

277
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,600
You look pretty serious

278
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,070
so I think you must be tired today.

279
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,520
I was distracted by a case

280
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,650
and neglected you.

281
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,640
It's okay.

282
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,990
If you're tired,

283
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,990
I'll put some hot water in your bath

284
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,390
to relieve your fatigue.

285
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,510
Okay.

286
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,180
Let's eat.

287
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,750
By the way,

288
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,860
I specially went to the cake shop

289
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,700
and bought some peach blossom cakes.

290
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,980
The boss said they're really delicious.

291
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,710
Try some.

292
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,930
The cakes look delicious.

293
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,160
Unfortunately, I can't eat them.

294
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,550
What's wrong?

295
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,360
I've been allergic to peach blossoms since childhood.

296
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,030
Once, I ate peach blossom cakes by mistake.

297
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,310
My throat was swollen for a day

298
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,310
and I almost died.

299
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,010
I never dared to eat them again.

300
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,050
But thank you.

301
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,710
But I see that Jinning always

302
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,730
sends you peach blossom cakes.

303
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,710
My brother

304
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,550
is really careless, don't you know?

305
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,380
He always buys a little of each flavor.

306
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,580
He doesn't remember.

307
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,160
I see.

308
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,520
Well, it's my mistake then.

309
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,290
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,190
It's okay.

311
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,790
You know,

312
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,270
of course you'll buy

313
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,180
whatever the manager recommends.

314
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,940
Yes.

315
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,050
Eat up.

316
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,610
Why does the loving dinner for two

317
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,390
seem a little weird?

318
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,270
Why is he so concerned

319
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,230
about the cakes?

320
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,090
Did he notice something?

321
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,460
That won't do.

322
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,430
I have to prepare in advance.

323
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,090
Young Master, your tea.

324
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,430
I won't have it.

325
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
I have something to do, I'm leaving.

326
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,310
He's holding a portrait of Young Madam.

327
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,270
Young Madam,

328
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,990
I really envy you and Young Master.

329
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,050
Young Master even carries your portrait with him when he goes out.

330
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,180
He really wants to see you all the time.

331
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,290
He brought my portrait?

332
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,250
He is indeed suspicious of me.

333
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:05,980
Young Madam.

334
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,840
Let's go.

335
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,500
[Duke's Mansion]

336
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:15,990
Sir,

337
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,230
do you live nearby?

338
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,380
Yes, why?

339
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,280
I want to ask you about someone.

340
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,850
Have you seen this woman?

341
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,120
Isn't this Miss Su?

342
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,030
Why are you asking about her?

343
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,940
Listen.

344
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,300

Sir.

Would you like some melons?

355
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,610
Let me ask you something first.

356
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,910
Have you seen this woman?

357
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,340
Isn't this Miss Su of the Duke's Mansion?

358
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,740
I've seen her.

359
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,110
Have you always been selling melon here?

360
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,330
Of course.

361
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,570
I've been selling melon

362
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,060
on this street for 20 years.

363
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,590
People from all over the city come here to buy melons.

364
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,270
Even the Duke's Mansion buys all their melons

365
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,300
from me.

Yes.

How about this?

369

I'll buy some if you answer my question.

370

Okay, go ahead.

371
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,530
How did you know

372
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,960
what Miss Su looks like?

373
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,860
I thought you were going to ask something else.

374
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,130
I'm not the only one who's seen her.

375
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,840
Everyone's seen her.

376
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,260
She comes out often?

377
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,460
No.

378
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,970
She is a rich lady.

379
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,990
Of course she doesn't go out.

380
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,640
But on Miss Su's wedding day,

381
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,110
the Duke's Mansion was very lively.

382
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,350
People from all over came to watch.

383
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,980
Of course they saw Miss Su.

384
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,110
On her wedding day,

385
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,800
wouldn't she have been wearing her veil?

386
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,840
No.

387
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,380
When she was saying goodbye to the Duke at the door,

388
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,960
he even asked her

389
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,320
to salute the people who came to see her off

390
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,990
and thank them

391

for taking care of her over the years.

392
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,150
You know, the Duke is really...

393
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,420
How can ordinary folk like us

394
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,750
take care of her?

395
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,730
It's thanks to them looking out for us from above

396
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,590
that we're able to have good days.

397
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,140

398

Okay.

409

have any good friends

410
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,910
or close servants growing up?

411
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,550
Speaking of Miss Su,

412
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,810
after she got married,

413
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,040
it seems that there's a new group of servants in Su's Mansion.

414
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,850
The people who come here to buy melons are new faces.

415
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,980
I don't know what the Duke is thinking.

416
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,480
The original servants were all pretty good.

417
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
Especially that Nanny Wang.

418
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
She was very nice.

419
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,670
She always came here personally

420
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,860
to pick melons for Miss Su

421

No.

426

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,800
Peanuts and peach blossoms can make her sick.

518
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,000
I remember when she was five,

519
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,520
we were in the countryside.

520
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,950
The peach blossoms were in full bloom,

521
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,910
so I took her to see the flowers.

522
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,330
After she came back, she fell seriously ill.

523
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,680
A lot of red rashes appeared on her body

524
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,660
and she got a scar on her shoulder.

525
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,830
The mansion sent someone

526
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,870
to tattoo a peach blossom on her to cover it up.

527
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,270
Only then was she scared.

528
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,380
After that, she didn't dare to eat these cakes anymore.

529
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,630
I see.

530
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,130
Miss has been living in the countryside since she was a child?

531
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:29,700
Yes.

532
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,510
Only when she was twelve,

533
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,470
did the Duke

534
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,450
take us to the mansion to live.

535
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,630
Miss was very naughty as a child,

536
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,060
like a fake boy.

537
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,370
I'm just worried that when she grows up,

538
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,730
if she gets married,

539
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,650
what if her husband can't accept her?

540
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,630
Sir.

541
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,610
We've been talking so much,

542
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,990
I forgot to get you water.

543
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,830
Have a seat.

544
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,920
I'll get you some water.

545
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,480
Okay.

546
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,070
Nanny's words

547
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,360
are exactly what Her Ladyship said to me.

548
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,160
Am I thinking too much?

549
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,230
Sir.

550
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,270
Here.

551
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,710
Here, have some water.

552
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,310
Thank you.

553
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,679
By the way, Madam Wang.

554
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,380
Miss asked me to give these silvers to you.

555
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,630
She said she misses you every day.

556
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,650
If you miss her too,

557
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,909
you can go to Xu's Mansion to visit her.

558
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:17,840
Her husband's family

559
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,320
will treat you like their family.

560
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,880
Okay.

561
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,510
I won't take up any more of your time.

562
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,670
Okay.

563
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,449
I'm leaving, Madam Wang.

564
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,489
Take care, sir.

565
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,469
Take care.

566
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,610
Madam Wang.

567
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,860
-Madam Wang.
-Miss Liu.

568
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,190
Thank you for this.

569
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,179
That's what I'm supposed to do.

570
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,810
But Miss Liu, you are suffering

571
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,010
for Miss.

572
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,719
It's fine.

573
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,610
I have something else to do.

574
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,300
I have to go.

575
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,370
Take care.

576
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,150
Miss Liu,

577
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,880
you be careful too.

578
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,260
And these silvers...

579
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,550
Keep them.

580
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,510
I'm leaving.

581
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,130
Senior Brother.

582
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
I told you to rest in your room.

583
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,310
What are you doing?

584
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,780
Xu Muchen didn't torture me.

585
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,420
There's nothing to heal from.

586
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,170
Even if you're not injured,

587
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,440
you usually don't do labor with your shoulders

588
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,020
or your hands.

589
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,980
Who said I don't?

590
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,850
I entered under the guise of a laborer,

591
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,250
yet I'm idling every day.

592
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,330
It's inevitable that someone will suspect something after some time.

593
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,030
Fine.

594
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,520
You've thought it through.

595
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,150
Take this bucket of water there

596
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,560
and water the tree then.

597
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,030
Okay.

598
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,710
All right.

599
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,920
I'll find you

600
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,000
some easier tasks, like sorting threads.

601
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,560
Let's go.

602
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:12,700
Boss Qin.

603
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,160
What's up?

604
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,470
Mrs. Xu is here.

605
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,730
She's waiting for you.

606
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,510
I'm exhausted.

607
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,430
I've been running after Xu Muchen the entire day.

608
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,360
What happened?

609
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,210
He started to suspect me.

610
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,820
He's investigating Su Jinzhen's identity.

611
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,620
But it's fine.

612
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,040
He's been tricked by me.

613
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,600
That's good.

614
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,190
Rong,

615
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,000
this Xu Muchen

616
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,580
is notoriously observant.

617
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,360
He's very good at solving cases.

618
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,620
You can't be careless.

619
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,910
I know.

620
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,540
That's why I have to put on a full show.

621
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,040
I told Madam Wang to tell him

622
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,630
I had a scar when I had an allergic reaction

623
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,270
that I had to cover up with an image,

624
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,530
so he won't be suspicious when he sees it.

625
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,070
However,

626
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,470
this scar...

627
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,420
No.

628
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,910
This image

629
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,390
won't wash off easily on my body

630
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,970
so it should look good.

631
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,380
Who in the capital has the best taste?

632
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,260
It's Senior,

633
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,420
right, Senior?

634
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,470
Senior.

635
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,030
Senior.

636
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,520
It hurts.

637
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Don't scare me.

638
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,190
Bite it.

639
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,790
Don't be dramatic.

640
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,680
It's just a few stitches.

641
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,090
A few stitches?

642
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,910
Senior, how long more?

643
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,080
Almost done.

644
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,670
Almost halfway done.

645
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,020
[Come home for dinner tonight. I'll cook.]

646
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,080
[The white sun sinks behind the mountains, and the Yellow River flows into the sea.]

647
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,660
[Come home for dinner tonight. I'll cook.]

648
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Her Ladyship's handwriting

649
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,770
is exactly the same as what I found in Su's Mansion.

650
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,480
Did I think too much?

651
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,290
No.

652
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,130
There's one more place.

653
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,030
[Xu's Mansion]

654
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,990
[Exceptional talents]

655
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,230
Mother.

656
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,570
Eat.

657
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,430
Honey.

658
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,200
Pass me that dish.

659
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,820
Thank you.

660
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,330
Zhen,

661
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,110
you don't seem to have a good appetite.

662
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,720
Are you not feeling well?

663
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,500
Maybe

664
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I ate too many cakes this afternoon.

665
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,450
I think you've been sick

666
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,610
since a few days ago.

667
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,230
I'm afraid there's a lot of dampness and coldness in your body.

668
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,080
I'll take you to the hot spring these days

669
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,460
to dispel the coldness.

670
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,460
No need.

671
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,950
Actually, I'm fine.

672
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,280
Let's go now.

673
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,190
Mother.

674
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,610
I promised you before too,

675
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,720
but I was caught up with work.

676
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,680
Honey.

677
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,610
What do you think?

678
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,090
Sure.
