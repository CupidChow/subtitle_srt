4
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,270
Mother,

5
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,430
who is this?

6
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,130
This is the best physician in the capital, Dr. Ding.

7
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,930
Mother, are you feeling unwell?

8
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,950
I'm fine.

9
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,340
I asked Dr. Ding to come

10
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,590
to examine your body.

11
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,790
Examine my body?

12
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,070
I'm perfectly fine.

13
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,590
Lord Xu,

14
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,670
Although it's a private issue,

15
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,790
you must be honest

16
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,190
with the doctor.

17
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,710
Otherwise, it may affect your reproduction.

18
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,390
It's not worth it.

19
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,150
What private issue?

20
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,030
It's preposterous.

21
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,790
Mother,

22
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,430
there's nothing wrong with my health.

23
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,640
Dr. Ding has the final say on that.

24
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,620
Sit down.

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,510
Sit down!

26
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,390
Mr. Xu's pulse is neither too light nor too heavy,

27
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,600
indicating a balanced and harmonious state.

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,200
It doesn't seem like there are any private illnesses.

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,530
However, this illness may not always manifest in the pulse.

30
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,070
Just to be cautious,

31
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,320
I'll prescribe medication for Mr. Xu.

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
If taken regularly,

33
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,870
he will surely recover.

34
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,070
Your Ladyship,

35
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,440
I'll go and prepare the medicine for him right away.

Yes.

What's going on?

43

If it weren't for Zhen's gift of white chrysanthemums to you this time,

44

Yes.

What's wrong with you?

71
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,670
Why the long face?

72
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,670
Were you bullied?

73
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,130
If you were mad at me,

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,880
you could vent your anger at me.

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,080
But don't you think tarnishing my reputation outside

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
was too much?

77

Who tarnished your reputation?

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,840
What about the white chrysanthemums then?

Come on. Why are we talking about it again?

81
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,750
I did sneak a few pieces of pastry.

82
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,610
I was helping Xiao Qiu deliver them,

83
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,680
and I got hungry on the way,

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,720
so I ate a few pieces.

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,430
The plate looked a bit empty, which didn't look good.

86
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,100
So I put a few white chrysanthemums on it.

87
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,610
Am I not allowed to eat your pastries?

88

What did he say?

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,070
It doesn't matter.

94
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,890
You were using the white chrysanthemums to give me a hint.

95
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,600
What can white chrysanthemums hint?

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,210
They are just a kind of flower.

97
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,270
Do you know that...

98
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,280
White chrysanthemums can be used to extract oil to enhance libido.

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,510
Sending white chrysanthemums may imply that Young Master wants it...

Don't you like analyzing things?

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,290
Then analyze this:

115
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,010
give you something like that?

116
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,550
If it got out,

117
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,159
would I be able to maintain my good reputation?

118

Moreover, we're...

there were only you, me, and Wu Zhao in the room.

How did Mother and the servants know?

123
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,210
Could it be that Wu Zhao told them?

Right.

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,310
Young Master.

175
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,580
Young Master, why are you back?

176
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,900
He's our Young Master.

177
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,860
Quickly, go and move the things.

178
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,610
Hurry up.

179
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,490
Young Master.

180
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,410
I heard that my dad found someone

181
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,900
to marry into the Xu family in place of my sister.

182
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,470
So,

183
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,750
as soon as I heard the news,

184
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,950
I hurried back

185
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,210
to make up for my gift as an elder brother.

186
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,030
Today is their homecoming, isn't it?

187
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,830
Young Master,

188
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,940
you're so considerate.

189
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,310
You must be exhausted from the journey.

190
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,640
Why don't you go freshen up and rest first?

191
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,260
What are you doing?

192
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,470
Do you know how to work?

193
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,830
In this box is the treasure

194
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,710
I specifically prepared for Rong.

195
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,070
Yes.

196
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,590
If you damage it, I will definitely punish you!

197
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,190
I'm sorry, Young Master.

198
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,670
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,190
And this one too.

200
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,070
Be careful!

201
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,270
Remember to handle them gently!

202
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,710
You unfilial son!

203
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,290
How dare you come back?

204
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,220
Tie him up!

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Yes.

206
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,300
Wait! Wait!

207
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,150
Dad, why are you tying me up?

208
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,460
How could you let...

209
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,720
Take him away and teach him a good lesson!

210
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,460
Lock him up for a few days!

211
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,700
Yes. Let's go.

212
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,970
This unfilial son.

213
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm so pissed off with him.

214
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,750
I found him a position in the Ministry of Industry, but he refused to take it.

215
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,420
We arranged a marriage for him with Miss Zhou before they were born, but he refused to marry her.

216
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,120
He sneaked out for over a month,

217
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,680
without even leaving me a word!

218
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,080
Today, I'm going to teach you a good lesson!

219
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,880
Muchen, let's go inside and have a seat.

220
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,830
Zhen.

221
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,400
Dad.

222
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,020
Untie me! Untie me!

223
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Young Master,

224
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,380
please stop struggling.

225
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,510
You may hurt yourself.

226
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,960
Then quickly untie me.

227
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,310
Have you all lost your minds?

228
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,950
How dare you tie up your own Young Master?

229
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,910
Master said

230
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,190
we cannot let you disturb

231
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,110
the homecoming of Miss and her husband.

232
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,510
Otherwise, we will be punished.

233
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,530
What Miss? What husband?

234
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,990
Are you blind?

235
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,540
That's your Young Madam and another man!

236
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,790
Not only didn't you

237
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,070
help me snatch her back,

238
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,030
but you also tied me up.

239
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,590
How disloyal you guys are!

240
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,840
Did you hear me? Untie me!

241
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,190
Fine. You're really something.

242
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,670
Young Master,

243
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,870
You've used this trick

244
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,470
dozens of times since you were a child.

245
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,420
Fine. I won't go out.

246
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,940
But you have to give me something to eat at least.

247
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,210
I haven't eaten anything yet.

248
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,230
Are you trying to starve me to death so that

249
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,890
you can tell Master that you finished your task?

250
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,630
You've been married for a while.

251
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,630
Are you getting along well?

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Father,

253
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,760
we are getting along quite well.

254
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,330
That's good to hear.

255
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,330
Zhen

256
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,720
was rarely around me when she was a child.

257
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,780
It took some effort to bring her back.

258
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,420
I always felt sorry for the hardships she endured,

259
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,370
so I rarely disciplined her

260
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,910
and spoiled her too much.

261
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,750
If she did anything wrong,

262
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,340
please forgive her, Muchen.

263
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,820
Don't worry about it.

264
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,630
Zhen is...

265
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,390
lively,

266
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,200
reasonable, and sensible.

267
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,160
There's nothing wrong with her.

268
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,290
That's good to hear.

269
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,890
Young Master, eat slowly.

270
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,780
Be careful not to choke.

271
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,390
Every meal

272
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,500
is too essential to skip.

273
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,910
Feed me quickly. Stop nagging.

274
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,460
Eat slowly.

275
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,460
Hurry up.

276
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,340
Young Master?

277
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,730
Be careful.

278
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,690
Young master.

279
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,250
Be careful.

280
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,830
Young Master.

281
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Young Master?

282
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,770
Young Master?

283
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,840
Stop pretending.

284
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,410
I don't believe you.

285
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,380
Young Master?

286
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,460
Young Master?

287
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,340
Young Master!

288
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,880
Young Master!

289
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,720
Young Master.

290
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,310
Young Master?

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Young Master?

292
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,750
Wake up.

293
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,010
Young Master! Young Master!

294
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,840
Help! Help!

295
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,030
Help!

296
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,340
It doesn't matter that the trick is old,

297
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,870
as long as I perform it well.

298
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,910
Zhen,

299
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,870
now that you're married,

300
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,790
you shouldn't be as willful as before.

301
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,250
You should know what to do

302
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,550
and what not to do.

303
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,590
Got it, Dad.

304
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,870
Dad! Dad!

305
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,710
What's going on?

306
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,190
Hey, Liu...

307
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,710
You mean stay here overnight?

308
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,670
Not only will we stay overnight,

309
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,070
but we're also going to stay for three days.

310
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,440
My dear brother.

311
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,470
Dear brother?

312
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,390
You brat.

313
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,350
Come and meet your brother-in-law.

314
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,550
Brother-in-law?

315
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,330
Brother.

316
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,300
Brother?

317
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,380
When did you come back?

318
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,670
Why didn't you tell me?

319
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,860
I missed you so much.

320
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,910
Really?

321
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,430
But...

322
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,720
What kind of brother are you?

323
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,770
You didn't come back for your sister's wedding.

324
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,589
And you didn't even tell me that you had come back.

325
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,109
Come out with me!

326
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,829
No, no, no.

327
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,670
It hurts!

328
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,010
I'm sorry for that.

329
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,960
They have had a good relationship since childhood.

330
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,079
Zhen must be blaming her brother

331
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,589
for leaving for over a month

332
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,050
and missing your wedding.

333
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,490
She must have gone to scold him.

334
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,620
She is right to do so.

335
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,590
Please, sit down.

336
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,560
Rong.

337
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,350
How come it's you who's the substitute bride?

338
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,950
Why can't it be me?

339
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,230
Zhen needed a substitute.

340
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,390
And I had a task to complete at the Xu's Mansion.

341
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,590
Wasn't that perfect?

342
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,870
What do you mean by "perfect"?

343
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,000
Come on, let me take you to divorce him.

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,030
Stop messing.

345
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,920
I haven't finished my task yet.

346
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,540
Come on!

347
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,150
My dear Lady,

348
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,030
being a thief and robbing the rich to help the poor is enough.

349
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,670
What task

350
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,550
is worth getting married for?

351
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,950
It's just a marriage.

352
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,030
What's the big deal?

353
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,910
Just a marriage?

354
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,820
Do you even know what marriage means?

355
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,070
It means being together,

356
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,030
sharing meals and beds,

357
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,920
treating each other with courtesy,

358
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,710
and being intimate at night.

359
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,510
-And also...
-Enough.

360
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,510
It's just a task.

361
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,510
We're husband and wife in front of others.

362
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,960
Once the task is finished, we'll part ways.

363
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,190
But what if you don't?

364
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,990
You're together every day.

365
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,520
Who can guarantee that nothing unexpected will happen?

366
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,270
Besides,

367
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,630
Who knows whether he has ulterior motives

368
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,720
and will use some trickery?

369
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,120
After all, you're beautiful and adorable.

370
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,160
That's true.

371
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,710
Don't worry.

372
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,060
I'll protect myself.

373
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,390
But, Rong...

374
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,780
There's no "but".

375
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,070
This is just a task.

376
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,260
If you dare to sabotage my task,

377
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,060
I'll never speak to you anymore.

378
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,080
I'm Su Jinzhen now,

379
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,940
your sister,

380
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,230
the eldest lady of the Su family.

381
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,960
Don't call me by the wrong name.

382
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,510
Fine.

383
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Well, call me that one more time.

384
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,120
What?

385
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,610
Call me...

386
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,330
dear brother.

387
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,960
Rong!

388
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,870
I'm sorry!

389
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
The case about the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom,

390
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,750
you handled it well.

391
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,470
If it weren't for the Zichen Department timely uncovering the truth

392
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,730
and finding the envoy,

393
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,280
it's very likely that

394
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,180
there would have been a war between our two countries.

395
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,780
What you did can be considered turning the tide

396
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,460
and saving countless lives from disaster.

397
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,640
Father, you're too kind.

398
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,840
It's our duty in the Zichen Department.

399
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,900
Have you found out

400
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,910
who was behind the attack on the envoy?

401
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,590
Such malicious intent

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,730
must have an ambitious motive.

403
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,470
We're still investigating.

404
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,490
If there are any difficulties,

405
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,590
feel free to ask for my help anytime.

406
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,400
We're family now.

407
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,750
We should support each other.

408
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,190
Thank you, Father.

409
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,570
Speaking of which,

410
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,310
the Su and Xu families have a connection.

411
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,510
Back then,

412
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,010
when your father was taking the imperial examination,

413
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,600
I was his examiner.

414
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,830
Later, when he passed and entered government service,

415
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,230
he became my student.

416
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,490
It was I who recommended him to the Ministry of Industry,

417
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,480
where we worked together to manage flooding.

418
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,070
Yes.

419
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,880
I've heard that

420
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,420
you've helped the Xu family.

421
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,480
I'll remember that forever.

422
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,310
I had thought that we, as teacher and student,

423
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,310
could always work together with one heart and one mind,

424
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,960
managing the country together

425
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,250
and achieving peace and prosperity.

426
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,930
Who would have thought

427
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,930
that Chengsi would harm countless people

428
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,150
because of his greed?

429
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,400
I never expected

430
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,950
that Lord Xu, who appeared so frugal in his daily life,

431
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,030
would turn out to be corrupt.

432
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,580
We may know a man's exterior but not his heart.

433
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,480
His death was deserved!

434
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,630
Nonsense!

435
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,870
My father was not a corrupt official!

436
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,580
He was not!

437
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,720
A big corrupt official!

438
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,180
He was a corrupt official!

439
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,910
My father let you down.

440
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,390
The past cannot be changed.

441
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,140
Muchen,

442
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,360
I brought this up with no other motives.

443
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,210
I just want you to know

444
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,470
that back then,

445
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,730
there were a lot of things

446
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,850
that I was reluctant to do and couldn't change.

447
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,300
I brought this up today

448
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,460
because I don't want it

449
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,370
to become a thorn between our families.

450
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,580
I especially don't want it

451
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,850
to affect your relationship with Zhen.

452
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,800
He embezzled government funds for his own gain,

453
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,910
then committed suicide out of fear of punishment,

454
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,170
causing the destruction of the dam

455
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,570
and leaving millions of people displaced.

456
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,700
He deserved it.

457
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,180
I harbor no resentment towards you.

458
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,110
Instead, I've been taking you as an example,

459
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,750
taking the welfare of the people as my responsibility,

460
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,100
and striving for their well-being.

461
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,580
That's the best.

462
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,030
Have you taught him a lesson?

463
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,730
I spared Brother for now.

464
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,200
Okay, okay.

465
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,000
It's getting late.

466
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,860

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,350
Come out!

472
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,890
What do you want?

473
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,780
Let's put the bags down first.

474
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,700
Keep looking!

475
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,320
Keep looking!

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,920
Have you seen them clearly?

477
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,620
I remember you were quite interested in this cabinet.

478
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Shall I open it for you to have a look?

479
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,670
Miss Su.

480
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,600
You...

481
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,370
I'm sorry.

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,060

according to our agreement,

484
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,870
should we

485
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,310
divide this room too?

486
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,140
Okay.

487
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,030
Keep up.

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,190

spend the night alone.

490
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,830
The night is long.

491
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,450
Who knows what might happen?

492
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,060
Come. Put the table here.

497
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,910
Why are you here?

498
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,470
I'm here to bond with my brother-in-law.

To bond?

But now you have inexplicably become husband and wife.

502

00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,290
Wonderful!

691
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,639
Here!

692
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,210
Catch it!

693
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,290
Catch it!

694
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,440
Everyone has a share!

695
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,590
[Su's Mansion]

696
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,660
Everyone has a share!

697
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,230
Here!

698
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,020
It's mine!

699
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,490
Everyone has a share!

700
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,670
Young Madam.

701
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,840
Young Master, Young Madam,

702
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,880
are you up?

703
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,310
Young Madam,

704
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,230
your brother came to visit you.

705
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,410
Why did he follow us here?

706
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,330
Why are you here?

707
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,480
I came to see you.

708
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,380
Besides,

709
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,810
I should visit Old Madam.

710
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,090
Greetings, Your Ladyship, I'm Jinning.

711
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,400
He is...

712
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,330
He is my brother.

713
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,500
Oh, you are her brother.

714
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,450
Don't stand on ceremony.

715
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,360
Please take a seat.

716
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,000
Okay.

717
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,750
Muchen,

718
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,110
How were you last night?

719
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,180
I was fine.

720
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,800
Jinning, please have a seat.

721
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,400
The renowned Young Master Su from the Duke's Mansion,

722
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,440
upon meeting you today, I found that you truly are a man of striking appearance.

723
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,980
I've been occupied with affairs outside,

724
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,280
missing the wedding of Zhen.

725
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,510
Only now have I come to visit,

726
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,630
if any rudeness, I ask for your forgiveness.

727
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,420
Your Ladyship,

728
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,060
I've prepared some modest gifts,

729
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,140
just to express my sincerity.

730
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,940
They're not anything valuable.

731
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,440
Pearls from the South Sea,

732
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,360
purple jade Guanyin statues,

733
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,730
porcelains from Ding kiln,

734
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,390
and...

735
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,650
Please, we can't accept them.

736
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,110
They are all too precious.

737
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,870
These are just lifeless objects,

738
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,670
not comparable to my sincerity.

739
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,600
Zhen holds a far greater value in my heart

740
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,070
than any of these.

741
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,870
I've heard how you treat her as your own,

742
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,970
with great care and affection.

743
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,250
I'm deeply grateful.

744
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,010
This is the only way I can express my gratitude.

745
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,750
Zhen is such a good daughter-in-law.

746
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,430
How can I not cherish her?

747
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,730
By the way,

748
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,880
I heard that you moved next door today.

749
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,750
Yes.

750
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,220
Let me tell you,

751
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,620
since we were kids, Zhen has always been relying on me.

752
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,040
Even though she's married now,

753
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,870
I still feel the need

754
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,380
to move close to her to look after her.

755
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,380
What do you think?

756
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,430
That makes sense.

757
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,990
As the saying goes, "a close neighbor is better than a distant relative."

758
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,840
A family living next to each other,

759
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,070
taking care of each other,

760
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,830
is fulfilling and harmonious.

761
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,070
Jinning, you truly are a good brother.

762
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,830
You flatter me, Your Ladyship.

763
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,750
What exactly do you want?

764
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,210
Let me have a word with my brother.

765
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,580
What exactly do you want?

766
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,990
I want to take care of you.

767
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,790
I need to keep an eye on you at all times,

768
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,940
ensuring that Xu Muchen

769
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,890
doesn't take advantage of you.

770
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,170
I...

771
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,000
You're going back?

772
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,430
Let me see you off.

773
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,430
Mother, let me see my brother off.

774
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,760
He said he's going back.

775
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,350
Hit harder.

776
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,150
Haven't you eaten?

777
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,210
Yes, Young Master.

778
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,500
What's going on?

779
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,170
Old Madam.

780
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,430
I think

781
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,850
now that we're neighbors

782
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,950
and taking care of each other,

783
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,750
it would be convenient to open a gate in this wall

784
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,210
for easy access between our homes.

785
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,480
After all, we are family.

786
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
What do you think?

787
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,370
Okay.

788
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,260
Isn't it good?

789
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,870
This one looks good.

790
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,630
Mother.

791
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,290
Mother.

792
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,120
Chen, Zhen.

793
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,370
This is the tailor I invited

794
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,950
to make new outfits for you.

795
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,590
Look.

796
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,070
This young couple,

797
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,110
one is handsome and dashing,

798
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,870
and the other is as beautiful as a flower.

799
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,190
I've seen

800
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,660
many young men and women,

801
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,050
but never have I seen a couple as well-matched as you two.

802
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,780
It's truly a blessing for me

803
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,750
to be able to make clothes

804
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,710
for such a golden couple.

805
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,850
Oh, you're too kind.

806
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,420
I think you just want to sell more fabric.

807
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,870
Your Ladyship,

808
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,330
you shouldn't say that.

809
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,750
Young Master Xu is truly handsome.

810
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,720
I feel too embarrassed to measure him myself.

811
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,530
I think it would be better

812
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,500
for Young Madam Xu to handle it.

813
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,530
Alright.

814
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,340
Let the young couple get close.

815
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,010
But I don't know how.

816
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,480
Let me teach you.

817
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,810
The shoulders.

818
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,760
The arms.

819
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,550
The neck.

820
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,810
The chest.

821
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,210
The waist.

822
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,540
Chen,

823
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,980
measure it for Zhen.

824
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,580
Wait.

825
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,880
Are you going to make clothes?

826
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,020
What a coincidence.

827
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,430
Be careful.

828
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,510
Since childhood,

829
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,930
Zhen has had delicate skin

830
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,460
and easily gets skin abrasions.

831
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,720
She can only wear Jinzhou satin.

832
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,270
Look,

833
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,530
I happened to bring it.

834
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,110
Are you going to measure her?

835
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,510
Here, let me do it.

836
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,550
I've been measuring Zhen's size since she was little.

837
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,510
Who else but me could handle this task?

838
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,120
Here, sister.

839
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,650
Turn around.

840
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,380
Let me measure your shoulders.

841
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,360
Okay. Write it down.

842
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,070
Well...

843
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,220
Only I can handle this job.

844
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,300
I'm professional.

845
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,860
Here.

846
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,260
Zhen, you've lost weight.

847
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,640
These are a few new dishes

848
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,010
I specially had the kitchen make.

849
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,360
You two, eat more.

850
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,430
Zhen,

851
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,770
don't just eat vegetarian dishes.

852
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:26,770
Have some of that.

853
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,440
Help Zhen with the food.

854
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,140
Yes, Mother.

855
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
It's not necessary.

856
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,600
I can do it myself.

857
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,200
No.

858
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,450
Zhen has always been used

859
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,460
to delicate food since she was little

860
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,390
and can't get used to simple meals.

861
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,150
These dishes were specially prepared by the chef

862
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,880
I brought from Hezhou for Zhen.

863

Mrs. Xu,

00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:10,240
don't just sit there.

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,570
You should eat more too.

869
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,440
Zhen, eat it while it's hot.
