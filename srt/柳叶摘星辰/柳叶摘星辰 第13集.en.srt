Moyan the suspect

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,470
is related to cases pertaining to Lord Hu

6
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,470
and the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom.

7
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,550
Each concerns the government.

8
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,510
It is naturally our responsibility to interrogate him.

9
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,910
How can the incapable Zichen Department interfere?

10
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,990
But these two cases

11
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,360
were all solved by us.

You...

13
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,830
These two cases

14
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,030
should have been handled by the Ministry of Justice.

15
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,750
The Zichen Department exercised long-arm jurisdiction.

16
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,210
It was beyond your duties.

17
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,030
I can let bygones

be bygones.

19

But I have to

20
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,480

It's just a case.

Is it necessary for you to draw swords?

Why are you still holding swords?

43

Forget it if you don't want to talk.

I don't think it's a big deal that I hindered you from catching Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
She is so powerful

125

126
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,670

I really can't remember.

128
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,550
Maybe next time.

What did you say?

A few days ago when I was solving a case,

you were kidnapped by bandits.

133

because of me last night.

135

139

than catching thieves?

146

You are the most important.

if you put me in danger?

149
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,630
No.

150

Are you afraid that my brother will trouble you?

No.

Nothing. You may leave now.

I had a fierce argument with them.

the suspect was taken away from here,

171

so we must take the responsibility.

172
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,110
They said if we couldn't solve the case within ten days,

173
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,830
I would be demoted.

174

Moyan wouldn't have been taken away so easily.

178
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,960
Why didn't they mention it?

179
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,470
They always have double standards.

180
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,790
In my opinion, Gongyang Maocai

181
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,870
aims at you in every aspects.

182
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,430
That's all?

183
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,670
Yes, that's all.

184
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,990
By the way, they also mentioned Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

185
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,250
Willow Leaf Thief Liu?

186
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,310
Yes.

187
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,190
They said it was Willow Leaf Thief Liu who broke into the prison.

188
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,190
That makes sense.

189
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,180
Hei Limao killed Lord Hu's family.

190
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,630
Later, he committed suicide by taking poison

191
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,870
which was made by Moyan.

192
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,330
It's upon valid evidence.

193
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,670
I think

194
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,650
the key to solving the case

195
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,310
lies in the herbs

196
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,040
used to make Butterfly's Love.

197
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,120
It seems that this is the only clue

198
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
we can find.

199
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,870
No matter what,

200
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,870
you and Wu Zhao keep investigating.

201
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,790
Young Madam, you're finally awake.

202
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,560
Young Master

203
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,620
was here with you for the whole night.

204
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,230
Here.

205
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,070
Have some hot snow fungus soup.

206
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,670
Have some.

207
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,870
Have some.

208
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,590
Xiao Qiu, take a seat.

209
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,670
I have something to tell you.

210
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,230
Here's the thing.

211
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,870
There's a maid

212
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,190
called Rong in my mansion.

213
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,050
Do you know her?

214
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,310
No.

215
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,190
Young Madam.

216
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,430
How could I know anything about your family?

217
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,230
You're right.

218
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,790
It doesn't matter.

219
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,230
Anyway, Rong

220
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,190
has a grudge against a butler

221
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,070
in my mansion.

222
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,750
They quarrel every day.

223
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,150
One day, the butler

224
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,910
changed his tune all of a sudden

225
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,310
and became considerate.

226
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,990
Rong panicked.

227
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,980
She didn't know what to do.

228
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,710
So she asked me what she should do.

229
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,710
What do you think?

230
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,030
Why did Rong panic?

231
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,750
Doesn't she have feelings for that butler?

232
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,750
Does she?

233
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,840
I don't think it's right to deny it.

234
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,270
I see.

235
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,510
She hasn't realized that she is in love.

236
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,650
What? In love?

237
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,150
You are talking nonsense.

238
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,470
What do you mean?

239
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,510
Aren't we talking about Rong?

240
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,800
Why are you so anxious?

241
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,790
I... I...

242
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,950
I want you to offer some suggestions to her,

243
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,010
rather than jumping to conclusions.

244
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,330
How about this?

245
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,630
Let Rong find quarrel in a straw

246
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,780
to provoke him,

247
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,550
torture him,

248
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,230
and finally insult him.

249
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,280
See what his reactions will be.

250
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,950
Xiao Qiu.

251
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,950
Maybe I didn't make it clear.

252
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
The butler is ill-tempered.

253
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,390
He's distant

254
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,030
but good at martial arts.

255
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,150
He's not easy to deal with.

256
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,630
That's great.

257
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,670
If he won't give up on Rong

258
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,070
after being treated like that,

259
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,570
that means he is really in love with Rong.

260
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,470
I see.

261
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,430
I'll ask Rong to torture him.

262
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,150
No.

263
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,110
Not only torture,

264
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,230
but also insult him.

265
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,710
Okay, got it.

266
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,600
Go back to your work.

267
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,150
Yes.

[Elegant Residence in Spring Sunshine]

269

Ill-tempered, distant and not easy to deal with.

270

The man that Young Madam described

271
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,550
has something in common with Young Master.

What are you doing?

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,590
Young Master.

276
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,630
You'd better have a look yourself.

277

Young Master.

278
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,670
Young Madam.

279
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,720
Have a look.

280
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,710
Move the red one a little to the left.

281

To the left.

282

Okay.

283

Be careful.

284

But why did you do that?

No special reason.

Wait.

You chose a good place for me.

Why didn't I think of it?

342
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,390
Very good.

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,030
Have a seat.

352
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,830
We won't eat with Mother today.

353
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,590
I made you some new dishes.

354
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,940
I want you to have a try.

355
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,230
You just recovered.

356
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,660
You shouldn't have tired yourself like this.

357
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,360
It's fine.

358
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,910
As long as you eat up,

359
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,970
I'll be satisfied.

360
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,070
Of course.

361
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,920
You are good at cooking.

362
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,670
I'll surely eat everything up.

363
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,930
Bring the dishes here.

364
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,490
Let's get started.

365
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,680
Honey.

366
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,110
This is...

367
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,210
This is braised intestines with stinky tofu.

368
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,560
What about the other one?

369
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,350
Fried mint leaves with spicy sauce.

370
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,610
Protein and vitamins.

371
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,910
I'm not hungry.

372
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,770
Why don't we try them another day?

373
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,220
No.

374
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,440
You're busy all day.

375
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,230
I have to reward you.

376
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,830
Actually, I'm not that busy.

377
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,590
You just said you could eat it all.

378
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,670
Are you going to

379
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,840
eat your words?

380
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,930
Delicious.

381
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,070
Come on.

382
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,430
You didn't even chew.

383
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,270
You need to taste it carefully.

384
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,250
Try it again.

385
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,110
Try it.

386
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,040
How's the taste?

387
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,160
Zhen.

388
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,410
Brother, what brings you here?

389
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,150
I heard you were poisoned by the ecstatic smoke

390
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,430
and were kidnapped by Willow Leaf Thief Liu yesterday.

391
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,160
Are you okay?

392
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,960
I'm fine.

393
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,560
Xu Muchen.

394
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,740
Is this how you take care of my younger sister

395
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,090
who married you?

396
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,510
Let me tell you.

397
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,830
I'll decide on behalf of my father today.

398
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,830
My sister will divorce you.

399
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,530
Let's go, Zhen.

400
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,550
I'll take you to have something delicious.

401
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,320
I...

402
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,590
Xu Muchen, what are you doing?

403
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,550
Let go of her!

404
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,750
Are you okay?

405
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,310
I'm fine.

406
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,640
Zhen.

407
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,990
Brother, stop it.

408
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,740
It wasn't his fault.

409
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,250
Not his fault?

410
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,590
If he hadn't been a loser

411
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,990
who is still in the Zichen Department

412
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,390
and deals with bandits

413
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,070
every day,

414
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,150
there wouldn't have been so much trouble.

415
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,590
It's wrong to say so.

416
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,910
He's devoted to solving cases.

417
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,990
It takes time for him to get promoted.

418
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,430
If all the officials were like him,

419
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,890
there would be no bandits.

420
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,430
What?

421
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,910
Zhen.

422
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,230
Why are you defending him now?

423
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,390
Fine, let's not talk about him.

424
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,510
Let's talk about the Xu family.

425
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,590
No matter what you eat or use here,

426
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,350
which can be a match for what it is in our family?

427
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,110
Come with me.

428
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,310
I'll take care of you.

429
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,670
Jinning.

430
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,750
My family is not on a par with

431
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,430
the Duke's family.

432
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,750
But we have never treated Jinzhen poorly.

433
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,230
Don't mention the divorce anymore.

434
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,630
You dare to say you haven't treated her poorly?

435
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,560
Here, take a look.

436
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,670
What are these dishes?

437
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,330
They look like animal feed.

438
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,830
This is abuse,

439
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,250
if not poor treatment.

440
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,230
Brother.

441
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,070
I made these dishes.

442
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,850
You made these?

443
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,070
Then I need to have a try.

444
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,590
You're indeed my sister.

445
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,750
You're good at cooking.

446
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,520
Delicious.

447
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,140
Of course.

448
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,830
What she cooks

449
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,770
is perfect in color, fragrance and taste.

450
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,550
Jinzhen.

451
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,530
Thank you for this meal.

452
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,920
I haven't eaten yet.

453
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,460
Delicious.

454
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,900
I'm hungry too.

455
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,790
Delicious.

456
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,690
Delicious.

457
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,520
Delicious.

458
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,270
Delicious.

459
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,510
Seems I didn't cook enough.

460
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,310
Perfect in color, fragrance and taste.

461
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,120
Mouth-wateringly delicious.

462
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,840
Since you like it so much,

463
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,870
do you want to have some more?

464
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,230
Jinzhen.

465
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,110
It occurred to me

466
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,870
that I had something to deal with.

467
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,800
I'll come here to see you next time.

468
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,670
Do you want more?

469
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,190
I told Rong your suggestions.

470
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,910
And then?

471
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,150
She followed everything you said,

472
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,270
like provoking,

473
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,930
insulting and torturing him.

474
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,150
What happened?

475
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,910
That guy is usually grumpy.

476
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,590
But this time he was not angry at all.

477
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,950
Do you think

478
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,430
he wants something else from Rong?

479
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,950
What can he want from Rong?

480
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,830
A maid doesn't earn much.

481
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,680
Are you indicating that I treat you badly?

482
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,590
Stop eating.

483
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,270
Give me...

484
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,550
Give Rong more suggestions.

485
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,570
More suggestions?

486
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,350
Got one.

487
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,160
You may ask Rong to write a letter

488
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,230
under someone else's name,

489
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,000
saying he has admired Rong for a long time

490
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,710
and wants to ask Rong out

491
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,910
at midnight.

492
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,270
She needs to create opportunities

493
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,390
for the butler to read the letter.

494
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,310
If he

495
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,990
goes to the place mentioned in the letter,

496
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,750
that means he really likes Rong.

497
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,650
What if he doesn't go?

498
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,430
Then it means

499
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,990
he doesn't like Rong.

500
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,060
