Your father

5
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,840
gave the ledger to Lord Hu personally.

6
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,290
Lord Hu had studied it for many years,

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,490
but he couldn't figure anything out.

8
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,040
Muchen,

9
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,690
are you sleepy?

10
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,110
I'm not.

11
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,670
Muchen,

12
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,710
I'm going to show you a trick. What do you think?

13
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,030
What trick?

14
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,510
Come.

15
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,230
Come.

21

Father,

22
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,350
how did you do that?

23
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,710
I

24
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,590
added this potion to the ink.

25
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,950
So the characters will disappear gradually.

26
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,230
Can they reappear?

27
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,110
Of course.

28
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,870

what are you doing?

32
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,070
Uncle,

33
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,320
my father had a bottle of potion

34
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,960
that can make characters disappear.

35
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,820
The characters will reappear when exposed to fire.

[The evidence of Duke Su's treason is in Taizhou]

37
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,430
The mastermind back then

38
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,430
indeed is Duke Su.

39
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,310
There should be more characters.

40
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,870
It's just that it's been too long,

41
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,200
so they can't reappear.

42
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,230
Now,

43
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,630

I have something very important to tell you.

47
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,350
The coroner has examined the bodies of the men

48
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,560
who went to assassinate Miss Hu yesterday.

49
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,230
The poison in their mouths is still the same

50
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,830
as that found in those cases.

51
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,070
But we found this

52
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,990
on them.

53
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,320
Maybe their target was not Miss Hu,

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,950
but... Young Madam.

55
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,470
Why would these people want to assassinate Young Madam?

56
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,400
They don't have a reason to do that.

57
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,550
Because of me.

58

She has a special identity

59

They have many tricks.

66

No matter how many people we send,

67
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,490
we can't protect her forever.

68
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,680
As long as she is my wife,

69

Is Young Master back?

79

He left home from the study early in the morning.

What about Miss Hu?

81

Miss Hu accompanied Young Master

in the study the whole night.

83
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,670

Xu Muchen,

86
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,170
you have no conscience.

87
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,990

if Young Master died on the execution ground,

91
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,990
you would have become a widow, right?

92
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,190
Now I'm so angry because of him.

93
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,390
I'd rather be a widow.

94
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,240
Young Master has gone too far.

95

You're the daughter of Duke Su.

Miss Hu is just a concubine.

99
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,870
What I mean is

100
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,520
she's not even a concubine.

Why?

Maybe they are together now.

Then I have to go.

116
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,669

Honey, what's up?

125
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,940
So you know I'm your wife.

126
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,560
Why did you let Miss Hu live here?

127
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,850
It's personal.

128
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,190
It's not your concern.

129
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,990
Are you really going to take a concubine?

130
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,240
We're just a nominal couple.

131

It's none of your business whether I take a concubine or not.

Xu Muchen is going to take a concubine.

Anyway, you are a fake couple.

150
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,310
Since he has fallen in love with someone else,

151
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,310
it will be easier for you to get away.

152
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,950
You're so sad.

153
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,510

No.

What happened then?

156
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,440
Did Xu Muchen bully you?

157
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,360
What on earth happened?

158
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,590
Say something. I'm so worried.

did you get

164

what I asked you to get?

165
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,310

Master,

168
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,030
Xu Muchen is cunning.

169
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,540
It's normal that she can't get it for now.

170
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,870
In that case,

171
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,380
you don't need to get the jade pendant.

172
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,720
Complete another task

173
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,350

Watermill never kills people.

why don't you ask someone else to do it?

She can only complete this task herself.

I know you have feelings for him.

192

Just because you have feelings for him,

193
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,310
you can kill him

Duke Su is the mastermind.

You still want to compete with me for the credit?

This is the Ministry of Justice's case.

you know Rong has feelings for Xu Muchen,

253
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,910
but you still asked her to complete such a task.

254
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,390
This is too cruel.

Duke Su firmly believes

258
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,070
Rong is on Xu Muchen's side

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,650
and wants to kill her.

260

Only by killing Xu Muchen

can she save herself.

262

But Duke Su has always been ruthless.

♫I'll land on your heart even if I have to keep circling♫

341
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,350
I married Su Jinzhen.

342
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,650
Of course she's the one I'm going to divorce.

343

♫Who made an honest mistake?♫

344

♫Without you, what's the point of having the world in my hands?♫

351
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,230
We've been waiting for so long. Why hasn't he come out yet?

352
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,710
That's right.

353
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,990
I'm so anxious.

354
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:28,070
[Gifted Pen]

355
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,270
We've been waiting for a long time.

356
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,070
That's right.

357
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,440
Boss,

358
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,590
what's going on?

359
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,310
Are you going to sell storybooks or not today?

360
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,040
-That's right.
-That's right.

361
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,190
Are you going to sell them or not?

362
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,910
Calm down.

363
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,670
Everyone,

364
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,790
calm down.

365
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,110
Calm down.

366
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,100
The storybooks are ready.

367
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,510
But I just heard

368
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,110
something more shocking.

369
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:45,870
What is it?

370
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,590
What is it?

371
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,110
So I specially invited a writer

372
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,970
to write the story in the room.

373
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,630
The number is limited.

374
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,190
First come, first served.

375
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,650
First come, first served.

376
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,380
Line up! Line up!

377
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,790
Don't squeeze.

378
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,510
What is so shocking?

379
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,550
Tell us first.

380
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,790
If you fool us,

381
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,310
we'll be waiting all morning for nothing.

382
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,510
-That's right.
-That's right.

383
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,570
What if you fool me?

384
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,870
This is what everyone wants, right?

385
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,750
Yes.

386
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,950
Listen up.

387
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,070
Lord Xu Muchen of the Zichen Department divorced his wife.

388
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,710
-Divorced?
-Divorced?

389
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,120
He married Duke Su's daughter

390
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,050
under His Majesty's edict, right?

391
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,390
That's why Lord Xu is fearless.

392
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,510
He just directly divorced Duke Su's daughter.

393
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,550
That's not right.

394
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,550
That's not right.

395
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,230
How could Lord Xu do this?

396
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,670
Is what you said true?

397
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,680
Well... of course it's true.

398
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,390
Art originates from life

399
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,690
and transcends life.

400
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,140
Where did you hear it?

401
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,290
Everyone in Xu's Mansion knows it.

402
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,310
Boss,

403
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,550
w-what about the details?

404
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,030
Tell us.

405
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,870
T-Tell us.

406
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,630
As for the details,

407
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,150
buy the book and read it yourself after you go back.

408
00:25:59,150 --> 00:25:59,990
Then hurry up.

409
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,310
Okay.

410
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,390
I'm going to rush him.

411
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,590
I'm going to rush him.

412
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,590
Hurry up.

413
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,390
Okay.

414
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,270
What?

415
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,630
Xu Muchen divorced his wife?

416
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,070
Could it be that Xu Muchen found it out

417
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,450
when Rong took action?

418
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,710
I told you we can't let Rong do this.

419
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,660
I mean...

420
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,550
Rong has never killed anyone.

421
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,610
How could she be a match for Xu Muchen?

422
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,400
Master,

423
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,950
what should we do now?

424
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,670
Mumu,

425
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,920
let's go take Rong back first.

426
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,990
Stop.

427
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,790
I'll go.

428
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,540
Don't act rashly.

429
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,880
Yes.

430
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,470
Yes.

431
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,350
Xu Muchen really divorced his wife?

432
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:55,830
Yes.

433
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,900
It happened last night.

434
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,310
Something is not right.

435
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,590
My Lord,

436
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,850
everyone in the capital knows it.

437
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,220
I think

438
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,950
it's true.

439
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,140
A divorce is a disgrace to the family.

440
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,590
How could everyone in the capital know it overnight?

441
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,390
Xu Muchen must have done it on purpose

442
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,600
to make me lower my guard against Liu Rong.

443
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,660
My Lord,

444
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,510
what should we do next?

445
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,810
Follow Liu Rong

446
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,800
and find a chance to kill her.

447
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,680
Whether the divorce is true or not,

448
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,880
Liu Rong is already useless to me.

449
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,100
It won't matter even if we kill her.

450
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,840
Yes, My Lord.

451
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,250
Stop!

452
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,420
Drop your weapons!

453
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,130
Drop them!

454
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,820
-Step aside!
-Step aside!

455
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,190
Master,

456
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,220
please don't kill Xu Muchen.

457
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,440
You can beat me or punish me if you want.

458
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,560
Please let him go.

459
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,190
I'm begging you, just this once!

460
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,050
If I don't kill him today,

461
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,630
you and I will die.

462
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,020
Get out of my way!

463
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,490
Xu Muchen, leave.

464
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,350
For the sake of our love,

465
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,610
please don't kill my master, okay?

466
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,080
I asked you to leave. Can't you hear me?

467
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,430
It's none of your business.

468
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,180
Step aside.

469
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,880
I'm not going anywhere.

470
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,110
Master.

471
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,830
Master!

472
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,150
Master.

473
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,210
Master.

474
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,670
Yu Luocha,

475
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,090
it's your own dart that is going to take your life.

476
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,890
I can give the Ministry of Justice an explanation.

477
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,020
Liu Rong,

478
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,910
for the sake of our love,

479
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,970
I'll spare your life today.

480
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,950
If we meet again,

481
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,760
I won't show mercy.

482
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,240
Master.

483
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,620
Master.

484
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,990
Rong,

485
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,200
leave the capital.

486
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,230
Don't avenge me.

487
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,560
Master.

488
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,230
Master.

489
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,660
Master!

490
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,970
Master.

491
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,870
Wake up, Master.

492
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,430
Master!

493
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,520
How can I not be angry?

494
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,710
She was my daughter-in-law.

495
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,070
I was supposed to have a grandchild soon.

496
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,860
She left because you made her angry.

497
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,470
Tell me.

498
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,130
When will you get Zhen back?

499
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,670
Mother,

500
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm going to be honest with you.

501
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,970
Her name is not Su Jinzhen.

502
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,250
Her name is Liu Rong.

503
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,910
She...

504
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,140
She is not the daughter of Duke Su?

505
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,100
Duke Su asked her to be his daughter's substitute.

506
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,160
I don't care.

507
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,770
It's better that she has nothing to do with Duke Su.

508
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,470
I just want my daughter-in-law to come back.

509
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,070
Tell me.

510
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,030
When will you get her back?

511
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,910

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,290
This is the token of the master of the Liu family.

682
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,400
My father said

683
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,790
you can tell at a glance.

684
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,700
Please have a seat.

685
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,400
Tell me about your family's assets.

686
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,370
Seven restaurants,

687
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,610
13 sea routes,

688
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,270
and five inns.

689
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,280
I heard the Liu family will open another restaurant.

690
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,210
Mr. Li, you must have misheard.

691
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,270
My family is planning to sell two restaurants

692
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,730
for the capital turnover.

693
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,560
That's right.

694
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,780
Although you are young,

695
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,340
you know very well

696
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,870
about your family's business.

697
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,370
If someone is willing to help,

698
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,630
you will definitely become successful.

699
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,810
Mr. Li, please enlighten me.

700
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,650
[500 tales]

701
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,950
Mr. Liu,

702
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,870
go home to get ready first

703
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,580
and then come to Zhao's Mansion to see me.

704
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,710
I'll introduce you to my young master.

705
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:42,610
Okay.

706
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,680
I'll follow your arrangement.
