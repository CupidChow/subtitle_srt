I knew you would come back.

Are you going to continue to investigate?

The case of Lord Hu's death has not been solved.

Back then,

27
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,270
your father found something fishy about the dam in Taizhou,

28
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,070
so he secretly investigated it.

29
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,510
Later, he died wrongfully.

30
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,190
I asked

31
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,910
the officials who were close to your father

32
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,030

But all of them got into trouble.

You almost got killed when you were a kid because of it.

What has happened recently

36
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,000
is so similar to what happened back then.

37

I'm afraid that more people

Have you found the jade pendant I asked you to find?

Donâ€™t move!

-Donâ€™t move. Donâ€™t move.
-What are you doing?

350
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,280
-Who are you?
-Don't move!

351
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,550
Do you know whose things are on the ships?

352
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,190
Shut up.

353
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,370
-Go away!
-Don't move.

354
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,440
-Don't move.
-Go over there.

355
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,470
Give me

356
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,800
all the things of value.

357
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,890
Otherwise, all of you will be killed.

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,510
Wu Zhao.

361
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,190
Bad news!

362
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,870
The pier is on fire!

363
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,520
The pier is on fire!

364
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,310
This...

365
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,310
Fire! Fire!

366
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,990
What's wrong?

367
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,630
Hurry up!

368
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,870
Fire!

369
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,870

Okay, okay.

Get more people to help.

How dare you snatch my goods!

384
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,730
How dare you!

385
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,110
Get lost!

386
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,040
You...

387
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,550
How dare you!

388
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,830
Stop!

389
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,670
Mr. Wu.

390
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,240
Stop!

391
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,480
Why are you here?

392
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,450
Lord Lu, don't worry.

393
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,410

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,840
will uphold justice for you.

395
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,880
Mr. Wu.

396
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,940
On the ships are all fruits and vegetables.

397
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,850
They are not valuable at all.

398
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,580
Don't bother

399
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,390
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu.

400
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,510
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu.

401
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,910
Don't bother.

402
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,180
It's late at night.

403
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,760
You don't have to do this.

404
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,430
Lord Lu.

405
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,390
Search carefully.

406
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

407
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,670
Lord Xu, why are you here?

408
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,670
Please stop Mr. Wu.

409
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,470
On the ships are only fruits and vegetables.

410
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,510
Nothing valuable is there.

411
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:18,990
Wait.

412
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,390
Let them see

413
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,790
if any losses are caused.

414
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,170
Let them search carefully.

415
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,430
So they can write what they do

416
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,550
in the report and get praised.

417
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,510
Lord Xu.

418
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,230
We're on the same side.

419
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,310
We're family

420
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,030
How about this?

421
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,300
You and your men go have a drink.

422
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,950
The drinks are on me.

423
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,680
Have a drink?

424
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,260
Why didn't anyone invite me to have a drink?

425
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,050
Lord Gongyang.

426
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,340
Why brings you here?

427
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,070
Lord Lu, you must be terrified.

428
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,680
It's okay.

429
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,700
On the ships are things that are not valuable.

430
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,680
You don't have to solve the case.

431
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,440
Lord Lu.

432
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,750
You are wrong.

433
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,010
Cases concerning the interests of officials are never small cases.

434
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,810
This ships are official ships.

435
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,850
There shouldn't be any losses.

436

442

Don't bother.

443
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,150
Don't bother.

Lord Gongyang!

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,670
What are you doing?

447
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,660
You are so nervous.

448
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,500
Are those goods illegal?

449
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,430
Lord Gongyang.

450
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,980
There is nothing illegal here.

451
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,730
My Lord.

452
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,520

How dare you!

457
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,600
To smuggle these things

458
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,200
will get you to be sentenced to death ten times!

459
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,310
Take him away.

460

-Go.
-Go.

I never let my personal feelings interfere with work.

463
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,130
Last time, I got you wrongfully imprisoned.

464
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,200
This time, I'll let you take the credit for the case.

We are even now.

466
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,710
But if you dare to disturb Miss Qin again,

467
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,790
I won't let you off.

This is the delivery list of the Moon Star Herbs.

471
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,610
Should we give it to Gongyang?

472
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Let's go back to Zichen Department.

473

Let's go back.

Great!

476
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,090
Muchen.

477
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,150
I now admire you more.

478
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,840
You managed to arrest the traitor

479
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,970
in such a short time.

480
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,010
Don't be so surprised and excited.

481
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,990
I should!

482
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,110
I'll meet His Majesty and tell him about this.

483
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,900
So he'll give us rewards.

484
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,420
Wait.

485
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,510
What are you going to do?

486
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,380
To report the case to His Majesty.

487
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,920
I'm going to the palace to ask for the rewards I deserve.

488
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,320
No, I won't ask for the rewards but His Majesty will give them to me.

489
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,380
The case is not as simple as you think.

490
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,960
Lu Rongchang said he wasn't the mastermind.

491
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,290
He said he was my family.

492
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,950
Family?

493
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,710
You mean...

494
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:04,830
Master.

495
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,730
I have a question.

496
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,410
Does the case of the Moon Star Herb have something to do with Watermill?

497
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,120
But didnâ€™t you say

498
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,600
Watermill was committed to upholding justice

499
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,130
and benefiting the people?

500
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,430
The flood in Taizhou

501
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,180
destroyed hundreds of acres of good farmland.

502
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,820
The Moon Star Herb is the only thing

503
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,310
that can help the people in Taizhou.

504
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,550
But it's poisonous.

505
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,120
Let me ask you.

506
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,270
Are you in love with Xu Muchen?

507
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,310
No.

508
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,950
I watched you grow up.

509
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,020
You can't hide anything from me.

510
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,550
I...

511
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,700
I just think the case of the flood in Taizhou

512
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,380
may have been misjudged by us.

513
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,110
According to Xu Muchen,

514
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,150
his father was wronged.

515
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,100
Fool.

516
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,420
The words of the victims in Taizhou

517
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,990
and the emperor's verdict

518
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,230
are solid evidence.

519
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,580
You just chose to ignore them because of what Xu Muchen said?

520
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,150
Why are you here?

521
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,930
Xiao Qiu said you were in a bad mood

522
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,920
and wanted to be alone for a while.

523
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,850
But it's too cold at night.

524
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,380
I'm here to bring you a coat.

525
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,070
Do you think

526
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,310
Watermill is a bad organization?

527
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,230
I'm not sure.

528
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,210
Why not?

529
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,580
If those from Watermill were bad people,

530
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,350
Willow Leaf Thief Liu

531
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,070
wouldn't have used darts to save me on the execution ground.

532
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,470
If my guess is right,

533
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,230
those from Watermill and Moyan

534
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,450
were fooled and used by bad guys.

535
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,810
Someone must be behind all this.

536
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,180
So you mean

537
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,230
those from Watermill are good people

538
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,830
and Willow Leaf Thief Liu is also a good person?

539
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,390
Yes.

540
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,560
Wait, no.

541
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,880
Why did you say yes and then deny it?

542
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,930
How can they be good people and bad people at the same time?

543
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,730
After all, Watermill hoarded Moon Star Herbs,

544
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,000
sold poisonous pills

545
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,410
and robbed officials.

546
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,340
But those were corrupt officials.

547
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,060
Fine.

548
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,470
Robbery is robbery.

549
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,470
A thief is a thief.

550
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,150

I want to officially marry you.

The real you, not you in someone else's name.

555
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,170
I want to marry Liu Rong.

556
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,320
Will you marry me?

557
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,800
It's getting cold.

558
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,350
I'll go back first.

It's so late.

580
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,640
Why did you call me back in such a hurry?

581
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,440
Lu Rongchang has been arrested.

582
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,070
So what?

583
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,070
Father.

Your disciples are all over the world.

585
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,150
Why are you worried because of him? He's just the director

586
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,410
of the Market Affairs Department, a low-ranked official.

It's all because of you.

Why are you blaming me?

590
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,550
If you hadn't been soft-hearted

591
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,670
and let Xu Muchen go,

592
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,670
His Majesty wouldn't have decided to investigate the case of the map thoroughly

593
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,200
and Lu Rongchang wouldn't have got arrested.

Sorry I made the mistake.

Sorry?

What should we do?

Are you going to send me to jail

00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,770
so Lu Rongchang won't be imprisoned?

I wish you could go to jail instead of him.

Lu Rongchang has been arrested.

602

can get the maps out of the capital now.

His men even forced officials to take off their underpants.

612
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,430
How can I take the maps out of the capital under these circumstances?

613
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,710
Transporting the maps without permission

614
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,970
is a treasonable act and a capital crime.

She was detained as a hostage.

But in the end, Young Master and his men
