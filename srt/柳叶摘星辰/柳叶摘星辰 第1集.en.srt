00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,520
so that you can go with us to collect herbs in the future?

177
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,670

With my physical condition, how can I take such a big responsibility?

180
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,950
What medicine did you pick this time?

181
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,780
One catty of Yuhuo.

182
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,980
Two taels of Shuiyin.

183
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,350
It's been rainy and windy these days.

184
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,370
Was the path easy to walk on?

185
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,470
It was muddy.

186
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,750
And I ran into some fierce dogs.

187
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,070
So, I didn't get the medicine I wanted.

188
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,230
Instead, I nearly collected some Xueyu.

189

5 grams for each of these two.

190

let's go to the backyard to hand over the goods.

194

This acupoint is not for headaches

195
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,710
but to prevent miscarriages.

196

Got it.

197
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,390
Junior, you're hurt.

198

I'm fine. Don't worry.

199

Which government officers did you meet this time?

200
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,550
The people from the Zichen Department.

201
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,120
They capture people like crazy.

202
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,570
What a pity to lose that piece of gold inlaid with jade.

203
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,720
So, this time,

204

you didn't get any money, did you?

205
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,900
The Watermill is to rob the rich and help the poor.

206

We're to uphold justice.

207
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,550
Can you stop talking about money all the time?

208
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,780
It's true.

209
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,110
But all our daily necessities

210
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,310

211
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
Only money can make the Watermill operate.

212
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,830
Junior, wait.

213

Master has added a few more traps inside.

214

When we go inside, you follow me.

215
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,390
This is the Sanguimotory Powder I made.

216
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,790

[Zichen Department]

218
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,520
I went to the cricket shop

219
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,270
in the south of the city as you ordered.

220
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,480
Guess what I found.

221
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,560
The beard comes from this cricket.

222
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,100
It's called a golden cricket.

223
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,740
It's very rare in the north.

224
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,790
Its body is golden yellow.

225
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,950
It's mostly seen in the countryside in the south.

226
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,690
Its chirping is pleasant to hear, but it's very hard to capture.

227
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,750
The dignitaries

228
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,120
like it very much.

229
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,070
My Lord, you predicted it all.

230

232
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,760
went to his shop and bought two.

233
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,240
But both of them were male.

234
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,440
Looks like we've found the spy in the Treasure Pavilion.

235
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,920
That day,

the one who came to the Treasure Pavilion to store the box

237

was Willow Leaf Thief Liu.

242
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,349
Wait.

243
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,369
She put the golden cricket in the box

244
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,810
when the manager wasn't paying attention.

245
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,290
Later,

246
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,710
Willow Leaf Thief Liu visited the Treasure Pavilion again at night.

247
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,810
Although there were many traps and passages there,

248
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,410
she brought the other golden cricket with her.

249
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,430
She used the characteristics that a golden cricket chirps when there's another golden cricket nearby

250
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,760
and navigated by listening to the sounds.

251
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,820
Thus, she found the right route to the Heaven Pavilion.

252

is Xu Muchen, the new Governor

Not only that,

279
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,930
his father was Xu Chengsi, the corrupt official

280
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,120
when the flood happened in Taizhou 15 years ago.

281
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,920
His father was greedy

282
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,990
and embezzled tens of millions of taels of silver from the central government's relief fund,

283
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,040
causing the collapse of the Taizhou dam

284
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,430
and leaving countless people homeless.

285

That was the year

Xu Chengsi

288
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,910
was the culprit of the flood.

If you hadn't saved me,

290

I would have drowned to feed the fish.

You mean the clue of the official silver

300
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,290
may be hidden in the jade pendant?

There are so many people visiting the Duke's Mansion.

344
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,470
To be on the safe side,

345
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,130
I'd better take the back door.

348
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,150
Lord Xu, you're here.

349
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,070
Please inform the Duke

350
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,680
that Xu Muchen from the Zichen Department has something important to discuss with him.

351
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,340
Please wait a moment, Lord Xu.

352
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,940
Zhen.

353
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,100
Rong.

354
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,050
Why are you here?

355
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,180
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

356
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,170
You scared me.

357
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,410
When did I ever knock before entering your room?

358
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,530
What are you doing?

359
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,570
I'm packing.

360
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,400
Why are you packing by yourself?

361
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,530
Where are you going?

362
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,300
Father wants to secretly send me out of the capital.

363
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,160
He doesn't let the servants know.

364
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,200
Rong.

365
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,120
After we part today,

366
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,910
I don't know when we can meet again.

367
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,420
Don't worry.

368
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,880
It's not like you're not coming back.

369
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,960
Besides,

370
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,190
if you miss me,

371
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,220
just write to me

372
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,530
Tell me where you are.

373
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,060
I'll definitely visit you.

374
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,370
Okay.

375
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,140
I brought you a gift.

376
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,270
You can divert yourself with it when you're bored.

377
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,380
Is this the amazing cricket

378
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,010
you once mentioned?

379
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,450
This is a golden cricket.

380
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,780
It brings me good luck.

381
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,800
Do you have snacks in your room?

382
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,750
We can feed it.

383
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,990
Greetings, Your Grace.

384
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,190
Dear Nephew, sorry to keep you waiting.

385
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,390
What brings you here

386
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,610
this time?

387
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,730
I'm here to break off the engagement.

388
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Break off the engagement?

389
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,410
The Xu family is humble.

390
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,040
We are not a match for the grand family of the Duke.

391
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,470
Besides, my father was a corrupt official

392
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,750
and had a bad reputation.

393
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,760
Your Grace, you supervised the handling of the case yourself.

394
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,290
If I marry Miss Su,

395
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,710
I'm afraid it'll damage the reputation of the Duke's Mansion.

396
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,670
I see.

397
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,810
You're still blaming me

398
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,840
for handling your father's case.

399
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,110
Dear Nephew,

400
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,520
your father

401
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,270
was my favorite disciple,

402
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,510
but he let His Majesty down

403
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,750
and embezzled the relief money.

404
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,030
I had to report it to the court.

405
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,010
Although I handled the case impartially,

406
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,450
I can understand it

407
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,260
if you still resent me.

408
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
I dare not.

409
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,070
No matter what,

410
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,190
it's inappropriate for me to marry Miss Su.

411
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,990
Please think twice, Your Grace.

412
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,680
Sit.

413
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,870
Sit down to talk.

414
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,430
Why isn't it eating?

415
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,110
Maybe your cake is too sweet.

416
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,600
Look.

417
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,170
Its antenna seems to be broken.

418
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,520
Maybe it's because I failed to take good care of it.

419
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,870
Dear Nephew,

420
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,610
whether as your elder

421
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,310
or as Zhen's father,

422
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,290
I don't think you are a good match for Zhen.

423
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,530
But now, His Majesty has ordered the marriage.

424
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,110
I may be the duke,

425
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,470
But I can't bear the accusation

426
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,670
of disobeying the imperial edict.

427
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,150
But...

428
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,310
So, don't mention

429
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,510
"breaking off the engagement" to me again.

Why isn't it making any sound?

434
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,620
My other one is at home.

435
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,540
I forgot to take it.

436
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,210
But aren't you gonna write to me?

437
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,320
Whenever this one is chirping,

438
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,160
it means I'm coming to visit you.

00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,860
Okay.

00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,020
But before I come to visit,

441
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,760
you must take care of yourself.

442
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,650
Don't worry.

443
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,370
I will take good care of myself.

444
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,030
I'll take good care of it, too.

445
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,410

to prove that Willow Leaf Thief Liu is right nearby.

Can you leave now?

As you can see,

or I'm that thief?

514
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,870
Arrest him!

515
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,790
Send him to the Ministry of Justice.

516
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,420
Yes.

517
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,480
Stop!

518
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,380
Your Grace,

519
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
your gate is open.

520
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,230
I came in myself.

521
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,160
Why are you here?

522
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,450
Your Grace,

523
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,720
we've only parted for a few days,

524
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,600
but you look so much better.

525
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,650
Lord Gu,

526
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,230
what do you mean?

527
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,460
Why are you still holding the weapons?

528
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,370
Put down your weapons.

529
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,450
Hurry up!

530
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,980
Put down your weapons!

531
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,960
Get out!

532
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,690
Listen to Lord Gu.

533
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,840
Why are you still standing here?

534
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,600
Come on. Put down your weapons.

535
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,350
It's easy to accidentally hurt people with knives and spears.

536
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,870
Put them down.

537
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,390
Xu Muchen!

538
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,070
His Majesty

539
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,670
just granted you a marriage.

540
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,040
Are you this eager

541
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,180
to meet your bride?

542
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,350
I'm afraid Lord Xu

543
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,800
didn't come here to see my daughter

544
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,840
but to catch thieves.

545
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,730
Your Grace, don't say that.

546
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,040
Of course the Duke's Mansion is heavily guarded.

547
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,380
How could there be a thief?

548
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,630
It must be because Xu Muchen

549
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,670
wanted to see his fiancee so much

550
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,200
that he used the excuse of catching the thief.

551
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,030
Lord Gu.

552
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,950
Shut up!

553
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,790
Your Grace,

554
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,670
please spare Xu Muchen this time.

555
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,440
Look.

556
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,310
Xu Muchen

557
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,540
will be your son-in-law soon.

558
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,020
Before he got married, he wanted to see Miss Su.

559
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,260
If word gets out,

560
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,080
it will be a beautiful story.

561
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,300
How about this?

562
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,950
I'll meet Mrs. Xu

563
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,810
and tell her

564
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,660
to hold the wedding ceremony

565
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,620
in three days.

566
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,990
Just now,

567
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,960
under the circumstances,

568
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,230
what I said

569
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,830
was so beautiful.

570
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,300
It was so appropriate.

571
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,680
The Duke of Su...

572
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,070
What could he do?

573
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,170
I dealt with him anyway.

574
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,770
Also,

575
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,220
golden crickets were already liked

576
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,770
by rich people.

577
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,590
It's normal to hear its chirping in the Duke's Mansion.

578
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,310
You guys

579
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,730
were a little impulsive.

580
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,160
Am I right, Xu Muchen?

581
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,140
Am I right or not?

582
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,870
Thank you for today.

583
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,219
I need to go back to the Zichen Department to calm down.

584
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,500
You get some rest, too.

585
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,719
His Lordship said he needed to calm down.

586
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,199
Don't listen to him.

587
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,659
He's too excited.

588
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,150
He just can't wait.

589
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,909
[Xu's Mansion]

590
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,520
Let me do it.

591
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,050
Done.

592
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,960
[Xu's Mansion]

593
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,469
This, too.

594
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,350
Hang this up.

595
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,560
Remove the clock.

596
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,110
Yes, Your Ladyship.

597
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,840
Who would give a clock as a gift?

598
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,260
Take this over.

599
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:45,830
Okay.

600
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,120
Just put it here.

601
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,150
Xiao Dong,

602
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,150
is this okay?

603
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,030
Move this over.

604
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,830
Okay.

605
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,409
Be careful.

606
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,750
Where is the vase I picked just now?

607
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,590
My son is back.

608
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,000
Mother.

609
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,550
Well done, son.

610
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,750
You're hiding something from me.

611
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,080
Mother, what are you talking about?

612
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,500
I don't understand at all.

613
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,820
Don't be modest.

614
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,910
It's only less than half a day.

615
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,020
Your romance

616
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,120
has been spread all over the capital.

617
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,790
Mother.

618
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,850
What are you talking about?

619
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,170
What am I talking about?

620
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,510
What I said is not even 5 percent as juicy

621
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,310
as the rumors in the street.

622
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,710
You've brought our Xu family

623
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,090
great honor.

624
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,520
Mother,

625
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,990
don't be angry.

626
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,410
Am I angry?

627
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,210
I'm more than happy.

628
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,350
Actually, I went to Su's Mansion

629
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,950
to break off the engagement.

630
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,320
And then?

631
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,170
Then, Willow Leaf Thief Liu appeared.

632
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,100
Well done.

633
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,840
My son

634
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,800
makes this marriage

635
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,330
set in stone all by himself.

636
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,680
Now, the Duke of Su

637
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,730
has no chance to break off the engagement.

638
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,420
Mother,

639
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,390
it's not the time to mock me.

640
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,000
Isn't the most important thing now

641
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,750
to find a way to break off the engagement?

642
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,760
Break off?

643
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,310
The imperial edict has been issued to our mansion.

644
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,370
But come to think about it,

645
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,890
it's time for me to have a grandson.

646
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,730
But if Miss Su marries me,

647
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,160
won't it be embarrassing for us

648
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,860
in front of the outsiders?

649
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,040
It's just a marriage.

650
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,680
Our Xu's Mansion won't collapse.

651
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,910
Where's the vase I was looking for?

652
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,950
Have you found it?

653
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,490
It's here, Your Ladyship.

654
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,710
Rong,

655
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,220
remember to write to me.

656
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:42,950
Zhen.

657
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,240
Take care of yourself.

658
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,830
Father,

659
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,070
take care.

660
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,550
Your Grace,

661
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,100
it's getting late.

662
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,410
I'll go back now.

663
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,680
Zhen.

664
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,690
Where are you going?

665
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,370
Your Grace,

666
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,930
don't be too sad.

667
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,190
Although I'm wearing Zhen's clothes,

668
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,740
I am Rong.

669
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,590
Zhen will come back

670
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,910
when the whole thing's over, right?

671
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,320
Today, I pretended to be her

672
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,450
because it was an emergency.

673
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,600
Don't be angry.

674
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,390
Here's the thing.

675
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,500
Xu Muchen has seen your face.

676
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,830
So, from now on,

677
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,710
you

678
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,750
will be Su Jinzhen.

679
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,950
It's getting late.

680
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,460
I gotta go now.

681
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,070
Didn't Yu Luocha make you

682
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,550
understand the task this time?

683
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,550
The marriage between Zhen and Xu Muchen

684
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,350
is arranged by His Majesty.

685
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,120
If you leave now,

686
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,930
the whole Su family

687
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,140
will be committing the crime of deceiving the Emperor.

688
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,400
You and Zhen have been close since childhood.

689
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,730
Do you really want her and her whole family

690
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,590
to be executed?

691
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,760
Kid,

692
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,200
you just need to stay with the Xu family

693
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,580
for a while.

694
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,800
Once this matter is over,

695
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,130
I will personally

696
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,930
help you divorce Xu.

697
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,490
If you help us this time,

698
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,550
after this,

699
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,210
you

700
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,190
will be the second daughter of the Su family

701
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,270
and my second daughter.

702
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,110
Your Grace.

703
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,310
I…

704
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,290
[Duke's Mansion]

705
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,570
Mr. Zhang is here.

706
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,310
Please come in.

707
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,990
Okay.

708
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,410
What are you doing?

709
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,620
Miss.

710
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,570
I'm here for the facial threading

711
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,300
or facial hair removal ritual.

712
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,430
Facial threading?

713
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,460
Facial threading

714
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,420
is to pull the fine hairs on your face

715
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,730
and make your skin as smooth as jade.

716
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,980
I think my skin is smooth enough.

717
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,670
I don't think I need it.

718
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,300
That won't do.

719
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,350
This is the tradition of the Jing Dynasty.

720
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,700
Every girl who is getting married

721
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,910
should go through the facial threading.

722
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,480
Every girl?

723
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,010
I guess it won't hurt a lot, will it?

724
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,950
It does hurt a little.

725
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,070
But think about it.

726
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,910
How much the groom will love you

727
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,710
when he lifts your veil tonight?

728
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,040
I don't want to.

729
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,270
Miss! Miss!

730
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,270
You can't go.

731
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,200
Miss.

732
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,420
Miss, you can't go.

733
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,640
What are you doing?

734
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,390
It's the first time that I pretend to be a bride.

735
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,920
It's bad enough that I have to marry that evil official,

736
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,600
and now I've even got a facial threading.

737
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,890
It hurts so much.

738
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,670
When I find the jade pendant,

739
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,670
I'll break his legs

740
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,930
to take revenge on him.

741
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,220
Miss,

742
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,290
I'm going to comb your hair.

743
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,740
You don't say.

744
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,180
I look quite pretty when I'm all dressed up.

745
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,940
But I am not bad-looking in the first place.

746
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
Master and Senior often praised me.

747
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,400
But I'm so beautiful…

748
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,900
What should I do

749
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,930
if that evil official has evil intentions towards me?

750
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,370
Lecher.

751
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,150
Don't blame me for being cruel by then.

752
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,670
Miss,

753
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm going to do your hair now.

754
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,510
I might pull it hard.

755
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,640
Please bear with it.

756
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,020
[Happiness]

757
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,590
Why are you crying?

758
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,890
[Happiness]

759
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,570
It's your wedding day, My Lord.

760
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,410
I'm excited.

761
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,360
If you're so excited, you go.

762
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,230
No, no, no.

763
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,710
My Lord.

764
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,770
I'm not that lucky.

765
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,570
Is the Blood-generating Pill ready?

766
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,850
Why do you need this on your wedding day?

767
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,020
It has its uses.

768
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,180
Leave it.

769
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,410
By the way,

770
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,180
I have a task for you.

771
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,640
During the formal bowing ritual at the wedding ceremony later,

772
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,970
if you hear me coughing,

773
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,290
bring me a bowl of brown sugar water.

774
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:23,900
Okay.

775
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,840
[Xu's Mansion]

776
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
He does this on purpose, doesn't he?

777
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,690
Let's go.

778
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,120
All right, it's the auspicious time.

779
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,700
First bow to heaven and earth.

780
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,340
Good!

781
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,070
Congratulations.

782
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,870
Congratulations.

783
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,470
Great.

784
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,710
Why is the groom coughing on his wedding day?

785
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,390
He was fine two days ago.

786
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,010
How did he suddenly get sick?

787
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,820
Second bow to your parent.

788
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,390
Great!

789
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,200
Great!

790
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,150
Is Xu Muchen all right?

791
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,500
I don't know.

792
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,440
It smells like brown sugar water.

793
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,000
Why is the groom so weak?

794
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,190
All right.

795
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,590
Third bow to each other.

796
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,320
Congratulations.

797
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,750
Wish you a long and happy marriage.

798
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,350
Wish you two have a baby soon.

799
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,590

Congratulations.

Why did she bring a knife?
