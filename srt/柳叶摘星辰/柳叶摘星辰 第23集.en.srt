[Episode 23]

4
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,290
You're very skilled in this.

5
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,230
I've done it for my mother before.

6
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,620
Was it for your mother

7
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,550
or for a lady?

8
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,670
See?

9
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,860
Even if I did it well,

10
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,530
I still got scolded by you.

11
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,390
I wouldn't have done it if I had known earlier.

12
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,250
What? Are you getting tired of it?

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
I dare not.

14
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,790
Don't move.

15
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,350
What's this?

16
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,430
I bought it when I went out this morning.

17
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,230
I noticed that I haven't given you a gift in a while.

18
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,840
Let's consider this as a token of our love.

19
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Do you like it?

20
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,510
Yes.

21
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,160
Good for you, Darling.

22
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,470
You're getting better in romance.

23
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,990
It's because you are a good teacher, Honey.

24
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,110
Don't be too proud of yourself.

25
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,950
Keep working.

26
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,570
However, this can only be considered an ordinary gift.

27
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,150
As for the token of love, you've already given it to me.

28
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,670
It's really like "the spring breeze bringing a message,

29
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,990
with a precious jade as the matchmaker."

30
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,100
I never thought that the jade pendant my father left me

31
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,960
would bring me such good fortune.

32
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,310
But speaking of which,

33
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,550
I agreed to marry you in place of Su Jinzhen for two reasons.

34
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,230
Firstly,

35
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,490
it was because you trapped me in the room.

36
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,990
That was because I figured out

37
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,350
that you committed the crime with the golden cricket.

38
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,310
And secondly,

39
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,790
it was because my Master ordered me

40
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,070
to steal this jade pendant.

41
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,990
Otherwise,

42
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,280
with one of us being an official and the other a thief,

43
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,080
we probably would never have met in this lifetime.

44
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,780
Your Master told you to steal the jade pendant?

45
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,430
Why?

46
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,560
She said

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,269
this jade pendant is related to the flood case in Taizhou.

48
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,730
The flood case in Taizhou?

49
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,440
So the mastermind behind it

50
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,830
must be Duke Su.

51
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,110
But why would he

52
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,510
be interested in my father's jade pendant?

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,460
Could there be some secret

54
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,730
behind this jade pendant?

55
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,909
How about we go ask my Master?

56
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,230
Master,

57
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,390
this is the jade pendant you've been asking me to find.

58
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,310
Rong,

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,470
since you have already got this jade pendant,

60
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,470
why didn't you give it to me earlier?

61
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,120
How could that be possible?

62
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,670
Xu Muchen just gave me this jade pendant recently.

63
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,310
Right?

64
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,280
Yes.

65
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,320
Forget it.

66
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,800
Muchen.

67
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,790
For you, Rong would rather conceal

68
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,730
the existence of the jade pendant from me.

69
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,660
It shows how much she cares for you.

70
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,500
You must not disappoint her.

71
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,970
Master, don't worry about it.

72
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:33,900
Master.

73
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,550
do you know why Duke Su wanted us

74
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,550
to find this jade pendant back then?

75
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,630
At that time, I was only commanded

76
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,740
to tell you to steal this jade pendant.

77
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,030
As for its purpose,

78
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,159
I really don't know.

79
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,250
However...

80
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,909
What?

81
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,360
However, Xu Chengsi, Lord Xu,

82
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,790
not only had extraordinary intelligence

83
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,150
but also understood the technique

84
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,550
of crafting mechanisms.

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,130
You see, the design of this jade pendant

86
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,530
is slightly different from ordinary ones.

87
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,080
It does seem different.

88
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,750
This jade pendant

89
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,390
looks more like a key to unlocking some mechanism.

90
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,110
My father had evidence

91
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,070
of Duke Su planting Moon Star Herb.

92
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,920
So this jade pendant must be the key

93
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,920
to unlock the whereabouts of the hidden evidence.

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,390
If it's a key,

95
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,650
then where is the door?

96
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,160
Look at this side.

97
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,460
Look. Can you see the difference

98
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,750
between this plum blossom pattern and ordinary ones?

99
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,710
This plum blossom has broken patterns.

100
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,430
If these patterns

101
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,630
were intentionally made by Lord Xu,

102
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,750
he must have left some clues.

103
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,790
Plum Blossom?

104
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,390
Take this.

105
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,180
[Plum Blossom Collection]

106
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,040
Mother,

107
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,830
what is this?

108
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,750
This is a plum blossom album your father made before his passing.

109
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,100
Before he went to Taizhou, he said

110
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,290
the peach blossoms there were in full bloom,

111
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,390
and he planned to bring back

112
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,390
a petal for me to tuck into the album,

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,320
and to draw a Peach Blossom Collection.

114
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,230
Could it be that book?

115
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,110
Master,

116
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,700
we're going over there now.

117
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,110
Have you found anything?

118
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,510
Mother said this book

119
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,640
was left to her by Father when he was in Taizhou.

120
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,560
But all the drawings in it are plum blossoms.

121
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,820
I didn't pay much attention to it before.

122
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,160
If there is some hidden meaning behind

123
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,840
the plum blossom on that jade pendant,

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,950
then this album...

125
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,750
The principle of the Nine Palaces requires the spirit tortoise to decipher.

126
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,550
Two and Four are shoulders, Six and Eight are feet.

127
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,870
Three on the left, Seven on the right, Nine above, and One below.

128
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,400
Five resides in the center.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,660
Gathering all the arts of divination

130
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,590
and all the ingenious techniques.

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,350
The Diagram of Gen.

132
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,750
It means Mountain among the five elements.

133
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,240
The Diagram of Qian.

134
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,200
It means northwest direction.

135
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,110
What place is that?

136
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,630
The northwest part of the mountain.

137
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,090
The Peach Blossom Valley.

138
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,870
It looks like Muchen has deciphered

139
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,310
the clues left by Lord Xu.

140
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,590
You go gather

141
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,650
our Watermill disciples to find him.

142
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,040
I'll go to Liu Wenchu, Lord Liu, to mobilize the troops.

143
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,370
To mobilize the troops?

144
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,230
With my many years

145
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,830
of understanding of Duke Su,

146
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,790
he will surely try to stop Xu Muchen from finding the evidence.

147
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,990
Lord Liu's escort

148
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,030
can ensure everything goes smoothly.

149
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,630
Yes.

150
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,710
Mumu.

151
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,150
Mumu.

152
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,800
I finally found you.

153
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,860
Young Master Gongyang?

154
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,910
You actually followed me to Taizhou?

155
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,230
Are you here on orders from the Ministry of Justice

156
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,690
to arrest me and my Master?

157
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,110
I...

158
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,470
Master, you go first.

159
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,470
I'll hold him off.

160
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,400
Gongyang,

161
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,190
I've been deceived by villains

162
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,350
and made many mistakes.

163
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,390
I know my sins are grave and undeniable.

164
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,310
But I do have urgent matters to attend to today

165
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,670
and cannot be entangled with you.

166
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,990
Let me finish my business first,

167
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,990
and then you can deal with me as you wish.

168
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,630
Master,

169
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,520
what are you talking about?

170
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Gongyang Maocai,

171
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,270
If you dare to lay a finger on my Master,

172
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,790
you'll have to get through me first.

173
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,750
Mumu, I've resigned.

174
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,440
What did you say?

175
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,310
I'm just a commoner now.

176
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,340
As for the Watermill's affairs,

177
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,760
they have nothing to do with me, Gongyang Maocai.

178
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,270
I'm Gongyang Maocai.

179
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,300
Greetings, Ms. Yu Luocha.

180
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,860
Are you saying

181
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,600
you're not going to be an official from now on?

182
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,080
Yes.

183
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,480
Xu Muchen competes with me every day.

184
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,750
I'm tired of it.

185
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,550
I've thought it through.

186
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,110
It's better that I resigned.

187
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,300
That way,

188
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,930
I can live with you freely.

189
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,350
Don't push it.

190
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,410
I never said I would live with you.

191
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,070
Chat with Gongyang another day if you have anything to say.

192
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,110
Muchen's investigation is obstructed,

193
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,630
and he needs your help.

194
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,230
Yes.

195
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,980
You, come with me.

196
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,190
Xu Muchen?

197
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,490
His affairs are not my concern.

198
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,310
Alright.

199
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,670
Stay here and have some tea.

200
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,670
I'll go by myself.

201
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,150
Your affairs are my concern.

202
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,870
Someone is following us.

203
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't look back.

204
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,010
Is it Duke Su's person?

205
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,190
Senior Moyan has already sent a message to the capital.

206
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,390
Based on the distance,

207
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,390
Duke Su will arrive in Taizhou soon.

208
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,390
I have already informed Ms. Yu Luocha,

209
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,310
asking her to take my letter

210
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,830
to find Uncle Liu in Taizhou.

211
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,710
What's next?

212
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,110
We'll go to Peach Blossom Valley

213
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,190
to lure Duke Su out.

214
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,510
Your Grace,

215
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,670
the person we sent has been following them all the way

216
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,550
to a peach blossom forest outside the suburbs,

217
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,680
where Xu Muchen's trail disappeared.

218
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,000
A peach blossom forest?

219
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,750
Chengsi.

220
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,490
Your Grace.

221
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,960
Your Grace, please take a seat.

222
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,670
I want to blame you for one thing.

223
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,430
In Taizhou,

224
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,350
there are big mansions everywhere.

225
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,910
If you take a fancy to any one of them,

226
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,440
you can always ask me for it.

227
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,790
Why bother

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,790
building a thatched hut in the peach blossom forest?

229
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,450
It is uncomfortable to live in

230
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,920
and cost money to build.

231
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,610
Aren't you afraid that your wife will blame you when you return?

232
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,370
You must be joking.

233
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,110
It's just a thatched hut.

234
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,570
It won't cost much silver.

235
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,510
I hope you will keep it secret for me

236
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,350
when you return to the capital.

237
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,900
For a few pieces of silver,

238
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,030
your wife won't give you a hard time.

239
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,970
But, Chengsi,

240
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,310
if after a few years,

241
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,870
you still worry about being blamed by your wife

242
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,830
because of a few pieces of silver,

243
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,670
that won't be acceptable.

244
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,910
Your Grace, you're right.

245
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,230
Fortunately, my wife is from a well-off family.

246
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,890
She doesn't need me to be rich.

247
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,430
She just wants my modest salary

248
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,760
to live up to my conscience.

249
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,970
Well said.

250
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,310
If everyone in the Jing State

251
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,230
were like you,

252
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,790
we would have peace and prosperity throughout the country,

253
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,790
and the prosperity of our country would last forever.

254
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,950
You flattered me.

255
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,440
Alright, go ahead with your business.

256
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,630
Good for you, Xu Chengsi.

257
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,550
Let's go.

258
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:43,950
Is it here?

259
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,390
Judging from the layout of this Peach Blossom Valley,

260
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,870
it looks like my father's work.

261
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,350
Let's go in and take a look.

262
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,910
I'll go over there to take a look.

263
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,270
Darling.

264
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,430
Darling.

265
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,390
Why is this niche upside down?

266
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,560
Here.

267
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:30,940
My Lord.

268
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,930
We're here.

269
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,180
Get into the mountain.

270
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,100
Search.

271
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,480
Yes, My Lord.

272
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,980
When you encounter Xu Muchen, execute him on the spot.

273
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,190
Search!

274
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,250
[Ledger]

[To the Emperor of the Yue State]

[Your Majesty, everything is done in the capital]

284
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,470
My Lord,

285
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,190
the terrain in the valley is complex,

286
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,330
and the weeds are everywhere.

287
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,190
It's difficult to find Xu Muchen's trail in a short time.

288
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,110
The location chosen by Master Xu Chengsi

289
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,270
is not one you can easily enter.

290
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,390
My Lord,

291
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,210
what should we do next?

292
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,910
Have you informed Young Master

293
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,550
to come over with manpower?

294
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,580
Don't worry, My Lord.

295
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,550
Young Master is on his way here.

296
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,990
Set fire to the mountain.

297
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,830
My Lord, that's not advisable!

298
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,110
If we set fire to the mountain,

299
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,670
it's likely to attract the government troops in no time.

300
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,310
By then...

301
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,680
So what if the government troops come?

302
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,950
If we kill Xu Muchen

303
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,710
and burn the evidence,

304
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,950
I will still be Duke Su.

305
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,470
If we can't burn it,

306
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,310
I'll be a traitor of the Jing State

307
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,910
and a spy of the Yue State.

308
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,280
If my guess is correct,

309
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,030
Xu Muchen must have already sent out

310
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,180
the information about here.

311
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,070
He stayed here as bait

312
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,710
to lure me.

313
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,350
Then, by coming here,

314
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,950
aren't you just falling into Xu Muchen's trap?

315
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,350
He only expected one thing,

316
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,280
but didn't expect the other thing.

317
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,710
I guess he thought selling Moon Star Herb

318
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,950
was just for personal gain.

319
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,410
But he definitely would never expect

320
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,110
that I am from the Yue State.

321
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,270
Killing Xu Muchen

322
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,670
would solve everything.

323
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,910
If this plan fails,

324
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,390
we can immediately enter

325
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,020
the Yue State from here.

326
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,340
You're right, My Lord.

327
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,430
Set fire to the mountain!

328
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,870
Yes!

329
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,890
[To my son, Muchen]

330
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,790
[My son, Muchen]

331
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
The case back then

332
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,270
has finally come to light.

333
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,430
When my father and Duke Su came to Taizhou to manage the water,

334
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,310
they found that the relief funds had been embezzled.

335
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,500
Furthermore, some farmers in Taizhou had stopped farming

336
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,470
and started cultivating a herb

337
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,110
called Moon Star Herb.

338
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,150
My father found that this herb, if consumed for a prolonged period,

339
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,630
would be fundamentally harmful to the human body.

340
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,680
It seemed that someone was manipulating it behind the scenes in Taizhou.

341
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,430
Later, during the investigation,

342
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,310
my father intercepted a secret letter.

343
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,670
According to its contents,

344
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,950
he discovered that Duke Su was not from the Jing State,

345
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,380
[Your Majesty, I'm living in the Jing State]

346
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,830
but a spy sent by the Yue State,

347
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,490
[Yours sincerely, Su Yu]

348
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,030
with the sole intention of weakening our country

349
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,390
to annex it.

350
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,110
Although my father found the evidence,

351
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,270
Duke Su was too powerful in Taizhou.

352
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,210
He couldn't fight him.

353
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,790
So he could only leave all the evidence here temporarily.

354
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,280
He then inscribed the clue onto a jade pendant,

355
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,520
just in case.

356
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,350
Duke Su learned that my father

357
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,030
had uncovered the truth about the Moon Star Herb.

358
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,550
He was preparing to destroy the dam to bury the evidence.

359
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,680
That's impossible.

360
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,800
That's impossible.

361
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,480
It's about thousands of lives.

362
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,390
Dad.

363
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,420
What's wrong?

364
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,090
No.

365
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,400
I have to ask him.

366
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,740
Dad!

367
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,400
Where are you going?

368
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,860
To protect the people there,

369
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,830
Father gave up the chance

370
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,870
of leaving Taizhou safely

371
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,510
and went to stop Duke Su.

372
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,350
After that day,

373
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,710
I never saw my father again

374
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,190
After my father's death,

375
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,630
Duke Su slandered him for embezzlement

376
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,220
and using inferior materials to pass off as superior ones.

377
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,350
He covered up the incident of destroying the dam with it.

378
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,840
My father was innocent.

379
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,770
It turns out Duke Su is from the Yue State.

380
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,320
No wonder he did so many bad things.

381
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,970
Darling.

382
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,470
Look. There's smoke.

383
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,510
It seems that someone arrived here

384
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,910
faster than we expected.

385
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,790
Keep the jade pendant safe.

386
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,190
They can't enter without the jade pendant.

387
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,310
There's a gap over there.

388
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,490
Let's get out of here now.

389
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,630
If we go out now,

390
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,710
won't we be falling into their trap?

391
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,550
If my estimation is correct,

392
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,370
Uncle Liu should be on his way.

393
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,930
It all depends on our luck.

394
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,070
The four top experts from the Yue State?

395
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,430
Have you heard of them?

396
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,830
When they attempted to assassinate the Emperor that year,

397
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,260
all the Imperial Guards were dispatched.

398
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,150
But they managed to escape.

399
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,870
Be careful.

400
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,750
Muchen, you are quite insightful.

401
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,750
Is the evidence

402
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,310
collected by Xu Chengsi back then

403
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,220
hidden in the woods behind you?

404
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:48,990
Exactly.

405
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,370
But who would have thought

406
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,390
that Duke Su, who has made great contributions to the Jing State,

407
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,390
is actually a spy from the Yue State?

408
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,930
Do you feel that

409
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,430
you've found out a bit too late now?

410
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,710
Duke Su, you have reached the highest ranks,

411
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,350
serving in key positions of government.

412
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,310
Why would you insist on colluding with foreign powers

413
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,440
and sowing discord?

414
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,510
When chaos erupts,

415
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,480
it's the innocent people who will suffer.

416
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,430
Colluding with foreign powers?

417
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,870
Xu Muchen,

418
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,390
do you know

419
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,670
that, to me, this place is the foreign land?

420
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,480
So what if two countries are in conflict?

421
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,210
The casualties will inevitably be soldiers and commoners.

422
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,510
But it will achieve

423
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,090
the glorious legacy of our country for generations to come.

424
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,800
How crazy.

425
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,830
After committing so many wrongdoings,

426
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,630
can you sleep soundly at night?

427
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,910
You don't need to worry about this.

428
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,470
Only the dead can sleep soundly.

429
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,630
Do you think by eliminating the Zhao family

430
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,090
and exposing my identity,

431
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,670
you can make anything different?

432
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,930
The Moon Star Herb trade in the Jing State

433
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,280
will still have someone secretly supporting it.

434
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,080
In less than five years,

435
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,980
the provinces throughout the Jing State

436
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,990
will be like Taizhou.

437
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,430
By then, without using a single soldier,

438
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,510
our country will reap the benefits.

439
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,790
The beautiful land of the Jing State

440
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,670
will become our possession.

441
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,160
Could it be Senior Moyan

442
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,300
who's controlling the business?

443
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,110
Rong,

444
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,190
you've been with Xu Muchen for too long.

445
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,710
Even if I want you to live,

446
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,590
I can't do that.

447
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,390
Rong,

448
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,670
your Master was killed by Xu Muchen.

449
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,710
Instead of seeking revenge for your Master,

450
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,760
you're now mingling with the killer.

451
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,790
If your Master could see it in heaven,

452
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,630
she would never forgive you.

453
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,030
Your Grace,

454
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,890
sorry to disappoint you.

455
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,790
But my Master is not dead.

456
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,590
I see.

457
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,630
Xu Muchen,

458
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,440
have you been setting up multiple layers

459
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,310
of schemes against me just for today?

460
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,930
If not for that,

461
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,790
how could my Master see through your ambitions?

462
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,670
Your Grace,

463
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,070
for the sake of the relationship between me and Jinzhen,

464
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,310
if you surrender now,

465
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,150
we'll spare your lives.

466
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,400
Then I thank you

467
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,370
for your filial piety.

468
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,350
What took you so long?

469
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,310
It's none of your concern.

470
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,870
I can come whenever I want.

471
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,140
Senior.

472
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,250
You and Young Master Gongyang...

473
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,310
Darling!

474
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,470
My Lord, go!

475
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,800
Hurry! Support Lord Xu!

476
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,180
Yes!

477
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,080
-Yes!
-Yes!

478
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,150
My Lord, let's retreat.

479
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,410
Where is Ning?

480
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,570
He'll be here soon.

481
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,070
Dad, are you alright?

482
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm fine.

483
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,490
Uncle.

484
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,720
Jinning?

485
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,470
Liu Wenchu?

486
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,300
It looks that the Jing State really has no one useful.

487
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,950
Even you have been dispatched.

488
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,430
The law is fair and just, leaving no loopholes.

489
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,520
Duke Su,

490
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,120
it's time for you to repay the debt you owe

491
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
to the people of Taizhou in the past.

492
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,750
Just based on you guys?

493
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,640
Liu Wenchu,

494
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,430
when I lead the army to conquer the Jing State,

495
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,510
you'll be the first one I'll use as a sacrifice to our flag.

496
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,030
Even at this point, you're still stubborn and unrepentant.

497
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,670
Guards!

498
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,710
Yes!

499
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,430
Take him down!

500
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,950
Yes!

501
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,830
Escort my dad to leave!

502
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,350
Yes!

503
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,750
My Lord, let's go.

504
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,570
Lord Liu, let's go.

505
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,460
My dad and his people have left.

506
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,770
Jinning,

507
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,800
with your martial arts skills,

508
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,750
can you stop me?

509
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,670
I know I can't defeat you.

510
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,440
But...

511
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,470
Jinning,

512
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,670
you know what Duke Su has done in the Jing State.

513
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,130
Are you going to help him make more mistakes?

514
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,670
Most conflicts arise from differing perspectives.

515
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,710
It's hard to tell what's right and what's wrong.

516
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,900
Why is that hard?

517
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,000
Seeking wealth at the expense of lives is wrong.

518
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,730
Killing the innocent is wrong.

519
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,870
Trafficking Moon Star Herb

520
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,200
and harming the people are even more wrong.

521
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,790
These are all naturally unacceptable!

522
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,520
Rong.

523
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,230
You're not me.

524
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,630
You don't need to lecture me with these moral truths.

525
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,390
I am Duke Su's son,

526
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,970
a citizen of Yue State.

527
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,310
This is my fate.

528
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,710
How do you expect me to turn back?

529
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,990
Should I hand my father over to the Zichen Department?

530
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,470
Considering his actions,

531
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,000
he would surely face death.

532
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,310
I am just an ordinary person.

533
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,070
I cannot harm my own family for the sake of righteousness.

534
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,470
Rong.

535
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,290
If you truly want to capture my father today,

536
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,110
then kill me first.

537
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,310
Jinning.

538
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,270
Go.

539
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,380
Thank you.

540
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,590
Jinning!

541
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,909
The next time we meet,

542
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:21,949
we'll be enemies.

543
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,630
By then...

544
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,230
Rong!

545
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,310
I won't see you again.

546
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,620
Rong.

547
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,550
Why did you follow me?

548
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,630
Uncle Liu has already captured the people from the Yue State.

549
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,630
Where is Duke Su?

550
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,550
Duke Su...

551
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,430
I couldn't catch him.

552
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,220
I intended to chase him,

553
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,390
but I was intercepted by Jinning.

554
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,590
He threatened me with his life

555
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,720
and blocked the way.

556
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,690
I was thinking that although Duke Su is extremely guilty,

557
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,110
Jinning at least didn't do anything

558
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,550
extremely immoral.

559
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,030
So...

560
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,590
I see.

561
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,190
It's okay.

562
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,420
You must be very angry, right?

563
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,190
As for Duke Su,

564
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,010
we need to discuss it further.

565
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,190
Gongyang Maocai is injured.

566
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,390
Let's go check on him.

567
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,800
Wu Zhao, why are you here?

568
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,860
It was all because of Xiao Qiu.

569
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,710
Since she found out

570
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,990
you left the mansion,

571
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,230
she has been too sad to eat or drink.

572
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,590
She forced me to come to Taizhou with the Lord

573
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,590
to bring you back

574
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,720
as soon as possible.

575
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,280
Senior Brother.

576
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,050
How's Gongyang's injury?

577
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,390
He's fine.

578
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,050
There's nothing serious.

579
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,400
However,

580
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,990
you should pay more attention to your Senior Brother.

581
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,550
When I was risking my life, you were nowhere to be found.

582
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,070
Now you're suddenly busy here.

583
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,750
You really know how to show up after the battle.

584
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,750
Gongyang Maocai,

585
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,450
is your wound not hurting anymore?

586
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,750
It hurts, Mumu.

587
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,770
What are you doing?

588
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,830
Young Master Gongyang was right.

589
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,870
Your Senior Brother is too weak

590
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,190
and can only do these trivial tasks now.

591
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,710
No matter how much Young Master Gongyang bullies me,

592
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,840
I can only endure it.

593
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,910
Stop pretending.

594
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,740
Senior Brother,

595
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,070
if I were you,

596
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,240
I wouldn't treat him.

597
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,140
I would let fate decide whether he lives or dies.

598
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,070
Mumu?

599
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,830
Young Master Gongyang.

600
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,840
Out of the mouth comes evil.

601
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,600
If you want to marry Mumu,

602
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,740
be cautious with your words and actions.

603
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,280
Your wanted posters are still in the capital.

604
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,910
Do you believe I'll...

605
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,520
Mumu.

606
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,190
Gongyang is threatening me.

607
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,070
Gongyang Maocai,

608
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,410
do you want to die?

609
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,710
I don't want to die, Mumu.

610
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,370
Continue with your business.

611
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,940
Am I right, Senior Brother?

612
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,910
Yes.

613
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,850
I'm thirsty. Go boil some water.

614
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,050
Gongyang,

615
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,260
if you marry Mumu,

616
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,930
you must be careful.

617
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,710
Darling.

618
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,330
What are you thinking?

619
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,950
Nothing.

620
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,050
Are you blaming me for not catching Duke Su?

621
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,460
My wife has a good heart.

622
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,910
How could I blame you?

623
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,380
Besides, Su Jinning

624
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,380
hasn't done anything evil.

625
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,500
If I were you,

626
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,890
I wouldn't want to see him die before my eyes either.

627
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,320
It's just that I wonder if my late father in heaven

628
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,030
would blame me

629
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,810
for not catching Duke Su personally.

630
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,170
This is what I found in Father's secret chamber.

631
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,060
Dad, Mom!

632
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,670
Chen.

633
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,940
What happened?

634
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,560
Who did you fight with?

635
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,580
Dad, Mom.

636
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,660
Gongyang Maocai spread rumors.

637
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,890
And people outside are all saying

638
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,950
that my father is a poor scholar pretending to be noble

639
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,370
and a hypocritical pseudo-gentleman.

640
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,830
I couldn't bear it

641
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,910
and ended up fighting with them.

642
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,910
It must have been the wife of the Gongyang family who said that.

643
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,190
I must confront her about it.

644
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,990
Don't. Honey.

645
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,670
Come on, Muchen.

646
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,250
Let me tell you,

647
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,730
right and wrong don't depend on a few idle words

648
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,780
but on the ways of the world and people's hearts.

649
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,390
If I can't handle idle gossip,

650
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,170
then there's no need for me to hold office,

651
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,990
right?

652
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,720
Chen is still young.

653
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,000
He doesn't understand

654
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,520
what you're saying.

655
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,870
Gradually,

656
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,590
he will understand it in the future.

657
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,850
This is something I just made.

658
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,610
Take it and play with it.

659
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,440
Thank you, Dad.

660
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,360
Fly!

661
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,870
Fly!

662
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,230
Be careful. Don't fall down.

663
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,830
Slow down.

664
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,470
I didn't expect my father

665
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
to have kept this with him all along.

666
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,390
Even in times of crisis,

667
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,160
he still thought of you.

668
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,450
Now that his name has been cleared,

669
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,520
and seeing you grown into an adult,

670
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,430
he must be very proud up in heaven.

671
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,430
My father left me since I was little.

672
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,310
I really wish he could see

673
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,710
what I've accomplished,

674
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,120
and scold me a bit.

675
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,070
Who says he can't see?

676
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,110
Remember when you taught me to look at the stars when we were kids?

677
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,920
Look at the brightest one.

678
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,090
That's Father.

679
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Maybe he's looking at you right now.

680
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,990
You're right.

681
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,320
Stop.

682
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,320
My Lord,

683
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,820
what's wrong?

684
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,050
Dad.

685
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,120
Are you okay?

686
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,930
I'm fine.

687
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,590
I'm just a little thirsty.

688
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,020
Take my father and leave first.

689
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,250
Make sure to take good care of him.

690
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,050
I'll go find water and be back soon.

691
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,110
Yes, Young Master.

692
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,630
Let's go.
