[My Wife is A Thief]

[Episode 15]

4
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,780
Mom,

5
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,080
I promised you before.

6
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,229
But it was delayed by work.

7
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,390
Honey,

8
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,270
What do you think?

9
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,870
Sure.

10
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,190
Xiao Dong.

11
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,430
Old Madam.

12
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,509
Get the carriage ready.

13
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,430
After we finish eating,

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,950
I'm going to the hot spring villa with Young Master and Young Madam.

15
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,070
Yes, Old Madam.

16
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
Let's eat quickly.

17
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,170
Zhen, eat more.

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,540
The journey to the hot spring villa is long.

19
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,870
Don't starve yourself.

20
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,230
Chen, you should eat more too.

21
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,800
Luckily, I went to see Senior this afternoon.

22
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,390
You'll be soaking in the pool to the east.

23
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,530
I had the maids scatter flower petals inside.

24
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,840
Soaking in it can not only dispel cold and dampness in your body

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,300
but also nourish the skin.

26
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,250
What about my husband?

27
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,910
Where is he?

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,140
Is there anyone taking care of him?

29
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,670
He's in the pool to the west.

30
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,640
Are you already missing your husband?

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,210
You lovebirds

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,770
can't even bear to be apart for a moment.

33
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,410
Mother,

34
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,810
stop teasing me.

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,820
Go ahead. Don't wait for me.

36
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,150
I haven't finished yet.

37
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,550
Why is there another pool?

38
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,390
It's too close to mine.

39
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,940
East, west,

40
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,329
south, north. West.

41
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,010
Is there another pool to the east?

42
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,150
Anyway, this is the westernmost part of the villa.

43
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,630
How can I make him notice it?

44
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,190
There's no such coincidence.

45
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,470
No.

46
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,690
It's too contrived.

47
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,090
Let me think of another way.

48
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,770
In case anything happens.

49
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,250
If you want to look, just look.

50
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,510
Don't be so shy.

51
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,890
Why are you here?

52
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,320
Aren't you supposed to be in the other pool?

53
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,680
We are husband and wife.

54
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,300
Husband and wife should soak together,

55
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,100
facing each other openly,

56
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,190
with no secrets,

57
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,240
right?

58
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,360
But you forgot.

59
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,950
We are only nominal husband and wife.

60
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,140
Only nominal husband and wife?

61
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,970
Really?

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,460
Well...

63
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,390
I think so.

64
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,350
Anyway, we're not close enough

65
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,860
to bathe together.

66
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,700
You know that.

67
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,510
Not close enough.

68
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,659
Honey,

69
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,590
I noticed a flower on your shoulder just now.

70
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,590
What does it mean?

71
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,710
I used to be allergic to peach blossoms when I was a child.

72
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,290
It left a scar from one of the allergic reactions.

73
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,380
The scar was very ugly,

74
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,620
so I got a tattoo to cover it up.

75
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,970
Why didn't you say that before?

76
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,630
Well...

77
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,610
Do I have to say it specifically?

78
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,730
Was I suppose to

79
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,890
suddenly lift my clothes one day and say

80
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,350
"look, there's a tattoo"?

81
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,550
Right?

82
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,890
Right.

83
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,720
Young Master heard that Young Madam was at the eastern pool,

84
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,200
so he voluntarily suggested going there.

85
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,210
My son is finally getting it.

86
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,060
The water in the eastern pool is too hot,

87
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,290
which Old Madam can't endure due to her age.

88
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,490
It was just right for Young Master to go.

89
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,210
Xiao Dong, Xiao Qiu,

90
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,210
pass on the order.

91
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,480
No one is allowed near the eastern pool.

92
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,700
Yes, Your Ladyship.

93
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,250
Yes.

94
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,120
Darling.

95
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,980
I had someone bring two more blankets.

96
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,830
This way, you can lay two blankets on the ground

97
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,160
and it won't be too cold.

98
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,320
You don't have to worry about me.

99
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,670
I'll wear more clothes,

100
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,350
so I won't feel cold in bed.

101
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,710
How long are you going to lie to me?

102
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,600
What did you say?

103
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,450
How long are you going to lie to me?

104
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,150
Every aspect was seamless.

105
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,080
He couldn't possibly find out.

106
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,280
What do you mean?

107
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,120
You still don't want to tell me?

108
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,110
Darling,

109
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,760
what do you mean?

110
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,410
I don't understand.

111
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,740
I'm not your "Darling".

112
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,520
I'm Su Jinzhen's husband.

113
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
And you are not her.

114
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
What are you talking about?

115
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,360
How could I not be?

116
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,540
You're very clever.

117
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,320
You knew I grew suspicious of you

118
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,160
because of the incident with the peach blossom cakes.

119
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,820
So, you've been a step ahead of me in everything.

120
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,700
The passersby at the gate of Duke's Mansion,

121
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,520
Miss Su's nanny, Mrs. Wang,

122
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,820
and the handwriting in Su Jinzhen's room

123
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,120
were all replaced by you.

124
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,880
But you probably didn't expect me

125
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,320
to go to the Wanfo Temple.

126
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,730
This

127
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,150
is the scripture that Miss Su transcribed on her 16th birthday

128
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,410
when she went to the Wanfo Temple to pray.

129
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,070
The handwriting doesn't match yours.

130
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,530
However, this one, signed by Liu Rong,

131
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,490
has the same handwriting as yours.

132
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,000
Are you still going to insist

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,330
that you are Su Jinzhen?

134
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,850
Who are you really?

135
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,520
Why are you impersonating Su Jinzhen?

136
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,260
I'm Liu Rong.

137
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,540
Su Jinzhen and I...

138
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,810
I was her maid.

139
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,500
She didn't want to marry you at that time.

140
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,810
You know that.

141
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,750
The Duke couldn't disobey the imperial decree,

142
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,790
so I had to marry you in her place.

143
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,390
Now that you know my identity...

144
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,780
That's not what I mean.

145
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,910
I mean...

146
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,310
I mean, I don't care whether Su Jinzhen

147
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,710
wanted to marry me or not.

148
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,510
But marriage is a big deal.

149
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,700
It's about your feelings.

150
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,950
If you had married into the Xu family

151
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,610
and found out I'm a bad person,

152
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,310
what would you do with your future life?

153
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,650
I would do whatever I can.

154
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,810
Anyway, I'm an orphan.

155
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,990
What could I do?

156
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,470
You're an orphan?

157
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,240
Yeah.

158
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,690
I've been without parents since I was a child.

159
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,730
I begged my way to Taizhou

160
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,600
and encountered a flood.

161
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,990
You've been through the Taizhou flood?

162
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,500
The dam collapsed all at once.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,720
Everyone was swept away.

164
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,060
So, how did you survive?

165
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,080
Duke Su saved me.

166
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,630
Later, he brought me to Su's Mansion

167
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,060
and made me Miss Zhen's maid.

168
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,880
Miss Zhen has been frail since childhood.

169
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,880
The Duke couldn't bear to marry her to you.

170
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,080
So, to repay the Su family's kindness,

171
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,580
I married you in her place.

172
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,910
I know I don't deserve you.

173
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,610
But don't worry.

174
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,520
After the excitement of the marriage arranged by the Emperor dies down,

175
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,730
I'll quietly leave Xu's Mansion.

176
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,480
I won't drag you down.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,130
I don't want you to leave Xu's Mansion.

178
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,570
Nor do I want you to leave me.

179
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,840
Right now, I just want to ask you one question.

180
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,030
Do you still want to be my wife?

181
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,130
We're from two different worlds.

182
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,930
How can we possibly be together?

183
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,320
Young Master, Young Madam.

184
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,450
Why are you here?

185
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,540
Old Madam specifically told us

186
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,140
to help you get ready for bed.

187
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,310
Why are the quilts on the floor?

188
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,570
They dropped accidentally.

189
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,690
Young Master, Young Madam, please rest early.

190
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,150
Don't move.

191
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,950

192
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,130

193

If you need anything, just call us.

194

I'm not Su Jinzhen anymore.

How do you plan to deal with me?

196
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,570
Receiving the imperial decree in someone else's name is a crime of deceiving the empire.

197
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,300
By law, you should be executed.

198
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,200
But I plan to spare you.

199
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,210
However, although you won't be put to death,

200
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,140
you still need to face punishment.

201
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,270
I was just saying.

202
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,150
Are you really going to punish me?

203
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,840
Of course.

204
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,080
I'll punish you by having you

205
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,450
be my wife in the mansion.

206
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,040
Aren't you afraid that if my identity is exposed,

207
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,170
it will involve you?

208
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,680
Whether you're a maid

209
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,350
or the lady of Duke's Mansion,

210
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,410
I like you all the same.

211
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,600
Even if something goes wrong in the future,

212
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,530
we'll solve it together.

213
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,830
But Honey,

214
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,050
don't deceive me anymore.

215
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,750
Okay.

216
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,450
I'm so cold.

217
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,030
Little brother,

218
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,460
will we die here?

219
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,870
No, we won't.

220
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,920
When we're rescued,

221
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,730
I'll buy you lots of delicious food and toys.

222
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,180
In the future, I'll share everything with you.

223
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,170
You won't die.

224
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,430
I'm not lying to you.

225
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,480
Oh,

226
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,620
keep this with you all the time.

227
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,720
That way, even if we're separated,

228
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,070
I can still find you.

229
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,770

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,860
I know

you're the little boy from back then.

232
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960

I found the file you asked me to find last time.

Put it there for me.

239

Okay.

Yes.

243
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,210
I got it from your study.

244
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,870
Did you see Young Madam?

245
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,950
Yes.

246

Did Young Madam ask about me?

No.

No.

250

She really didn't.

251
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,930
Mr. Su prepared a table of fine food and wine

take Young Madam back to the mansion.

The son of the Li family from the Grand Court drowned?

280
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,720
It is said that a group of dandies were boating at the East Lake at night,

281
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,080
but only the son of the Li family from the Grand Court

282
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,550
[The File of the Drowning Case]

283
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
drowned.

284
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,790
This Young Master Li is the only son of the Li family.

285
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,710
So Mrs. Li went straight to the Ministry of Justice,

286
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,250
demanding these dandies

287
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,330
pay for her child's life with theirs.

288
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,690
The Ministry of Justice

289
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,670
found it to be a tough nut to crack

290
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,170
and decided to hand it over to the Zichen Department.

291
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,360
And it ended up here.

292
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,710
Are there any other doubts?

293
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,880
Doubts?

294
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,820
Mrs. Li stated that

295
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,320
her child has been afraid of water since childhood

296
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,960
and never dared to go near it.

297
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
However, these dandies claimed

298
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,040
that Young Master Li went to the lake by himself

299
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,390
and was dancing there.

300
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,410
As for when he fell into the water

301
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,470
and when he died,

302
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,950
they said they don't know.

303
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,240
But here, the coroner's report indicates

304
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,040
that Young Master Li struggled in the water

305
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,100
for quite some time before his death.

306
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,580
According to what you just said,

307
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,730
there were a dozen people there, but none of them noticed him falling into the water.

308
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,060
If he did drown, then it's very suspicious

309
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,720
that none of them tried to save him.

310
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,560
Yes.

311
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,160
I also found it too suspicious.

312
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,560
But think about it.

313
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,590
No hatred could be so great

314
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,300
as to make...

315
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,700
a dozen people conspire to kill one person.

316
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,240

Our Young Madam is an expert in this.

343
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,400
Whenever Young Master enters the room with a frown,

344
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,040
he always comes out with a smile.

345
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,000
I believe everything about Young Master

346
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,140
is under Young Madam's control.

347
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,100
Don't be deceived by their usual behavior.

348
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,310
They actually care about each other very much.

349
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,580
Don't... don't talk nonsense.

350
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,730
Go and invite Young Madam out.

351
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,660
I want to see her.

352
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,810
Young Madam is being punished by Young Master to transcribe Female Virtues.

353
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,810
I dare not do that.

354
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,330
The Female Virtues?

355
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,500
Good for you, Xu Muchen.

356
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,870
How dare you bully my sister like this!

357
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,840
Just you wait!

358
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,030
He took my money and refused to give me the goods.

359
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,010
Have you found out the origin of the Moon Star Herb?

360
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,790
The Moon Star Herb

361
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,850
was highly likely to be from Taizhou.

362
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,980
Taizhou?

363
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,410
Since when did Taizhou start producing medicine?

364
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,000
I've had some medicine shops

365
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,370
with Moon Star Herb seized.

366
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,650
The employees all said

367
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,620
that the herb was purchased from medicine dealers

368
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,300
from Taizhou.

369
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,520
However, we don't have any leads

370
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,150
on the specific route it took.

371
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,150
Where did it enter the capital from?

372
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,090
From Taizhou.

373
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,290
But as for how it was transported here,

374
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,780
I have no idea.

375
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,760
However, I've also heard

376
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,390
that consuming Moon Star Herb in small amounts

377
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,630
can uplift one's mood

378
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,810
and boost energy.

379
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,630
Especially among the nobility,

380
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,350
it has quietly started to gain popularity.

381
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,110
Okay.

382
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,150
I'll have Wu Zhao investigate

383
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,570
how it was transported into the capital

384
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,900
and who turned the Moon Star Herb

385
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,380
into pills.

386
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,930
Nowadays, wealthy people

387
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,900
are becoming increasingly adept at having fun.

388
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,960
-My Lord.
-Lord Xu.

389
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:11,470
[Zichen Department]

390
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,080
Lord Xu,

391
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,710
our Master wants to talk to you in the carriage.

392
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,630
You'll know who he is when you get in.

393
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,160
[Zichen Department]

394
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,740
Please.

395
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,790
Lord Liu.

396
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,430
What's the matter?

397
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,320
How did you know I'm Lord Liu?

398
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,710
You're wearing the Ministry of Revenue's official robe.

399
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,980
According to the regulation in the Ministry of Revenue,

400
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,200
only officials of the fourth rank and above

401
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
can arrive at and depart from the Court in a carriage.

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,480
I've met most of them

403
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,040
in the Ministry of Revenue.

404
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,930
As for those I haven't met before,

405
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,060
there's only Liu Wenchu, who was newly transferred to the capital,

406
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,320
also known as Lord Liu.

407
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,470
Impressive.

408
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,770
You truly are Chengsi's son.

409
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,960
Did you have a connection with my father?

410
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,550
Yes.

411
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,480
Your father and I were old friends.

412
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,880
We worked together to manage the flood in Taizhou back in the day,

413
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
and forged an unbreakable relationship.

414
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,790
It's a pity that talented individuals

415
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,190
often attract jealousy.

416
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,120
Chengsi fell victim to a scheme

417
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,350
and died under suspicious circumstances.

418
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,100
A scheme?

419
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,960
Yes.

420
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,900
It wasn't just your father.

421
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,920
Many of those who participated in the flood management efforts back then

422
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,540
were either dismissed and exiled

423
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,940
or died in distant lands.

424
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,150
Now, there are only a few of us

425
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,850
left in the Court.

426
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,730
There must be hidden motives

427
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,710
behind the Taizhou flood incident.

428
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,860
I've been investigating for years,

429
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,990
but still haven't made much progress.

430
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,090
If you have anything to say, Lord Liu,

431
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,350
please speak plainly.

432
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,010
Do you know how Lord Hu died?

433
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,720
Lord Hu?

434
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,690
Yes.

435
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,630
It was I who arranged for you to serve as a guard

436
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,050
at Lord Hu's mansion.

437
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,370
Why?

438
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,280
Lord Hu had a ledger of your father's

439
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,360
in his possession,

440
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,120
which is related to the Taizhou flood.

441
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,520
After discussing with Lord Hu,

442
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,930
we deliberately spread this information.

443
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,970
If the masterminds behind the flood

444
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,240
are still around,

445
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,730
they would surely try to break into

446
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,720
Hu's Mansion to steal the ledger.

447
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,360
So you want me

448
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,490
to catch the thief who stole the ledger

449
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,110
and then uncover the real masterminds behind the scenes?

450
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,040
That's right.

451
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,710
I came to you today for two reasons:

452
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,650
first, to tell you the truth,

453
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,330
and second,

454
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,760
to inform you that if you want to clear your father's name

455
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,040
and avenge Lord Hu,

456
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,200
you must find the person who stole the ledger.

457
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,750
Then, follow the clues to uncover

458
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,040
the true masterminds behind the scenes.

459
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,240
Why should I trust you?

460
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,850
I understand that you may not trust me right now.

461
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,460
Well.

462
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,210
Tomorrow, Lord Chen will host a banquet at the Chang An Restaurant.

463
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,280
You'll understand then.

464
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,240
Whether you believe it or not will be up to you.

465
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,790
Lord Xu, goodbye.

466
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,280
Wait.

467
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,680
Don't let your father down.

468
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:30,040
[Xu's Mansion]

469
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,290
How is it? Is it good?

470
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,800
You came

471
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,900
just to bring me a bowl of noodle soup?

472
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,990
What's wrong? Is one bowl not enough?

473
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,950
I'll buy you another one.

474
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,660
No, that's not it.

475
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,740
What I mean is,

476
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,870
if you have nothing to do here,

477
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,650
don't bother coming over.

478
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,100
I heard Xu Muchen doesn't let you leave the house,

479
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,960
so I came to check if you were okay.

480
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,830
No, I'm fine.

481
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,950
Fine?

482
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,230
I've heard everything.

483
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,180
He doesn't let you leave

484
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,290
and even made you transcribe the Female Virtues.

485
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,300
Is he crazy?

486
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,890
He's just joking with me.

487
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,230
Rong,

488
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,410
why are you joking with him?

489
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,490
Remember,

490
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,380
you married him in someone else's name. You didn't really marry him.

491
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,220
Look at you.

492
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,390
Your face is covered in food.

493
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,950
Here.

494
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,840
Let me help you clean up.

495
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
I can do it myself.

496
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,610
Why do I feel like you're suddenly distancing yourself from me?

497
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,260
Do you have feelings for Xu Muchen?

498
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,490
No.

499
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,340
I've always been like this.

500
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,590
Besides, it's not like I'm not disabled.

501
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,070
I can take care of myself.

502
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,080
Brother.

503
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,510
I brought my sister a bowl of noodle soup.

504
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,460
Honey,

505
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
I bought you delicious food.

506
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,600
You didn't eat enough of it at the last banquet,

507
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
so I specifically bought it for you.

508
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,680
You just got married.

509
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,590
How could you know her taste?

510
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,000

If I were Willow Leaf Thief Liu,

680
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,830
I would...

681
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,650
My hand slipped.

682
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,240
You're awake?

683
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,240
Young Madam,

684
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,970
why are you dressing like this?

685
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,660
I see.

686
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,500
Are you playing some kind of role-playing game,

687
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,090
where one is a heroine from the martial world

688
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,560
and the other is an official from the Zichen Department?

689
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,910
You sure know how to have fun.

690
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,460
I'm going to be late for work.

691
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,630
I'll go on duty now.

692
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,000
The pairing of an official and a thief,

693
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,420
the entanglement of fate,

694
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,820
a bond of a lifetime.

695
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,960
The air is filled with the scent of love.

696
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,950
What are you talking about?

697
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,240
Have you been reading too many storybooks?

698
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,060
Stop it from now on.

699
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,620
Quit it.

700
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:33,080
[Chang An Restaurant]

701
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,950
Today, our restaurant

702
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,410
has already been booked by Lord Chen.

703
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,280
We're closed to the public.

704
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,010
Please come another day.

705
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,400
Okay.

706
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,820
Today is Lord Chen's family banquet.

707
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,230
Many court officials and their families have been invited.

708
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,150
We have to be cautious.

709
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,770
Lord Xu, Mrs. Xu,

710
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,910
Please forgive us.

711
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,460
This way, please.

712
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,130
I've long heard that the dishes here are famous.

713
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,770
Yes.

714
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,200
We must try it later.

715
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,650
Muchen.

716
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,430
Greetings, Uncle Liu.

717
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,450
You're here.

718
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,510
It's really a pleasure to meet you in person.

719
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,830
I've heard about the outstanding and handsome Lord Xu

720
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,660
from the Zichen Department, who has remarkable abilities in solving cases.

721
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,750
Now that I see you,

722
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,270
you are truly a remarkable young man.

723
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,740
You flattered me, sir.

724
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,700
Let me introduce.

725
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,200
This is Chen Ruohong, Lord Chen.

726
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,560
He's an old friend of mine

727
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,420
and a close friend of your father.

728
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,580
Greetings, Uncle Chen.

729
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,680
I remember holding you in my arms

730
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,480
when you were a child in Taizhou.

731
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,910
And this must be the newly-wedded wife of Lord Xu.

732
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,930
I'm Su Jinzhen.

733
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,760
Greetings, Lord Liu, Lord Chen.

734
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,720
Mrs. Xu.

735
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,110
I've long heard that Mrs. Xu is pretty.

736
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,560
Today, meeting you in person, it's indeed true.

737
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,330
Lord Xu,

738
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,750
you're truly fortunate.

739
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,480
By the way,

740
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,170
at the auction later,

741
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,190
Mrs. Xu, please don't compete with me.

742
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,050
Let me buy some of the good stuff too.

743
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,080
Auction?

744
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
You don't know?

745
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,290
Then let me take you to the second floor to take a look.

746
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:08,820
Go.

747
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,440
Let's go.

748
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,430
Muchen,

749
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,040
let them go.

750
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,450
My wife specially had the servants

751
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,040
from various shops in town bring items

752
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,350
from their stores

753
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,290
and set up an exhibition on the second floor

754
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,010
for the ladies to enjoy and purchase,

755
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,920
to prevent them

756
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,270
from feeling bored while sitting with us.

757
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,180
I'll follow your arrangements.

758
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:29,850
Lord Liu,

759
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,500
shall we take our seats?

760
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Okay.

761
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,630
Lord Chen.

762
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,390
-Enjoy.
-Lord Chen.

763
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,990
We're going to have some tea.

764
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,310
Please.

765
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,630
-Please.
-Please.

766
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,390
Lord Chen,

767
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,560
why did you host

768
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,310
such a grand banquet today?

769
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,900
Days ago, when we went out,

770
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,430
we noticed someone secretly following us.

771
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,950
So we decided to cancel our private meeting

772
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,390
and host this grand farewell banquet for Lord Chen.

773
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,630
Firstly, it allows everyone to meet.

774
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,400
Secondly...

775
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,540
Muchen,

776
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,510
I have a favor to ask you.

777
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,170
Please go ahead.

778
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,550
This time, I'm going alone

779
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,470
to Taizhou for my assignment.

780
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,830
It is to investigate the truth

781
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,120
behind your father's case.

782
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,150
It's likely to be dangerous.

783
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,380
I want to entrust the safety of my wife and daughter

784
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,390
to you and Lord Liu.

785
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,120
You're risking for my father.

786
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,350
I will do my best

787
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,590
to help.
