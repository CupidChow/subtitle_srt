4
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,910
You have a good mother.

5
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,710
Take it in.

6
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,830
What's wrong?

7
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,480
Old Madam.

8
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,750
Young Madam has a special constitution

9
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,030
and cannot eat peanuts.

10
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,610
After eating them, she experiences rapid breathing

11
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,020
and develops a rash all over her body.

12
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,400
From now on, you must pay more attention

13
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,510
to the food and drink at home.

14
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,110
Okay.

15
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,470
I'll go prepare the medicine for Young Madam right away.

16
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,950
Okay.

17
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,510
Old Madam,

18
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,990
I'll go with him.

19
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,920
Hurry.

20
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,550
Haven't I instructed the chefs and servants

21
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,390
that peanuts must never

22
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,030
be put in Zhen's meals?

23
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,870
Old Madam,

24
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,750
I have indeed reminded them during this period.

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,910
Every servant and chef in this mansion

26
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,990
knows not to add peanuts.

27
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,210
Yes. There were no peanuts added.

28
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,340
Then what happened?

29
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,950
Get her a cup of water, quickly.

30
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,590
Okay.

31
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,230
Hurry.

32
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,670
Zhen, let me see.

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,330
Are you feeling uncomfortable in this area?

34
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,150
Hurry up.

35
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,950
Have some water.

36
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,470
Here.

37

38

39

My Lord.

40
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,110
Here's the final deployment plan for tonight's

41
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,270
ambush operation at the Liufang Pavilion.

42
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,200
Please take a look and see if there are any omissions.

43
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,590
It looks good.

44
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,550
Okay.

45
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,210
How are Li and his wife?

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,510
How dare you ask?

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,550
She's already lying in bed.

48
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,680
How can they be okay?

49
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,829
No way.

50
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,350
Don't say you understand

51
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,750
women's hearts anymore.

52
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,550
None of your tricks have worked.

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,350
You've ruined

54
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,750
a perfectly good family.

55
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,070
Come on.

56
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,800
Why are you blaming me for this?

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,450
I'm blaming you on behalf of Li.

58
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,070
From now on, focus on your own affairs

59
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,530
and stop giving bad ideas.

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,390
You asked me first.

61
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,380
Drink it while it's hot.

62
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,210
The medicine will be more bitter when it's cold.

63
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,670
Here.

64
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,690
Have a candy, and it won't be bitter anymore.

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,180
Chen bought the crispy cakes, right?

66
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,150
All right, you can leave now.

67
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,970
-Yes, Old Madam.
-Yes, Old Madam.

68
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,320
Since his father passed away,

69
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,320
Chen has become more and more

70
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,850
cold and weird.

71
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,460
He doesn't have many close friends,

72
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,720
and doesn't know how to be kind to others.

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,830
If he did anything wrong,

74
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,090
don't take it to heart.

75
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,950
He meant well.

76
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,800
Chen

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
wasn't like this before.

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,690
But later on,

79
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,550
with the vicissitudes of life,

80
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,390
he has been pushing himself harder and harder,

81
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,750
molding himself

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,390
into a sculpture

83
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,670
devoid of vitality.

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,910
As his mother,

85
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,950
it pains me to see this.

86
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,180
Fortunately, you married into our family.

87
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,150
Since you two got married,

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Chen has been becoming more and more lively and happy.

89
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,790
Ever since you entered our home,

90
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,120
I've admired your cheerful disposition.

91
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,310
Talking to you

92
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,270
always brightens my mood.

93
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,120
Chen feels the same way.

94
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,760
In all these years, it's the first time

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,020
I've seen him care so much about someone.

96
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,909
In the future, please understand Chen,

97
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,390
this emotionally dense man,

98
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,470
and teach him more.

99
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,150
As long as you two

100
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,550
live happily together,

101
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,830
I'll be relieved.

102
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,710
If you give me a grandchild in the future,

103
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,190
I'll be completely content as a mother.

Why are you here?

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,830
You haven't been home for lunch

108
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,150
for several days.

109
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,190
You're an adult now,

110
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,790
yet you always make me worry.

111

112
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,110
it's just a few meals.

113
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,210
Your health is important.

114
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,970
You should have lunch anyway.

115
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,880
Sit down.

116
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,390
These are all your favorite dishes

117
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,470
that I made for you.

118

Eat.

119
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,510
Okay, I'll eat.

By the way,

121
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,710
I've found a few ladies from influential families

122

125

this really isn't urgent.

126
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,870
Why isn't it urgent?

127
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,909

Take a look now.

131
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,510
Mom,

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,110
is this a smudge

133
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,990
accidentally left by the painter,

134
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,120
or does she really have such a big mole?

135
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,470
What do you know?

136
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,190
Having a mole on the nose

137
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,050
brings wealth.

138
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,950
Keep looking.

139
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,560
This one looks a bit familiar to me.

140
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,490
Oh, I remember now.

141
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,310
She looks like the bandit leader

142
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,840
we captured years ago.

143
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,830
She...

144
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,710
She's the daughter of Lord Zhang from the Ministry of War.

145
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,710
It's a perfect match for our family.

146
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,470
If you don't like her,

147

keep looking.

it suddenly occurred to me

152
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,150
that Dad seems to be chatting with Lady Wang,

153
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,350
the widow of Lord Wang, in the backyard.

154

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,840
♫I looked into your eyes and forgot to speak♫

177
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,730
♫Love gradually grows♫

178
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,140
♫I fell in love quietly at this moment♫

179
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,690
♫My cheeks turned red secretly♫

180
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,090
♫The song you played♫

181
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,750
♫Has become what I miss in the twinkling of an eye♫

182
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,880
♫Like flowers in the wind♫

183
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,120
♫Falling down from the sky♫

184
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,080
♫I stayed in my memory♫

185

♫If you were the world♫

186

♫I'd be willing to be the sunset glow♫

187
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,060
♫Turning the sunset into sweet words♫

188

♫I miss you so much♫

♫I'm recalling the years when I had you♫

191
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,040
Young Master Gongyang?

192
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,490
How come you have time to visit our Embroidery House today?

193
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,810
I'm here to pick out some embroidery, of course.

194
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,150
Feel free to choose whatever style you like.

195
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,190
Show him around.

196
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,190
Yes, Miss Qin.

197
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,750
You may leave.

198
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,330
Yes.

199
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,470
Why did you come over?

200
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,490
Feel free to choose.

201
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,730
I'll give you a discount at checkout.

202
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,990
What if I say

203
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,540
I want all of them?

204
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,790
All of them?

205
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,270
Yes, all of them.

206
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,520
My Embroidery House

207
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,590
may not compare to your Gongyang's Mansion,

208
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,230
but it's not just

209
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,960
some insignificant workshop.

210
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,650
If you want all of them,

211
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,340
the cost could buy ten embroiderers back home.

212
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,830
But among those ten embroiderers,

213
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,890
none of them is you.

214
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,110
What's the use of buying them all?

215
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,070
I hear these sweet words

216
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,540
at least ten times a day.

217
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:05,880
This one.

218
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,800
This one.

219
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
And those at the door.

220
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,650
I'll take them all.

221
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,430
How much?

222
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,190
Five thousand taels.

223
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,320
Mumu.

224
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,390
Every man can say sweet words.

225
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,030
But not every man is willing to

226
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,830
invest genuine feelings in you.

227
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,100
Young Master, do you think

228
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,840
that this mere five thousand taels

229
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,440
is all you need to win me over?

230
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,970
Take these embroideries as a gift from me.

231
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,070
The ploy of wealthy young men

232
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,030
spending a fortune to entertain a girl

233
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,110
doesn't work on me.

234
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,910
Come.

235
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,590
Wrap up all these embroideries

236
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,030
and send them to Gongyang's Mansion.

237
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,680
Remember,

238
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,630
these are my gifts to the Young Master.

239
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,550
Yes.

240
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,950
Young Master Gongyang,

241
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,030
I heard that Xu Muchen has been suspended from his duties.

242
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,910
Is it true?

243
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,910
Yes, it's true.

244
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,150
How did you manage that?

245
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,070
Xu Muchen's suspension

246
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,500
has nothing to do with me.

247
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,350
It was because he neglected his duties

248
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,430
while guarding Lord Hu's mansion.

249
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,830
Shouldn't someone like that be suspended?

250
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,640
That's true.

251
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,150
That was why such a horrible incident happened in Lord Hu's mansion.

252
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,920
All the people in the mansion

253
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,340
have lost their lives.

254
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,550
I wonder when this case

255
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,920
will be solved.

256
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,390
There's been some progress in the case.

257
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,200
It's just not appropriate to make it public yet.

258
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,590
If that's the case,

259
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,470
I hope the spirits of the deceased from the Hu family

260
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,410
can rest in peace.

261
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,550
What a kind-hearted girl.

262
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,270
Lord Gongyang,

263
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,190
the things are ready.

264
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,550
We'll deliver them to your mansion now.

265
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,030
According to Gongyang,

266
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,390
there's nothing unusual about Lord Hu's case.

267
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,390
Then why did Master strictly forbid us from investigating this matter?

268
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,380
My Lord.

269
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,310
It's 7 p.m.

270
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,000
Let's go.

271
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,750
Yes.

272
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,960
Did Wu Zhao really say that?

273
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,410
There was no reason for him to lie to me.

274
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,910
Putting a coat on me and adding food

275
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,070
was to appear caring and considerate?

276
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,390
Giving me the sword was to please me?

277
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,870
Hovering around you all the time

278
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,870
is to accompany you.

279
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,990
Sending you crispy cakes

280
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,390
was just to cheer you up.

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,110
So, informing me

282
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,590
of his whereabouts every day

283
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,190
is his way of reporting to me?

284
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,970
This is what a perfect couple is like in the storybooks.

285
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
Don't be too dramatic.

286
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,800
Aren't most couples like this?

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,670
Eat.

288
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,750
What time is it?

289
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,020
Why hasn’t your Young Master come back?

290
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,790
Wu Zhao said

291
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,450
that they have something to do at some Pavilion.

292
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,110
What Pavilion?

293
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,850
It's called...

294
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,710
Liu... something...

295
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,430
Liufang Pavilion?

296
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,760
Yes, Liufang Pavilion.

297
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,270
What's this place?

298
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,800
The name sounds beautiful.

299
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,510
Young Madam.

300
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,510
Where are you going?

301
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,350
You're still sick.

302
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,210
I'm so angry that I recovered now!

Young Master Gongyang,

307
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,750
why are you still here this late?

308
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,980
Mumu, do you dislike me?

309
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,470
Of course.

310
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,760
Because you keep staring at me.

311
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,110
What's there to stare at?

312
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,040
You're pretty.

313

I want to stare at you for a lifetime.

Are you sure it's 7 p.m.?

and expose the forces behind him.

Understood.

327
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,030
Inform the brothers to wait for me outside.

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,560
What's the rush?

346
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,190
Let's drink while waiting.

347
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,050
It will arrive shortly.

348
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,500
Here.

349
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,220
Boss lady,

350
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,550
are you sure this person won't stand us up today?

351
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,910
Don't worry.

352
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,670
What I promised you will definitely happen.

353
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,829
I promise,

354
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,910
before three drinks, the medicine will be here.

355
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,460
Here.

356
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,640
Here, Young Master.

357
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,010
Boss lady.

358
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,030
Boss lady,

359
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,960
the medicine delivery guy is here.

360
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,030
What did I say?

361
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,650
The Butterfly's Love is here.

362
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,390
Here.

363
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,880
I'll go downstairs to get the medicine.

364
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,790
Young Master,

365
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,480
please wait a moment.

366
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,840
Please come back soon.

367
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,360
Reporting everything? Nonsense.

368
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,290
Why didn't you report to me that you came to the brothel?

369
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,320
Senior Brother?

370
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,750
Why is he here?

371
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,470
Is there not a single decent man

372
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,830
in this world?

373
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,430
Mr. Moyan has arrived.

374
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,550
Boss lady,

375
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,110
the goods are here.

376
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,150
Would you like to check them?

377
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,950
No need.

378
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,270
We are familiar with each other. There's no need to check.

379
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,270
I trust you.

380
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,870
It's better to check.

381
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,990
Okay.

382
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,670
Two, four.

383
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,230
The quantity is correct.

384
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,550
Mr. Moyan,

385
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,670
please wait for a moment.

386
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,270
I'll go fetch the bank notes.

387
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,430
It turns out he's selling medicine.

388
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,470
Brothers,

389
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,530
please lend a hand.

390
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,670
Sir,

391
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,870
what can we do for you?

392
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,710
Team Two, surround them head-on!

393
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,390
Yes!

394
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,390
Team One, Team Three, follow me!

395
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,030
Yes!

396
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,490
Xu Muchen!

397
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,360
Good for you, Xu Muchen.

398
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,600
Once again you came to the brothel to have fun.

399
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,680
I must divorce you!

400
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,310
Why are you here?

401
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,910
The Zichen Department is on a case.

402
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,270
What are you doing here in this pleasure house?

403
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,720
So you're aware it's a pleasure house, aren't you?

404
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,920
Then why are you here?

405
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,750
I have work to do here.

406
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,150
What work do you have?

407
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,110
Tell me.

408
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,190
Go back now.

409
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,070
I'll explain to you later.

410
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,910
I'm not going back now.

411
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,370
Explain it to me right now.

412
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,270
Young Madam,

413
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,270
please calm down.

414
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,630
His Lordship and I really are here to investigate a case.

415
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,950
Young Masters,

416
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,740
why are you in such a hurry?

417
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,100
Didn't I tell you to wait for me in the box?

418
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,630
I've brought you the Butterfly's Love.

419
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,360
Young Master Gongyang?

420
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,150
You're awake?

421
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,440
Did I fall asleep just now?

422
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,360
Young Master,

423
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,840
you shouldn't have forced yourself if you can't drink.

424
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,830
I just wanted to have a drink with you,

425
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,030
as a goodbye gesture.

426
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,190
But look what you did.

427
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,470
After just one drink,

428
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,110
you finished the entire jug

429
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,630
and then passed out right on the table.

430
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,910
It startled me.

431
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,870
That was really embarrassing.

432
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,620
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,390
It's alright with me.

434
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,950
However, your brothers

435
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,710
have been waiting for you outside all night.

436
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,370
You should apologize to them.

437
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh no!

438
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,720
My Lord,

439
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,690
the time has passed.

440
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,750
Are we still going?

441
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,470
Let's go.

442
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,070
Yes.

443
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,270
Let's go!

444
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,590
Let go of me!

445
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,390
Stay still!

446
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,430
Let go of me!

447
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,270
Young Master,

448
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,700
why are you doing this?

449
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm Xu Muchen from the Zichen Department.

450
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,160
Zichen Department?

451
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,590
Tell me.

452
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,190
Who made this Butterfly's Love?

453
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,070
Well...

454
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,350
Young Master.

455
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,710
This pill is our signature product.

456
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,150
If I tell you our source,

457
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,590
wouldn't that cut off our revenue stream?

458
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,450
And it'll be awkward for me to see them in the future.

459
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,190
Tell me the truth.

460
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,110
Otherwise, there won't be a future for you.

461
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,380
Where is Her Ladyship?

462
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,510
She saw that we were really investigating,

463
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,590
so she went back on her own.

464
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,800
What should we do next?

465
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Let's go to the Pharmacy.

466
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,350
Let's go to the Pharmacy!

467
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,060
Yes!

468
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,440
[Beautiful and Fascinating]

469
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,350
My business has been ruined

470
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,670
because of them.

471
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,050
[Beautiful and Fascinating]

472
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,560
You're late, Officers.

473
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,150
The girls have already left.

474
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,150
Where is the person who sold you the Butterfly's Love?

475
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,950
Butterfly...

476
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,150
He's left.

477
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,500
Why is even the Ministry of Justice looking for him?

478
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,290
What exactly happened?

479
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,130
Even the Ministry of Justice?

480
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,570
Who else has come looking for him?

481
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,110
Well...

482
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,430
It was the Zichen Department.

483
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,470
Xu Muchen again.

484
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,050
Are you Dr. Moyan?

485
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,630
My Lord, may I have your name?

486
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,960
I'm Xu Muchen from the Zichen Department.

487
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,790
Nice to meet you, Lord Xu.

488
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,680
Gentlemen, what brings you to our shop

489
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,750
at this late hour?

490
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,640
What are you burning there?

491
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,470
Just some useless prescriptions.

492
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,230
Lord Xu, are you interested too?

493
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,830
The Zichen Department is indeed interested in your prescriptions.

494
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,870
But we're not sure if what you're burning

495
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,000
are prescriptions.

496
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,030
Lord Xu.

497
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,320
Our shop has always conducted

498
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,910
legitimate business.

499
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,470
I wonder how we've offended the Zichen Department?

500
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,330
Whether it's legitimate or not is not for you to say.

501
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:01,990
Search!

502
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,310
Yes!

503
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,410
Xu Muchen,

504
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,830
if you don't find anything

505
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,910
-in my shop today,
-Search carefully!

506
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,910
I'll report you to the authorities.

507
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,150
Can the Zichen Department break into private residences at night?

508
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,410
Aren't there any laws constraining you?

509
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:22,990
Search carefully!

510
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,910
-Yes!
-Yes!

511
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,650
I wonder how Senior Brother is doing inside.

512
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,030
My Lord,

513
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,550
we haven't found anything.

514
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,190
My Lord,

515
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,750
we found nothing suspicious.

516
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,270

Senior Brother triggered the alarm before being captured.

and follow the Master to Taizhou.

546
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,390
The Zichen Department is accustomed to using severe torture to extract confessions.

547
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,870
Senior Brother knows no martial arts to defend himself

548

We need to rescue him as soon as possible.

550

Of course, we need to rescue him.

551
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,620
But the method of rescuing him

552
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,950
requires careful consideration

553
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,950
to ensure safety.

554
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,070
The Zichen Department is full of experts,

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,470
and their guard is tight.

556

Their prison is even more heavily guarded.

Acting rashly

558

would be like walking into a trap.

What should we do then?

560
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,590
We need the internal defense layout map of the Zichen Department

561
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,270
as a reference for our actions.

562
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,110
But even with the map,

563
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,150
forcibly storming the prison is the last resort.

564

Their martial arts skills are no joke.

That way, we can rescue Senior Brother.

Then that will be your last day being Mrs. Xu.

573

Then what do you think we should do?

The official uniform of the Ministry of Justice?

575
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,070
The official uniforms of the Ministry of Justice and the Zichen Department

576
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,600
are both custom-made at my embroidery house.

577
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,190
If we pretend to be from the Zichen Department,

578
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,720
we could easily be exposed.

579
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,070
But if we pretend to be from the Ministry of Justice,

580
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,330
the people from the Zichen Department won't recognize us.

581
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,410
As long as the Ministry of Justice causes trouble at the Zichen Department and demands the prisoner,

582
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,800
we can take the opportunity to disguise ourselves as people from the Ministry of Justice

583
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,460
and take Senior Brother away.

584
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,100
It'll be best if this plan works.

585
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,330
But if something goes wrong,

586
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,260
you can pretend to hold me hostage.

587

When I was wandering, I was taken in by my master and learned medicine.

604

After my master passed away, I came to the capital to practice medicine.

605

After saving up enough money, I opened a pharmacy to make a living.

The first time

was on the assassin who killed the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom.

My Pharmacy is for business.

Someone came to sell Canglin, so I bought it.

620

I can't just stand by and do nothing, right?

685
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,950
Nonsense.

686
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,900
I'm the one who treats you the best.

687
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,470
Fine.

688
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,490
You treat me the best in the world.

689
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,310
Please help me.

690
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,390
So you agreed?

691
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,590
Are you going to keep your promise?

692
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,350
Yes.

693
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,510
Miss Qin.

694
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,670
Miss Qin.

695
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,270
-Hello, Miss Qin.
-Miss Qin.

696
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,430
Is she here to deliver clothes to Young Master Gongyang?

697
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,270
Of course.

698
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,280
Young Master Gongyang.

699
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,350
Am I disturbing you?

700
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,990
Mumu?

701
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,400
Mumu,

702
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,760
why are you here?

703
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,990
Pour Miss Qin a cup of tea, quickly.

704
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,510
Yes.

705
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,150
Mumu, have a seat.

706
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,470
I was just delivering clothes to a client,

707
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,590
and coincidentally passed by the Ministry of Justice.

708
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,990
So, I came in to say hello.

709
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,830
Did I disturb your work?

710
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,310
No, not at all.

711
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,390
You can come anytime.

712
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,760
I made this in my spare time.

713
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,790
Young Master, please try it on to see if it fits.

714
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,990
You made it yourself?

715
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,150
How can it not fit?

716
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,800
How do I look?

717
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,030
My Lord, everyone who sees you would say

718
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,760
you're a charming gentleman of the turbid world.

719
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,750
I appreciate

720
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,100
your kindness.

721
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,970
As long as you like it.

722
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,750
Yesterday, I was being stubborn

723
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,950
and insisted you accompany me for a drink.

724
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,810
Did I make you late for something?

725
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,920
You seemed in a hurry when you left.

726
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,700
It doesn't matter.

727
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,470
That Xu was lucky.

728
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,230
Xu?

729
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,470
Is it Xu Muchen from the Zichen Department,

730
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,750
Lord Xu?

731
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,430
You're familiar with him?

732
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,670
Not really.

733
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,760
I've just heard guests mention him frequently.

734
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,300
They say he is good at solving cases,

735
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,449
and solves many major and mysterious cases every year.

736
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,050
If it weren't for his father,

737
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,610
he would have been promoted long ago.

738
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,389
However,

739
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,670
rumors like these should be taken with a grain of salt.

740
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,630
In my heart,

741
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,790
Young Master Gongyang,

742
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,120
you are the one truly young and promising.

743
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,790
One should fulfill the duties in the position.

744
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,920
I only seek to have a clear conscience.

745
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,469
You harbor lofty aspirations.

746
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,639
I have always admired you greatly.

747
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,400
Therefore,

748
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,480
if your plans this time

749
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,409
were disrupted because of me,

750
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,790
how can I be at ease?

751
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,310
Mumu, don't worry.

752
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,989
That Xu Muchen just took advantage of my unpreparedness

753
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,120
to take the criminal away beforehand.

754
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,550
So what?

755
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,920
It's just a mere Zichen Department.

756
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,980
If my Ministry of Justice demands the criminal, would he dare not comply?

757
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,640
Then I can rest assured.

758
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,790
Take the wine. Let's drink together.

759
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,590
We brought you something delicious to eat.

760
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,120
-Thank you, Mrs. Xu.
-Guys.

761
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,990
Come and help.

762
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,230
-Coming.
-Coming.

763
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,630
Hurry up.

764
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,630
Just give it to me.

765
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,830
Hurry and follow up.

766
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,550
Yes.

767
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,540
[Law enforcement]

768
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,310
Come on.

769
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,570
Put the good wine and dishes on the table!

770
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,030
It's our Zichen Department's honour

771
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,150
to have you and Young Madam here.

772
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,710
Honey.

773
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,340
Brother.

774
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,670
Why are you here?

775
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,150
Brother said

776
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,880
he wanted to come by and see you.

777
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,240
I heard from Zhen

778
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,990
that you've been quite occupied with official matters lately.

779
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,590
So I came to offer my regards.

780
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,050
Official matters are indeed keeping me busy.

781
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,580
Regards are not necessary.

782
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,120
That's not the most important.

783
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,750
The main reason is that I heard that in the brothel that day,

784
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,670
the Zichen Department was indeed investigating a case.

785
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,990
So I came specifically to apologize.

786
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,040
These things are all specially prepared for you

787
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,560
and your brothers from the Zichen Department.

788
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,820
I accept your apology.

789
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,310
Gifts aren't necessary.

790
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,160
There are regulations within the department.

791
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,790
What?

792
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,710
Are you trying to embarrass me?

793
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,350
Muchen,

794
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,810
how could you say that?

795
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,190
They came here to see you.

796
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,350
Why don't you accept their kindness?

797
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:15,990
Besides,

798
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,050
we are off duty now.

799
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,950
What are you putting on airs for?

800
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,310
Come, sit down.

801
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,210
Have a seat, brothers.

802
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,450
Have a seat.

803
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,590
Come on, pour the wine.

804
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,550
Let's drink.

805
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,680
What's wrong?

806
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,120
Drinking is strictly prohibited in the Zichen Department.

807
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,550
Lord Xu

808
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,350
is really strict with the rules.

809
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,110
Lord Gu.

810
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,750
Do you think we can drink?

811
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,000
Jinning,

812
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,230
I really want to drink.

813
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,830
But we can't break the rules

814
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,290
of the Zichen Department.

815
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,830
Fine.

816
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,910
Then let's have tea instead of wine.

817
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,710
Is that okay?

818
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,310
Okay, let's have tea instead of wine.

819
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,030
Come on.

820
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,070
Let's have a drink together.

821
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,310
Let's have a drink together.

822
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,190
Here.

823
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,510
Enjoy yourselves.

824
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,130
I'm a bit hungry. I'll have something to eat.

825
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,470
Muchen,

826
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,260
should I toast to you or should you toast to me?

827
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,800
A toast to you.

828
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,410
Lord Gu,

829
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,010
let's have another drink.

830
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,270
Come on.

831
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,550
-Let's have a drink together.
-Cheers.

832
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,610
Come on, everyone.

833
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,390
Come on, guys.

834
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,320
Let's have another drink.

835
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,160
Enjoy.

836
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,270
These tangyuan are quite delicious.

837
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:26,870
Darling,

838
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,350
would you like to try one?

839
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:28,960
Okay.

840
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,680
Why is there wine in it?

841
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,600
Honey!

842
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,750
What's wrong with Young Madam?

843
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,550
What's in it?

844
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,150
Wine?

845
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,670
Who added wine into the tangyuan?

846
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,790
Don't they know my sister can't drink?

847
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,670
What's wrong?

848
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,990
She can't drink.

849
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,230
She can't just keep sleeping with her head on the table.

850
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,030
Xu Muchen,

851
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,040
make some space on the couch.

852
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,570
I'll help my sister inside to rest for a while.

853
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,710
Brother, let me do it.

854
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,420
Be careful.

855
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,670
Slowly.

856
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,710
Keep eating.

857
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,310
It's fine.

858
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,590
My sister is always like this.

859
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,150
Okay.

860
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,820
Don't touch her hair.

861
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,350
Don't touch her hand.

862
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,670
Don't touch her hand.

863
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm afraid you'll wake her up.

864
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,380
Okay.

865
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,910
You...

866
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,810
Why are you touching her shoulder now?

867
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,950
Zhen. Zhen!

868
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,590
Wake up.

869
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,390
How about I take you home to rest?

870
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,230
Jinning,

871
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
after all, she is my wife.

872
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,110
Let her rest here.

873
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,470
When I'm off work,

874
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,930
I'll take her home myself.

875
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,670
Alright.

876
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,070
Let's go out.

877
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,250
Thank you for your help.

878
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,550
Seeing them enjoying the food,

879
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,470
I'm relieved.

880
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,230
I'm leaving.

881
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,950
I'll come to see you again next time.

882
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,470
Okay.

883
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,610
Let me check her again.

884
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,150
Brother.

885
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,470
She is asleep.

886
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,500
Fine. I'm leaving.

887
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,190
Go back first.

888
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,860
I'll take a stroll by myself. Yes, young master.

889
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,090
Yes, Young Master.

890
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,170
[Zichen Department]

891
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,270
I have moved the guards in the courtyard

892
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,670
to the hall.

893
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,200
You can take action at ease.

894
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,800
Thank you, Young Master Su.

895
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,020
No need to thank me.

896
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,950
I owe her this.

897
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,190
Bye.

898
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,550
Brothers,

899
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,550
we usually don't get to eat

900
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,200
such exquisite food.

901
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,190
Eat more.

902
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,730
This is delicious.

903
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,790
Keep eating.

904
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,240
I'll go check the courtyard.

905
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,410
Thank you, Lord Xu.

906
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,810
You're welcome.

907
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,170
Come on, keep eating.

908
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,010
Come on.

909
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,190
Xu Muchen!

910
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,780
Hurry!

911
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,400
He arrived just in time.

912
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,440
Gongyang Maocai,

913
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,110
what brings you here?

914
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,990
Since Lord Xu likes to play dumb,

915
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,390
I'll be straightforward.

916
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,630
Why did you take away the Ministry of Justice's criminal?

917
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,390
The person arrested by our Zichen Department

918
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,450
is naturally a suspect under our jurisdiction.

919
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,390
What does it have to do with the Ministry of Justice?

920
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,070
The suspect Moyan from the Pharmacy

921
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,360
is related to Lord Hu's case

922
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,430
and the envoy of the Nanxiang Kingdom's case.

923
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,310
Both cases concern the country and the Court.

924
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,240
So of course, he should be investigated and tried by the Ministry of Justice.

925
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,820
What right does your mere Zichen Department have to intervene?

926
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,910
But weren't both of these cases

927
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,070
solved by our Zichen Department?

928
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,880
You...
