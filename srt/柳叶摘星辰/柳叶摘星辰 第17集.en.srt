00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,310
Lord Xu, why are you here

6
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,570
instead of healing your wounds at home?

7
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,500
Are you here to confess your crime?

8
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,320
I'm here to tell you that the Zichen Department

will handle the case of Lord Chen.

10

Did I hear it right?

11
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
What's your rank, Xu Muchen?

12
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,600
How dare you come to the Ministry of Justice and ask for a case?

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,880
Lord Chen is innocent.

14

I've found some clues.

15
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,240

Xu Muchen, what do you mean?

18
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,670
You mean I'm incompetent?

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,730
I didn't mean that.

-It's just... -You can leave now.

outside Lord Chen's warehouse

96
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,760
and spill the swill on his wall?

Do you recognize your fingerprint on the title deed?

102
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,710
You spent 100 taels of silver seven days ago

103
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,710
on a house in the suburbs

104
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,590
and saved 150 taels in the bank,

105
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,960
an amount

106
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,590
equal to Lord Chen's annual salary.

107
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,120
How did you get the money?

108
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,590
Anyone who fabricates evidence

109
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,120
and frames a court official

110
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,720
shall be convicted of frame-up according to the law.

111
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,710
Given Lord Chen's post,

112
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,590
the culprit who framed him should be executed.

113

Let me show you the way.

118
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,590
If you testify against the person behind the scenes,

119
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,990
you won't be the culprit.

120
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,720
Besides,

121
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,150
your deeds will be considered as redeeming yourself by good service.

122
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,720
Lord Chen might ask a favor

123
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,050
to spare your life.

124
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,270
Fine.

125
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,440

come to me.

129
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,230
He said he would give me a large sum of money

130
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,950
if I helped him transfer the goods.

131

This is Lord Gongyang.

158
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,950
Sit down.

159
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,940
What's up?

160
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,910
I heard you found

clues to Lord Chen's case.

162
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,110
That's right.

163
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,550
Zhong Aba, Lord Chen's servant,

164
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,750
admitted himself

165
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,990
that he was instigated

166
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,110
to frame Lord Chen.

167
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,370
Where is Zhong Aba?

168
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,230
He died during the interrogation.

169
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,230
He was poisoned.

170

We're still investigating.

171
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,070
In other words, the witness died

172

before the testimony was taken down.

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,750
Are you clear

that the evidence you have now

175
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,750
cannot prove anything?

176
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,800
That means

177
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,510
Lord Chen's case

178
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,470
has been settled.

179
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,350
Lord Xu.

180
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,430
Do you remember

181
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,470
what you promised me?

182
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
If I can't solve the case,

183
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,680
I will be convicted of the same crime as Lord Chen.

184
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,130
Arrest him!

185
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,990
Yes.

186
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,500
-What are you doing? -What are you doing?

187
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,750
Excuse me. Excuse me.

188
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,360
Excuse me.

189
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,630
My Lord.

190
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,870
I found it.

191
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,110
In Yongan Bank,

192
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,870
there was the account statement

193
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,130
of Lord Chen's family.

194
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,390
The owner of this batch of silver

195
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,720
is Moyan from Pharmacy.

196
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,670
The Watermill?

197
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,110
Lord Gongyang.

198
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,990
Although there is a witness,

199
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,870
this case involves the Watermill.

200
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,000
That means Lord Chen

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
can't be convicted soon.

202
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,360
Time for you to leave.

203
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,830
You...

204
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,750
Wu Zhao.

205
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,310
Good job.

206
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,860
My Lord.

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,630
What should we do next?

208
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,140
Keep investigating.

209
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,910
[Peaceful Residence]

210
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,850
Darling.

211
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,310
How is Lord Chen's case?

212
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,560
We still can't prove his innocence due to a lack of evidence.

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,420
How could it be?

214
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,550
Didn't the servant confess his crime?

215
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,200
But he died

216
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
before he signed the testimony.

217
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,990
He was imprisoned in the Zichen Department.

218
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,390
How could he be poisoned?

219
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,710
It was chronic.

220
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,050
Even he himself didn't notice it.

221
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:22,870
The big boss

222
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,510
knew our every move

223
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,190
to the nearest second.

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,350
If the case is settled in two days,

225
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,680
we won't have any chance to save Lord Chen.

226
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,310
There's another way.

227
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,710
Other than the Ministry of Justice,

228
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,190
the Grand Court is also investigating this case.

229
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,920
If we can ask for the transfer of Lord Chen's case,

230
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,310
there might be a chance of survival.

231
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,480
How will it work?

232
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,270
Since Lord Chen was wronged,

233
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,440
there must be something wrong in his file.

234
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,510
If the file can be transferred to the Zichen Department,

235
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,310
I can say there are so many doubts

236
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,750
that the case must be re-investigated.

237
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,280
Then transfer the case now.

238
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,690
But the procedure of the Grand Court is very strict.

239
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,640
It takes at least half a month to transfer a case.

240
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,790
It will be too late.

241
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,680
What should we do now?

242
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,650
Don't panic, darling.

243
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,990
If it doesn't work, I will...

244
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,110
What will you do?

245
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:19,940
Mother.

246
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,990
Mother.

247
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,110
I...

248
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,190
Lord Gu.

249
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,460
Isn't this Young Madam?

250
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,590
It's been a few days since we met last time.

251
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,550
You look much prettier.

252
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,380
Old Madam.

253
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,790
I won't disrupt

254
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,590
your family time.

255
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,110
I have something to deal with in the Department.

256
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,950
I have to go.

257
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,470
Wait, Lord Gu.

258
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,410
You must have something to tell me.

259
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,990
Nothing.

260
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,750
Think about it.

261
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,320
Ah, yeah.

262
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,030
I have something of great importance

263
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,510
to tell you.

264
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,270
The Ministry of War

265
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,910
lost a newly revised map.

266
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,230
They asked us

267
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,350
to cooperate with the Ministry of Justice to investigate the case.

268
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,670
This is serious. Let's go.

269
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,230
Let's go.

270
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,750
Wait.

271
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,910
Tell me

272
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,230
about Lord Chen's case.

273
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,190
Mother.

274
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,220
This is confidential.

275
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,270
I can't tell you.

276
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,230
You can't?

277
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,470
I heard you two

278
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,230
talking about that just now.

279
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,590
It's fine

280
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,080
if you can't tell me.

281
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,110
Zhen.

282
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,130
Tell me what happened.

283
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,960
The Ministry of Justice

284
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,190
has convicted Lord Chen of corruption.

285
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,070
But Muchen thinks...

286
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,750
Honey.

287
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,110
Speaking of which,

288
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,620
the case

289
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,270
was not under the jurisdiction of the Zichen Department initially.

290
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,950
Rather, you asked the Ministry of Justice for it.

291
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,270
I also heard from Lord Gu

292
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,870
that you promised with your life

293
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,230
to the Ministry of Justice in order to investigate this case.

294
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,830
You'll be at the disposal of Gongyang Maocai

295
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,640
if you can't solve the case.

296
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't look at me.

297
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,230
I accidentally spilled the beans.

298
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,590
How could you promise that

299
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,640
to Gongyang Maocai?

300
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,160
If he has something on you,

301
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,270
he will definitely give you a hard time.

302
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,310
Are you crazy?

303
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,870
Mother. Darling.

304
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,770
No need to worry at all.

305
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,360
I'm completely confident.

306
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,270
Don't worry?

307
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,750
Your life is hanging by a thread.

308
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,430
How can I not be worried?

309
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,440
Mother.

310
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,830
I have sufficient evidence

311
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,510
that Lord Chen is wronged.

312
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,390
As the Governor,

313
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,160
I can't sit by and watch.

314
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,340
So what?

315
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,350
Countless people are distancing themselves from the affair.

316
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,430
What's the use of taking the risk

317
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,760
when your word doesn't carry much weight?

318
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,910
I've asked for leave for you from Lord Gu.

319
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,840
From now on, you are not allowed to leave the mansion.

320
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,680
I will ask a favor of Gongyang

321
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,020
for you tomorrow morning.

322
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,510
Mother.

323
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,640
It has been decided.

324
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,070
Zhen.

325
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,270
I'm tired.

326
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,790
Take me back to my room.

327
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,990
Yes, Mother.

328
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,870
Well,

329
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,070
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

330
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,910
Stay here.

331
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,250
Since you're here,

332
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,230
have some tea.

333
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,680
Mother.

334
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,270
I burned some soothing incense.

335
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,220
You may go to bed early.

336
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,150
I'll stay here.

337
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,190
Zhen, thank you.

338
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,900
Mother.

339
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,470
Muchen was impulsive to say that.

340
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,270
The worst-case scenario is he will be discharged from the position.

341
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,090
He is intelligent.

342
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,270
In addition, I can borrow some money from Jinning.

343
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,270
We can live a decent life by running business.

344
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,070
Don't be angry about this.

345
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,430
I hope he could be laid off,

346
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,790
so that he wouldn't get himself into trouble.

347
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,880
At least it will spare both of us

348
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,670
from worries every day.

349
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,230
If he can't investigate this case clearly,

350
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,670
I'm afraid he won't be able to live in peace for the whole life.

351
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,350
Zhen.

352
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,670
There's something you don't understand.

353
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,350
Lord Chen's case is not that simple.

354
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,600
Mother, why do you say so?

355
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,830
Forget it.

356
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,190
Zhen, you may leave now.

357
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,630
Okay.

358

[Memorial Tablet of My Husband, Xu Chengsi]

359
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,540
Madam.

360
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,630
Madam.

361
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,460
Lord Jiang had an accident

362
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,990
and fell down from the cart.

363
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,310
What about the other ministers?

364
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,470
They also went to investigate the case of Chengsi.

365
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,510
Lord Wang was framed

366
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,080
for colluding with the enemy

367
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,319
and was exiled to the border.

368
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,790
Duke Sheng was sent to the Yue State to direct operations.

369
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,550
Now he's trapped in the mountain.

370
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,630
The other ministers are in the same situation.

371
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,680
Madam, we...

372
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,380
Bad news!

373
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,500
Bad news! Bad news!

374
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,400
Bad news!

375
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,270
Old Madam.

376
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,630
Young Master is missing.

377
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,230
Find him.

378
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,390
Hurry up.

379
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,349
-Yes. -Yes.

380
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,150
Madam.

381
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,430
Madam.

382
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,490
Stop it. You are not a good drinker.

383
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,550
It's getting late.

384
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,100
Can you let me go?

385
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,790
Let me go.

386
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,230
Let me go back early.

387
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,430
You did it on purpose.

388
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,510
What do you mean?

389
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,310
You deliberately told my mother

390
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,990
my promise to the Ministry of Justice.

391
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,790
How could that be possible?

392
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,670
How could I?

393
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,510
How could I say that on purpose?

394
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,550
At that time, I was just chatting

395
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,910
with Old Madam.

396
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,470
I accidentally

397
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,990
spilled the beans.

398
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,550
Don't interfere

399
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,330
with Lord Chen's case.

400
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,470
But you know it.

401
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,200
I know it.

402
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,200
Lord Hu lost his life

403
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,550
because of a ledger in Taizhou,

404
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,510
while Lord Chen

405
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,750
was imprisoned right after he took office in Taizhou.

406
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,110
Do these things

407
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,170
have nothing to do with the flood in Taizhou?

408
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,950
I know

409
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,350
you want to save Lord Chen

410
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,480
for dealing with the flood in Taizhou.

411
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,390
Lord Chen's case should be investigated by the Ministry of Justice.

412
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,870
But you volunteered.

413
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,990
Muchen.

414
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,480
Can you stop causing this mess?

415
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,960
Lord Chen and my father are old friends.

416
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,110
How can I just sit by and do nothing?

417
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,910
You are right.

418
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,870
But the Zichen Department is an institute of the government.

419
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,330
It's not at your disposal.

420
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,310
If someone has something on you,

421
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,510
you won't be able to

422
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,870
explain it easily.

423
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,110
How about this?

424
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll return this case

425
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,010
to the Ministry of Justice tomorrow.

426
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,630
Do we stop investigating it?

427
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,070
It's beyond your duty.

428
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,620
Not only you,

429
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,840
but the whole Zichen Department

430
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,900
can't investigate Lord Chen's case.

431
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,600
But this case...

432
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,130
What do you want to say?

433
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,190
You are really stupid.

434
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,000
Think about it.

435
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,770
What else is there besides the flood in Taizhou?

436
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,270
The Moon Star Herb.

437
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,550
You can go to Taizhou to investigate

438
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,630
in the name of the Moon Star Herb.

439
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,990
You can do whatever you want then.

440
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,710
The Zichen Department will fully support you.

441
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,160
Gongyang will have no reason

442
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,660
to interfere.

443
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,990
You are right.

444
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,870
I've offered you the idea.

445
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,730
It depends on you to take actions.

446
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,170
But I'm still grounded.

447
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,470
Grounded?

448
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,360
You want me to

449
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,290
plead for you in front of Old Madam?

450
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,960
No problem.

451
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,870
But I dare not.

452
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,870
Father.

453
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,270
What is this?

454
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,250
Lord Chen's testimony.

455
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,710
I sent someone to copy it for me

456
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,370
from the Ministry of Justice.

457
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,950
Xu Muchen is investigating

458
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,790
Lord Chen's case.

459
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,950
He wants to clear Lord Chen's name before the case is settled.

460
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,990
He needs this.

461
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,230
Besides, Gongyang has a grudge against Xu.

462
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,350
There's not enough time

463
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,510
to go through all the procedures in the Ministry of Justice.

464
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,350
And then?

465
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,370
You need to find a way to put it in Xu's Mansion.

466
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,880
I'll inform the Ministry of Justice.

467
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,040
The Ministry of Justice will search the Xu family.

468
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,630
Xu Muchen will be dismissed and under investigation.

469
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,270
Then I'll ask His Majesty

470
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,110
to grant them a divorce.

471
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,950
All of this will be reasonable.

472
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,690
Do you understand?

473
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,190
I've considered

474
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,800
everything for you.

475
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,310
As for what to do,

476
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,310
it's up to you.

Have you prepared everything I need?

Young Master.

481
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,630
It's done.

OK.

Why did you invite me here?

487
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,830
Nothing.

488
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,510
I prepared some desserts.

489
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,560
Have a try.

490
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,350
Have some.

Tell me which one you like.

493
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,270
I'll ask someone to pack some to your residence.

494
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,870
No need.

495
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,640
I can buy whatever I want.

496
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,390
Although Xu Muchen is not as rich as you,

497
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,830
he can afford desserts.

498
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,230
I heard

499
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,470
he got hurt in Pharmacy.

500
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,870
There was a fire in Pharmacy.

501
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,030
He went there with his men

502
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,350
and fell into the trap of the secret tunnel.

503
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,470
If I hadn't saved him,

504
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,000
he would have been dead now.

505

00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,100
Nothing serious.

Your head was hit?

509
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,470
Don't do

Xu Muchen is not worthy of your care.

512
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,510
Brother, don't say that.

513
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,910

What kind of husband is he?

520
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,310
Do you have feelings for Xu Muchen?

521
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,870
Brother, what are you talking about?

522
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,270
If Master and Senior heard what you said,

523
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,870
they would scold me heavily.

524
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,510
So you admit it?

525
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,320
I didn't. Don't talk nonsense.

526
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,630
I know what you mean.

527
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,280
You really know what I mean?

528
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,270
Yes.

529
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,230
You are my brother.

530
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,230
You care about me.

531
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,270
Yes, I'm your brother.

532
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:46,990
Rong.

533
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,150
I have something to do today.

534
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,190
I gotta go.

535
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,830
Which one do you like?

536
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,530
I'll ask someone to pack some to your residence.

537
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,850
By the way, Rong,

538
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,470
I was given some toys made in the neighboring country.

539
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,400
I can tell they are what girls like.

540
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,590
They are in the back room.

541
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,310
Go pick one.

542
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,370
Take what you like.

543
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,870
Okay, thank you.

544
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,640
Here you are.

545
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,310
Miss.

546
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,430
Young Master said

547
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,030
you could pick anything you liked on the table.

548
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,590
Why is there a logo of the Watermill?

549
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,040
Miss.

550
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,520
Have you found the one you like?

551
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,790
I like them all.

552
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,990
Wrap them up

553
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,550
and send them to my residence.

554
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,550
Yes, My Ladyship.

555
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:32,720
[Zichen Department]

556
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,310
Brother Chen was wrongfully imprisoned

557
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,430
before he set off to Taizhou.

558
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,230
There must be a backstage manipulator.

559
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,670
It seems that the manipulator

560
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,830
pertaining to the flood case

561
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,350
has done more than corruption.

562
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,430
Uncle Liu.

563
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,910
An initial investigation of Uncle Chen's case

564
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,000
has been carried out by the Zichen Department.

565
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,130
Please don't worry.

566
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,680
Although Uncle Chen is in custody,

567
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,950
he's safe now.

568
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,590
Lord Chen shouldn't have suffered.

569
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,530
I also found some clues

570
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,670
to the case of Hei Limao.

571
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,070
Hei Limao didn't get along well

572
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,080
with his younger brother at all.

573
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,880
Hei Limao even sold out his younger brother to the government

574
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
to protect himself.

575
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,600
So I think that suicide note

576
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,370
must be a misleading clue by the backstage manipulator.

577
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,350
I found this letter

578
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,810
in Hei Limao's residence.

579
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,130
[Kill all the corrupt officials in the world. I'd die without anything to regret after I avenge my brother's death.]

580
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,790
In that case,

581
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,350
the backstage manipulator forced Hei Limao to die

582
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,270
to cover up his evil purpose.

583
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,630
So the key to this case

584
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,750
is Lord Hu's ledger.

585
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,440
I have a guess about the ledger.

586
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,740
I'll let you know if there's news.

587
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,990
The flood

588
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,070
was the trigger of

589
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,010
both the cases of the Hu family and Lord Chen.

590
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,950
The person behind it is getting more and more unscrupulous.

591
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,000
You must be careful.

592
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,110
Don't let the evildoer take advantage of you.

593
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,630
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

594
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,990
I'll be careful.

595
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,430
I will find out the truth

596
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,400
and bring the culprit to justice.

597
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,630
[Xu's Mansion]

598
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,070
Why is there nothing

599
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,670
on the scroll Master gave me?

600
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,710
Who are you?

601
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,710
This is Xu's Mansion.

602
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,630
You can't enter without permission.

603
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,750
He Wei, stop!

604
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,430
The Ministry of Justice is ordered to search here.

605
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,190
Move!

606
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,590
How can the Ministry of Justice hit people?

607
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,310
Apologize!

608
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,310
Wu Zhao.

609
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,910
Wu Zhao, forget it.

610
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,170
Don't make trouble for Young Master.

611
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,470
Apologize!

612
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,040
What if I say no?

613
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,910
Wu Zhao.

614
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,440
As a constable of Zichen Department,

615
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,500
how dare you stop the investigation?

616
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,670
Xiao Qiu, step back!

617
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,430
Wu Zhao.

618
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,470
What happened?

619
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,190
Officials from the Ministry of Justice wanted to search the mansion.

620
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,520
They even hurt Xiao Qiu.

621
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,250
Take Xiao Qiu back to the mansion.

622
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:56,830
My Lord.

623
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,400
Go back.

624
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,590
I don't know why you

625
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,670
broke into my residence at night

626
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,790
and hurt my maid.

627
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,630
Lord Xu.

628
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,060
The Ministry of Justice received a tip-off

629
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,430
that Lord Xu might have something to do

630
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,240
with the missing map of the Ministry of War.

631
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,520
Under the order of the higher-ups,

632
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,310
we are here to search your mansion.

633
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,110
How dare you search my residence

634
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,510
without any solid evidence?

635
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,680
Is this how the Ministry of Justice works?

636
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,550
Xu Muchen.

637
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,540
The Ministry of Justice is searching for the missing map.

638
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,230
Anyone who stands in the way

639
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,670
will be considered as a suspect.

640
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,870
You'd better be sensible.

641
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,870
Do you have an order?

642
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,700
I wonder where the Ministry of Justice got the tip-off.

643
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,830
It's confidential.

644
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,630
Since you have the order,

645
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,310
I dare not disobey.

646
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,870
But you hurt my maid.

647
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,270
I will go to the Ministry of Justice to ask for an explanation.

648
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,430
If Lord Xu

649
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,840
has nothing to do with the missing map,

650
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,550
it's up to you

651
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,470
to go to the Ministry of Justice or not.

652
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,510
But if we find any clue here,

653
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,910
Lord Xu,

654
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,400
you have no choice but to go with us.

655
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,110
Search!

656
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,280
Yes.

657
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,430
Chen.

658
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,250
Search carefully!

659
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,120
Mother.

660
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,870
Chen.

661
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,070
What happened?

662
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:50,990
Nothing.

663
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,790
They probably got a wrong tip-off

664
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,350
so they're here for a routine check.

665
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,750
I'll ask them to speed up.

666
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,120
Darling.

667
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,750
They kept mentioning a map.

668
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,030
What is it?

669
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,590
It is a map drawn by every municipal government.

670
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,920
It is necessary for military operations.

671
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,790
The map is usually kept by the Ministry of War.

672
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,840
Even three Councilors are not allowed to see it.

673
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,970
Anyone who steals it

674
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,000
will be executed according to the law.

675
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,430
Who will be that crazy

676
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,950
to steal such an important thing?

677
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,190
The map is priceless and not tradable.

678
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,350
Ordinary gangs won't want it.

679
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,110
I guess it was not a thief

680
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,260
but a foreign spy who stole it.

681
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,830
My Lord.

682
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,730
My Lord, we found this.

683
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,390
Xu Muchen.

684
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,960
What is this?

685
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,870
I don't know.

686
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,750
This doesn't belong to me.

687
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:07,990
Guards!

688
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,190
My Lord.

689
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,670
This is silverstone powder

It's a box in the Duke's Mansion

727
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,910
There was a logo of the Watermill on it

728
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,510
and a blank scroll inside.

729
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,550
I thought it was a new task from Master,

730
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,520
so I took it back.

731
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,430
But why did the Ministry of Justice

732
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,030
come to search Xu's Mansion?

733
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,780
And how could they know that the blank scroll

734
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,640
was the map of the Jing Dynasty drawn in a secret way?

735
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,760
The map is related to the spy of Yue.

736
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,470

So you think

739
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,760
Xu Muchen was framed by the Watermill?

740
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,650
I dare not to doubt that.

741
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,990
I'm sure the Watermill won't collude with the Yue State.

742
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,470
There's no reason for the Watermill to frame Xu Muchen.

00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,070
How is it?

863
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,770
I asked His Majesty for his grace.

864
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,950
Come with me to the prison of the Ministry of Justice tomorrow morning

865
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,950
to visit Muchen.

866
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,870
[Ministry of Justice]

867
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,950
Has Xu Muchen confessed?

868
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,750
He has been severely punished.

869
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,470
It might be hard for him to recover if the punishment continues.

870
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,750
We can't afford

871
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,200
if anything happens.

872
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,000
He's indeed tough.

873
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,070
My Lord.

874
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,760
My Lord.

875
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,870
We have arrested the spy from Yue who sneaked into our country.

876
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,870
Is he still alive?

877
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,470
Yes.

878
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,280
The spy wanted to take poison

879
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,230
but we stopped him.

880
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:53,870
Good job.

881
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,950
Where is he now?

882
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,280
He's in prison.

883
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,910
Xu Muchen is not willing to confess, right?

884
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,910
Let's see if his accomplice can endure the punishment.

885
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,470
Let's go.

886
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,430
Let's interrogate that spy now.
