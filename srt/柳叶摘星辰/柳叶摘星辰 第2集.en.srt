Xu Muchen, that bastard,

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,560
pretended to be sick during the ceremony

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,060
and even despised me.

besides getting married in place of Su Jinzhen,

11
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,500
there is a more important task for you.

12
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,750
What important task is it?

13
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,180
You need to get close to Xu Muchen

14
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,740
and wait for a chance to steal the jade pendant.

15
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,960
After finishing this task,

16

I'll try to help you escape unscathed.

17
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,320
Just remember that

18
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,710
all the members of the Watermill

19

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,750
Since it's something so important,

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
if it is not in this room,

26
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,329
it should be with him.

27
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,910
It's with him.

28
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,950

It's time for you to lift the veil.

39
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,670
After I lift the veil, I'll tell you that

Why did he stop?

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,660
Just lift the veil now.

After I lift the veil, the ceremony will be completed.

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,930
The jade pendant is with him.

53

Are you still angry about what happened that day?

56
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,070
Any girl would get angry if someone

57
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,990
barges into her room.

58
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,950
I just felt so embarrassed that I got angry.

59

But now,

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,140
Is the jade pendant hidden in the study room?

345
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,900
Mother.

346
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,450
I'll go serve my husband first.

Why do you care about him?

Just enjoy your meal.

350
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,750
I've just married him.

351
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,080
It's my duty to serve him.

352
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,210
I'll get going then.

353
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,230
I was thinking that

354
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,200

a hard time.

358
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,310
It seems that I've worried too much.

359
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,000
Yes.

360

I think Young Madam is a good person.

361

But Young Master

362
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,730
is a bit inflexible.

363
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,200
Your Young Master is not someone you can count on now.

364
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,790
From now on,

365

Yes, Your Ladyship.

What's the matter?

I'm here to serve you while you're going out.

369

Don't bother, Miss Su.

370
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
Is there anything extraordinary about him?

371
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,330
When I get the jade pendant,

372
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,530
just see how I'll teach you a lesson, Xu.

373

How come it isn't in the study room, either?

I want to clean this room.

You don't have to clean this room.

I clean this place every day.

Well...

380

I'm sorry, Young Madam.

385

I'll be more careful next time.

386
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,310
And the part inside it, too.

please don't tell Old Madam about it.

Okay.

No, Young Madam.

I asked him to wash it.

I asked him to wash it. So what?

412
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,530
You asked him to wash it?

413

You know what?

432

Old Madam likes eating sweet food the most.

433
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,590
But Young Master doesn't allow her to eat it.

434
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,870
He said it's bad for her health

435
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,870
as she's old now,

436
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,150
so she secretly hid a big box of mille-feuille

437

under her bed behind Young Master's back.

Even Ms. Xiao Dong doesn't know about this.

Don't tell others about it.

We'll be sisters from now on.

446
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,570
By the way, Xiao Qiu,

447
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,480
have you served my mother-in-law

448
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,670
by her side all the time previously?

449
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,240
Yes.

450
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,330
Ms. Xiao Dong is the leading maid.

451
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,270
She's in charge of everything in the mansion.

452
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,670
I'm the one serving Young Master

453
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,510
and Old Madam.

454
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,520
For all these years, is there any treasure

455
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,120
which my mother-in-law has cherished so much?

456
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,230
For example,

457
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,120
something like a jade pendant.

458
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,290
Old Madam likes hairpins the most.

459
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,950
It's rare to see her wear a jade pendant.

460
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,820
The only mutton-fat jade pendant she has

461
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,950
is very ordinary.

462
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,190
It's not a treasure.

463
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,540
My master didn't say whether it was good jade or not.

464
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,270
I might as well investigate it.

465
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,220
I've heard that

466
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,260
the old Mrs. Xu used to be a princess,

467
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,750
so Xu's Mansion used to be an imperial residence.

468
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,550
Can you show me around?

469
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,740
No problem.

470
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,560
Just tell me where you want to go.

471
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,810
Is there any mysterious place in Xu's Mansion,

472
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,010
which they don't allow others to enter?

473
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,210
A mysterious place?

474
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,950
Isn't that the description in a storybook?

475
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,470
The more mysterious a place is, the more likely it is to have treasures.

476
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,080
Things like elixirs

477
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,050
and secret martial arts books are all hidden inside.

478
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,160
As Xu's Mansion used to be an imperial residence,

479
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,560
do you think there is any secret mechanism here?

480
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,550
Mechanism?

481
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,700
I know.

482
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,670
It's the ancestral hall.

483
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,440
The ancestral hall?

484
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,080
Yes.

485
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,840
The ancestral hall in Xu's Mansion

486
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,540
is cleaned by Young Master himself.

487
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,470
Normally, other people are not allowed to go inside.

488
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,110
Then take me there to have a look.

489
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,030
No.

490
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,750
If Old Madam and Young Master find out about it,

491
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,270
they will punish me.

492
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,390
Ms. Xiao Dong once accidentally went into the ancestral hall when she was a child,

493
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,730
which made Old Madam so angry.

494
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,190
She was locked in the ancestral hall for a whole night as the punishment.

495
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,470
When she came out...

496
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,770
That place is hidden so deeply.

497
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,480
The jade pendant must be there.

498
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,090
What happened when she came out?

499
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,540
She was starving when she came out.

500
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,350
Old Madam felt so worried about her that

501
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,990
she cooked noodles for her personally.

502
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,790
Don't worry.

503
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,000
If we get caught,

504
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,290
I won't let you starve.

505
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,540
This way.

Today,

683
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,750
I didn't find the jade pendant,

684
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,230
but I'm quite exhausted instead.

687
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,150
It looks like he really loves his father,

688
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,680
who was a corrupt official.

689
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,550
Why is it different from what my master has described?

690
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,760
Didn't you treat the wound on your hand?

691
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:29,860
I'm fine.

692
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,250
Let me get you some medicine.

693

694
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,950
Do you need me to apply the medicine to your wound?

695
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,950
Just give it to me.

696
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,390
How come you know where the medicine is?

697
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,110
I...

698
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,140
-I...
-Thank you

699
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,080
for your help today.

700
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,610
Darling, you don't need to thank me.

701
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,420
This is what I should do.

702
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,310
Wait a moment.

703
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,670
I'll get you some water.

704
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,520
It was my fault for treating you violently today.

705
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,010
Actually, it was also my fault.

706
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,070
I shouldn't have

707
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,710
worshiped the ancestors

708
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,170
without your permission.

709
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,640
Yesterday, I already told you that

710
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,980
we were not a good match.

711
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,780
Why don't we get divorced as soon as possible?

712
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,290
No.
