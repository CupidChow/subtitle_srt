Did you see the photos?

8
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,827
You punk. What are you playing at?

9
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,373
What do you think?
I'm trying to arrest you all.

10
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,668
-Sun-ho, hurry up!
-Okay.

The money that people use
to bet on this site

13
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,488
is all saved as cryptocurrency.

14
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,198

Yu Dong-man, you punk!

18
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,528
Shut your mouth and listen to me.

19
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,283
If you mess with my students again,

20
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,037
I'm going to chase you
to the ends of the earth to catch you.

21
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,297
I was the one who told them to do it.

22
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,926
So that I could catch the criminal
hiding in our school.

23
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,058
So talk with me from now on

24
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,936
instead of them.

25
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,623
Care to elaborate?

26
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,958
To catch who?

27
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,629
Can you take responsibility

28
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,465
for what you just said, Professor Yu?

29
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,384
They're right.

30
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,179
Shouldn't you explain what's going on

31
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,724
so that everyone here can understand?

32
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,650
Professor Yu Dong-man.

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,168
We caught the culprit who was on the run,

34
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,254
Professor Yu.

35
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,507
"Culprit"?

36
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,467
Correct.

37
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,387
The culprit
who ran the illegal gambling ring,

38
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,681
hurt Professor Yu Dong-man,

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,394
and broke into the Police University.

40
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,355
What are you talking about?

41
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,694
LEDGER

42
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,491
Jang, a man in his thirties
who had been wanted

43
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,285
for running an illegal gambling website,

44
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,580
was arrested at the Police University
in Asan on the night of the seventh.

45
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,290
Your name?

46
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,834
After eluding the police dragnet
for over two months,

47
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,919
Jang broke into the Police University

48
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,963
-to steal firearms for his escape,
-Answer me!

49
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:43,092
but he was caught by students
who happened to be at school at the time.

50
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,553
Right. I have faith in you

51
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,555
that you will stop
any news coverage on it.

52
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,144
The police will investigate Jang
to find out

53
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,646
if he had an accomplice helping him

54
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,816
and focus on investigating
the illegal gambling site case

55
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,860
which still remains unsolved.

56
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,573
This illegal gambling site evaded
the police dragnet for years,

57
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,868
and Jang was
at the center of its operation.

58
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,873
The students at the Police University

59
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,626
finally caught him
after being on the run for months.

Im Hyeon-seok, KCS News.

66
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,587
Okay! This is going on the air!

67
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,592
Okay, my foot.

68
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,304
You have to kill this.

69
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,973
Sir.

70
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,309
The police called
and said they wanted to bury this.

71
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,521
We've agreed to their request,
so go bring something else.

72
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,107
If things get awkward,
your junior colleagues

73
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,068
won't be able to cover anything
that requires the police's help.

74
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,654
-Still, we must reveal the truth…
-Seriously!

75
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,615
Go start your own channel
if you want to do as you please.

76
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,908
Hand in your resignation.

77
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,469
What can you do?
Both you and I must obey our higher-ups.

78
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,221
Just let it go, Reporter Im.
I'll call you again later.

79
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,227
Goodness. Looks like Han Jeong-sik

80
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,063
is very anxious right now.

Gosh, what's taking him so long?

83
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,726
What? Are you going to apologize again?

84
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,231
That's all you've been doing
since last night.

85
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,484
You guys

86
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,028
got involved in the case because of me.

87
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,030
And you got punished too.

88
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,533
Of course, we should be punished.

89
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,577
Regardless of catching the culprit,

90
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,496
we broke the student rules.

91
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,749
But thanks to Professor Yu,

92
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,168
we didn't get expelled.

93
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,964
It'll be fine as long as
we don't cause any more trouble.

94
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,008
And you'll be off suspension too.

95
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,470
Right?

96
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,683
Of course.

97
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,397
We have the ledger and the evidence too.

98
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,525
I'm sure Professor Yu
will find the real culprit soon,

99
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,236
and I'll only need to assist him
until then.

100
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,449
I won't do anything to make you worry.

101
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,742
I promise.

102
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,454
You're finally saying
what I've been wanting to hear.

103
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,209
If you get into trouble again,
I'll never see you again.

104
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,879
-Okay.
-I mean it.

105
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,881
Bear that in mind.

106
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,634
Okay, I will.

107
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,557
Oh, right. The guys can't come
because they're cleaning.

108
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,936
Beom-tae and Joon-wuk
will hold out well, won't they?

109
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,064
They might look soft,
but they're quite tough.

110
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,944
Gosh.

111
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,830
I was the bad one.

112
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,249
Actually, when I heard

113
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,544
Sun-ho would be the only one
getting suspended from school,

114
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,962
I was kind of relieved.

115
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,924
I took three years
to get into this school,

116
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,510
and my life will be ruined
if I get expelled.

117
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,138
I suddenly got anxious

118
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,182
about getting that many penalty points.

119
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,354
I shouldn't have had those bad thoughts.
Poor Sun-ho.

120
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,274
You punk. They're not bad thoughts at all.

121
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,026
Come here.

122
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,028
-Come on.
-Gosh.

123
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,200
Don't you know him?

124
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,870
He'll come back to school
as if nothing happened.

125
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,706
-Right?
-Yes.

126
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,124
He will, right?

127
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,132
What are you guys doing?

128
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,139
You guys acted up,
thinking you're already in the force.

129
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,140
It serves you right.

130
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,684
By the way,

131
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,813
didn't Kang Sun-ho get expelled yet?

132
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,108
Oh, well.
He already got 150 penalty points.

133
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,403
He'll get expelled
once someone reports him.

134
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:36,946
Hey, Cha Seong-su!

135
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,141
They committed assault during probation,

136
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,435
so we must report them
to the guidance director.

137
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,146
-What? Assault?
-It is assault.

138
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,022
An assault of water.

139
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,318
-Min-guk!
-Hey, stop it already.

140
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,237
He probably did it by mistake.

141
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,905
It wasn't a mistake.

142
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,242
Noh Beom-tae, that jerk, shot water on me.

143
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,996
You punk. Just let it slide.
It's embarrassing.

144
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,708
Is the school jinxed or something?

145
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,710
Bad things keep happening.

146
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,170
Shouldn't we perform an exorcism?

147
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,921
I know, right?

148
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,885
Go away, water demon!

149
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,219
Tae-jin!

150
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,387
Calm down.

151
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,432
-Goodness.
-Gosh, this is frustrating.

152
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,376
I guess we'll be investigating the case
by ourselves again.

153
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,546
Of course!

154
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,216
Hey, Han Jeong-sik's name

155
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,926
is all over the ledger.

156
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,636
Even if we hand the ledger
over to the police,

157
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,555
it'll only benefit Chief Han.

158
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,848
Why would I do that?

159
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,351
I'm glad I got suspended from school.

160
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,731
-Let's go inside.
-All right.

161
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,777
Why is it so heavy?

162
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,404
You're not even feeling well.
Give it back.

163
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,408
-It's fine.
-Come on.

164
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,413
There was nothing in there?

165
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,541
Yes.

166
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,628
There wasn't anything particular
when Jang Jae-gyu was arrested.

167
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,674
We even searched his house,
but we didn't find anything.

168
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,680
Can I get going now? I'm quite busy.

169
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,977
Wait.

170
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,856
When you failed to catch Jang Jae-gyu
at the internet cafe,

171
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,777
didn't you say he had a facilitator?

172
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,419
Professor Yu, take a look at this.

173
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,591
When they paid the high-rank officers,

174
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,552
it seems like they paid them
in cash and goods.

175
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,389
Han Jeong-sik received goods
most of the time,

176
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,100
but since two years ago,
the amount has increased dramatically.

177
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,147
Also, there's someone who gets paid
more than Han Jeong-sik.

178
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,025
It's someone called Joo Jae-il.

179
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,027
He's the only one
whose affiliation isn't written.

180
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,655
JOO JAE-IL

181
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,741
I think we need to look
into that person too.

182
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,412
So these are the jerks who took bribes?

183
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,581
Through whom?

184
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,750
Through the foundation?

185
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,585
Yes.

186
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,880
Did you look into Zelkova Tree Foundation?

187
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:28,302
I did. They pay the legal expenses
of police officers who get sued,

188
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,681
and they also provide hospital bills
when police officers get injured.

189
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,141
But that's just a pretext.

190
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,064
It's a paper company they made
to bribe the officers.

191
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,399
The names of the executives are people
who have no families.

192
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,528
But why did they choose
to use a foundation?

193
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,864
What do you mean?

194
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,118
I mean, if they wanted to launder money
or bribe the officers,

195
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,288
there's no reason
to establish a foundation.

196
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,916
Reason? Listen.

197
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,210
That's not what's important here.

198
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,257
Those damn jerks ran
an illegal gambling ring,

199
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,844
and their ringleader hasn't been caught.
That's what's important.

200
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,181
I know, but…

201
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,604
What about the account
they used to withdraw money?

202
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,608
It looks like they kept changing
the account to avoid getting caught.

203
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,944
Kim Ik-gu, Seo Min-u, and Lee Ju-won.

204
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,322
I think they used fake names
to make an account.

205
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,908
Wait. Who?

206
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,785
Kim Ik-gu, Seo Min-u, and Lee Ju-won.

207
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,122
Lee Ju-won?

208
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,958
Professor Choi Hee-su.

209
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,003
I saw you with her a while ago.

210
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,963
She was the wife of one of my colleagues.

211
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,841
He was Inspector Lee Ju-won.

212
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,384
He was an officer. Didn't you know?

213
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,011
REMEMBRANCE OF POLICE OFFICERS
WHO DIED ON DUTY

214
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,310
What is it? Do you know him?

215
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,146
It's Choi Hee-su again.

216
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,897
Sorry?

217
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,945
Where are you going?

218
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,825
I should meet the prime suspect first.

219
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,012
-You're going to the school, right?
-Yes.

220
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,685
Hey, Beom-tae.

221
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,146
Why did they come without calling?

222
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,194
Hang on, Beom-tae.

223
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,370
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,540
Hey, take Dong-man.

225
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,878
-Captain!
-Professor Yu.

226
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,482
Hey, Detective Joo!

227
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,902
Mr. Kang Sun-ho.

228
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,695
It's 10:17 p.m., September 9th.

229
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,489
You're under arrest without a warrant
for helping a culprit escape

230
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,907
and violating
the Information and Communications Act.

231
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,283
You have the right to an attorney,

232
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,993
and you may refuse to give
an incriminating statement.

233
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,080
You may request the court
to review the legality of this arrest.

234
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,128
What are you doing?

235
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,943
What are you talking about?

236
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,780
Tell me what it is.
What are you talking about?

237
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,449
He was on the phone with me.

238
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,828
They arrested him without a warrant and…

239
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,337
This is driving me crazy.

240
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,383
You let me go and distracted
the police from chasing me.

241
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,802
Don't you remember?

242
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,515
Jeto Internet Cafe in Asan.

243
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,226
The police were there
but went back without anything.

244
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,644
That was all because of him.

245
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,605
He hacked

246
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,815
and opened the emergency exit.

247
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,735
And that's how I got away.

248
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,905
How many times
have I told you this politely?

249
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,785
I get it, so shut your mouth, okay?

250
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,707
Mr. Kang Sun-ho.

251
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,753
Is Mr. Jang Jae-gyu's statement all true?

252
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,091
On Thursday, September 2nd, 2021.

253
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,385
Around 10:30 p.m.

254
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,263
Where were you, and what were you doing?

255
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,062
He's pleading the Fifth.

256
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,736
Hey, Yu Dong-man!

257
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,488
-Get a hold of yourself!
-Let me go!

258
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,614
Gosh, wait.

259
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,950
Just hold your temper, you punk.

260
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,912
Let's be rational
like intellectuals, okay?

261
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,914
All right.

262
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,999
-Gosh.
-Goodness!

263
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,711
Hey! Yu Dong-man!

264
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,089
My gosh.

265
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,468
I told you that I'd take care of it.

266
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,684
I need to find a way to get away too.

267
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,477
Just…

268
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,481
stay in school.

269
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,733
Just like you always do.

270
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,367
Darn it.

271
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,667
I told you.

272
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,087
If you mess up with my students,
I'll chase you to the ends of the earth.

273
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,884
Gosh, you punk. You're really insane.

274
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,096
How can a senior inspector grab
a chief by the collar?

275
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,057
Who's the chief here?

276
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,186
All I see is a criminal
who's been getting bribes

277
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,855
from the illegal gambling ring!

278
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,774
Bribes?

279
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,569
Who says it's a bribe?

280
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,239
All I did was accept the donation money

281
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,242
to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

282
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,079
I have no idea how they got that money.

283
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,043
I've been doing my duty
for the common good.

284
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,504
You shouldn't be doing this to me.

285
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
Gosh, you crazy punk!

286
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,260
Yu Dong-man.

287
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,139
Bring me the ledger
if you want to save Kang Sun-ho.

288
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,726
-Hey, Dong-man!
-You scumbag!

289
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,102
Take him away!

290
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,647
-Take him out already!
-Take him out.

291
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,982
-Let go of me!
-Gosh.

292
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,568
Let go of me! Gosh!

293
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,540
Did you ask me for a pass?

294
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,503
Yes. Please, ma'am.

295
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,506
Ms. Oh Kang-hui.

296
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,717
Aren't you on probation now?

297
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,261
During this period, you're not allowed

298
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,140
to go out or sleep out.
I'm sure you're aware of this.

299
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,142
I'm well aware of it.

300
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,604
I'm glad to hear that. Now leave.

301
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,816
I will clean up the rest when I'm back.

302
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,527
I'll do the cleaning and training
for today when I'm back.

303
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,403
I will finish them
even if I have to stay up all night.

304
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,240
-So please just for once--
-Your probation period started yesterday,

305
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,701
so it's not acceptable.
I will never accept that,

306
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,829
so just take that and leave now.

307
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,333
What are you doing? I told you to leave!

308
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,838
Please give her a pass, Guidance Director.

309
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,216
Professor Seo!

310
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,595
She seems to have an urgent matter.

311
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,972
We should let her go.

312
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,477
They won't stop no matter what we do,
you know.

313
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,034
Yu Dong-man.

314
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,663
Bring me the ledger
if you want to save Kang Sun-ho.

315
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,211
Damn it!

316
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,922
Hey, I know you're upset and all.

317
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,674
But Jang Jae-gyu keeps insisting

318
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,051
that Kang Sun-ho helped him escape.

319
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,888
So we needed to arrest him.

320
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,100
We didn't get the warrant yet.

321
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,812
So don't get worked up, okay?

322
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,191
I'm his guardian,

323
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,735
so don't call his father for now.

324
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,445
All right.

325
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,575
You punk. What's up with your gaze again?

326
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,913
I will put all of them behind bars
no matter what,

327
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,374
so just keep him here, okay?

328
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,418
That could be safer for him.

329
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,420
What are you talking about?

330
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:08,256
You punk, come here. Come back here!

331
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,263
What?

332
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,765
Captain.

333
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,309
Let me see him.

334
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,117
Is this situation funny to you?

335
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,831
It reminded me of the time

336
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,711
when you and I first met.

337
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,133
I guess…

338
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,388
I haven't changed at all since then.

339
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,984
Hey. You've changed.

340
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,698
You're not as nice as you were back then.

341
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,199
You've become disrespectful.

342
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,119
You act all smart,
just because you learned some stuff.

343
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,371
And you never listen to me.

344
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,166
You think you haven't changed?
You've changed a lot, you punk.

345
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,341
All you did

346
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,303
was try to catch the bad guys
who even tried to kill someone.

347
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,640
But things ended up getting messy.

348
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,604
So there's no need to come up
with excuses or thoughts for it, got it?

349
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,576
I'll be back.

350
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,245
Ask them to order
a large bowl of ox head rice soup.

351
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,917
Sit straight and be yourself.

352
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,253
Okay.

353
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,682
INTERROGATION ROOM

354
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,061
It's him, right?

355
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,397
The guy in the report
you asked me to get at the hospital.

356
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:38,531
Well, I feel like I've said this
to you so many times,

357
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,618
-but Detective Joo--
-Gosh, seriously.

358
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,330
What is it? What now?

359
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,257
Where is Dong-man?

360
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,135
He left just now after making
a bunch of photocopies.

361
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,847
Goodness. He's not in his right mind now.

362
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,642
What a mess. This is crazy.

363
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,810
I know.

364
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,527
Where did it go?

365
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,323
My goodness.

366
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,785
My new car keys.

367
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,745
Where did it go?

368
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,167
Yu Dong-man, this jerk!

369
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,044
Yu Dong-man!

370
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,302
Where are you now?

371
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,680
PROFESSOR CHOI HEE-SU

372
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,764
Come to the school.

373
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,308
I'll wait for you here.

374
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,017
Professor Kwon,
let's have a cup of coffee.

375
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,988
How are the students doing?

376
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,033
Not great.

377
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,076
The Investigation Studies professor
is gone,

378
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,661
and the culprit has been caught.

379
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,954
On top of that,
this is not the first time.

380
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,416
Given what's going on,
the students can't focus on their studies.

381
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,293
Right.

382
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,630
I'm aware.

383
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,591
Why did things have to turn out this way?

384
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,597
Our students did nothing wrong.

385
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,976
We put them through too much.

386
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,983
They say, "Adversity makes you stronger."

387
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,152
But…

388
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,031
could you be their anchor,
so they won't be too affected

389
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,160
by everything that's going on?

390
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,580
Me?

391
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,082
Yes.

392
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,171
I believe you're the perfect person
for the role.

393
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,853
Come in. You can sit over there.

394
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,498
Will you be contacting my school
by any chance?

395
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,668
No, not yet.
The arrest warrant hasn't been issued yet.

396
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,341
There's no one else here,
so I'll just say it.

397
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,679
I heard Chief Han Jeong-sik is
the mastermind behind all this.

398
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,140
Dong-man told me briefly.

399
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,520
He said he was headed to the school

400
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,480
and left this with me.

401
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,316
He also said

402
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,651
that you would know what to do.

403
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,826
LEDGER

404
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,996
Joo Jae-il…

405
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,961
May I borrow your laptop, Detective?

406
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,107
How are you feeling?

407
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,196
ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION DAY
AUGUST 27TH, 2016

408
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,448
Was it you?

409
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,163
Choi Hee-su, are you the culprit?

410
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,626
Will you believe me if I say no?

411
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,544
Just answer my question.

412
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,090
So you won't believe me.

413
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,721
In the ledger, we found evidence

414
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,224
that your husband, Lee Ju-won,

415
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,393
was a member of the gambling ring.

416
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,481
Bribes were given to Han Jeong-sik
using the foundation as a cover.

417
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,070
You lied to me and met
with Go Deok-bae and Han Jeong-sik.

418
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,030
You joined the school in 2016,

419
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,074
which was when the gambling ring
was formed.

420
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,033
It was all…

421
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,788
It was all you, Choi Hee-su.

422
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,252
Isn't that all
mere circumstantial evidence?

423
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,090
It looks like you're done talking,

424
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,467
so it's your turn to listen.

425
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,636
I'm not sure if you know this,

426
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,973
but Zelkova Tree Foundation is
an organization that supports the police.

427
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,267
What?

428
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,895
It supports active duty police officers

429
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,897
and provides financial assistance
to the bereaved

430
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,817
for all the funeral expenses
and other expenses that may arise.

431
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,738
Although…

432
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,283
it was done with the money
made through the gambling ring.

433
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,577
If you want to confess,
go turn yourself in!

434
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,246
Keep your mouth shut
and listen to me first.

435
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,501
This isn't about the gambling ring
starting the foundation.

436
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,671
Why did Zelkova Tree Foundation
start the illegal gambling ring

437
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,339
and go through all the trouble?

438
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,217
Don't miss the forest for the trees.

439
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,929
That's what you should be after.

440
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,641
Go after it,
and it'll lead you to the real culprit.

441
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,646
It could be me,

442
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,190
like you're thinking now.

443
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,901
Or…

444
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,737
it could be someone else.

445
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,282
What are you playing at?

446
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,786
I'm done talking.

447
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,414
Now, it's your job to figure out

448
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,875
whether this is a confession
or a witness statement.

449
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,049
I'll be waiting here.

450
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,221
Hey, Choi Hee-su!

451
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,774
Yes, go ahead.

452
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,193
Sun-ho found Joo Jae-il.

453
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,738
-Joo Jae-il?
-Yes.

454
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,116
The recipient of the biggest sum.

455
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,245
Also, there's someone who gets paid
more than Han Jeong-sik.

456
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,873
It's someone called Joo Jae-il.

457
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,209
He's the only one
whose affiliation isn't written.

458
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,670
I'll send you the address now.

459
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,631
Can you go check? Okay.

460
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,729
-Detective.
-Yes?

461
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,148
Someone is here to see you.

462
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,191
Who?

463
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,154
ID verified.

464
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,077
You're Sun-ho's friend, right?

465
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,288
Yes.

466
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,500
I'm sorry. You can't see him now
because we're interviewing him.

467
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:15,840
Then can I at least speak
to him on the phone?

468
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,925
Please help me out.

469
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,814
Keep it short, and I have to listen in.

470
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,983
Thank you.

471
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,270
Kang-hui.

472
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,818
How can this happen?

473
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,031
You said
you wouldn't get into trouble anymore.

474
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,575
You said it wouldn't happen again.

475
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,662
It's been only a day

476
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,748
since you made that promise.

477
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,255
Do you even think of me
when you make decisions?

478
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,050
I'll explain everything.

479
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,054
Things got messed up
because of the ledger I found in the safe.

480
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,098
They haven't informed the school yet.

481
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,307
Kang Sun-ho.

482
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,353
Do you know how I felt…

483
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,357
on my way to see you?

484
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,195
I felt like a girl who's gone insane.

485
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,617
I told myself that you'll be okay
and that nothing will happen.

486
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,745
Then the next moment,

487
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,710
my heart sank,
thinking you're in really big trouble.

488
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,921
Then again, I was so anxious

489
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,090
because there was so much traffic.

490
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,634
I had all sorts of feelings

491
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,803
like I'd gone crazy.

492
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,931
Then…

493
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,144
I started getting mad at you.

494
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,649
And it wasn't the first time…

495
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,114
I felt this way.

496
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,038
I felt that way every time
my mom got arrested.

497
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,461
And now my boyfriend is making me anxious.

498
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,307
I guess I can say…

499
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,020
that I've done enough.

500
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,232
Wait, Kang-hui.

501
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,650
Let's stop it now.

502
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,451
Let's break up.

503
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,245
Kang-hui…

504
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,183
You didn't find any piece of evidence?

505
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,310
The thing is…

506
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,896
And you arrested him without a warrant?

507
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,190
But that's what you told me--

508
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,943
Go and find the evidence right now!

509
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,362
If you find nothing,
make one and bring it to me.

510
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,239
Find it by any means necessary!

511
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,909
Keep holding Kang Sun-ho up.

512
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,466
Dong-man told me this
as he handed it to me.

513
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,427
If I come too late,

514
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,929
or if things go south with him,

515
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,143
give this to Chief Han Jeong-sik.

516
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,688
LEDGER

517
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,565
To Chief Han Jeong-sik?

518
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,068
Give it to him,
and tell him to let Sun-ho go.

519
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,321
This is to protect him.

520
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,834
If you have to go,

521
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,086
then decide now.

522
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,523
JAEIL CORPORATION

523
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,535
JAEIL CORPORATION OFFICE

524
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,540
So Joo Jae-il wasn't a person
but a factory.

525
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,874
JAEIL CORPORATION

526
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,459
Let's go.

527
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,295
-Get home safely.
-See you tomorrow.

528
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,548
Excuse me, may I help you?

529
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,096
Zelkova Tree Foundation?

530
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,306
Do you know that foundation?

531
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,475
Not so much,

532
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,478
but the one who manages the foundation
is our factory manager.

533
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,272
He's on night duty tonight,

534
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,275
so he'll be here in 30 minutes.

535
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,194
Then I'll wait.

536
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,488
By the way, what does this factory make?

537
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,700
Oh, we make bulletproof vests,

538
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,285
protective gloves, and gears.

539
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,911
Things like that.

540
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,297
LEDGER

541
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,469
While trying to track down
the gambling ring…

542
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,180
Yes, we lost Eun-ju.

543
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,559
If I hadn't hacked back then,

544
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,979
you would have caught
the illegal gambling ring.

545
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,857
Whether you hacked or not,

546
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,651
it's my fault as a detective
that I failed to catch them.

547
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:40,909
Please don't…

548
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,872
hand over the ledger.

549
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,378
If we hand this over, Professor Yu
won't be able to close the case.

550
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,976
What are you doing with the suspect?

551
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,020
Captain…

552
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,448
Even if he asked,

553
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,242
what do you think you're doing
with a suspect under investigation?

554
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,415
But Captain,
on the day that Jang Jae-gyu mentioned,

555
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,876
Kang Sun-ho wasn't caught in any
of the security cameras in the area.

556
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,172
And you know that our request
for the arrest warrant will be rejected.

557
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,256
Shut it!

558
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,385
Are you all dying to be fired?

559
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,765
Lock him up in jail,

560
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,851
and you should go
and find evidence on Kang Sun-ho.

561
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,939
Of course I know.

562
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,941
Through Zelkova Tree Foundation,

563
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,777
our products are distributed
to the police stations.

564
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,529
You know those old supplies

565
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,281
or the ones that they lack.

566
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,450
The foundation figures out what they lack

567
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,661
and give out the supplies as a donation.

568
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,290
We're pretty good
at making protective gears.

569
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,172
How long has it been?

570
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,760
I think it's been about five to six years.

571
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,305
Can I see the list of products

572
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,141
you distributed in those years?

573
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,684
Oh…

574
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,061
Sure. Please wait here.

00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,383

ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION

NORTH GYEONGSANG POLICE AGENCY

581
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,359
Zelkova Tree Foundation is
an organization that supports the police.

582
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,945
I mean, if they wanted to launder money

583
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,614
or bribe the officers,

584
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,742
there's no reason
to establish a foundation.

585
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,334
4,000,000 WON

586
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,758
This isn't about the gambling ring
starting the foundation.

587
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,385
Why did Zelkova Tree Foundation
start the illegal gambling ring

588
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,887
and go through all the trouble?

589
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,140
Don't miss the forest for the trees.

590
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,560
That's what you should be after.

591
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,022
Go after it,
and it'll lead you to the real culprit.

ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION DAY
AUGUST 27TH, 2016

593
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,951
The number you have dialed does not exist.

594
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,619
What are you doing?

595
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,288
Check the number and try again.

596
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,673
The number you told me.
It doesn't exist anymore.

597
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,092
It's a burner phone.

598
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,349
I told you everything I know.

599
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,810
Then what about this photo?

600
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,065
I went there once
only because I was invited.

601
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,402
I met these people there
for the first time.

602
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,447
Frankly, I don't really remember
because I was there to do sales.

603
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,783
And you don't even know
whose number that is?

604
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,620
Hey, does that make sense to you?

605
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,581
It was one of the conditions
of our deal with the foundation.

606
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,001
We were told to call this number
no matter what

607
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,837
if anyone visited the factory
and asked about the foundation.

608
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,797
They said they'd terminate
the contract otherwise.

609
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,008
The thing is,

610
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,052
they picked up the last time
we called them.

611
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,804
Why does it say
that the number doesn't exist?

612
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,058
-You spoke to them last time?
-Yes.

613
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,894
Was it about two years ago?

614
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,772
A cop came by

615
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,398
and asked about the foundation.

616
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,610
Who?

617
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,278
It was…

618
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,490
I don't remember the name.

619
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,119
But he had double eyelids,
and he was tall.

620
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,832
He seemed to be in his fifties.

621
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,169
Han Jeong-sik received goods
most of the time,

622
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,588
but since two years ago,
the amount has increased dramatically.

623
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,548
Han Jeong-sik.

624
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,598
Do you even think of me
when you make decisions?

625
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,144
Let's break up.

626
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,192
Hey.

627
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,798
Captain.

628
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,968
-This was faxed to us.
-What is it?

629
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:18,932
Hey, Dong-man.

630
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,101
What?

631
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,898
What?

632
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,199
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

633
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,719
Hey.

634
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,307
Get in. Let's go.

635
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,409
I thought I told you
to do whatever it takes

636
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,870
to keep Kang Sun-ho here.

637
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,715

638
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,896

640
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,208
Where are we going?

641
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,670
To check something for one last time.

642
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,134
KANG SUN-HO:
INDEFINITE SUSPENSION CANCELED

643
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,719
Nice.

644
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,514
-Hey, Kang-hui!
-Kang-hui.

645
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,598
Did you hear?

646
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,726
Professor Seo managed to get
Sun-ho's suspension canceled.

647
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,646
He can return to school tomorrow.

648
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:33,275
The police released him this morning.

649
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,277
My gosh, I'm so relieved.

650
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,279
You too, right?

651
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,948
Sun-ho and I broke up.

652
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,325
What?

653
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,372
So from now on,
don't bring him up in front of me.

654
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,997
Why are we suddenly
deep-cleaning the office?

655
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,165
Well…

656
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:34,252
Because we have to throw out the old
to bring in the new.

657
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,839
What is this, Professor?

658
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,966
It's garbage.

659
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,094
-Should I throw it out?
-No, it's okay.

660
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,432
It's my garbage,
so I should throw it out myself.

661
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,276
You always come
just before I can forget about you.

662
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,988
It's not like I want to see you, jerk.

663
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,491
Give me the photo.

AUGUST 27TH, 2016

665
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,215
About Zelkova Tree Foundation…

666
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,802
Looks like you guys pulled
lots of funny tricks using it.

667
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,261
What?

668
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,515
While pretending
to support police officers,

669
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,601
you jerks bribed corrupt cops

670
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,937
and did all sorts of ridiculous things.

671
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,524
Everything's recorded in the ledger.
Am I wrong?

672
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,491
If all you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

673
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,327
Maybe I just know

674
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,913
scumbags like you too well.

675
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,418
Hey, Detective Yu.

676
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,966
Do you know
why Park Cheol-jin nearly lost his life?

677
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,805
He kept getting confused,

678
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,890
forgetting what was really important.

679
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,821
The jerks running the illegal site
you're after…

680
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,118
They are the Police University's…

681
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,126
Hey, Cheol-jin.

682
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,212
Cheol-jin. Park Cheol-jin!

683
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,463
Cheol-jin!

684
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,021
Why did you have to make this hard for us?

685
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,359
We did this to save the officers like you.

686
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,156
We all started with the same mindset.

687
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,158
We wanted to do something good.

688
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,080
Once you're in this business,
there are times when your hands get dirty.

689
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,457
But that jerk suddenly
made a big deal out of it.

690
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,667
Go Deok-bae!

691
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:06,214
We only ran the illegal gambling ring
to help police officers like you.

692
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,553
We used that money to defend
your pathetic sense of justice!

693
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,308
Who told you to?

694
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,273
Professor Seo Sang-hak?

695
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,576
Let me ask you one last thing.

696
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,122
-The woman you talked with…
-Woman?

697
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,666
It wasn't a woman.

698
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,960
It was a man.

699
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,956
Did he go to his class?

700
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,258

Let's go, Professor.

703
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,413
Okay.

704
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,791
Let's go.

705
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:15,134
PROFESSOR SEO SANG-HAK

706
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,347
There's a question

707
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,891
that students ask me every year.

708
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,814
"If I could understand
the motive of a criminal,

709
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,651
and if I'm unsure

710
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:37,198
that I'd make another choice

711
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,076
if I were put in the same situation."

712
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,328
"What should I do?"

713
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,250
They'd ask me if they were qualified
to become an officer

714
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,503
when they have such mindsets.

715
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,510
My answer to that
has always been the same.

716
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,638
It's more than possible for you
to think like that.

717
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,683
The fact that you worry about it

718
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,893
makes you qualified.

719
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,897
But this year,

720
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,067
I want to give a different answer.

721
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,945
Don't ever

722
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:20,700
justify a criminal.

723
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,662
Even if they're your friend,

724
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,625
girlfriend, boyfriend, family,

725
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,712
or teacher.

726
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,842
You don't have to try and understand them.

727
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,261
Regardless of the reason,

728
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,014
if they committed a crime,

729
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,891
you should help them

730
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,310
so that they can reflect on themselves
and get punished.

731
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,605
It's too difficult, Professor.

732
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,569
I know. It's not an easy thing to do.

733
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,036
However,

734
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,791
it's something you shouldn't avoid
just because it's difficult.

735
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,174
You'll become police officers

736
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,511
who need to fight for justice.

737
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,264
So…

738
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,184
do not get hurt.

739
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,146
Do not die.

740
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:36,818
That way,
you'll be able to accomplish it all.

741
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,875
I'm sorry about that.

742
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,545
It looks like
I digressed from the subject.

743
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,684
The class felt especially short today.

744
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,979
All right, then. Thank you, everyone.

745
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,398
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

746
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,574
PROFESSOR SEO SANG-HAK

747
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,194
Yes, this is Seo Sang-hak.

748
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,822
One died, and one got hurt.

749
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,490
If you went through that,

750
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,618
does that give you a right
to pull a stunt like that?

751
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,953
Since you got your noble hands dirty,

752
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,456
you should go the full distance.

753
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:22,877
What should I do
so that no one gets hurt anymore?

754
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,253
Seeing where you are now…

755
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,256
I am not good enough to stay by your side.

756
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,885
Meet me at the front gate
at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

757
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:34,055
What has Sun-ho been up to?

758
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,391
I've been so grateful
that you admitted me into this school.
