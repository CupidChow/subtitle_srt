LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,587
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,427
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:16,016
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,825
IF YOU DON'T STOP HIM,
IT'S OVER FOR YOU

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,248
MY ONE AND ONLY SUPERVISOR

8
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,469
-What?
-You rude punk.

9
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,681
Hey, do you want to have pork belly
since it's raining?

10
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,893
-Dong-man.
-What is it?

11
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,020
Why do you sound so down? What is it?

12
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,939
You won't give up, right?

13
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,193
Give up what? What are you talking about?

14
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,946
You'll never give up
on going after those jerks, will you?

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,241
Gosh, don't you know me?

16
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,161
Where are you?

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,371
Did you drink?
Do you want me to pick you up?

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,377
The jerks running the illegal site
you're after…

19
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,090
They are the Police University's…

20
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,392
Hey, Cheol-jin.

21
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,020
Cheol-jin. Park Cheol-jin!

22
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,021
Cheol-jin!

23
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,082
Cheol-jin.

24
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,459
Cheol-jin!

25
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,128
Mr. Park Cheol-jin!

26
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,879
-Call Anesthesiology.
-Yes, sir!

27
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,720
My gut feeling tells me
that this case is dangerous.

28
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,558
That day, you said
you'd always be right behind me.

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,102
It still hurts on rainy days.

30
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,812
And I still turn around in panic mode,

31
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,355
thinking someone might attack me
from behind.

32
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,439
So please,

33
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,234
don't leave me alone.

34
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,282
-I can't seem to stop the bleeding.
-We'll move him now!

35
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,034
Cheol-jin. Hey…

36
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,912
My gosh…

37
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,804
You were the last person he called.

38
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,514
Did you hear anything?

39
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,686
Hey, tell me.

40
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,565
The illegal gambling site.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,360
Those damn bastards.

42
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,362
I'll catch them.

43
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,032
I will catch them no matter what.

44
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,826
Hey, calm down.

45
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,370
Because of those scumbags, Eun-ju died,

46
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,541
and now even Cheol-jin is hurt.
How do you expect me to calm down?

47
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,420
I must catch those jerks.

48
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,464
I'll catch them

49
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,425
and make them pay for this!

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,637
Hey, Dong-man!

51
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,433
I MUST

52
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,438
I MUST PROTECT EVERYONE

53
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,742
I BELIEVE THAT YOU'LL DO WELL
BIRD HAS LOGGED OUT

54
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,910
He's not here.

55
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,582
Why don't we meet up?

56
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,625
Yes.

57
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,629
I will do it…

58
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,606
DO NOT ENTER
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

59
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,735
DO NOT ENTER

60
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,359
Professor Yu.

61
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,736
Kang Sun-ho.

62
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,237
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,325
You said you'd do anything for me

64
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,578
if I helped you out, right?

65
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,497
Help me.

66
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,083
-Pardon?
-Help me…

67
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,919
so that I can catch those jerks.

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,381
-What are you talking…
-With your hacking skills,

69
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,508
we can catch those jerks.

70
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,054
Yoon.

71
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,515
"Yoon"?

72
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,227
-Are you…
-That's right.

73
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,230
I am…

74
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,651
Bird.

75
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,362
What?

76
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,784
Wait, hold on.

77
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,620
You said you were in college.

78
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,249
-A computer science major.
-That's because hackers run away

79
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,126
the moment I tell them I'm a cop.

80
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,670
At first,

81
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,174
I signed on to the Black Net
to get some information.

82
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,719
But I met you, and we ended up chatting…

83
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,429
So you deceived me for a year?

84
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,598
Hey, I didn't deceive you.

85
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,183
I couldn't find
the right time to tell you.

86
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,477
When did you find out that I was Yoon?

87
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,438
That day at the police station? Or here?

88
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,232
You don't have to believe me
if you don't want to,

89
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,234
but I only found out recently.

90
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,780
And when I found out,
I was as surprised as you are now.

91
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:50,076
So I was going to pretend
I didn't know it was you.

92
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,494
I was going to, but…

93
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,872
Cheol-jin got hurt.

94
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,545
I think it's the jerks that run
the illegal gambling site that you hacked.

95
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,591
If you could help me out by hacking them,
I think I'll be able to get them.

96
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,219
Is that why you let me
get admitted to this school?

97
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,971
You punk!

98
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,440
If I help you,
does that make hacking legal?

99
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,068
The first time is hard.
It's easy the next time around.

100
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,321
And by the third time,
you won't even feel guilty.

101
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,157
That's what you said to me.

102
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,536
That's why I promised you
that I will never break any rules.

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,746
I made that promise to you.

104
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,418
I'll pretend
you didn't ask me that tonight.

105
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,218
CHUNGRAM LOUNGE

106
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,226
One.

107
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,895
Two.

108
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,688
One.

109
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,856
Two.

110
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,864
Hey, if you're not going
to have that yogurt drink,

111
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,782
I can help get rid of it.

112
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,078
But then again,
he should take some probiotics too.

113
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,580
Of course.

114
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,416
Probiotics are essential.

115
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,627
I'll get going first.

116
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,385
Our sweet friend looks edgy today.

117
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,639
You know how Professor Kwon

118
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,807
put Sun-ho to shame in his class.

119
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,520
He didn't get any sleep last night
and rummaged through books all night.

120
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,909
"I feel lousy."

121
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,414
That's what your face says.

122
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,795
Honestly speaking,
Professor Kwon was too harsh yesterday.

123
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,715
Who can answer him properly
if he corners them?

124
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,593
I bet most of them would've
gone speechless just like you did.

125
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,389
So don't be discouraged.

126
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,809
Thanks.

127
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,479
But I've actually
never given it a thought.

128
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,358
What it means to become an officer
and to protect the citizens.

129
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,027
What my stance is.

130
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,490
Then you can find your answer now.

131
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,702
We just got into this school.
We just started this journey.

132
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,829
You're right.

133
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,747
We just started.

134
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,084
By the way,

135
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,171
about what you told me
on the last day of the training…

136
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,467
I actually came to this school
because of you.

137
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,387
It's you.

138
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:58,931
Sorry?

139
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,766
Which one?

140
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,020
Attention.

141
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,446
Professor Yu had
an urgent matter to take care of,

142
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,698
so today's class is canceled.

143
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,327
Mr. Hyun over here
will give you detailed information

144
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,330
on the curriculum and the material
you'll need for the semester.

145
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,374
We'll announce the date
for the make-up class once it's decided.

146
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,585
We won't answer any questions.

147
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,049
How could he cancel his first class?

148
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,761
It must've been an urgent matter.

149
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,471
He notified us over the phone.

150
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,849
He said he'd submit the report
and the syllabus later.

151
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,476
Is he not feeling well?

152
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,061
He must teach his class anyway.

153
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,064
His students come to his class
even when they're sick.

154
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,149
I don't think he qualifies as a professor.

155
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,319
Why don't we start our meeting?

156
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,204
It's an epidural hemorrhage.

157
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
His surgery went well,

158
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,502
but we'll have to wait and see
whether he will wake up or not.

159
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,213
He will wake up, won't he?

160
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,091
I can't guarantee that.

161
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,394
Hey, Dong-man. You haven't eaten, right?

162
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,525
-Let me return to the force.
-You punk, it's already over.

163
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,194
The paperwork has been completed.

164
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,532
-Captain.
-What is it?

165
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,242
Do you trust me?

166
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,660
What? You're scaring me.

167
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,495
I trust you, Captain.

168
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,790
What are you trying to say?

169
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,754
I think Cheol-jin found

170
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,424
a lead to the gang
running the illegal gambling site.

171
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,716
What?

172
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,095
So? Go on.

173
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,138
I think

174
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,433
I should return to the force
and investigate it myself.

175
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,310
I think Cheol-jin
found conclusive evidence.

176
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,272
Why? What did he say?

177
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,151
I think it has something to do

178
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,653
with the Police University.

179
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,449
Those jerks involved
in the illegal gambling site.

180
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,325
I think they're at our university!

181
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,290
Was it you who hurt his head,
not Cheol-jin?

182
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,875
Come on, Captain.

183
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,460
You nearly had me convinced

184
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,087
with your serious talk of nonsense,
you punk.

185
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm serious! Cheol-jin told me that
over the phone.

186
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,552
Gosh, you pathetic punk.

187
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,721
Cheol-jin is unconscious!

188
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,640
When will you grow up?

189
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,934
How dare you use a sick person?

190
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,519
You're nuts.

191
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,480
And you call yourself his supervisor?

192
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,440
Gosh. Darn it.

193
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,235
I'm telling you the truth!
Cheol-jin said it!

194
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,905
-Don't follow me!
-Cheol-jin said it!

195
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,407
-Go away.
-My goodness.

196
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,493
Stop following me!

197
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,249
TEA CEREMONY CLUB, DAHYANG

198
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,253
The best part of campus life is the clubs.

199
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,423
-Have you decided which one to join?
-This one.

200
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,468
Scientific Investigation Research Club
that Professor Seo Sang-hak leads.

201
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,595
It's also known as SIRC.

202
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,807
Others think it doesn't have
many activities because it's led

203
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,019
by a public administration professor,
but actually it is the only club

204
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,146
that deals with
fingerprints, blood, and DNA.

205
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,234
I heard there's a real queen

206
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,402
in the dance club.

207
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,112
A queen.

208
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,656
Really?

209
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,659
Where can I fill out an application
for the dance club?

210
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,417
Join the judo club
if you want to see a queen.

211
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,418
Gosh, you scared me.

212
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,297
You can see me if you join the judo club.

213
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,591
Right…

214
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,680
What? He has the face for judo.

215
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,307
What's your name? Sun-ho?

216
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,809
Kang Sun-ho.

217
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,687
I'm going to join the student council.
Are you joining it too?

218
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,522
What? Yes.

219
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,984
The seniors wanted me to join,
and I think it'll be fun.

220
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,194
But I heard there are only two spots left.

221
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,113
Are we rivals now?

222
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,659
We can both get in.
Here it is. Let's go check it out.

223
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,870
2021 STUDENT COUNCIL
RECRUITING NEW MEMBERS

224
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,454
What's your number?

225
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,248
-Get his number.
-It's 010…

226
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,628
-What? Sun-ho.
-You won't get this chance again.

227
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,132
If you want to win her love,
join the judo club.

228
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,967
Goodness, Professor Choi.

229
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,138
None but the brave deserve the fair.

230
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,724
-You know that, right?
-Why are you doing this to me?

231
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,309
I remember during your interview

232
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,728
you said you wanted
to build your physical strength.

233
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,564
You can't change your mind overnight.

234
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,024
Now, your number.

235
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,651
-It's 010…
-I need some time to think. Sorry.

236
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,030
-Did you get his number?
-No.

237
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,282
Why didn't you?

238
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,414
-He's tall, and he has good grades.
-Really?

239
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,917
Are you here to apply?
You can put it there.

240
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,837
You know it's based on grades, right?
Good luck.

241
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,255
Do you think you'll make it?

242
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,175
STUDENT COUNCIL APPLICATION FORM
OH KANG-HUI

243
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,509
STUDENT COUNCIL APPLICATION FORM
PARK MIN-GYU

244
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,469
Police officers…

245
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,930
shoot guns not to harm others

246
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,934
but to protect them.

247
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:39,980
Remember that a bullet
should only be fired to save people.

248
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,859
I hope you'll learn
to shoot safely and precisely.

249
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,945
Please demonstrate.

250
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,458
Take a deep breath.

251
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,587
As you breathe out,
put your arms holding the gun

252
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,172
in line with your sight.

253
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,886
Once your arms are in line, stop breathing

254
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,305
and align the front sight
with the rear sight.

255
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,934
Focus!

256
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,315
And shoot.

257
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,169
It has the anecdote of Miranda
of the Miranda rule.

258
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,920
It might be good for you to take a look.

259
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,547
Thanks.

260
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,758
You don't need to read it all.

261
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,558
You just need to read this chapter…

262
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,185
Kang-hui's hand touched mine.

263
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,482
Kang-hui's hand…

264
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,235
Kang-hui's hand…

265
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,240
Are you listening?

266
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,160
Hey, Kang Sun-ho!

267
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,541
Get a grip.

268
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,670
I'm sorry. Can you explain it again?

269
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,839
If you read here…

270
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,176
It says you can't use
the suspect's statement

271
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,595
as evidence against him at his trial.

272
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,433
If you see the next page,
it goes on and on, but you must read it.

273
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,684
-You need to memorize it.
-Okay.

274
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,358
Something must be going on
with Kang-hui and Sun-ho.

275
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,529
I knew it. Like attracts like.

276
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,114
Can't you see I'm studying?

277
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,282
I see.

278
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,243
Sorry.

279
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,669
There's no more mercy
or consideration for Jo Joon-wuk.

280
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,130
Gosh, that's too much between friends.

281
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,301
There are no friends
when it comes to love.

282
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,729
No. There's no fair play.

283
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,358
It's a war from now on.

284
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,404
I can do this.

285
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,754
Goodness. Are you guys
going to be this childish?

286
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,513
If you're done eating, let's talk.

287
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,231
Do you like Kang-hui?

288
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,150
Yes.

289
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,152
You too, right?

290
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,695
Since when?

291
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,866
Before I got into this school.
What about you?

292
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,702
Way before you did.

293
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,873
Witness, please come on in.

294
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,374
2 YEARS AGO

295
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,891
That wench…

296
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,229
WITNESS

297
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,442
I don't know it exactly.

298
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,070
But I remember people coming
and going around midnight.

299
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,490
Then have you seen the accused,
who is your mother,

300
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:47,412
opening an illegal casino
in a warehouse and gambling?

301
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,708
Yes, I have.

302
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,879
At night. Almost every night.

303
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,840
When I was studying for exams,
and even before my judo competition.

304
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,927
That woman, that man, him and her!

305
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,262
Hey, mister.

306
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,598
ACCUSED

307
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,768
Your Honor.

308
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,145
To those adults including my mother

309
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,731
who renovated general housing
into an illegal casino,

310
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,526
please give them
the maximum penalty allowed by law.

311
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,987
Please, sir.

312
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,708
Then Kang Sun-ho, we can't be friends.

313
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,128
Okay, Park Min-gyu.

314
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,214
-There will be no fair play…
-From now on.

315
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,684
-Gosh, really?
-My goodness.

316
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,352
-Isn't this unbelievable?
-Goodness.

317
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,858
What's going on?
Why are you all suddenly so quiet?

318
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,109
Were you talking behind my back?

319
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,426
Keeping the dorm clean is essential.

320
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,178
Call the roll!

321
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,640
Evening-roll-call!
Two in total, two present.

322
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,892
All clear.

323
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,233
Again.

324
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,115
Again!

325
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,708
Something amazing happened.

326
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,255
Again!

327
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,053
My gosh, unbelievable. Goodness.

328
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,972
Sun-ho.

329
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,645
It's unbelievable.
Did you hear about Oh Kang-hui?

330
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,108
Kang-hui's mother
was convicted four times.

331
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,485
-And it's fraud and gambling.
-What?

332
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:27,114
On the day of our interview,
she was arrested in front of the school.

333
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,367
-My goodness.
-What's going on?

334
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,494
-I'm scared.
-She's cuffed.

335
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,414
Everyone has been talking about it
since last night.

336
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,084
How could the daughter of a criminal
become a police officer?

337
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,710
How can you say that, Joon-wuk?

338
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,379
Hey.

339
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,644
My goodness.

340
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,771
Kang-hui must have heard everything.

341
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,773
My gosh.

342
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,943
No way.

343
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,947
Just for this week. This is an emergency.

344
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,533
What about the report
and make-up plan from last week?

345
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,118
Did you bring it, Professor Yu?

346
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,288
Ms. Baek.

347
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,916
I'll come back later.

348
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,171
As for the report,
I'll submit them together at once.

349
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,380
Professor Yu.

350
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,967
Are you canceling your class again?

351
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,760
Well, I have an urgent matter.

352
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,805
What's more urgent for a professor
than teaching his students?

353
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:40,228
Gosh, I have nothing to say and all,

354
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,731
but I really have an urgent matter.

355
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,815
Then just leave.

356
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:49,613
You seem to lack ethics as a professor.
Don't disgrace other professors.

357
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,656
Just resign and leave.

358
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,994
I get what you mean.

359
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,582
But who are you
to tell me to resign or not?

360
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,461
This is the last piece of advice
I can give politely to a loser like you.

361
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,172
Leave without causing any trouble.

362
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,843
Did you just talk down to me?

363
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,096
What are you doing
in front of all the students, professors?

364
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,149
-Here, have some.
-Thank you.

365
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,489
I thought you'd made up your mind,
Professor Yu.

366
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,409
The school and students…

367
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,955
I thought you've got
some different plans now.

368
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:44,709
When field officers come to the school,

369
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,629
they often have a hard time adjusting.

370
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,132
But even so,
you can't do this, Professor Yu.

371
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,137
My colleague got injured badly.

372
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,014
He's still unconscious.

373
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,768
After this week, I may not even
be able to track them down.

374
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,978
It is like the golden hour.

375
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,939
I know that I shouldn't be doing this,

376
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,858
but please understand just this once.

377
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,073
I get why you have to do this,

378
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,912
but it's time for you
to make up your mind.

379
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,917
Whether you'll stay a professor
or go back to being a detective.

380
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,644
Darn it.

381
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,790
Hey, you've been asleep for way too long.

382
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,543
Actually, never mind. Just sleep.

383
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,755
I'll work round the clock

384
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,716
and make sure I catch the jerk
who did this to you,

385
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,509
so just sleep and rest up.

386
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,639
To tell you the truth,

387
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,184
I was starting to be attached
to the school.

388
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,188
It's fun to watch
those clueless youngsters.

389
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,690
"I used to be like that too."

390
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,401
It makes me a little emotional at times.

391
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,448
But I promised
that I'd always protect you.

392
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,160
That's why I'm here again.

393
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,163
What I'm saying is…

394
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,042
Don't sleep for too long.

395
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,006
What am I doing now?
He's asleep and can't hear me.

396
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,093
Gosh.

397
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,392
GET LOST, OH KANG-HUI!
YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO POLICE UNIVERSITY!

398
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,476
DAUGHTER OF A FELON! DROP OUT!

399
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,854
This is insane.

400
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,111
This crazy little piece of…

401
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,372
Who did that?

402
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,208
What?

403
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,293
Gosh, what was that?

404
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,094
GET LOST, OH KANG-HUI!
YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO POLICE UNIVERSITY!

405
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,470
DAUGHTER OF A FELON! DROP OUT!

406
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,555
BRAT WHO INHERITED CRIMINAL'S BLOOD!

407
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,472
OH KANG-HUI

408
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,150
Gosh, this still looks so messy.

409
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,203
HOLOGRAM STICKER

410
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,583
BOOKSTORE
CONVENIENCE STORE, STATIONERY STORE

411
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,384
Hey.

412
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,727
A few days ago,

413
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,188
Cheol-jin got injured

414
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,232
so I wasn't in my right mind.

415
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,069
I'm the one who needs to catch them.

416
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,405
What I'm trying to say is…

417
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,534
Just forget what I said that day.

418
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,703
Bye, I'm off.

419
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,005
Unbelievable, right?

420
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,299
She always acted like
she was better than everyone else.

421
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,634
Is she really not going to drop out?

422
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,220
She wants to hold out with no shame.

423
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,596
Like mother, like daughter.

424
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,099
If she becomes a cop
and her mother gets arrested,

425
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,851
will she just let her off?

426
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,937
No, I won't.

427
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,232
Even if she's my mom,
she needs to pay for what she did.

428
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,651
And if you've got things to say to me,

429
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,321
say it to my face instead of doing it
behind my back like a bunch of rats.

430
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,989
Hey, watch what you say.

431
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,658
You're one to talk.

432
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,662
Your mom is a gambling addict.
No wonder you turned out like this.

433
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,789
Let's go, girls.

434
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,969
-Hello.
-Hi.

435
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,390
LEADERSHIP ROOM

436
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,518
Ms. Baek. You need to see this
on our website.

437
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,062
Why? What is it?

438
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,861
Hey, look at this.
Oh Kang-hui is really something.

439
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,529
-What?
-What's going on?

440
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,281
She must really be out of her mind.

441
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,448
-Hey, look.
-What?

442
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,783
Check this out.

443
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,456
Kang-hui must be so upset.

444
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,668
-What do we do, Sun-ho?
-What's going on?

445
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,380
My daughter tells me
she wants to die before me.

446
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,090
You little…

447
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,262
DID YOU KNOW? OH KANG-HUI'S MOTHER
WAS CONVICTED 4 TIMES FOR GAMBLING

448
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,722
CHILDREN ARE A REFLECTION
OF THEIR PARENTS

449
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,223
IF KANG-HUI BECOMES A POLICE OFFICER,

450
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,100
IT'LL ONLY TARNISH
PUBLIC'S TRUST IN THE POLICE

451
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,896
I don't want you in my life!

452
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,317
When was this posted?

453
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,737
Where is Kang-hui?

454
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,446
I hope it helps you cool down.

455
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,958
GET LOST! DROP OUT!

456
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,236
You're uncomfortable with me, right?

457
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,072
No.

458
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,327
Yes. Because of my mistake
during the Chungram Training.

459
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,662
By doing that,

460
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,958
you're robbing me of the opportunity
to solve the problem on my own.

461
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,131
It's not easy to befriend someone
who humiliated you in the past.

462
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,011
I said that because of my mom.

463
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,763
Whenever I had an exam,

464
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,350
she somehow got the correct answers
and made me memorize all of them.

465
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,812
She made me memorize the answers
instead of learning to solve them.

466
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,568
So later on, I got to a point
where I knew the answers right away

467
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,447
without understanding
why they were the correct answers.

468
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,871
Another family
where the mom's the problem.

469
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,372
What?

470
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,338
Hey, isn't this our first time

471
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,799
having such a long conversation
since becoming roommates?

472
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,720
Well, people make friends
even during wartime.

473
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,061
They get things done fast.

474
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,354
Did you see this?

475
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,318
FRESHMAN OH'S SHOCKING SECRET
THIS POST HAS BEEN DELETED

476
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,832
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

477
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,085
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY,
OH KANG-HUI

478
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,935
Hey, Kang Sun-ho.

479
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,782
By the way, how did you know?

480
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,327
-Who else would do that, if not you?
-Why?

481
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,871
-Do you hate it?
-A little.

482
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,542
It's so childish,

483
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,461
but kind of sweet at the same time.

484
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,510
Have you thought about
Professor Kwon Hyuk-phil's question?

485
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,719
Do you know your answer?

486
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,013
Not yet.

487
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,977
During the class that day,

488
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,147
you said that we should
protect everyone when we can

489
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,898
since we're police officers.

490
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,152
I felt a little guilty when I heard that.

491
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,947
When I was in 11th grade,

492
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,078
my mom's trial was held.

493
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,749
The prosecutor asked me
to stand in court as a witness.

494
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,002
So I testified

495
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,088
that it was my mom who did all that.

496
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,843
The people she was involved
in the crime with

497
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,137
hired lawyers.

498
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,183
But my mom was poor,

499
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,561
so I was afraid
she would take all the blame.

500
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,275
That's why I told the judge
that they were all in it together.

501
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,612
That my mom was involved in it too.

502
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,117
I only said that to protect my mom,

503
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,246
but I think I only protected my mom,

504
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,999
not others.

505
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,299
Hey. Please do this for us.

506
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,510
A guy like me can never
make that kind of money.

507
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,637
But you can.

508
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,722
Please forgive them just this once.

509
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,599
Please, Detectives.

510
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,643
Help me.

511
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,520
A few days ago, Cheol-jin got injured

512
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,941
so I wasn't in my right mind.

513
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,112
That must have been

514
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,324
the best option you had back then.

515
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,493
And I don't think…

516
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,247
that's wrong.

517
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,513
Let's go

518
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,431
and get ready for the evening roll-call.

519
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,269
Why don't you go ahead first?
I need to stop by somewhere.

520
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,228
Where?

521
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,942
Yes.

522
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,989
It'll take me about ten minutes,
so please wait for me.

523
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:08,703
DO NOT ENTER

524
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,749
KIM DON-GUN,
SOUTH CHUNGCHEONG 90J 1398

525
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,167
All right.

526
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,256
-Professor Yu, I have something to…
-Later.

527
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,182
What are you doing?

528
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,935
I need to ask you now, not later.

529
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,645
Get out! Get off now!

530
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,856
I said I have something to ask you!

531
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,899
Darn it. I'm not responsible for this.

532
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,278
Professor Yu.

533
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:47,116
I heard you met
all the truck drivers within a week.

534
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,242
Yes.

535
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:56,667
This is where they park their trucks,
so you must've met a lot of them.

536
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,587
I can't believe
you actually met all of them.

537
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,089
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

538
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,383
I'll check as soon as I can
and return it to you.

539
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,886
It rained a lot that night,

540
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,971
so I'm not sure
what got caught on my dashcam.

541
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:15,311
Goodness. The road there isn't paved,
so it was all muddy.

542
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,314
When it rains, the truck gets messy.

543
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,952
What are you doing?

544
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,129
It's 8:57:14 p.m.

545
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:55,768
It's 8:57:34 p.m.

546
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,020
It's a gray sedan.

547
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,148
What's the number? Four, seven…

548
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,609
What's the last one?

549
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,362
Isn't that 4, 1?

550
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,446
What?

551
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,453
Hey, it's me.

552
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,456
I'll send you a file,
so can you analyze the video

553
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,167
and get me the car model
and its plate number?

554
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,548
Where are we going again?

555
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,759
Aren't we going back to school?

556
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,726
Where did he go?

557
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,730
It's almost time
for the evening roll-call.

558
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,402
What's all this?

559
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,529
KANG SUN-HO

560
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,197
ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION…

561
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,451
THE MIRANDA RULE!

562
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,952
"Miranda"?

563
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,540
Don't you know
that I'll get a penalty for AWOL?

564
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,918
So why did you have to follow me?
I'm so busy.

565
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,672
PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

566
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,550
-Are we going to a police station now?
-Yes.

567
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,343
Why?

568
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,929
I smell something fishy.

569
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,224
I smell something fishy.

570
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,195
If you want to go up, just go.
Why are you waiting here?

571
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,654
Be quiet.

572
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,074
Hey, Detective Lee.
You gained some weight.

573
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,327
I guess you're only working from the desk.

574
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,454
-Gosh.
-Let's go.

575
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,498
Hey, Detective Kim.

576
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,875
I saw that you changed your car.

577
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,793
Don't get any bribes.

578
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm watching you.

579
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,005
I bought it
on a five-year installment plan.

580
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,340
Don't shoot your mouth off.

581
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,426
I was just kidding. See you.

582
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,848
Hello, sir.

583
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,019
Hey, Senior Inspector Yu.

584
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,482
I heard you were going to appoint me
somewhere else again.

585
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,900
Thank you.

586
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,321
But Captain Choi isn't
the type to do that.

587
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,281
Right.

588
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,827
It's not Captain Choi who asked me.

589
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,121
I thought it'd be a waste to let you go.

590
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,791
I didn't want a competent officer like you
to be stuck at school.

591
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,794
I see.

592
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,337
Anyway, what are you doing here?

593
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,216
My colleague got hurt,
so I came to pick up his stuff.

594
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,928
You mean Inspector Park Cheol-jin?

595
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,223
-Yes.
-I see.

596
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,016
They got the real culprit.

597
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,937
They're investigating him now.

598
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,564
They caught him?

599
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,528
Oh, right.

600
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:56,490
I mixed it up
with the Seongsu-dong theft case.

601
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,704
Gosh, how could you mix that up?

602
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,123
I know, right? Good night, then.

603
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,708
-Okay. See you.
-Bye.

604
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,005
-Hey, let's get going.
-Sorry?

605
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,177
Chief Han.

606
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,308
What's this about? Why are we here?

607
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,518
Didn't you see him earlier?

608
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,354
His face when I told him
that the real culprit was caught.

609
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,023
I can tell who's guilty.

610
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,984
They can't hide their feelings
in that instant.

611
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,654
But I only got circumstantial proof.

612
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,197
I have no evidence.

613
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,783
-Gosh.
-What are you going to do?

614
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,537
Well, we'll have to wait
until Cheol-jin wakes up.

615
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,122
Darn it.

616
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:48,375
What did you want to ask me?

617
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,129
I'll ask you later.

618
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,674
Is Cheol-jin okay though?

619
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,480
I was really desperate when I had to
get the money for my dad's hospital fees.

620
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,947
It looks like Professor Yu
is desperate too.

621
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,992
So please wake up soon.

622
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,009
Right.

623
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,137
You said you wanted to ask me something.

624
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,933
-Are you not going to ask me?
-I think I heard my answer.

625
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,309
What?

626
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:00,739
Professor Yu.

627
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,868
Why did you help the drunk man
in the emergency center?

628
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,120
What do you mean?

629
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:09,206
"We need to protect criminals.
They have rights too."

630
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,125
Is that what you believe in?

631
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,379
Beliefs aren't important.
I just follow my instincts.

632
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,298
Why make it so complicated
and question everything?

633
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,801
I don't have such beliefs. It's simple.

634
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,303
"Protect them and catch them." Okay?

635
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,889
If you want to do that,
you'll need to work out.

636
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,184
How can a weak man like you
protect or catch anyone?

637
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,790
Guys, do you want to win
that girl's heart?

638
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,251
-Of course!
-Of course!

639
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,003
-Here I go!
-Bring it on!

640
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,762
LEAVE YOUR JUDO CLUB APPLICATION HERE

641
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,139
This isn't the time for skincare.

642
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,640
We haven't received a single application!

643
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,267
NEW MEMBERS WANTED

644
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,935
Just wait until you get to my age.

645
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,271
Freckles scare me
more than zero applications.

646
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,524
You can't see them now,
but they'll be visible later on.

647
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,279
You tricked me when I was a freshman
and now I have to put up with this.

648
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,615
What do you mean, I tricked you?

649
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,745
You said this would be the highlight
of my campus life. Where are the boys?

650
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,288
I hate you!

651
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,707
What if they decide
to get rid of the club?

652
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,042
This is driving me nuts.

653
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,468
We'd like to join the judo club.

654
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,472
Here come the boys.

655
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,102
Welcome.

656
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,481
I'll teach you how to do a breakfall
to see if you're qualified.

657
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,899
Wait, there's a test?

658
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,486
Here I come!

659
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:12,246
Now that you've joined the judo club
and will be learning from me,

660
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,332
you'll become the toughest cookies
in the entire school!

661
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,088
Maybe it'd be easier to just drop dead.

662
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,006
Then she's mine.

663
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:24,967
Professor.

664
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,594
I want to try one more time. Let's go!

665
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,059
-I'm sorry.
-He doesn't know it yet,

666
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,435
but I joined the relations team too.

667
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,605
-All right!
-Eon-ju is a member of that club.

668
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,526
I can handle two clubs.

669
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,153
-No! I will try one more time. I'm okay!
-I won.

670
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,447
Beom-tae can't beat me.

671
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,866
Look at that!

672
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,288
-My goodness.
-I'm okay.

673
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,039
-Right.
-It hurts.

674
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,542
-I sent you those photos.
-No, I want to try again.

675
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,793
I'm okay!

676
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,671
Joon-wuk.

677
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,798
You call yourself Mr. Popular.

678
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,675
Everyone would agree.

679
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,677
-Right, sure.
-That's right.

680
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,053
Can you send me the photos

681
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,598
of those who tagged
"Korean National Police University"

682
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,016
on Monday night?

683
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,727
-Okay.
-Thanks.

684
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,978
No problem.

685
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,521
KIM BA-DA,
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

686
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,024
It was posted on Monday at 9:30 p.m.

687
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,484
And the person who posted it
used the Wi-Fi

688
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,320
in the lobby at the dorm.

689
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,490
What?

690
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,719
Hey, did you hear?

691
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:57,100
They caught the person
who posted the video of Kang-hui's mother.

692
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,852
What?

693
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,903
So it was you.

694
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,580
What a nasty girl you are.

695
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,624
Everyone!

696
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,628
My daughter tells me
she wants to die before me.

697
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,301
Why did you do that?

698
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,553
Darn it.

699
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,848
Then I'll go show this to Ms. Baek.

700
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,227
I did it to join the student council.

701
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,397
Darn it.

702
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,400
There are only two spots left.

703
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,611
But they look at your grades,
so I can only join if she gives up.

704
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,363
You did that for something so petty?

705
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,782
"Petty"? Don't you know
that the council members

706
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,575
have it easy after joining the force?

707
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,161
If you want to "have it easy"
as a police officer,

708
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,330
you should just quit now, you idiot.

709
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,500
You're not going to tell anyone, right?

710
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,878
Go to the student council's office
and withdraw your application.

711
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,338
-Jeez.
-If you don't,

712
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,215
I'll make you too embarrassed
to stay in school.

713
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:12,884
Hold on.

714
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,595
How did you know it was me?

715
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,766
That look on your face.

716
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,269
I can tell who's guilty.

717
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,771
They can't hide
their feelings in that instant.

718
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,367
Oh Kang-hui's grades are much better,

719
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,661
but with all those talks about her,
we shouldn't let her in.

720
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,996
Totally.

721
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,081
She'll destroy the council's reputation.

722
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,501
We absolutely cannot accept her.
There's no way…

723
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,627
She's here.

724
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,880
I'd like my application back.

725
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,173
Okay, here.

726
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,716
Wait.

727
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,925
Why?

728
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,261
I've decided to withdraw my application,

729
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,640
so you can't disqualify me
for such unfair, ridiculous reasons.

730
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,809
Can I have my application back?

731
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,645
Here.

732
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:12,986
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

733
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,990
HERE'S THE VIDEO ANALYSIS RESULT

734
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,827
HERE'S THE VIDEO ANALYSIS RESULT

735
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,376
Hello?

736
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,505
What? He's awake?

737
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,257
How is he?

738
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,720
PARKING FOR PROFESSORS ONLY

739
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,821
I heard you joined the judo club.

740
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,032
Yes, I want to build strength.

741
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,036
Did you get into the student council?

742
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,872
No, I applied to join the relations team.

743
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,042
I'm a total newsmaker. Who else
would join the relations team if I don't?

744
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,421
So many freshmen will apply next year
if you do the promotion.

745
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,924
I'll make sure
it's more competitive than ever.

746
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,264
It's Professor Kwon's class.

747
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,811
That's it for today's class.

748
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,567
May I

749
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,405
answer the question you asked me
last time?

750
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,494
The answer had better
be worthy of my time.

751
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,007
I stumbled upon a book in the library.

752
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,676
It was a book about Miranda

753
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,845
of the well-known Miranda rule.

754
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,434
Ernesto Miranda was a serial rapist.

755
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,187
He confessed to his rape charges
during a police interrogation,

756
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,023
but the court
ruled his confession inadmissible

757
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,984
because he had not been informed
of his rights to remain silent

758
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,988
and to consult with an attorney,
so he ended up being released on parole.

759
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:26,202
Ultimately, this verdict set an example
that justice can only be truly realized

760
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,704
through lawful means.

761
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,165
However, there are still
many controversies

762
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,541
surrounding this decision.

763
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:37,339
Personally,
I don't agree with the verdict.

764
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,090
The rights of someone who kidnapped

765
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,885
and raped an 18-year-old girl
are not important.

766
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:49,392
But perhaps by following the rules
and accepting everyone's rights,

767
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,979
we can protect those

768
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,067
who truly need to be
protected from such criminals.

769
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,946
So my answer to your question

770
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,239
remains the same.

771
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,241
Be it an innocent civilian

772
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,327
or a criminal.

773
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,454
I believe everyone should be protected,

774
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,998
within the frame of laws

775
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,084
and rules we must follow.

776
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,753
Because we're members of the police

777
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,090
and a law enforcement agency.

778
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,581
The verdict wasn't made
to protect Miranda.

779
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,584
The officer who caused an accident
and led the criminal to die

780
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,963
didn't get dismissed and punished
because the criminal was innocent.

781
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,757
We shouldn't let our emotions
do the judging.

782
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,843
We should leave it to the law.

783
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,805
Understanding the world through the law

784
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,726
is the legal mind you must learn

785
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,104
in the first class
of the Constitutional Law course.

786
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,857
Kang Sun-ho.

787
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,152
Well done.

788
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,511
Good job, Sun-ho.

789
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,072
I didn't know bananas were this good.

790
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,281
My gosh.

791
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,539
Cheol-jin!

792
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,667
Hey, my head! I can't breathe!

793
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,712
Hey! Are you okay?

794
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,631
You punk. You made me worry.

795
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,342
Why didn't you worry about me
when this didn't happen?

796
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,971
Look at him. He's back.

797
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,890
-He's back, Captain.
-Dong-man.

798
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,183
Right.

799
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,560
You remember the jerks
who did this to you, right?

800
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,563
What?

801
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,400
-Dong-man.
-it must've been a big shock.

802
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,153
Then do you remember
the phone call we had?

803
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,323
You said it has something
to do with the Police University.

804
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,702
-What?
-What?

805
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,747
-What?
-What?

806
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,749
What's wrong with him?

807
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,046
It's dissociative amnesia.

808
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,090
He's mentally shocked.

809
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,051
It looks like a whole part
of his memory has been erased.

810
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,012
We'll need to wait and see
if his memory returns.

811
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,142
Let's wait and see.

812
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,518
What do you mean?

813
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,563
You expect me to believe that?

814
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,566
You saw how fine he was.

815
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,734
What? Wait, Doctor!

816
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,404
Shouldn't we do an MRI scan again?

817
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,447
Hey.

818
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:34,200
It's possible to temporarily lose
some memory when you're in shock.

819
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,245
No, that's not possible.
That can't happen.

820
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:40,999
We can't catch those jerks
if he doesn't remember!

821
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,716
YU DONG-MAN

822
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,518
PROFESSOR'S OFFICE

823
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,832
HERE'S THE VIDEO ANALYSIS RESULT

824
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,256
It's 4178.

825
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,299
What?

826
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,842
Wait a minute.

827
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,637
Wait. Hold on!

828
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,180
Professor Yu!

829
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,724
-Excuse me!
-Professor Yu!

830
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,601
Stop right there! Wait!

831
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,478
-Hey!
-Professor Yu!

832
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,527
Stop right there! Hey!

833
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:51,945
Stop!

834
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,365
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

835
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,075
Hey, you punk!

836
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,743
Professor Yu!

837
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,162
I said, stop!

838
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,456
It's a gray sedan.

839
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,960
When it rains, the truck gets messy.

840
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:13,633
This is the last piece of advice
I can give politely to a loser like you.

841
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,885
Leave without causing any trouble.

842
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,513
Wait!

843
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,315
Hey! Darn it…

844
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,988
What? What are you doing here?

845
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,116
You asked for my help.

846
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,660
Do you still need my help?

847
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,996
What did you say, you punk?

848
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:47,875
You asked me to help you
catch those jerks.

849
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,210
Do you still need my help?

850
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,966
I feel like I can

851
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,468
protect those who are hurt

852
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,014
and catch the bad guys when I'm with you.

853
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,644
A way to protect my people.

854
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,689
The right way to protect them.

855
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,234
Not as Hacker Yoon,
but as a student of this school.

856
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,195
Can I find the right way

857
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,656
as I work with you?

858
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,489
This is all the material I collected
while chasing the illegal gambling ring.

859
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,740
I'll come back in a month.

860
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,034
These are the culprit's footprints.
They're 285mm.

861
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,786
Could it be Professor Kwon Hyuk-phil?

862
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,497
I can feel the stare.
Hands are faster than eyes.

863
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,082
-I saw everything.
-Since when?

864
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,833
Since the moment you inserted that wire.

865
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,251
That sly punk.

866
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,128
Let's go. I'm going
to catch him no matter what.

867
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,090
What was that?
You look like you saw a puppy.

868
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,258
If he looks cute to you,
then you're already into him.

869
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,844
Hey! Don't make that toothy smile.

870
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,014
If a student here makes
physical contact to show sexual desire,

871
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,975
they will be expelled instantly.

872
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,852
Oh Kang-hui, you're expelled!
