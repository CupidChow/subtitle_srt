1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:02,919
LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,587
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,427
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:16,016
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,817
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,860
Son!

8
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,323
Dad.

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,333
This website isn't the only one.

10
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,878
We've found more than 300 so far.

11
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,339
The exact same logo.
And the sites are down.

12
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,468
This must be a hacker's doing.

13
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,021
Are you listening?

14
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,192
-When did it start?
-Sorry?

15
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,861
When did the hacking attack begin?

16
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,863
According to the cyber crimes unit,

17
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,240
it began around midnight last night.

18
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,591
Professor Yu.

19
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,177
Professor Seo Sang-hak might
have been wrong,

20
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,765
but what the foundation wanted to achieve
may not have been wrong after all.

21
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,686
I found out that the zelkova tree
represents the Police University.

22
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,480
I just think

23
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,525
that he got into it to protect the school.

24
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,402
The way he did it was wrong

25
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,696
even if the direction was right.

26
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,951
The way he did it was wrong

27
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,286
even if the direction was right.

28
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,011
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

29
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,347
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,808
I'm going to cause trouble
for one last time.

31
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,395
From your foolish student
who learned from his foolish professor.

32
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,282
This brat.

33
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,202
"Foolish professor"?

34
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,454
I'm offended.

35
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,957
Darn it.

36
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,796
This crazy fool.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,340
An unprecedented hacking attack
has occurred.

38
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,551
It targeted
about 1,000 illegal gambling sites

39
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,887
that have servers within the country.

40
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,222
The moment you try to access the websites,

41
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,309
this tree logo appears
and the sites freeze.

42
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,936
The hacker defaced the websites,

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,732
meaning the hacker changed
the visual appearance of the sites.

44
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,317
Hackers normally use this method

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,611
to either show off their skills

46
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,822
-or to send political messages.
-Who knew the world would find out

47
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,616
about the foundation in this manner?

48
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,702
However, this attack doesn't seem
to have a political purpose.

49
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,372
Because of this week-long cyberattack,

50
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,125
most of the illegal gambling sites

51
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,920
with servers based in Korea
have been shut down.

52
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,380
-About 100 sites
-Hey, that hurts!

53
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,007
were shut down daily on average.

54
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,593
The police have stated
that they will carry out

55
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,137
another special crackdown
on online gambling sites,

56
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,266
including the websites
that have been shut down.

57
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,143
All of this began
with an anonymous hacker.

58
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,812
All eyes are on
whether or not this can lead

59
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,067
to a successful crackdown
on illegal gambling sites.

60
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,152
Im Hyeon-seok, KCS News.

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,072
Does this hacker think
he's a superhero or what?

62
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,407
There are so many crazy people
in this world.

63
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,659
I don't know who it is,

64
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,702
but the people who run those sites
are doomed now,

65
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,828
thanks to this guy.

66
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,163
I know.

67
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,959
Let's go. You said they asked for backup.

68
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,043
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,933
What?

70
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,028
DEPOSIT 7,000,000 WON

71
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,446
GO TO COLLEGE!

72
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,618
Your confession alone
can't prove you guilty,

73
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,289
so we'll probably have to investigate
the case you were involved in as a hacker.

74
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,624
Okay.

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,710
Had you pretended not to know about it,

76
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,545
no one would have found out.

77
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,715
Have you never thought about it?

78
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,216
That's why I'm here.

79
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,885
Because I didn't want it to get buried.

80
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,145
Captain.

81
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,859
YU DONG-MAN

82
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,530
-Going to class?
-My goodness.

83
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,199
Where were you hiding?
You always jump out and scare me.

84
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,868
I have my hiding spots everywhere.

85
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,373
You know, the hacking attack.
That was Sun-ho, right?

86
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,667
Didn't you see the news?

87
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,627
They said it was done
by an anonymous hacker.

88
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,881
Come on. Clearly, it was done
by our little Yu Dong-man.

89
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,884
Professor Yu,

90
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,344
you must be lonely
now that Sun-ho is gone.

91
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,849
"Lonely"? Not at all.
Why would I be lonely?

92
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,213
In this class,

93
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,757
we'll go over
how we can protect crime victims

94
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,050
and the systems we have in place
to help them.

95
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,551
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

96
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,391
I'm going to take notes separately
for Sun-ho.

97
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,811
That will take forever.

98
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,814
What the…

99
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,398
-Darn it.
-For my buddy, Sun-ho.

100
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,903
Thank you for accepting our sudden request
and coming here.

101
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,321
I'm a KNPU graduate,

102
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,242
so I've been wanting to teach
at my alma mater for a long time.

103
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,994
Would you like me to start next week?

104
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,623
Yes. You may start with the first-year
Public Administration course.

105
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,916
Sure.

106
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,462
Professor Choi Hee-su
is working here, right?

107
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,923
Yes. She's our judo professor.
Why do you ask?

108
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,718
I've been a long-time fan of hers

109
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,512
since she was a judo medalist.

110
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,597
She's still beautiful, isn't she?

111
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,100
Are you not married?

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,853
I missed the opportunity
because I was busy studying.

113
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,523
I'll get to see her
during my welcome party, right?

114
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,692
There will be no welcome party

115
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,528
-because our budget is tight.
-Sorry?

116
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,989
I'll get going first
because my day is packed.

117
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,660
What?

118
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,877
He doesn't even have students on his mind
when he's a professor.

119
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,883
The 41st Batch, Airheads.
Listen carefully.

120
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,428
When you're assigned to a case
and go to the scene,

121
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,222
you'll be really nervous.

122
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,267
No matter how much you study, practice,

123
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,060
and do image training,

124
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,063
when a suspect runs amok in front of you,

125
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,607
your mind will go blank.

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,984
It's because your life is at stake.

127
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,450
Sometimes,
people will criticize you for no reason.

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,162
Also, your colleague might get injured
right in front of you.

129
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,789
Cheol-jin!

130
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,460
Eun-ju!

131
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,505
You might lose your colleague
during a chase.

132
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,006
Eun-ju!

133
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,137
There will be times when you handcuff
someone close to you.

134
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,389
I once admired you

135
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,060
as my senior.

136
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,028
But I can guarantee you one thing
as your senior.

137
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,161
As much as it's difficult, you'll be happy

138
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,540
as you'll get closer to the truth.

139
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,045
The precious moments with your colleagues.

140
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,215
The first unit, let's go!

141
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,716
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

142
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,302
The moments where you protect someone.

143
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,974
He's different from you.

144
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,643
So save your nonsense for prison,
you jerk.

145
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,229
Kang-hui.

146
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,029
I think what we do

147
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,074
is that much worthwhile.

148
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,580
So don't just think of yourselves
as civil servants with stable jobs.

149
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,584
Stand tall, and be proud of yourselves.

150
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,425
When it gets too difficult
that you can't bear it,

151
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,096
then you can call me.
I'll treat you to soju.

152
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,432
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

153
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,225
That's all for today's class.

154
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,604
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

155
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,495
Professor Yu.

156
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,637
Professor Yu Dong-man.

157
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,346
Kang-hui.

158
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,724
Hello.

159
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,811
Did you eat?

160
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,355
No, not yet.

161
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,356
Come with me.

162
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,858
I'll buy you lunch.

163
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,282
I'll take a combo
for the sandwich with sausages.

164
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,451
-Okay.
-Hold on.

165
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,793
Wait, it was right here.

166
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,795
PREPARING FOR TRANSACTION

167
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,674
It's been paid.

168
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,760
You asked me out to lunch first,
so I ought to treat you.

169
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,845
Thanks.

170
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,721
Make sure to treat me next time.

171
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,931
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

172
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,599
Enjoy.

173
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,229
So? Have you made up your mind?

174
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,314
Who will you choose? Beom-tae or Joon-wuk?

175
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,234
I don't know.

176
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,819
One day,
Beom-tae feels like the right guy,

177
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,737
but the next day,
Joon-wuk seems like the right one.

178
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,657
Hey, what's so difficult about it?

179
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,742
The person you think of
before going to sleep.

180
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,287
The one you miss
when the sun rises or sets.

181
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,831
The one you want to share
the good food you're having with.

182
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,748
Which is it?

183
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,963
The one I want to share
the good food with?

184
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,886
Hey, she's already made up her mind.

185
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,932
Do you have one that pops up in your head?

186
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,560
I used to,

187
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,813
but I gave up on him.

188
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,523
Now, I have someone else.

189
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,694
Is it easy for you to like someone
and to stop liking them?

190
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,030
Yes, because I'm bighearted.

191
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,574
What about you, Kang-hui?

192
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,620
Are you seriously
not going to see Sun-ho again?

193
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,791
Come on, seriously.

194
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,337
We haven't gotten together for a while,
and all we're talking about are men.

195
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,088
Let's change the topic.

196
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,216
You're right. Let's change the topic.

197
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,968
So where do you want to apply
after you graduate?

198
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,554
Well, after I'm done
with position rotations,

199
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,556
I'll probably apply
for an administrative position.

200
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,060
But if the judo professor's position
becomes available, I'll apply for it.

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,728
-Judo professor?
-Yes.

202
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,397
Teaching students is made for me.

203
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,691
What about you, Eon-ju?

204
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,486
You'll be a junior soon,
so you must have a lot on your mind.

205
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,364
I want to apply to a department
that does serious crime investigations.

206
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,783
Serious crimes?

207
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,620
I think you'll do a really good job.

208
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,580
You know it suits you, right?

209
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,460
Are you still scared of me?

210
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,758
Where do you want to apply to?

211
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,344
I want to apply to KCSI.

212
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,764
My goal has always been to go to KCSI
since I got into this school.

213
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,599
What about you, Kang-hui?

214
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,602
I just wanted to join the force.

215
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,438
I didn't think of an exact position
I wanted to apply for.

216
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,608
But I realized it
after taking Professor Yu's class.

217
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,444
-Realized what?
-That I like investigating.

218
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,654
Violent crimes, at that.

219
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,951
What did Professor Yu teach her?

220
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,331
This is good.

221
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,295
Tonight, auditorium.

222
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,212
41ST BATCH JO JOON-WUK

223
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,131
-You don't need to know.
-Who is it?

224
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,841
You all know him.

225
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,134
I think I know who it is.

226
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,303
Already? Was it that obvious?

227
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,929
Cheers.

228
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,018
So you won't be teaching at our school
next semester?

229
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,853
My captain told me

230
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,397
there's a truckload of bad guys
I need to catch.

231
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,983
But there's also
a truckload of students to teach.

232
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,945
That could be done by professors
who are more capable than me.

233
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,990
I want to catch guys who are below me.

234
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,578
How is the new
Public Administration professor?

235
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,038
I don't really like him.

236
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,831
You're at it again.

237
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,583
You're judging him
even before getting to know him.

238
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,295
Why? Why do you not like him?

239
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,756
Is there something suspicious about him?

240
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,468
Is crime investigation
the only genre you know?

241
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,844
I know, right?

242
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,847
What about other genres like melodrama,
romantic comedy,

243
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,683
or perhaps forbidden romance?
They're fun too.

244
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,728
What's with you again?

245
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,188
Forget it.

246
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,567
I'm going to spend the rest of my life
catching the bad guys.

247
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,736
Excuse me.

248
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,155
I need to take this.

249
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,618
There's no fun in life
living the way he does.

250
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,079
What about you?

251
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,413
What?

252
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,123
Are you happy with your life?

253
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,542
What if I'm not?

254
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,462
Should I make you happy from now on?

255
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,428
Melodrama or romantic comedy.

256
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,390
Why don't we give it a go?

257
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,770
That's gross.

258
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,070
So?

259
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,115
Captain reported it,
and things got sorted out.

260
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,201
How?

261
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,453
We decided to confiscate
the money Sun-ho returned

262
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,206
with the profits
that the illegal gambling gang made.

263
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,124
Wait.

264
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,793
Where did he get that large sum of money?

265
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,087
It was either his younger brother
or older brother.

266
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,091
His brother didn't use the money
he gave him.

267
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,176
His father came up with the rest.

268
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,556
Anyway,
all the illegal gambling sites are closed,

269
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,267
and there's no record of
exchanging cryptocurrency for real money.

270
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,185
All we have is his confession.

271
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,105
The case is closed,

272
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,607
but he insists on getting punished.

273
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,276
So I told him to be smart.

274
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,113
-"Be smart?"
-He was a hacker too.

275
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,616
So he will get data
on how they run the programs

276
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,328
and support making the tracking program.

277
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,546
YOON DIGITAL

278
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,722
NAMYANG-DONG 37-1, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL
TO KANG SUN-HO

279
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,608
You didn't eat, right?

280
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,651
Try some of this.

281
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,611
What's this?

282
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,822
It's not much. It's samgyetang.

283
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,784
My wife told me to bring this to Sun-ho.

284
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,287
Gosh, she didn't need to do this.

285
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,289
Thank you for this.

286
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:06,335
By the way,
did Sun-ho really quit the school?

287
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,341
Is he not going to be
a police officer then?

288
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm not sure.

289
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,887
He must have his plans.

290
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,972
As for me…

291
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,974
Whatever he does,

292
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,852
I'll trust him, wait for him,
and support him.

293
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,313
My goodness.

294
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,941
You're like his real father now.

295
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,360
What are you talking about?

296
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,028
Are you saying

297
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,031
-I wasn't his real father until now?
-What?

298
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,283
Sun-ho is my son.

299
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,329
Well, that's not what I meant.

300
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,875
Taek-il. This is made with Korean chicken.

301
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,545
The drumsticks are so big that…

302
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,131
They're like the drumsticks of an eagle.

303
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,927
-Hey, we're ready, right?
-What?

304
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,928
Yes, we are.

305
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,139
I'LL LOVE YOU MORE THAN YESTERDAY

306
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,807
I'm the one who's asking her out,

307
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,600
but why are you more nervous?

308
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,771
Gosh, I know. Why am I so nervous?

309
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,940
So what's the plan?

310
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,026
Okay. So you go out and bring Eun-ju in.

311
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,403
All right.

312
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,405
I'll play the music.

313
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,906
-Good.
-And then,

314
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,742
I'll be hiding behind this.

315
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,911
I'll pass this to you.

316
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,165
That's when you ask her out.

317
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,791
Okay.

318
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,919
Well, Beom-tae.

319
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,214
I know you like her too.
Are you okay with this?

320
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,050
You decided to ask her out first.

321
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,345
And you're my friend.

322
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,223
If you get rejected,

323
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,100
you help me too, okay?

324
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,979
Hey, why would I get rejected?

325
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,815
I'll go and get her.

326
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,317
Okay.

327
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,443
-Good luck!
-Thank you.

328
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,489
Beom-tae.

329
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,200
What?

330
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,162
I like you more than I thought.

331
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,541
Are you rehearsing now?

332
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
Right.

333
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,295
Hey. Should I tone down my voice?

334
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,465
Yes. You should tone down a lot more.

335
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,551
As if you're in a cave.

336
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,470
-Okay.
-Tone down, okay?

337
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,305
-I'll be back.
-Good luck.

338
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,658
They're here.

339
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,743
What do I do?

340
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,263
I'LL LOVE YOU MORE THAN YESTERDAY

341
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,910
Gosh, Eon-ju.

342
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,247
Where's Joon-wuk?

343
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,752
Hold on…

344
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,422
Where is Joon-wuk?

345
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,923
Well…

346
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,466
Joon-wuk told me to come here.

347
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,637
He said you'd be here.

348
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,972
What?

349
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,768
I like you more than I thought.

350
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,901
He said you had something to tell me.

351
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,279
Joon-wuk told me that.

352
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,697
Well…

353
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,996
Noh Beom-tae.

354
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,834
Gosh.

355
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,383
I like you.

356
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,553
What?

357
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,016
I…

358
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,685
I like you. I mean it.

359
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,355
Hey, I can't hear you.

360
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,449
I like you, Lee Eon-ju.

361
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,226
Then let's go out.

362
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,770
Let's see how it goes.

363
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:50,470
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

364
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,145
Did you do that
for friendship or something?

365
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,523
It's more like being considerate.

366
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,899
"Considerate"?

367
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,070
To be honest,

368
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:13,118
I'm handsome and cute.
I'm full of attractive qualities.

369
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,037
I have everything, you know.

370
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,623
But Beom-tae…

371
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,043
It takes time to see his true worth.

372
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,754
And Eon-ju has known Beom-tae for a while.

373
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,717
So I thought she would know by now.

374
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,094
About Beom-tae's charms.

375
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,475
Hey, Jo Joon-wuk.

376
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,728
Are you crying?

377
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,148
No, I'm not.

378
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,693
Gosh, you shouldn't act cool then.

379
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,861
You've been acting so cool and all,

380
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,905
and now you're crying?
Have you lost your mind?

381
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,824
I just got something in my eyes.

382
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,910
Gosh.

383
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,604
I'm okay.

384
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,524
Gosh, everyone but me.

385
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,612
Let's do that melodrama
or romantic comedy.

386
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,699
Gosh, I must be out of my mind.
What am I thinking?

387
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,825
Be mine.

388
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,577
Gosh! Are you crazy?

389
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,163
Stop it.
Don't imagine something like that!

390
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,207
-Honey.
-Gosh, you're crazy!

391
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,169
I must be not feeling well.

392
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,504
Let's work out.

393
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,881
That's right. I should work out.

394
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,595
Professor Choi
must be having a hard time too.

395
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,895
Cheer up, Professor Choi.

396
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,906
Something came from your school.

397
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,432
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

398
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,125
Let's go, Kang-hui.

399
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:50,502
LECTURE HALL

400
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:26,121
2 YEARS LATER

401
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,959
Is someone picking you up?

402
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,794
Your family?

403
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,422
No, I told them not to come.

404
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,841
I don't want them to see me like this.

405
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,509
So no one is coming?

406
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,303
It's hard to get a taxi here.

407
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,891
Well, I'm going to walk a little.

408
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,269
I need to figure out

409
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,021
how I'll earn a living from now on.

410
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,385
Dong-man.

411
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,221
What took you so long?

412
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,769
Hurry up and get in.
I need to get back to work.

413
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,645
JUNGANG PENITENTIARY

414
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,027
Did you come empty-handed?
Where's my tofu?

415
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,740
I brought tofu, of course.
Along with other things.

416
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,952
My gosh. You even got a new car.

417
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,294
What is this?

418
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,589
Can't you tell? It's a lease document.

419
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,216
It's 1,500,000 won a month
with a deposit of 20,000,000.

420
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,885
I have already taken care
of the deposit for you.

421
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,886
As for the rent,

422
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,680
you'll earn money
and pay it monthly from now on.

423
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,433
Dong-man, seriously.

424
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,435
It's in a shopping arcade near the school.

425
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,106
There's a lot of foot traffic in the area,

426
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,234
so I think the business will do well.

427
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,448
You need to focus and do a good job.

428
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,202
It's right by the Police University,
so you can't do bad stuff.

429
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,122
This way, you'll have time
to spend with your kids too.

430
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,500
That's the best, you know.

431
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,128
Don't you hate me?

432
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,258
That's such a silly question.

433
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,886
Hey. You did something bad,
and you paid for it.

434
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,889
I'm sure you've had enough time
to reflect on what you did.

435
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,101
If you do something like that again,
I'll kill you.

436
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,645
So why would I hate you?

437
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,819
That deposit of 20,000,000 is my money.

438
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,488
Don't you ever forget that, okay?

439
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,490
I'll do random inspections

440
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,494
to make sure you're doing a good job
while staying out of trouble

441
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,330
and following the food safety guidelines.

442
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,420
But the thing is,

443
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,425
can't they lower the rent?
Paying 1,500,000 won is a lot.

444
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,760
My goodness.

445
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,347
You've just gotten out of jail,
and you're already preparing to swindle.

446
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,395
I'm sorry, sir.

447
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,649
And thank you.

448
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,651
For everything.

449
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,948
Shut your mouth
and just eat your soft tofu.

450
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,117
How can I eat with my mouth shut?

451
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,912
Here, eat this tofu too. It's all yours.

452
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,915
By the way, what's going on with Sun-ho?

453
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,254
It's just a college entrance ceremony.

454
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,131
Why is my entire family coming?

455
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,259
It's just the three of us.
Of course, we should be there.

456
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,095
Gosh, must you make all this fuss over it?

457
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,141
I promised that I'd be at your college
entrance ceremony no matter what.

458
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,311
You crazy punk.

459
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,313
Hey, you'd better stay out of trouble.

460
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,731
You're asking for the impossible.

461
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,359
I'm young and I'm brimming with passion!

462
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,819
I'll show you I have the guts
to do some crazy things.

463
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,488
And I'll get a girlfriend.

464
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,908
You haven't changed at all
even after serving in the military.

465
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,619
Dad, I'll drive.

466
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,667
Thanks for everything you did
to help Seung-beom pay his tuition.

467
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,127
It's nothing compared to what you've done.

468
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,968
Look at that father-son duo.
You look like two peas in a pod.

469
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,888
Let's go. We'll be late.

470
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,938
You're already handsome enough.

471
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,356
Come on. It's my first day at school.

472
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,774
I guess I'm not late.

473
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,943
Congratulations on getting in, Seung-beom.

474
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,277
Thank you!

475
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,946
I'm so proud of you.

476
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,282
You got into college as soon as
you completed your military service.

477
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,909
-It's no big deal.
-Let's go. We'll be late.

478
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,204
-Let's go.
-So you'll get a degree in sports?

479
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,831
Judo. This, you know.

480
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,124
-My gosh. Judo?
-Yes, like this.

481
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,626
Oh, my. I'm so proud of you.

482
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,712
Gosh, it's nothing.

483
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:33,177
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

484
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,892
Am I getting wrinkles
now that I'm in my third year?

485
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,240
You look pretty.

486
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,908
Come on. Let's go.

487
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,911
Hey, you need to try this.
It's really good.

488
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,038
Really?

489
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,626
-It is really good.
-Right?

490
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,711
I want more.

491
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,051
Right. Would the entrance ceremony
be over by now?

492
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,636
Yes. They must be in the assembly hall

493
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,346
for the Chungram Training by now.

494
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:23,227
Stand up. Sit down. Stand up.

495
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,148
Is that all you've got? Louder!

496
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,399
My goodness.

497
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,902
Practicing these lines every night
has definitely paid off.

498
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,861
Was that okay?

499
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,947
Does it make you want to go home? Hold on.

500
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,659
Hey, Eon-ju.

501
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,370
What? No, it's okay.

502
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,748
Let's go and take care
of the Chungram Training.

503
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,999
Hey, Min-gyu.

504
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,960
Na-rae called me again last night.

505
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,629
Can you take
better care of your girlfriend?

506
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,757
She calls me if she doesn't hear from you
for like ten minutes.

507
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,801
-My gosh, finally.
-What? Are you jealous?

508
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,136
Then date someone.

509
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,346
Darn you.

510
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,933
Let's go meet the 43rd batch.

511
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:27,458
THE 2023 CHUNGRAM TRAINING

512
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,793
Nice to meet you all.

513
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,587
I'm Superintendent Kwon Hyuk-phil,
who will be guiding you

514
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,922
through the entire training process.

515
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,051
You will be split
into three autonomous units

516
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,888
for the movement and assembly training.

517
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,432
Each unit will be led by its unit captain.

518
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,309
Any volunteers?

519
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,981
Trainee Park Jin-u.

520
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,107
I'll do my best.

521
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,818
Trainee Park Min-gyu.

522
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,319
I'll do my best.

523
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,029
Great.

524
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,115
For the captain of the second unit…

525
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,368
Trainee Yoon Ji-hye.

526
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,203
I would like to volunteer.

527
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,122
Trainee Oh Kang-hui.

528
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,623
I would like to volunteer.

529
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,669
All right.
For the captain of the third unit…

530
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,318
Trainee Kang Sun-ho.

531
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,988
I'm confident that I'll do well this time!

532
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,752
You'd better do a good job this time.

533
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,578
I looked through the statute book

534
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,122
for the first time
since I started teaching here.

535
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,542
It's impossible for a student
who dropped out to enter the school again,

536
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,503
but there's an exceptive clause.

537
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,130
What is it that you want to say?

538
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,549
I wanted to check.

539
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,721
I didn't want to give
false hope to him again,

540
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,432
and I didn't want to mess things up

541
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,101
because of my feelings.

542
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,937
That's why I came to see you.

543
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,440
You've gotten to know him,

544
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,568
so if you say no, then that means no.

545
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,613
Do you think

546
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,284
Sun-ho will make a good police officer?

547
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,080
I know that he lacks in many ways.

548
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,123
But…

549
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,419
I think he'll become
a better police officer than I am.

550
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,130
So I don't want him

551
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,300
to lose his chance to learn
from good adults

552
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,594
and to fulfill his dream with his friends,

553
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,263
although he may be lacking.

554
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,472
That's all.

555
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:36,105
Is there really no way I can help him?

556
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,320
There is one.

557
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,825
We can restart everything.

558
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:55,124
PROFESSOR KWON HYUK-PHIL

559
00:38:55,207 --> 00:39:01,797
ADMISSION CANCELATION NOTICE

560
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,177
ADMISSION CANCELATION NOTICE

561
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,265
ADMISSION CANCELATION NOTICE
KANG SUN-HO

562
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,185
THE ABOVE STUDENT HAS PASSED
THE 2021 GENERAL ADMISSION

563
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:18,064
BUT THE ADMISSION HAS BEEN CANCELED
FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON

564
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,904
So that's what happened.

565
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,037
I thought it was all over

566
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,707
because you didn't pick up our calls.

567
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,542
I know.

568
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,252
You punk.

569
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,421
We went to see you
at your place several times.

570
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,761
I'm sorry about that.
I wanted to see you confidently

571
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,763
after I got admitted again.

572
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,977
I'm really happy for you.

573
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:10,282
How can trainers be hanging around
with a trainee?

574
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,539
Let me join you guys.

575
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,754
You know how our school is strict
with batches, right?

576
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,674
You should address us politely at school
even though we're friends.

577
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,758
Of course, sir.

578
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,138
Did you see Kang-hui?

579
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,849
Not yet.

580
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,018
Shouldn't you go see her first?

581
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,441
I'll go see her
after I get admitted officially

582
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,401
after I pass the Chungram Training.

583
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,777
Good.

584
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,823
You should finish the training first.

585
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,116
Where's our next course?

586
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,743
Panting Pass, right?

587
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,662
Hey, that's still part of training?

588
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,165
Trainee Kang Sun-ho, get up.

589
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,208
-Get up.
-Get up!

590
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,419
Can't you hear us, trainee?

591
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,547
Get up. Will you hurry up?

592
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,257
Sit back down.

593
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,758
-Hurry!
-Sit.

594
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,760
-Get up!
-Why are you doing this?

595
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,639
-Gosh, you scared me.
-Sun-ho!

596
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,851
Sun-ho! Welcome back!

597
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,313
Welcome back, Sun-ho!

598
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,485
Youth.

599
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,529
Some moments can't be described
with that word alone.

600
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,114
Stop chasing me, mister!

601
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,325
Hey! You're dead meat!

602
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,535
Hey! Stop right there!

603
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,829
Hey. You…

604
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,040
Back in my day,

605
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,626
I could run 100 meters in 10 seconds!

606
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,629
Then you'd have become
a track and field athlete instead.

607
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:50,049
What? This sounds familiar.

608
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:54,011
You punk. Do kids these days

609
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,555
never lose in arguments?

610
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,225
Look at the old geezer
trying to talk like teenagers.

611
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,976
What? An old geezer?

612
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,855
I'm going to kill you today
and end my career as a detective.

613
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,942
-Come here. Come here, you punk.
-Come and get me.

614
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,653
You're smirking at me? How dare you!

615
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,156
Do you like it when I call you a baby?

616
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,534
The moments where you never give up.

617
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,081
Oh, gosh.

618
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,791
Someone is here.

619
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,252
Oh, no. My first customer is here.

620
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,546
Welcome!

621
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,882
Goodness, you're so loud.

622
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,301
Please sit over here.

623
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,473
Did you come with a group?

624
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,849
I want ice water.

625
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,185
Ice water? Okay.

626
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,273
All right. Here you go.

627
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,983
What's good here?

628
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,068
Our signature dish is tofu
with stir-fried kimchi.

629
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,237
-Tofu with stir-fried kimchi?
-Yes.

630
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,489
My mentor advised me to abide by the law,

631
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,783
-so I chose tofu as our…
-That's good.

632
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,368
Why would she cut me off?

633
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,954
I'm really good at stir-frying kimchi.

634
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,206
Sorry?

635
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,916
LOOKING FOR A PART-TIMER
WORK WITH US

636
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,710
You're looking for a part-timer,
aren't you?

637
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,047
Actually, I'll be the one to cook,

638
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,341
so I'm looking for a part-timer
who can serve.

639
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,596
That's even better.

640
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,932
-Let me see…
-Where are you going?

641
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,147
The decor is quite tacky.

642
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,273
This?

643
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,108
Let's remove this.

644
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,154
We can take our time
and change this place.

645
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,489
Oh, right.

646
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,659
-Do you offer insurance?
-Insurance?

647
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,494
You pay for the unused
annual leaves, right?

648
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,580
I'm sure you have a severance package.

649
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,166
Okay, then.

650
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,586
Let's make things clear.

651
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,339
You see, my daughter

652
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,966
is a cop.

653
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,426
I see.

654
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,596
So what?

655
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:05,142
The moments where you try new things
although you're afraid.

656
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,530
What is it, this time?

657
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,865
Oh, it's…

658
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,786
I heard the produce we grow here

659
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,996
was sent to the orphanage nearby.

660
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,123
You're unbelievable.

661
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,043
Are you done nursing your cellmate?

662
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,878
Oh, yes.

663
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,382
He's become a lot healthier.

664
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,094
These days,
he works out with me every morning.

665
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,305
It's nice that you're a model prisoner,

666
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,349
but you should take care
of your health too.

667
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,892
Sure.

668
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,523
We'll soon have practical training
at a nearby precinct.

669
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,318
So I can't come as often.

670
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,529
Today is my last leave.

671
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,157
Time surely passes fast.

672
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,204
You need to be extra careful

673
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,873
during your practical training.
You know that, right?

674
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,875
Of course.

675
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,045
I must be able to protect myself
to protect the citizens.

676
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,755
That's right.

677
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,884
The moment where you make a mistake,

678
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,678
regret, reflect on yourself,

679
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,221
and get back up on your feet.

680
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,558
MOUNT NAEJANG SCULPTURE PARK

681
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,600
And…

682
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,811
-You look so pretty.
-Really?

683
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,922
JEONGEUP

684
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,090
He was hit by a car.

685
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,217
A male in his twenties.

686
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,719
-He lost consciousness at the scene.
-Let's take him inside.

687
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,305
PARAMEDIC

688
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,602
Thank you so much for all your help.

689
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,479
No, I didn't even do much.

690
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,023
You got the situation under control
right away,

691
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,317
so we got him here
before he reached critical condition.

692
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,653
All right. I have to get going.
I'm running late.

693
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,947
Okay. Thank you so much.

694
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,992
MOUNT NAEJANG SCULPTURE PARK

695
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,890
Drink this.

696
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,893
Thank you.

697
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:36,997
Why did you run?

698
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,874
I would've waited
until you got here anyway.

699
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,423
I…

700
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,425
I won't leave anymore.

701
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,638
I won't…

702
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,931
go anywhere, no matter what.

703
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,895
Even if you push me away

704
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,148
or tell me that you're sick of me,

705
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,112
I won't go anywhere. Never.

706
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,244
Kang-hui, so…

707
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,294
If you do,

708
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,339
I will kill you.

709
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,636
If you leave me again,

710
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,640
I will break your legs.

711
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,751
The moments that make your heart burst
with excitement.

712
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,924
Your youth is
at the heart of such moments.

713
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,890
Oh, boy.

714
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,351
Are you doing a good job?

715
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,354
It's so stressful.

716
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,190
POLICE STATION

717
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,400
You're trying to slack off
when it's only been a year.

718
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,943
Don't say stuff like that.

719
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,447
I miss my school days.
It's rough out there.

720
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,076
What about you? Don't you miss the school?

721
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,872
Why would I?

722
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,465
Captain.

723
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,967
-The report?
-On your desk. I have to go.

724
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,219
Hey, wait!

725
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,512
Here.

726
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,308
Catch all the bad guys!
You can do it, Detective Joo!

727
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,851
I can do it.

728
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,311
Be safe!

729
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,201
KANG HAS LOGGED IN

730
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,955
Hey! I got into the Police University.

731
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,961
HEY! I GOT INTO THE POLICE UNIVERSITY

732
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,380
Goodness, this fool…

733
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,306
THE 2025 APPOINTMENT CEREMONY
FOR INSPECTORS AND SENIOR INSPECTORS

734
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,478
Dad, I'm a police officer now.

735
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,855
Gosh, you.

736
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,858
-You're a police officer now?
-Yes, I am!

737
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,818
-Eon-ju!
-Hey.

738
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,445
-Thanks for coming.
-No problem at all.

739
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,364
Congratulations on your graduation.

740
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,448
Thanks.

741
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,450
-Right, my dad is here.
-Father!

742
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,161
-My dear Eon-ju!
-It's so good to see you.

743
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,080
-You look pretty today.
-Me?

744
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:48,415
He treats her like his daughter-in-law.

745
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,002
-Here. Congratulations, Joon-wuk.
-Thank you.

746
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,880
-You need to date too.
-I'll figure it out.

747
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,883
-Shall we?
-Yes.

748
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,803
So do you work in Mapo?

749
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,388
My gosh, I heard it's the toughest area.

750
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,806
Yes, in the patrol division.

751
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,601
It's fun. It's really fun,

752
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,311
so I don't know why I keep crying.

753
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,105
You too? Me too!

754
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,524
All I do is clean up
when the drunkards vomit.

755
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,984
Me too.

756
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,070
-Are you stressed?
-Yes.

757
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,113
-Is it that stressful?
-Yes.

758
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,781
-My baby is stressed.
-Hold on a second.

759
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,074
-What?
-I don't want you to be stressed.

760
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,200
No one is more stressed out
than I am right now.

761
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,201
Let go.

762
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,745
Don't! Don't you dare.

763
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,289
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

764
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,749
-Let's go.
-You heard them.

765
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,459
-Hey!
-What's your problem?

766
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,752
-Darn it.
-My goodness.

767
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,878
-In Mapo…
-Hey!

768
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,087
-Stop!
-What's your problem?

769
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,088
Go. Get out.

770
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,632
-Let's go.
-Leave him alone.

771
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,425
-Come on.
-What's his problem?

772
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,063
Mom!

773
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,485
These flowers cost me 35,000 won.

774
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,113
Why are flowers so expensive?
You can't even eat them.

775
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,698
You've never bought me flowers before.

776
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,659
Stop complaining, will you?

777
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,995
This is all a sales gimmick.

778
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,873
Anyway, don't date guys
who buy you flowers.

779
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,044
You didn't come to my entrance ceremony,

780
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,545
but you made it today.

781
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,007
Of course, I should be here,

782
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,426
no matter what.

783
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,263
You have no idea
how much I wanted to be here.

784
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,688
Where's your boyfriend?

785
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,322
Kang-hui.

786
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,370
I'm going to date a guy
who buys me flowers.

787
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:54,541
You stay away from such men.
You have such low standards for men.

788
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,420
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

789
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,423
-Did you eat?
-Just a little.

790
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,299
Did you take a day off?

791
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,969
-No, just a half-day off.
-Oh, I see.

792
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,056
Let's take a photo together, all of us.

793
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,767
No, I'm good.

794
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,185
I'll take a photo of the two of you.

795
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,520
He wants to take a photo with all of us.

796
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,813
Let's take one.

797
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,696
Here.

798
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,782
Here we go.

799
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,076
In three, two, one.

800
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,539
Gosh, it's amazing.

801
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,665
-It's so convenient.
-It's fascinating.

MARCH 14TH, FRIDAY

805
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,978
Everyone I love is in here.

806
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,994
Everyone, please take your seat.

807
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,080
The 2025 Appointment Ceremony

808
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:18,333
for newly appointed inspectors
and senior inspectors will begin.

809
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,226
Salute to the president.

810
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,603
-Salute!
-Salute!

At ease.

813
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,402
The president is going to present
the certificate of appointment

814
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,322
on behalf of the Commissioner-General.

815
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,201
Inspector Oh Kang-hui.

816
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,748
Salute.

817
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,553
Inspector Noh Beom-tae.

818
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,431
Salute.

819
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,897
Inspector Park Min-gyu.

820
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,153
Salute.

821
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,992
Inspector Jo Joon-wuk.

822
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,830
Salute.

823
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,960
Inspector Min Jae-kyeong.

824
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,797
Salute.

825
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,927
We're going to wrap up the ceremony
after reciting an oath

826
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,429
to become a protector of human rights.

827
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,847
An oath to become
a protector of human rights.

828
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,266
An oath to become
a protector of human rights.

829
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,310
-One.
-One.

830
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:03,188
We will become a protector of human rights

831
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,273
that guard everyone's freedom and rights.

832
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:06,983
-One.
-One.

833
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,486
We will become impartial officers

834
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,322
who enforce laws
according to our consciences.

835
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,323
-One.
-One.

836
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,533
We will become heartwarming officers

837
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,952
who protect the disadvantaged.

838
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,790
About-face.

839
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:29,339
Salute to the senior officers
and your parents.

840
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,882
-Salute.
-Salute.

841
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:37,847
THE 2025 APPOINTMENT CEREMONY
FOR INSPECTORS AND SENIOR INSPECTORS

842
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,177
Do you envy them?

843
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:17,929
Professor Yu.

844
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,724
I thought you were busy.

845
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,518
No matter how busy I am,

846
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,687
I can't miss the airheads' graduation.

847
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:31,192
It'd have been nice
if you could graduate with them.

848
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,615
No, I'm glad
that I'm not graduating with them.

849
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:43,580
I'll need to learn a lot more
if I want to catch a criminal with you.

850
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,083
Goodness.
Then how much longer must I wait for you?

851
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,627
I'm a junior now,

852
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,379
so two more years until graduation,

853
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,756
and two more years in the army.

854
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,551
Hey, are you going to join me
when I'm over 50?

855
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,678
I'll join you as soon as possible

856
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,180
since you're very much looking forward
to working with me.

857
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,644
Professor Yu.

858
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:11,190
I've always been curious.

859
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,567
Look over here.

860
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,361
I've always wondered
what made people so happy,

861
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,113
desperate,

862
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,699
and passionate.

863
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,284
In three, two, one.

864
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,661
But this thought occurred to me.

865
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,788
While I was in school,

866
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,207
I must've seemed like
one of those people to some.

867
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,337
Someone desperate, passionate,

868
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,672
and enjoying the moments.

869
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,507
In two, one.

870
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,844
Thanks to my dad, Kang-hui, my friends,

871
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,847
and you,

872
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,433
I could realize it.

873
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,978
That I'm also one of those people.

874
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,277
It's not like you're graduating today.

875
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,820
Come on, Professor Yu.

876
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:01,157
Thanks to you,
my heart became full after a long while.

877
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,785
I thought I had gotten old.

878
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:07,080
I thought both my body and mind
had gotten old.

879
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,665
But they weren't.

880
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:12,335
Thanks to you, I became young again.

881
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,173
I quit smoking,

882
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:20,343
but I can't seem to quit nicotine gum.

883
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,388
Sun-ho, Professor Yu.

884
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,306
