Sorry, honey!

Wait. This is…

Sorry.

Are you crazy? You're dead.

68
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,837
I'm leaving.

69
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,426
Where is she?

70
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,931

Yes!

73
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,718
Something's wrong with the cameras.

74
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,595
That's weird.

75
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,388
Gosh, what's wrong with them?

76
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,890
Let's check Camera One first.

77
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,819
-You said it.
-Are you kidding?

78
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,320
-It's crazy.
-Totally.

79
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,905
Yes!

80
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,117
He's good.

81
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,748
Make sure not to miss the timing.

82
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,044
My goal is Park Eun-ji, not a medal.

83
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,716
I couldn't make it to the finals anyway,
so I'm just going to ask her out.

84
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,843
You idiot.

85
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,803
What will you say?

86
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,265
"I love you. Be mine.
You're more precious than a medal."

87
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,725
-For real?
-Yes.

88
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,310
She's more precious than a medal.

89
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,105
-What's your ideal type?
-A woman.

90
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,606
Eun-ji is a woman.

91
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,443
Of course. How would you know about love?

92
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,654
Of course I do.

93
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,783
It's when your heart gets ticklish
that you want to keep scratching it.

94
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,624
"Eun-ji, you're all I have."

95
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,710
"Seung-beom, you're all I have too."

96
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,253
"Let's love each other forever."

97
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,673
What does he like so much about her?

98
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,845
What makes them
want to win so desperately?

99
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,389
What makes them laugh?

100
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,393
I don't understand.

101
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,645
I get that.

102
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,941
I get that this is my only shot
to get at least a bronze medal.

103
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,736
It doesn't make sense to give up

104
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,446
just because of this injury!

105
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,490
I get that, so why don't you understand?

106
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,867
You brat.
It's not like you have other arms.

107
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,452
Don't be stubborn!

108
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,496
Arms can heal even if they're broken!

109
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,748
This moment will never come again.

110
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,959
I'm going to do what I want to do
right now with no regrets.

111
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,005
Are you sure this isn't about losing?

112
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,257
Nobody wants to lose.

113
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,594
Hey! Oh Kang-hui!

114
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,804

You can do it!

120
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,262
I became curious

121
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,016
to know why she was so desperate to win.

122
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,022
Where did she learn

123
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,190
to become so passionate?

Of course I do.

It's when your heart gets ticklish

00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,453
I thought he liked you.

It was that mouse.

173

That mouse moved by itself.
That's what happened.

How about I raise the rent

Just don't tell Mr. Yoon.

183
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,015
You've grown so well.

184
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,602
Who would think
that you'd gone through hardship?

185
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,652
No one would.

186
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,113
You're 19 now.
I guess you'll have to stand alone.

187
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,616
Mr. Yoon has been through a lot.

188
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,289
Hey.

189
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,461
Why did you bring him here?
He should be studying.

190
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,506
-Go inside.
-It's not like that, Mr. Yoon.

191
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,718
-Go inside now.
-Gosh, let's get some sleep. It's late.

192
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,974
Dad. You could pass out
if you overwork like that.

193
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,852
My goodness.

194
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:23,023
How lucky you are
to have sons who care for you.

195
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,358
I'll get going.

196
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,279
Right, Dad.

197
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,781
Don't forget to come to school tomorrow.

198
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,533
For the admission consultation.

199
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,494
What about you?

200
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,413
Not yet.

201
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,685
KANG DONG-YEONG
HAN YEONG-SEON

202
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,242
You must be Sun-ho, right?

203
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,411
I am

204
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,621
a friend of your dad.

205
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,623
I'm Yoon Taek-il.

206
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,799
Why don't you come and stay with us?

207
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,230
Say that you lost. Say it!

208
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,609
YOON SEUNG-BEOM

209
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,235
No, I won't. Never.

210
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,821
Go away, you jerk.
Go back to where you were.

211
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,990
Get out of my house.

212
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,456
I lost.

213
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,416
Get out.

214
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,626
I said, get out!

215
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,764
Mom…

216
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,184
Dad…

217
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,363
What does your father do?

218
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,324
What does your father do?

219
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,786
All the parents except yours have come.

220
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,330
You haven't told them.

221
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,249
I'll just apply to any university.

222
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,751
I've sorted out all the universities

223
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,088
that offer scholarships and dormitories.

224
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,424
I've printed it out for you.

225
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,759
I'll just pick one among these.

226
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,053
I'm aware of your situation.

227
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,514
But don't you have a dream?

228
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,976
Things you want to do,
places you want to go,

229
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,395
and dreams to realize.
Don't you have any of that?

230
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,481
DREAM JOB

231
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,234
Then…

232
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,528
how about a public official?

233
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,449
Even if you have good grades,
you will need to develop your strength

234
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,825
to get in there.

235
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,536
It's a special national university.

236
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,039
They provide school expenses
and dormitories,

237
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,832
as well as other benefits.

238
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,002
You'll be a police executive
once you graduate.

239
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,462
How great is that?

240
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,715
If you don't have anything to rely on,

241
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,384
you'd better choose a safe option.

242
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,178
-Yes, Dad.
-What are you going to eat?

243
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,722
-I'll have tangsuyuk.
-Tangsuyuk?

244
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,642
-Can I?
-Sure thing.

245
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,144
Dad wants to wait for you
and have jjajangmyeon.

246
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,687
When are you leaving?

247
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,523
BESTIE

248
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,108
I'll be staying late studying.

00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,593

THE HIGHEST ACCEPTANCE RATE

254
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,312
The Police University?

255
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,534
Why? Is there something?

256
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,912
No, nothing.

257
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,580
How's it going with your test?

258
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,793
I barely passed the cut-off score.
You've done well in it, right?

259
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,169
I'm still nervous.

260
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,213
I'll just die if I don't get in.

261
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,549
I'm doing this for my dad.

262
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,592
Why do you want to go
to the Police University?

263
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,098
Because it's my dream
to become a police officer.

264
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,559
Dream?

265
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,443
PS DELIVERY SERVICE

266
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,453
-Let's go.
-Okay.

267
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,663
MARCH FORWARD TO YOUR DREAM!

268
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,999
MARCH FORWARD TO YOUR DREAM!

269
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,585
MARCH FORWARD TO YOUR DREAM!

270
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,318
Player four, on standby.

271
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,535
There's a lot going on here.

272
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,708
-The banker…
-Hello.

273
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,419
You can place your bets
using your cyber money.

274
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,379
Yes, I'm aware.

275
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,173
I know the drill, of course.

276
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,719
But where's the restroom?

277
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,473
Yes, go ahead.

278
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,851
The betting system
uses their special technology,

279
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,104
so it's sent to the headquarters
if it breaks.

280
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,397
But how do we break it?

281
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,403
There's always a way.

282
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,832
I got the location. Okay, we got it.

283
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,543
You're all dead meat.

284
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,838
You're dead meat.

285
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,092
Hey, you lost 100 million won.

286
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,846
I was told I had to spend that much to get
to the VIP casino, so I had no choice.

287
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,765
Also, I wouldn't have spent my own money

288
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,559
if our budget was big enough.

289
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,102
You crazy fool.

290
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,646
Do you think
everyone stays within the budget

291
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,398
because they can't do what you did?

292
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,775
Even two years ago,
you spent your own money

293
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,652
to catch the voice phishing ring.

294
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,655
-The exact amount was 13 million won.
-Goodness…

295
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,408
But I managed to catch them.

296
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,243
It's not easy to track down
cryptocurrency transactions.

297
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,953
Even the Cybercrime Unit
struggles with it.

298
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,087
That's why I worked at it for over a year

299
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,425
and managed to become a VIP
to get into that on-site casino.

300
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,677
Once they move the betting terminal,

301
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,762
we can put all the higher-ups behind bars,

302
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,640
so just sit back
and get ready to celebrate.

303
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,436
Thanks to you, my head will be
on the chopping block soon.

304
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,522
Gosh, I'm anxious.

HEY, WHY ARE YOU SO LATE?

312
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,935
Don't you have your exams?
I heard you're taking summer classes.

313
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,645
IT'S ALMOST OVER

314
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,772
WHAT ABOUT THE THING I ASKED YOU FOR?

315
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,275
Here, the online account
backtracking program.

316
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,529
THANKS!

317
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,615
HAVE YOU DECIDED
ON WHICH COLLEGE TO APPLY FOR?

318
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,326
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING?
COMPUTER ENGINEERING, RIGHT?

319
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,911
YOON?

320
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,954
Answer me, Yoon.

321
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,539
It's not even a difficult question.

322
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,083
Why is he all quiet?

323
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,168
Sir, is your ID "Bird"
because you're a cop?

324
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,546
Hey, I told you
to just drop the honorifics.

325
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,965
You're rude to me anyway.

326
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,009
It must be this guy. Your online buddy.

327
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,054
You talk to him every night
and tell him all your secrets.

328
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,555
Hey, get lost.

329
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,559
Why must you always be so mean to me?

330
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,561
What? Got a problem with that?

331
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,648
The terminal is on the move.

332
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,109
You little…

333
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,320
-Why didn't you tell me sooner?
-What? What are you doing?

334
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,656
Where are you going?
Captain put us on standby.

335
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,242
Be on standby, my foot.
I'm so anxious right now.

336
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,868

00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,131
I applied to the Police University.

339
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,174
The written exam is tomorrow.

340
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,092
What?

341
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,928
BIRD HAS LOGGED OUT

342
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,643
You're still up?

343
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,313
Are you going somewhere?

344
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,608
Who asked you to come at this late hour?

345
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,694
Who cares what time it is?
I need to make money.

346
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,404
Then I'll go with you.

347
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,323
It's okay. Go back in and do your thing.

348
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,576
You can't even see well at night.

349
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,536
Let me come with you. I'll drive.

350
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,414
See? Isn't it nice
your son got his license early?

351
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,708
You should go to bed.

352
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,888
Hold on! Slow down!

353
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,229
Captain will punch you
if you get another ticket.

354
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,608
Criminals don't obey the speed limit
when they're on the run.

355
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,651
This is why we lose them all the time!

356
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,197
Goodness. Are you sure we're going there
on our own without the others?

357
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,242
I've spent my security deposit,
and I've maxed out my loans!

358
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,371
If I lose the 100 million won,
I'll become homeless.

359
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,122
No one told you to do it.

360
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,875
I had to do it
because I'm a police officer!

361
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,001
Make a right turn here.

362
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,802
Less than 30km per hour
in residential areas!

363
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,764
Dad, are you sure it's here?

364
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,766
Go further up the street.

365
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,812
Goodness, hold on.

366
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,480
Wait! Slow down.

367
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,443
-Gosh.
-Hold on, careful!

368
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,445
-Hey!
-Oh, no!

369
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,634
2021 POLICE UNIVERSITY ADMISSION
WRITTEN EXAMINATION

370
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,309
MISSED CALL
BESTIE

371
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,227
What's going on?

372
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,397
Hey, what's up?

373
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,567
What?

374
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,194
Gosh.

375
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,988
What? You dodged?

376
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,491
You went to raid a scene on your own,

377
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,577
caused an accident,
and even hurt civilians.

378
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,081
Why not be the captain, the chief,
and everything else while you're at it?

379
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,499
What will you do now?

380
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,417
My point, exactly.

381
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,505
What do you think?

382
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,924
-I'll track them down.
-As if…

383
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,054
Hey, go ahead.

384
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,015
Captain.

385
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,017
They're already gone.

386
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,061
-What?
-Darn it.

387
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,023
"Track them down," my foot.

388
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,942
You punk. The casino is empty.
They're already gone.

389
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,447
Why do we always have to
clean up the mess that you make?

390
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,200
Those damned scumbags…

391
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,620
If you go ahead and do anything

392
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,205
without permission again,

393
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,290
you'll be asked to resign.

394
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,754
Just fire me now, then.

395
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,715
Actually, no. I'll do it of my own accord.

396
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,845
I get that you're becoming
cowardly with age,

397
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,764
but enough is enough. Okay?

398
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:12,310
Causing an accident and hurting civilians?
Yes, I'm sorry. I know it's horrible,

399
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,937
and the guilt is driving me crazy.

400
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,773
But if you go out there
worrying about everything,

401
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,401
it's not like criminals will be
waiting for us to arrest them.

402
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,946
How are you expecting us to catch anyone

403
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,073
when our budget is that tiny?

404
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,699
-I'm always put on standby.
-Hey…

405
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,035
Why must we always be on standby?

406
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,372
-I'm embarrassed, annoyed, and sorry.
-My gosh.

407
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,833
It's driving me crazy too.

408
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,085
Do you really have to do this, seriously?

409
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,586
Must you do this?

410
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,630
Look, I'm only wearing my underwear now.

411
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,132
What do you say?
Shall I take this off too? Just say so!

412
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,385
Yu Dong-man, have you lost your mind?

413
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,764
He's my supervisor,
but he's a little crazy.

414
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,016
I see…

415
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,438
Anyway, I'm really sorry about all this.

416
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:03,069
My supervisor feels so bad that
he couldn't give this to you in person.

417
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,322
We're mutually responsible
for the accident.

418
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,616
-It's okay.
-Please take it.

419
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,742
No, it's okay.

420
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,202
Should I take this off too?

421
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,788
What are you doing at the hospital
in broad daylight?

422
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,748
At the hospital, in broad daylight.

423
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,793
Did you really have to kick
this 40-year-old man in the shin?

424
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,920
Goodness gracious.

425
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,006
-Darn it.
-You did nothing to be proud of.

426
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,467
You punk. Cheol-jin got hurt again
because of you!

427
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,595
Jeez.

428
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,430
Darn it.

429
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,599
Darn it.

430
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,694
It's a relief though.
Your son didn't get hurt.

431
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,696
Right. He's your only son, right?

432
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,283
No, I have two sons.
The other one must be on his way here.

433
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:54,037
My gosh, you must be
reassured to have two sons.

434
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,207
Gosh, your son is here.

435
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,086
Of course I'm reassured.

436
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,006
It's cancer.

437
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,176
It's hard to spot stage one cancer.

438
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,803
I must say, it's all thanks
to the accident.

439
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,642
So you're saying he'll be okay
after getting surgery, right?

440
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,769
That is why

441
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,229
I suggest he gets a robotic surgery.

442
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,524
How much will that be?

443
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,361
It's a non-benefit surgery,
so it's around seven million won.

444
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,239
Or we could give him other treatments.

445
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,076
-Like we could remove…
-Remove?

446
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,828
No, that's not what I meant.

447
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,790
We'll take that robotic surgery.
We'll take that no matter what.

448
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:39,832
Gosh.

449
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,002
How did he get that cancer?

450
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,088
He's so kind and diligent.

451
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,091
-My gosh.
-Where is his hospital?

452
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,676
I'm going to see him right now.

453
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,719
You won't be able to see him anyway.

454
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,971
What?

455
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,265
-While we're on the topic…
-Yes?

456
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,893
For our dad…

457
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,689
Can you lend us some money for my dad?

458
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,357
Seven million won for his surgery.

459
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,360
I'll make sure to pay back
after I become successful.

460
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,278
It's seven million won?

461
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,991
Okay.

462
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,754
YOON DIGITAL

463
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,349
You look like you're carrying
all the burden on your shoulders.

464
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,686
Come on. Lighten up a little.

465
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,230
You have a family and a home.

466
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,945
Okay, Mr. Yoon.

467
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,906
Stop calling me that.

468
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,368
Won't you call me your dad?

469
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,821
Hey, stop it already.

470
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,076
Stop it! We don't have any money!

471
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,329
He couldn't see a dentist
even when he was in pain for six months.

472
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,416
He barely handled the pain
by taking painkillers.

473
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,670
We're so damn poor!

474
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,258
Hey, let's just steal some money
from the pawnshop.

475
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,844
You know how he rips off money
from the elderly, right?

476
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,805
Is it a crime to steal from those guys?

477
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,848
Last year, the government estimated…

478
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,892
What can we do? We have no better option!

479
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,143
…was 54 trillion won.

480
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,646
Due to the growing number
of online gambling sites,

481
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,481
-the police announced
-No.

482
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,358
-that they will conduct
-I found a way.

483
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,152
special regulations.

484
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,238
Let's hear more from Reporter Kim.

485
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,781
This is an office in Busan.

486
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,700
Credit details can be seen
on one of their monitors.

487
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,660
KM BANK:
MR. YU DONG-MAN

488
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,912
PLEASE PAY YOUR LOAN
IN FULL BY AUGUST 31TH

489
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,247
Darn it.

490
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,875
Gosh, this is so annoying.

491
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,294
Right.

492
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,926
-Hello.
-Hey.

493
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,870
Hey. Please do this for us.

494
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,330
A guy like me can never
make that kind of money.

495
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,249
But you can.

496
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,334
You…

497
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,336
can save my dad.

498
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,511
It's simple.

499
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,889
The money that people use
to bet on this site

500
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,724
is all saved as cryptocurrency.

501
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,519
INCHEON

502
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,897
We'll hack the cryptocurrency accounts

503
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,065
of the bad guys
who run those illegal sites.

504
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,779
I'm sure the cryptocurrency
they used to bet on those sites

505
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,033
will end up in their main bank accounts.

506
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,826
When they transfer their money,

507
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,204
you use this program
and track down their accounts.

508
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,258
Dong-man.
They're transferring their money.

509
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,886
Then you should track
their main account first.

510
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,015
They can't report us anyway
because it's illegal.

511
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,017
We'll only steal
the money for the surgery.

512
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,572
My gosh. You always fixed
people's broken computers.

513
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,824
You've improved a lot!

514
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,660
I found it.

515
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,411
HOW MUCH WILL YOU TRANSFER?

516
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,581
Hey, if I press Enter now,
we can't turn back.

517
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,627
If this goes wrong,
we might end up in prison.

518
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,170
Didn't you watch Tazza?

519
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,590
"We should go for it
even if we don't win."

520
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,101
Yes!

521
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,397
We've been hacked.
I'll delete the account.

522
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,652
Dong-man.

523
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,280
I think they're being hacked
by someone else.

524
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,364
What?

525
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,869
We did it!

526
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,079
Yes, we did!

527
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,580
What are you talking about?

528
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,000
What's going on?

529
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,419
What's going on? Wait.

530
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,461
Corporal Joo!

531
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,630
I'm working on it!

532
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,090
THIS WEBPAGE CANNOT BE FOUND

533
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,013
Hey.

534
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,559
All their websites and accounts are gone.
There's no way we can catch them.

535
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,186
The year we spent working on them
was all for nothing!

536
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,439
Since I take pity on you,

537
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,691
I won't let you resign.

538
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,068
I'll have you transferred.

539
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,697
You're suspended. Get out of here!

540
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,326
How can we catch the criminals
if we follow all the regulations?

541
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,161
Also, this wasn't even my fault.

542
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,372
-Some lunatic messed up with our work…
-You'd better shut your mouth!

543
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,918
I don't need a cop like you
who rides the high horse on our team.

544
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,378
Get out.

545
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,673
Get out, you punk!

546
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,232
Please let my dad take that robot surgery.

547
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:24,320
Make sure to kill all the cancer cells
right then and there.

548
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,657
It seems like your dad is really upset.

549
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,452
His younger son will take care of that.

550
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,580
So how old are you?

551
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,207
I'm so sorry.

552
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,255
I'd be more at ease
if you just scold me or give me a beating.

553
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,717
Like how you treat Seung-beom.

554
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,058
Get some rest.
You have surgery tomorrow morning.

555
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,031
Gosh, your sons paid for your surgery

556
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,992
with the money they earned
from their part-time jobs.

557
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,328
Goodness.

558
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,303
You little…

559
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,861
YOU HAVE PASSED
THE POLICE UNIVERSITY WRITTEN EXAM

560
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,320
SEE BELOW FOR INFORMATION

561
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,490
ON THE PHYSICAL ABILITY TEST
AND IN-PERSON INTERVIEW

562
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,744
OH KANG-HUI

563
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,455
"YOU HAVE PASSED
THE POLICE UNIVERSITY WRITTEN EXAM"

564
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,706
I PASSED! LET'S GO TO THE NEXT STEP!

565
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,175
Run! Keep going.

566
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,682
Okay, you passed.

567
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,478
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

568
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,742
My goodness…

569
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,870
You need to get some sleep.

570
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,247
-You see…
-Goodness.

571
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,542
I'll make sure I catch those jerks
no matter what

572
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,002
before I sleep or drop dead.

573
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:48,464
You're suspended right now.

574
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,966
Right, that's why
I need you to do something.

575
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,510
What? Me?

576
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,263
-Today is my first day back at work!
-Hey.

577
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:02,478
Those hackers cashed out the coins,
and I'm sure a bank account was involved.

578
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,773
Contact the bank for cooperation
and find out the transaction time.

579
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,233
If they withdrew the money,

580
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,109
get the CCTV footage. You have an hour.

581
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,404
But why do you need to catch them?

582
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,864
I must ask them

583
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,617
how they managed to hack
into the account in one blow.

584
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,411
But we'll lock them up first.

585
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,205
Those damned criminals.

586
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,207
-Here.
-More lettuce, please.

587
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,211
-Sure.
-My special giant wrap. Here, Dad.

588
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,504
It's okay. You eat it.

589
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,838
I've already eaten a lot.

590
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,215
I'll eat myself. You eat it.

591
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,467
You were discharged today,
so you must eat well.

592
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,679
-Here.
-I'll make my own wrap. You go ahead.

593
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,099
It's so good.

594
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,980
I digest everything so quickly.
I have to use the restroom.

595
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,242
-Can we get a bottle of soju?
-Sure.

596
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,994
You were discharged today.

597
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,662
Your doctor said you shouldn't drink.

598
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,832
It's for you, not me.
It looks like you could use a drink.

599
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,208
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

600
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,231
My head hurts when I think of Seung-beom.

601
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,568
But when I think of you, my heart hurts.

602
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:37,364
How could I treat you guys the same
when you two are so different?

603
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,369
And you don't act in the same way
Seung-beom does to me.

604
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,249
You never whined
about what you wanted to do or have.

605
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,711
You didn't tell me when you had
your admission consultations.

606
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,631
I spoke to your teacher on the phone.

607
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,424
I heard you've decided to go
to the Police University.

608
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,053
You finally have something you want to do

609
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,347
and are eager to make it happen.

610
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,223
As your dad,

611
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,101
I am so happy to see that.

612
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,482
Maybe the cancer cells died off

613
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,276
because I'm so happy.

614
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,371
What? What about me?

615
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,290
Am I not getting any soju? Come on, Dad!

616
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,750
I'll just have one glass.

617
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,169
-Give me some.
-You punk. Who do you take after?

618
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,254
Goodness, thank you.

619
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,716
Is it good?

620
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,635
Is it your first glass?

621
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,220
My gosh.

622
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,514
What brings you here, Detective?

623
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,184
Well, the thing is…

624
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,410
So you did this
because of your father's hospital bill?

625
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,707
The whole thing happened
because that man caused the accident.

626
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,251
Can't you just let it go?

627
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,794
We let the accident go.

628
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,712
Hey, this is different.

629
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,506
Then what do you want us to do?

630
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,882
What would you have done?

631
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,010
Let's be honest. How else would
we make seven million won overnight?

632
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,721
It doesn't mean you can steal
even if there's no other way.

633
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,768
Is it wrong to steal from bad people?

634
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,231
We're not the ones you should be after.

635
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,692
Isn't it the jerks
who ran the illegal gambling site?

636
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,702
We'll lock you guys up first,
then we'll also catch them

637
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,705
and lock them up in the same cell,
so don't you worry about that.

638
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,664
Hey, move.

639
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,794
Your name.

640
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,422
What is your name?

641
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,259
Kang Sun-ho, Yoon Seung-beom.

642
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,637
What? How come
you have different surnames?

643
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,598
That's personal.

644
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,600
-Is that important now?
-Age.

645
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,643
We're 19.

646
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,063
Profession, high school students. Address?

647
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,108
Namyang-dong 37-1, Jongno-gu, Seoul.

648
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,611
-And you?
-Can't you tell we live together?

649
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,613
You little…

650
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,325
You violated the Information
and Communications Act.

651
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,911
Detective Park, that's
three years in prison, right?

652
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,662
Yes.

653
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,124
While all your friends
are enjoying their fun college life,

654
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,002
you guys will be stuck
in your depressing jail cells.

655
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:41,006
Thanks to your criminal record
gained from stealing from bad guys,

656
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,217
you won't be able to get the job you want,

657
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,762
and you'll have to give up
on all your dreams.

658
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:50,057
Your life will be hopeless.

659
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,853
Did you hear that?
The sound of your lives being doomed.

660
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,734
Goodness, you gutsy idiots.

661
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,071
Hand them over to the prosecution.

662
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:17,876
Mr. Yoon.

663
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,062
Please forgive them just this once.

664
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:42,943
They're so young,
and they have a bright future ahead.

665
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,406
Please, Detectives.

666
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,826
Please give these boys another chance.

667
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,589
Get up, Dad.

668
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,133
I said, get up!

669
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,512
Please. I beg you, Detectives.

670
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,597
Please…

671
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,022
Get up.

672
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,743
Open your eyes and see
the outcome of your reckless actions.

673
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,997
-Stop.
-And never forget

674
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,207
that every choice
comes with responsibility.

675
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,043
I said, stop!

676
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,213
Damn it!

677
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,346
It's unfair, isn't it?

678
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,266
But it's not like
the law will go easy on you

679
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,894
just because you're poor
and had no choice.

680
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,105
How dare you do this
to someone who has raised you?

681
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,899
You pathetic fools.

682
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,129
Don't get down on your knees
to protect your sons' future.

683
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,256
It is up to them to protect it.

684
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:33,136
Let them handle things like this
on their own from now on.

685
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,354
What?

686
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,821
Thank you.

687
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,823
Thank you so much.

688
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,326
-It's no problem.
-Are you sure about this, sir?

689
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,081
This way, those fools
will learn their lesson

690
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,458
and never put their father
through this again.

691
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,714
You'd better stay out of my sight.

692
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,091
If we cross paths again,

693
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,469
I'll show you what's really unfair.

694
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,059
If you do this,
you can't return to the station.

695
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,854
You'll be transferred without a doubt.

696
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,331
STOP

697
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,693
YOU HAVE PASSED THE WRITTEN EXAM

698
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,489
DELETE

699
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,874
Let's just enlist in the army.

700
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,377
Okay.

701
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,095
COMPUTER REPAIR, WIRELESS DEVICES

702
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,977
Get in.

703
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,604
But Seung-beom isn't ready yet.

704
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,980
YOON DIGITAL ON-SITE SERVICE

705
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,244
Where are we going?

706
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,423
LANDLORD

707
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,508
Yes, hello.

708
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,469
You always open your store
no matter what happens.

709
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,887
What's gotten into you today?

710
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,516
I'm taking my son
to his college interview.

711
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,018
Interview?

712
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,604
Have you heard
of Korean National Police University?

713
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,481
Korean National Police University?

714
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,694
Oh, my! Isn't it almost impossible
to get an admission?

715
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,028
So you've heard.

716
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,116
He only has an interview to take.
He's practically a student there.

717
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,578
Goodness, that's great news!

718
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,704
Yes, it is.

719
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:50,333
My son, Sun-ho,
wants to become a police officer.

720
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,503
My gosh, Taek-il. You must be ecstatic!

721
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,089
Of course I am.

722
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,592
I'm so proud of him.

723
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,429
I'll buy you a drink soon.

724
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,763
I'll talk to you later.

725
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,438
I'm so sorry.

726
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,859
You should reflect on your wrongdoing

727
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:21,281
and study hard
to pay back for what you did.

728
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,078
It's your first time
having a goal to become something.

729
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,581
So I want you to make it.

730
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,751
That'll make up for my kneeling.

731
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,255
Won't that be enough?

732
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,508
Yes, it will.

733
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,469
Hurry up and eat this.

734
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,555
You can't answer anything
on an empty stomach.

735
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:59,319
2021 FRESHMEN RECRUITMENT

Of course I am.

738
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,128
I'm so proud of him.

739
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,966
So I want you to make it.

740
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,050
Mr. Yoon…

741
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,516
Dad!

742
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,688
I…

743
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,273
I will make sure to get in!

744
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,318
I'll get in…

745
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,114
and become a police officer!

746
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,659
That's good to hear!
Hurry up and go inside!

747
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:53,248
Of course you'll get in. You're my son.

748
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,175
FINAL INTERVIEW WAITING AREA

749
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,885
My grandfather…

00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,861
KANG SUN-HO

751
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,920
We'll now begin the final interview
for the 41st batch

752
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,339
of Korean National Police University.

753
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,092
Do not make any noise,
including small talks.

754
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,554
Make sure to sit up straight
until the end.

755
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,390
As soon as your name is called,
answer loudly and get up.

756
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,516
Do you understand?

757
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,102
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes…

758
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,353
Do you understand?

759
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,772
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

760
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,107
Good luck, everyone.

761
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,134
I applied to the school hoping to learn
about crime scene investigation first.

762
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,097
Are you planning to advance
to a law school later?

763
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,724
Yes, I'm considering it.

764
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:41,272
It'll be nice to have
a smart guy like you in our force.

765
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,943
I hope you'll change your mind
and stick with us.

766
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,404
Yes, I'm hoping to do so as well.

ENTRANCE APPLICATION FORM

768
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,172
Goodness, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

769
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:11,302
I was just really nervous,
so this helps me relax.

770
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,680
This is my third time applying.

771
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,766
If I fail this time,
I'll never be able to apply here again.

772
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,394
My name is Noh Beom-tae.

773
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,771
I'm Kang Sun-ho.

774
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,609
I'm Jo Joon-wuk. Nice to meet you.

775
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,863
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

776
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,116
Examinee number 002618, Noh Beom-tae.

777
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,076
Yes!

778
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,997
Aren't you going to answer?

779
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,958
So what I'm saying is…

780
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,251
I think…

781
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,463
You should take it easy.

782
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,923
Why don't you have a sip of water?

783
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,759
Thank you.

784
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,138
VERY NERVOUS

785
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,347
So what I'm saying is…

786
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,475
My grandfather…

787
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,395
was a police officer in a small town.

788
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,147
I grew up

789
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,525
watching him serve the citizens.

790
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,738
I wanted to follow the example he set.

791
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,990
That's why

792
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,533
I really want to become…

793
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,287
-a good officer.
-A good officer.

794
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,413
-I want…
-I want…

795
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,165
-Become a good officer.
-I want to become a good officer.

796
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,374
I want to become a good officer.

797
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,001
EVALUATION

798
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,011
You…

799
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,806
You were there
in front of the academy, right?

800
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,059
-What?
-And are you here because of me?

801
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,104
No.

802
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,191
It's also my dream
to become a police officer.

803
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,825
-Examinee number 002623, Oh Kang-hui.
-Yes!

804
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,577
Wait.

805
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,539
Good luck.

806
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,133
The first plainclothes officer

807
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,761
was a thief. Did you know that?

808
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,596
When theft was a serious problem,

809
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,974
the French police
hired the reformed thieves

810
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,810
saying thieves know each other the best.

811
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,938
From then on, the crime rate
sharply dropped by 68 percent.

812
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,856
The second offense rate
was lower than 20 percent.

813
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,110
The world turned upside down
when thieves became cops.

814
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,488
I'll learn with the mindset
of a thief on sites.

815
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,866
I'll learn with the mindset
of a victim in the office.

I'm examinee number 002630, Kang Sun-ho.

INTERVIEWER

822
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,255
You'd better stay out of my sight.

823
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,883
If we cross paths again,

824
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,136
I'll show you what's really unfair.

825
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:44,849
I told you.

826
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,895
I told you that you won't be able
to get the job you want

827
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,689
and you'll have to give up
on all your dreams.

828
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,067
I told you that your life
will be hopeless.

829
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,694
The Police University?

830
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,947
Not a chance. Get out.

831
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,076
Did you not hear me?

832
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,578
You're not getting in.

833
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,127
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM KWANG-KYU
AND KIM HYEONG-MOOK

834
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,073
-"You have been admitted."
-"Admitted."

835
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,449
-"Admitted"!
-For real!

836
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,118
Who is she?

837
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,495
-She's pretty, and she seemed nice.
-I can carry this for you.

838
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,457
-Freshmen at the Police University?
-Yes.

839
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,084
You can't get into this school, you punk.

840
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,462
Let's get through the training
and make it to the final admission stage.

841
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,922
Wait, we can be disqualified
even at this stage?

842
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:58,923
Assume a push-up position.

843
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,133
If you get
on the drill instructor's bad side,

844
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,426
you won't even last two days.

845
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,971
Can't you just think of it
as a mistake and let it go?

846
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,723
It wasn't your first time.

847
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,350
You've done it more than once, you punk.
