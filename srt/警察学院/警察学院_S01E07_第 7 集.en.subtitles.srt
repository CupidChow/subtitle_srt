INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:16,016
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,439
Hey! Hold on. Where did he go?

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,441
-Go, Professor, go!
-What?

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,359
-Go, Professor, go!
-Where did he go?

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,612
What's going on? Where is he going?

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,614
-Hey!
-Where is he going?

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,075
Damn it!

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,039
DORMITORY

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,291
I got you, punk!

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,146
You…

15
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,398
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,650
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

17
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,029
I asked what you are doing here!

18
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,864
Why are you yelling at me?

19
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,616
They told me not to return
because of the aftereffects.

20
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,912
Therefore, I was appointed as a professor
at Korean National Police University.

21
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,747
So we're colleagues now.

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,707
What?

23
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,694
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
What's with that look on your face?

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,863
I'm just tired, that's all.

25
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,491
Why did you come here today of all days?

26
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,701
The sooner I come,
the sooner I can start helping you out.

27
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,411
What?

28
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,873
I know you're investigating
the illegal gambling ring here.

29
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,583
Captain told me everything.

30
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,128
Apparently, I told you
that they're at the university.

31
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,423
You idiot, shut your mouth!
Don't blurt it out here.

32
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,427
Leave at once. Get lost.
You're making me even more tired.

33
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,638
Come on. Where are you going?

34
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,391
We should go for a drink
and celebrate my joining you here.

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,560
The restaurant across the street
sells pork rinds.

36
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,401
Cheol-jin asked for it,
saying he wants to work by your side.

37
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,611
That's why I transferred him there.

38
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,821
Even so…

39
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,990
How could you do this
without talking to me first…

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,868
Anyway, okay. I have to go.

41
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,287
What happened?

42
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,128
Because of this…

43
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,797
Do you know

44
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,508
what I had to give up because of this?

45
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,260
What?

46
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,431
Someone sneaked into my empty room
and went through my laptop.

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,392
The frame for my family photo is broken.

48
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,106
CAPTAIN

49
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,274
Goodness.

50
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,359
Professor.

51
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,994
Professor.

52
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,790
Professor.

53
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,184
This jerk…

54
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,520
What an interesting turn of events.

55
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,775
Professor.

56
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,443
Professor!

57
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,034
-What are you going to do?
-Hey.

58
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,788
The maximum transmission range
of this listening device is 3km.

59
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,125
The only person within the distance
who'd listen in on our talks is Mr. Go!

60
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,669
We don't know that for sure yet.

61
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,587
And even if it's him, what will you do?

62
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,756
I'll figure that out later.
Move out of my way!

63
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,549
Calm down.

64
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,177
That little rat. I will catch him!

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,180
-Please, Professor!
-Let go, you punk!

66
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,270
Darn it…

67
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,986
Hey! Why did you try to stop me?

68
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,946
"Why"?

69
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,744
You told me to stop you
when you are being rash.

70
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,373
You said that's why every cop needs
a partner and why two are better than one.

71
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,501
You were the one who told me to do this.
And what? "Why"?

72
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,464
-Hey, this situation is…
-So it's different in every situation?

73
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,551
Then take back what you said.

74
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,679
I don't care what happens.
I won't stop you anymore!

75
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,808
So take back what you said.

76
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,686
Hey.

77
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:17,483
A real man never takes back his words.

78
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,071
And since when did you always
listen to me?

79
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,407
Okay, fine.

80
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,827
The fact that I had no idea

81
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,873
that jerk has been sneaking
into my office made me blow a fuse.

82
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,542
I'm sorry about that. Happy now?

83
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,878
Why say that at the end
and ruin your apology?

84
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,797
Wait until you get to my age
because you'll be doing that too.

85
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,218
What do we do now?

86
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,304
What do you think?

87
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,598
We'll get the serial number
from the device

88
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,349
and find out where
and when it was purchased

89
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,018
as well as who bought it.

90
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,353
Then we'll catch the culprit.

91
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,107
Wait.

92
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,280
No. Hold on.

93
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,281
Hey, stop!

94
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,283
What's with those losers?

95
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,039
Hey! You scumbag!

96
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,535
This is actually for the best.

97
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,162
Yes.

98
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,963
Why do you look so upset?
What are you thinking about?

99
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,090
What do you think he gained

100
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,551
from planting that bug?

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,681
Hey, think about what we gained.

102
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,433
Now we know the culprit is close by.

103
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,518
So we haven't been barking up
the wrong tree.

104
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,020
He got scared and wiretapped me. Why?

105
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,857
It's because we're so close
to catching him.

106
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,650
That's what's important here.

107
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,154
If the culprit is within the range,
that means we're in danger.

108
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,490
He even saw my family photo.

109
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,200
-Gosh.
-Come on!

110
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,744
That's exactly what that jerk wants.

111
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,288
Getting scared by this.

112
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,000
And stepping back because we're scared
so that we won't investigate him!

113
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,794
You punk. Are you going
to do exactly what he wants?

114
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,713
But this is my first time!

115
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,218
I've never gone through this before.
Isn't it only natural that I'm scared?

116
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,899
You punk. Why are you whining here?

117
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,695
You should've gotten rid of such thoughts
before coming here, you brat.

118
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,405
-Hey!
-"Hey"?

119
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,741
What now?

120
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,285
You want to have a go at me
when I'm your professor?

121
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,205
Bring it on.

122
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,915
Gosh, that nutjob.

123
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,333
I can hear you.

124
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,798
What? Why? Are you really
going to have a go at me?

125
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,675
Why was Mr. Park
suddenly transferred here?

126
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,596
Am I the only one who thinks it's odd

127
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,723
that he came here now?

128
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,644
Don't bark up the wrong tree.

129
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,022
Cheol-jin is here to help
with our investigation,

130
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,399
and I knew it all along.

131
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,485
Are you sure?

132
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,573
Are you sure you knew?

133
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,825
Of course, you punk!

134
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,256
Gosh.

135
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,551
Darn it.

136
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,030
Hey, Sun-ho.

137
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,582
Why did you do that?

138
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,417
Back in the field.

139
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,255
That…

140
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,969
I suddenly got a stomachache.

141
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,724
I must've eaten
something bad during lunch.

142
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,810
My stomach was upset.

143
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,563
Is that true?

144
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,867
Five minutes to the evening roll call.
Get ready for the roll call.

145
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,119
I'll get going. Good night.

146
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,239
FORENSICS
PROFESSOR SEO SANG-HAK

147
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,660
Do you know the serial murder case
that occurred in saunas in 2004?

148
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,954
It was raining.

149
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,167
The night was chilly.

150
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,254
The phone rang sharply
despite the loud sound of rain.

151
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,216
Ring!

152
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,468
"This is a sauna in Dogok-dong."

153
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,470
"A man is dying here!"

154
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,930
"What did you say?"

155
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,973
When we arrived at the scene,

156
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,934
the victim was already dead.

157
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,687
The suspect set the scene on fire
and fled.

158
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,607
All the evidence was destroyed,

159
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,193
and we were thinking
this would cause us a headache.

160
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,653
But right then!

161
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,322
From a distance, someone shouted,
"Inspector Seo! Come look at this!"

162
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,407
"What?"

163
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,993
One step, two steps.

164
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,205
I went close to the burned body.

165
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,833
"Wait, that is…"

166
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,503
The suspect's fingerprints
were clearly visible on the body.

167
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,798
That's impossible!

168
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,678
Is it true?

169
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,309
It was the first case in Korea
where we solved the case

170
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,062
with the fingerprints left
on the victim's body.

171
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,730
No way.

172
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,448
Professor Yu, when did you get here?

173
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,836
I heard you've been teaching
as a professor your whole career.

174
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,008
It's just a rumor.

175
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,926
A rumor?

176
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,844
Right.

177
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,432
What brought you to the clubroom?

178
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,768
I wanted to ask you

179
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,520
for a favor.

180
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,318
Why is the TV off?

181
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,947
My gosh.

182
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,327
The first baseman, Kim Ji-ho,
is dashing at full speed…

183
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,916
You've never tasted a beer like this.
This is Gossi Beer.

184
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,876
Hello?

185
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,336
Darn it.

186
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,963
What was that about?

187
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,716
What?

188
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,594
Where did the remote control go?

189
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,476
Well…

190
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,396
Can you check
if the fingerprints on this remote control

191
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,400
are also on this laptop?

192
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,153
Aren't you going to tell me

193
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,490
the story behind this
when you're asking for a favor?

194
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,575
Don't you think you need to tell me that?

195
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,748
Do you think you can handle it?
It might be disturbing.

196
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,670
I'm weakhearted, so…

197
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,047
Just consider it done.

198
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,674
It's nothing too difficult anyway.

199
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,384
Okay. Thank you.

200
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,762
Right.

201
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,931
There's also a difficult favor I must ask.

202
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,736
Do you need anything, Kang-hui?

203
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,580
I…

204
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,624
I like you.

205
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,427
Are you that upset?

206
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,680
Do you want to use my special leave?

207
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,474
No, it's not because of that.

208
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,313
You're not even done.

209
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,692
Hey, guys! I got good news!

210
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,193
Did you hear?

211
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,613
They're giving everyone special leave!

212
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,740
-What?
-The faculty members decided.

213
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,159
Everyone will get to go out!

214
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,537
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

215
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,581
It looks like Professor Seo
pushed ahead with it.

216
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,004
This is amazing!

217
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,177
Professor Seo is a romanticist
in many ways.

218
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,261
Right.

219
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,222
But he used to be really scary
when I was in school.

220
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,515
Right.

221
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,893
You went to our school too, right?

222
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,937
-Yes, I did.
-You know everything about him.

223
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,605
Look at you two bonding already.

224
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,232
I'm in the 25th batch.

225
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,777
I studied at the Yongin campus,
so I'm not familiar with this one.

226
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,530
How did you become friends
with Professor Yu?

227
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,450
He was my first supervisor
in the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

228
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,994
Since then, I've followed him everywhere.

229
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,204
We were inseparable.

230
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,123
It seems like you remember everything.

231
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,168
Are you sure you're suffering
from dissociative amnesia?

232
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,173
That condition can be quite funny.

233
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,093
Some erase the entire memory
of their first love.

234
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,221
Some erase the people they met
in the military from their memory.

235
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,890
They say an entire part
of your life gets erased.

236
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,727
But I'm not sure
which part of mine got erased.

237
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,896
I hope only bad memories were erased.

238
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,690
Thank you.

239
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,650
She can be quite nosy.

240
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,695
Where is Professor Yu?
Did he go home already?

241
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,613
What?

242
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,949
The surveillance cameras
were all very old,

243
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,410
so we've been replacing
all of them for a month.

244
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,328
So we don't have any recorded footage.

245
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,288
Then what should I do?

246
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,749
Sorry? About what?

247
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,836
Sorry about that. Darn it.

248
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,337
YU DONG-MAN

249
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,970
Gosh, you startled me.

250
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,847
Hey, airhead!

251
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,349
Dong-man is not here though.

252
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,070
I'm not sure if you saw the board,

253
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,364
but how could you order
fried eggs at a pub?

254
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,535
Is there a law saying
that you can't sell fried eggs at a pub?

255
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,205
I'm sure you know about laws
better than I do.

256
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,377
The one who breaks the law
knows better than the one who keeps it.

257
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,340
Well, we all live different lives.

258
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,801
By the way,

259
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,512
did you leave

260
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,098
after seeing me win
in the relay race yesterday?

261
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,185
Relay race?

262
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,228
I didn't see it. Why?

263
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,150
Well, I was just curious if you did.
Since you came to school yesterday.

264
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,029
I see. I just looked around the school.

265
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,989
I went to see the dormitory too.

266
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,115
I see…

267
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,163
Why are you so surprised?
You startled me even more.

268
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,005
I'll be off. It's about time
for the roll call.

269
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,266
Of course I did.

270
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,394
Gosh, you were so fast.

271
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,773
I see. So you did see me.

272
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,944
Sun-ho ran out first in a flash,

273
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:36,782
then you ran after him in a flash.

274
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,619
Are you saying that you won with that?

275
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,954
My goodness.

276
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,416
-So he was watching all along?
-Gosh…

277
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,466
I guess you and Sun-ho are very close.

278
00:18:55,634 --> 00:19:00,055
You guys were totally like a team.

279
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,605
Gosh, that jerk…

280
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,488
What do you think he gained
from planting that bug?

281
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,324
Kang Sun-ho.

282
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,051
Eon-ju.

283
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,809
Sun-ho. This is the day.

284
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,020
Weren't you asleep?

285
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,234
Students in uniform are not allowed

286
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,820
to stain the dignity of students
at the Police University.

287
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,116
Putting your hands in your pocket,
clasping them behind your back, spitting,

288
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,119
smoking, or eating while walking
are all forbidden.

289
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,081
Also, you're not allowed
to enter places that can damage

290
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,916
your reputation and dignity.

291
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,710
You're not allowed
to enter places that are

292
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,254
only for entertainment.

293
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,548
Refrain from all acts that can harm
the dignity of the Police University.

294
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,051
What you do in your uniform

295
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,095
can become the image of the police.

296
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,264
Please keep that in mind.

297
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,976
We will now check your uniform and hair.

298
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,109
Your decision as a romanticist worked out.

299
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,321
It's against equity though.

300
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,702
I told you to say the right thing
at the right time.

301
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,412
People will talk behind your back.

302
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,206
You shouldn't hang out
with abnormal people.

303
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,335
Don't fight.

304
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,464
Unfortunately,
I'm not the romanticist here.

305
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,757
What?

306
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,225
Wear your badge correctly.

307
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,437
Shine your shoes.

308
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,318
I've got a date today. What are you up to?

309
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,362
I have

310
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,574
very important plans.

311
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,491
"Plans"?

312
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,996
You're not hiding anything from me, right?

313
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,623
Of course not. I don't have anything.

314
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,752
Sun-ho, what are you doing today?

315
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,172
I…

316
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,341
I don't know yet.

317
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,814
If the culprit is within the range,
that means we're in danger.

318
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,816
He even saw my family photo.

319
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,291
Seong-su, what are you going to do?

320
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,376
-I don't know.
-Why not?

321
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,215
-Nice.
-Let's go.

322
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,052
Let's sit here.

323
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,522
Why? Did you forget something?

324
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,648
I did.

325
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,526
I need to drop by the dormitory.
You go ahead.

326
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,860
All right.

327
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,405
We're leaving now.

328
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,407
Let's go!

329
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,412
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

330
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,253
Professor Yu.

331
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,930
Let's investigate Mr. Park too.

332
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,685
Like we did with Professor Kwon.

333
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,270
It's a relief if there's nothing.

334
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,980
So we can just make sure…

335
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,273
I think

336
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,900
I've told you
Cheol-jin is not in the picture.

337
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,446
Your phone.

338
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,995
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

339
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,248
DELETE CONTACT

340
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,670
Stop working on this case.

341
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,263
Is it because I asked you
to investigate Mr. Park?

342
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,391
Shouldn't you ask me why I think so first?

343
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,978
Save that foolish assumption
for your reports.

344
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,229
Don't you hear me?

345
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,649
Don't come to my office.

346
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,944
From now on, the only place
that you and I will meet

347
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,946
is in the classroom.

348
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,496
Is that it?

349
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,376
Is this what a partner means to you?

350
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,380
You said you'd never give up
on the investigation,

351
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,008
but this is it?

352
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,387
You are scared.

353
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,267
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

354
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,246
Gosh.

355
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,878
Do you think you can break it with that?

356
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,577
POLICE UNIVERSITY

357
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,667
Hey, why didn't you take the shuttle?

358
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,460
Why did you lie to me?

359
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,384
I wanted to kick you, but I took it out
on the poor trash can instead.

360
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,553
Take the next bus!

361
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,400
I'll just go get some tests done
at the hospital.

362
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,861
When I'm back,
we'll go for pork belly and drinks.

363
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,697
You'd better hurry.
The traffic is bad on weekends.

364
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,201
Dong-man, is everything okay?

365
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,622
-Why?
-You look like someone…

366
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,376
who just got dumped.

367
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,212
I'll be right back.

368
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,606
You are scared.

369
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,275
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

370
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,127
-Are you going somewhere?
-You startled me.

371
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,047
Yes, I'm going somewhere.

372
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,175
Where? you bought drinks.

373
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,011
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

374
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,263
You're going to drink soju?
With who? A woman?

375
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,767
Are you always this interested
in everyone's business?

376
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,103
Or are you just like this with me?

377
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,062
Just with you.

378
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,734
You're a dangerous person. You really are.

379
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,114
Who is this woman?
Is she prettier than me?

380
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,866
That's impossible.

381
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,870
Get in the car if you're curious.

382
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,041
Are you crazy?

383
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,714
How long have you worked
at the Police University?

384
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,885
I think this is my seventh or eighth year.

385
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,307
Was Gossi Beer around
when you first joined the school?

386
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,144
No, it suddenly opened one day.

387
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,730
That spot has always been like that.

388
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,650
It always had different owners
doing different things.

389
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,695
But surprisingly,
Professor Go has been there for a while.

390
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,239
And he befriended all the neighbors
very quickly.

391
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,992
Why do you ask?

392
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,911
I should buy some instant noodles.

393
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,081
Where are we going?

394
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,478
Do you really want to get kicked?

395
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,983
Just kick me.

396
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,445
Do it all you want,
if it'll make you feel better.

397
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,030
I can put up with it.

398
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,282
But you know, the trial…

399
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,287
Hold on. Gosh.

400
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,247
I've been waiting for this day.

401
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,751
I'm even in my uniform now,
but I have to attend my mom's trial.

402
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,753
So I'm…

403
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,463
really upset right now.

404
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,090
You'd better not follow me.

405
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,135
If you do, I'll actually break your leg.

406
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,471
Wait, Kang-hui…

407
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,394
COURT IN SESSION

408
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,565
All the evidence shows that

409
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,068
the defendant willingly participated
in the opening of the gambling site,

410
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,488
yet the defendant refuses to accept it.

411
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,698
Well…

412
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,285
She admits to everything and…

413
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,539
Didn't she request an appeal
because she can't accept it?

414
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,540
My point exactly!

415
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,791
DEFENDANT

416
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,584
Let me do the talking.

417
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,169
Look, Prosecutor.

418
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,171
I admit that I gambled.

419
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,173
Ma'am.

420
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,260
They told me I had to open
a cryptocurrency account,

421
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,637
or whatever it's called, to place bets.

422
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,139
I had no idea what it was,
so I asked them to take care of it.

423
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,017
That's why that man
opened the account for me.

424
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,521
I played a few games with it
but ended up blowing all the money.

425
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,857
So I quit a long time ago.

426
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,150
And you're saying
I opened a gambling site?

427
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,361
I'm not gutsy enough
to do something like that.

428
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,865
I'd like to bring in a witness.

429
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,201
WITNESS

430
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,289
I clearly remember her telling me that
she was running an illegal gambling site

431
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,209
with some people in the Philippines
and that it was very lucrative.

432
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,128
You damn brat.

433
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,297
Don't make up such lies.

434
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,884
Why would I run away
if I were running something so lucrative?

435
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:30,096
And why would I let my daughter
freeload off other people all her life?

436
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,891
Order!

437
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,852
And Ms. Kim.

438
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,896
Spit out your gum, please.

439
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,188
Sure.

440
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,773
You two.

441
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,735
I bet you talked
and decided to dump this all on me.

442
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,236
Ms. Oh Jeong-ja.

443
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,364
You said your name was Oh Ga-eul.

444
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,659
Why are you calling me
by the name I do not wish to use?

445
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,620
Do I not have any rights?

446
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,706
Hey. From the get-go,

447
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,834
you were planning
to dump it all on me and close the case.

448
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,130
I may look like I've had an easy life,
but I've been through all sorts of things.

449
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,340
Don't mess with me!

450
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,842
I bet you were bribed. Who bribed you?

451
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,720
You call this the law?

452
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,764
Hey! Yes, you.

453
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,183
As soon as I get out of jail,

454
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,685
I will kill you. Do you hear me?

455
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,441
Let's go.

456
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,278
-You don't need to see this.
-Order!

457
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,697
You call this the law?

458
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,827
No. You need to see this, Kang-hui.

459
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,875
You are the only one who can tell whether
your mom is telling the truth or not.

460
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,379
So you have to stay and watch the trial.

461
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,672
You'd better tell the truth.

462
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,092
Kang Sun-ho, let go of her hand.

463
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,218
You let go.

464
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,097
What are you guys doing in a courtroom?

465
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,015
Let go, both of you.

466
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,934
She's lying!

467
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,230
Defendant, please be seated.

468
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,816
Prosecutor, you may give
your closing argument.

469
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,817
Let go!

470
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,779
The estimated sum of the bets
accumulated by this illegal gambling site

471
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,865
under the defendant's name
reaches tens of billions of won.

472
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,872
Her accomplice, Kim Sun-ae,

473
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,917
has admitted to everything
and withdrew the appeal,

474
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,921
whereas Defendant Oh Jeong-ja,
who has priors,

475
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,759
is busy listing excuses in this courtroom
instead of showing remorse.

476
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,637
Ergo, the original sentence
of two years in prison

477
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,055
along with the fine of 500 million won

478
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,433
for habitual gambling,
setting up a site for gambling,

479
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:43,229
and violating the Electronic Financial
Transactions Act was fair.

480
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,274
Hence, I ask the court
to dismiss her appeal.

481
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,696
We will hear
the defense counsel's closing argument

482
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,948
before we wrap up.

483
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,408
Counsel.

484
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,371
Your Honor.

485
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,420
You know, I have admitted
to everything I did.

486
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,257
Gambling? Yes, I gambled.

487
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,009
And I will gladly accept
the punishment for it.

488
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,761
But…

489
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,847
I refuse to be punished
for something I didn't do.

490
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,558
Opening the gambling site?

491
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,983
I swear on my daughter's name.

492
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,945
I never did such a thing.

493
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,017
It's simple.

494
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,522
The money that people use to bet on
this site is all saved as cryptocurrency.

495
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,608
It's the same website.

496
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,491
COURT IN SESSION

497
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,870
YU DONG-MAN
NO RESULT FOUND

498
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,664
Right.

499
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,711
Having fun?

500
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,426
-What?
-Acting cool, then chickening out.

501
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,053
That's your specialty.

502
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,847
Am I wrong?

503
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,614
Thanks to you guys,
I stayed until the end.

504
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,659
Thank you.

505
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,413
But can you guys leave now?

506
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,666
I don't want to be embarrassed anymore.

507
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,118
He really is like a puppy.

508
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,176
Sit down. Your legs will hurt.

509
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,311
My mom

510
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,356
wasn't lying.

511
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,400
She's not at fault.

512
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,445
I know her.

513
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,531
I know what she does when she lies.

514
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,411
When I was seven,

515
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,083
I asked her why I'm the only one
without a dad,

516
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,127
and she said this while avoiding my eyes.

517
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,257
"Your dad is working abroad."

518
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,718
When I was 13,

519
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,429
I asked her
if she was going to jail again,

520
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,599
and she avoided my eyes again

521
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,727
and said that she was not.

522
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,274
But she did.

523
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,361
That's when I realized it.

524
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,697
That…

525
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,325
if Mom avoids my eyes,

526
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,453
that means she's lying.

527
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,170
But in the courtroom,
she looked straight into my eyes.

528
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,971
Mom didn't do it.

529
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,193
I'm asking this because I'm dumbfounded.

530
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,280
Why are you here?

531
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,157
My point exactly.

532
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,409
Because I'm lonely.

533
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,370
Why would you come here
when you're lonely?

534
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,331
My point exactly.

535
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,999
Because I'm super lonely.

536
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,420
Your close colleague got transferred.
Why didn't you go see him?

537
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,341
Hey, when people are super lonely,

538
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,302
they meet people they're not close to.

539
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,388
The closer you are,
the harder it is to be honest.

540
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,932
There are times
when you can't share everything.

541
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,445
-What?
-Here.

542
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,238
You said it's too expensive
for me to hold.

543
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,157
Just hang onto it
while I use the restroom.

544
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,122
Gosh, am I getting old?

545
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,958
What's going on, seriously?

546
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,169
Why did you become so weak? What's wrong?

547
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,465
You know…

548
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,927
I said all those things,
knowing I'd regret it later,

549
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,097
but I'm regretting it already. Darn it.

550
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,683
Then why did you say it?

551
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,937
I didn't want to regret it more later.

552
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,273
It's strange.

553
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,234
I'm not sure what it's about,

554
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,194
but why are you scared?
That's not like you.

555
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,531
I guess it's because I have
people to protect now.

556
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,866
I'm scared to make choices.

557
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,703
Who is that woman?
Is she prettier than me?

558
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,457
Gosh.

559
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,199
-Eon…
-Eon-ju!

560
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,382
Noh Beom-tae?

561
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,552
What?

562
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,431
Wait…

563
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,557
Jo Joon-wuk?

564
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,809
What are you doing here?

565
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,978
I have a date with Eon-ju.

566
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,356
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

567
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,113
How could you not tell me?

568
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,284
You're the one who didn't tell me.
I told you I have a date.

569
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,077
Hey, what's the problem?

570
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,372
You both wanted to see me,

571
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,042
so I thought we could all meet up.

572
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,461
Here. Drink up!

573
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,963
-Thank you! Cheers!
-Cheers!

574
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:55,638
Hey, is this the date you mentioned?

575
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,557
What? You're not
keeping any secrets from me?

576
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,603
What? Are you not going to drink it?

577
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,230
Drink up.

578
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,315
Hurry up!

579
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,196
When it comes to alcohol,
the speed matters more than the amount.

580
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,492
-Drink up!
-Bottoms up!

581
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,161
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

582
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,669
The tickets for Asan have sold out.

583
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,212
We're out of tickets.

584
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,588
What?

585
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,053
TO ASAN, SOLD OUT
TO DAEJEON, SOLD OUT

586
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,972
No, it's really fine.

587
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,057
I'll just take the first bus
in the morning.

588
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,685
How can you wait until then?

589
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,229
Just come with me, please?

590
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,664
Here's your beer.

591
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,666
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

592
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,670
I'll just have one more.

593
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,463
I'll go home after this.

Hey, Kang-hui.

Yes?

600
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,278
Are you and Min-gyu…

601
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,702
-No, never mind.
-What about me and Min-gyu?

602
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,250
I was wondering
if you two were seeing each other.

603
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,171
Are you crazy? He's just a friend.

00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,051

00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,095

Did he go somewhere?

I didn't know they were brothers.

No, it's okay.

Why don't you give your girlfriend
a tour of the house?

636
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,249
She's not my girlfriend.

637
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,799
Do you have any photos of Sun-ho
when he was a baby?

638
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,885
I only see photos of him grown-up.

639
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,220
That's…

640
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,223
We moved around a lot,

641
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,725
so I don't have baby photos of my sons.

642
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,268
I see. Same here.

643
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,063
Where can I get changed?

644
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,481
In that room.

645
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,406
By the way, what happened
in your room? It's a mess.

646
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,327
Well, I tried on
a bunch of different outfits

647
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,996
because I wanted to look nice.

648
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,126
No. I forgot to press the cook button.

649
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,296
I'll go pick up some instant rice.

650
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,425
My goodness…

651
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,278
-Take a seat.
-It looks amazing.

652
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,656
Leave it. Just sit down, please.

653
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,492
Gosh, that'd make me uncomfortable.
Please let me help.

654
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,453
And please drop the honorifics.

655
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,748
It'll help me enjoy the food even more.

656
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,377
My Sun-ho is too nice.
He's probably boring to be around.

657
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,838
Sorry? Not at all.

658
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,132
I mean, he is nice.

659
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,802
But he's pretty decisive,
and he rarely gets flustered.

660
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,763
Also, he's very outspoken,
so our classmates look up to him.

661
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,931
Really?

662
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:13,890
Yes.

663
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,811
That's why I was surprised earlier.

664
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,439
I've never seen him like that.

665
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,858
He seemed all flustered and lost,

666
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,986
like a five-year-old boy
who couldn't find his dad.

667
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:31,783
I was always afraid
he'd disappear one day.

668
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,162
But he's all protective of me now
that he's grown up.

669
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,833
He was like an outsider
when he was little.

670
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,170
He'd be right behind me
when I thought he wasn't there.

671
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,756
And when I thought he was there,
he was gone.

672
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,966
He was always like that.

673
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,428
But today, he was right there.

674
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:57,434
He's no longer like an outsider.

675
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,862
When he walks into the room,
you just know.

676
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,739
He sure stands out, wherever he goes.

677
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,574
-I'm back.
-Hey.

678
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,454
Go heat the rice.

679
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,289
Hurry. I'm hungry.

680
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,584
Okay.

681
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,928
I think I ate too much. I'm so full.

682
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,976
Sorry for stealing your room.
Let me sleep here for just one night.

683
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,902
Why are you staring at me?

684
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,696
Get out.

685
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,157

That thought terrifies me.

713
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,561
I'm scared. My head is
telling me not to do it

714
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,606
and that I don't need to do it.
But the thing is…

715
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,316
But…

716
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,068
you want to do it.

717
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,613
Then you should do it.

718
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,491
You've always held yourself back,

719
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:46,788
so the fact that you're this torn
tells me that you should do it.

720
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,546
Just do it.

721
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,590
But make sure you do it properly.

722
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,595
Only then will you become
a great police officer

723
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,680
who can protect everyone dear to you.

724
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,560
As your dad,

725
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,856
I will always believe
in the decisions that you make.

726
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,593
Why don't we try to analyze
this burner phone's call patterns?

727
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,179
There's a program that analyzes
call patterns and frequency.

728
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,181
If we look into the base station
using that,

729
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:49,643
we should be able to track down
the person using the burner phone.

730
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,030
Done.

731
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,755
Is the investigation still ongoing?

732
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,385
Yes, I haven't caught the culprit yet.

733
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:27,180
Is Kang Sun-ho working on it with you?

734
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,600
Why are you so surprised?

735
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,310
It's so obvious.

736
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:37,857
Well, I was just training him.
But he's no longer involved.

737
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,403
That's why you're lonely now.

738
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,073
When you're investigating a case,

739
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,617
you have to suspect
even those closest to you

740
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,829
if you spot anything suspicious.

741
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,873
It can be awful and lonely,

742
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,960
but you have to do it.

743
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,629
That's why you were
suspicious of me as well?

744
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,969
Just like fishing,

745
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,388
the investigation
will eventually come to an end.

746
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:13,351
What or whom will I see
at the end of this investigation,

747
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,229
and what will happen in the end?

748
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,566
I'm scared to find out.

749
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,901
That's when you can

750
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,487
lean on your friends.

751
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,997
Just come here anytime you're lonely.

752
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,880
What? You caught one.

753
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,089
What?

754
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,634
-Gosh.
-Wow!

755
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,429
Gosh, what's this? I caught one!

756
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,056
-My! Help me.
-Wow!

757
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,891
-Help me!
-Hold on.

758
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,267
-Wait.
-Grab it!

759
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,478
My gosh.

760
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,938
-Look at that.
-Wow.

761
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,317
Goodness.

762
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,986
My gosh.

763
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,078
Your dad seems so nice.

764
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,580
You've grown up well.

765
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,752
Anyway, don't tell anyone
that I slept over at your place.

766
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,297
I don't want people to gossip
when we're not even seeing each other.

767
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,426
Kang-hui.

768
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,099
I'll catch the real culprit
of your mother's case.

769
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,520
I'll put everything back to normal.

770
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,397
Actually,

771
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,485
I've been investigating a case
with Professor Yu.

772
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,113
I see.

773
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,281
What?

774
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,660
I couldn't finish the race
because of that investigation.

775
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,122
What are you investigating?

776
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:01,042
I mean, is that related to my mom's case?

777
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,670
That…

778
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,716
I'll tell you after I discuss it
with Professor Yu.

779
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,554
I'm planning to
have it out with him today.

780
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,888
"Have it out"?

781
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,808
Yes, and…

782
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,645
I'm going to
have it out with you after him.

783
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,233
It's about time we have it out
and decide what we are.

784
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,162
YU DONG-MAN

785
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,914
Yes, I'll go to your office.

786
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,306
Did you find fingerprints?

787
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,479
Yes, I did, but…

788
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,372
The fingerprints on this laptop

789
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,292
weren't found on this remote control
you brought

790
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,420
but on this plastic cup.

791
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,592
You look like someone who just got dumped.

792
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,260
I'll be right back.

793
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,000
Dong-man.

794
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,594
Professor Yu.

795
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,276
I can't stop working on this case.

796
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,153
No. I won't.

797
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,323
You said the culprit is here.

798
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,411
How did you…

799
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,787
I must…

800
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,249
catch the culprit at all costs.

801
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,377
So that I can

802
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,130
protect the people I love.

803
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,595
I've made up my mind,

804
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,680
so you should decide.

805
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,433
I must…

806
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,103
see the end of this case.

807
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:09,897
Dong-man.

808
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:08,706
You're not getting Sun-ho
involved in your private matter, are you?

809
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,083
You did it, didn't you?

810
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,460
We don't know if you were injured
while carrying out a sting operation

811
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,379
or if you're just putting on a show.

812
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,297
Is that really what you think?

813
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,590
Do you know what this is?

814
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:21,552
I got a report. It says that the sample
questions going around the students

815
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,138
seem to be the exam paper
for Investigation Studies.

816
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,683
He can't deny it. They even found
an envelope of money in his office.

817
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,393
The arrest warrant will be issued soon.

818
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,602
You'll have to hurry.

819
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,230
We'll be able to save Professor Yu, right?

820
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,273
I'm going to save your supervisor.
