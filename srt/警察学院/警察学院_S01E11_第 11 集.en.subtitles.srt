AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,438
Yes, I'm on my way, so get the boat ready.

7
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,378
I got you, you little punk.

8
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,929
Did that catch you off guard?

9
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,127
Professor Yu!

10
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,548
Professor Yu, are you okay?

11
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,383
Damn it!

12
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,639
Why you…

13
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,245
Who are you trying to mess with, you jerk?

14
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,806
Damn it!

15
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,229
Let go of me!

16
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,323
-Run!
-Hurry!

17
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,992
-Block the route!
-Spread out!

18
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,422
Go Deok-bae, you're under arrest
for running an illegal gambling house,

19
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,216
violating the Game Industry Promotion Act,

20
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,967
the Electronic Financial Transactions Act,

and the Act on Information
and Communications Network Utilization.

24
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,476
You have a right to an attorney.

25
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,061
You have the right to remain silent

26
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,729
and the right to explain yourself.

27
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,441
You also have the right to challenge
the legality of your confinement.

28
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,735
But just don't.

29
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,612
You're dead meat now.

30
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,323
You're so dead.

31
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,584
Get up, you punk.

32
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,841
Good job, guys.

33
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,885
Let go of me!

34
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,303
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

35
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,138
-Get him!
-What…

36
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,640
-Damn it!
-Let me go, you jerk!

37
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,895
-Damn it!
-Why you little…

38
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,694
-You scum. Stop right there!
-You jerk! Stop!

39
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:42,282
-No! You can't go.
-Get him! Go catch him!

40
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,244
-Darn it.
-Stop!

41
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,206
-Hey!
-Get him!

42
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,136
I'll go this way.

43
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,532
-Move!
-Let go of me!

44
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,367
-Let go!
-Move!

45
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,077
-Hurry.
-Gosh.

46
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,629
-Dong-man!
-Darn it.

47
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,007
-What took you so long?
-Sorry.

48
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,092
We lost a guy
because we were short of hands.

49
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,553
-Are you okay?
-Gosh.

50
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,020
What is he doing here?

51
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,772
It's not easy
to issue a warrant at this hour.

52
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,900
Chief got the warrant issued himself.

53
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,860
What? Why?

54
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,780
-What do you mean why?
-Senior Inspector Yu.

55
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,700
Good job.

56
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,079
My goodness.

57
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,957
Crime Investigation Team One
should take charge

58
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,793
and wrap it up thoroughly.

59
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,794
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,838
Track down all the suspects
related to this case

61
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,216
and arrest every single one of them.

62
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,967
Yes, sir.

63
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,474
Thanks to you, I might be
getting a special promotion.

64
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,401
KCSI

65
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,748
Darn it. Was I wrong?

66
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,167
I thought they were in cahoots.

67
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,718
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

68

ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION

69
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,143
You can give that to me.

70
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,728
Excuse me.

71
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,399
Oh, right. Here.

72
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,109
Thank you.

73
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,157
Are you okay?

74
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,035
Yes. Let's go.

75
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,334
I've never seen suspects
being arrested in my life.

76
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,878
Me neither.

77
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,964
By the way, will they be able to catch

78
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,841
the suspect that got away, right?

79
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,969
Of course.
There are surveillance cameras everywhere.

80
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,265
Anyway, are you sure you're not hurt?

81
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,267
Yes, thanks to Professor Yu.

82
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,561
I'm not hurt either.

83
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,064
Guys, to celebrate the success

84
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,066
of our first investigation,

85
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,818
shouldn't we go on a trip?

86
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,361
A trip? To where?

87
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,488
-A beach trip?
-A beach?

88
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,947
-Let's go.
-What do you think?

89
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,367
Shall we really go somewhere
before the vacation is over?

90
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,289
-What do you say?
-Well…

91
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,043
But it's too hot,

92
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,921
and there will be a traffic jam
since it's vacation season.

93
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,967
But the beach…

94
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,054
I guess we could go to the beach
if you really want to.

95
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,520
Let's get going, guys.

96
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,441
You should all go home
before the vacation is over.

97
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,517
So how do you feel?

98
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,893
What do you mean?

99
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,522
You just arrested the guys
you were after for a long time.

100
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,690
So what about it?

101
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,153
My gosh. Listen.

102
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,490
It's my job to arrest criminals.

103
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,535
There's nothing I should be happy about.

104
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,497
Just say you're glad if you are.

105
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,250
Why would I be glad?

106
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:51,257
Performing public duty
is my job as a public official.

107
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,467
It can't be used as a means
to achieve self-realization.

108
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,554
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

109
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,353
However,
you're not public officials but students.

110
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,148
So I suppose you could be happy about it.

111
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,900
You didn't do so bad,

112
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,861
considering it was
your first practical training.

113
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,532
-Professor Kwon.
-Did you just say we did well?

114
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,787
No. I said it wasn't bad.

115
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,890
Thank you for taking me home.

116
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,350
I should be the one to thank you.

117
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,019
Thanks to you, I got to drive fast.
It was so satisfying.

118
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,688
Me too.
Especially when you did the drifting,

119
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,482
it relieved all of my stress.

120
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,026
What? Are you the younger version of me?

121
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,029
I hope you'll enjoy
the rest of your vacation.

122
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,031
Enjoy your dates with Sun-ho as well.

123
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,241
Sorry?

124
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,993
Why do you look so surprised?

125
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,871
Everyone knows that you two are dating,
except for Beom-tae.

126
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,759
You should drive back safely.

127
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,306
I want to see you more often
for a long time.

128
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,519
I'll see you next semester.

129
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,332
Are you going to Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency right away?

130
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,710
Yes. I need to write them
a witness statement.

131
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,255
Oh, right. Remember the guy

132
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,965
we failed to arrest earlier?

133
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,259
I'm sure they'll arrest him soon,

134
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,094
but still, be careful.

135
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,139
I have you with me.

136
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,893
I'm not afraid of anything
when I have you next to me.

137
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,984
Also, thank you for saving me earlier.

138
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,865
You punk. I'm not your bodyguard.

139
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't ruin the mood, will you?

140
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,456
You'll be at school

141
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,624
when the new semester begins, right?

142
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,130
Right?

143
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,842
Of course, you punk!
I have nowhere to go anyway.

144
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:42,970
I'll see you next semester then.

145
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,395
Wait!

146
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,902
We wouldn't have been able

147
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,987
to arrest him without you today.

148
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,492
I'm saying
it's all thanks to you, partner.

149
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,329
Also,

150
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:14,126
I'm ecstatic that I caught that jerk.

151
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,892
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

152
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,352
Are you here
because of the illegal gambling ring?

153
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,020
-What did they say?
-Nothing much.

154
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,480
What about you? Any good news?

155
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:35,981
Excuse me.

156
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,818
-Dong-man!
-Gosh.

157
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,280
I decided to serve you
as my big brother from today.

158
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,908
You're a true detective, not a pig.

159
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,160
And you're super loyal.

160
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,245
Jeez, stop it.

161
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,747
Just write up good articles.

162
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,251
Don't just write click-baits, got it?

163
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,378
You can trust me.

164
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,256
I'll repay you with my article
since you called me the first thing.

165
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,052
By the way, have you not identified
the suspect who fled from the scene?

166
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,933
His name is Jang Jae-gyu,
and he is 30 years old.

167
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,893
His records are shown below.

168
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,687
He was convicted five times of fraud

169
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,189
and twice of attempted murder and assault.

170
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,694
Gosh, this bastard is such a mess.

171
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,446
It took some time to find out
about his residence.

172
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,532
We'll be asking around from today.

173
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,784
Okay.

174
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,160
Right, Dong-man.

175
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,830
In the witness statement,

176
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,749
you wrote that you saw him
talking on the phone

177
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,917
while coming out.

178
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,961
Yes, what about it?

179
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,131
We've received the seized evidence
from the KCSI.

180
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,926
I've searched through them,
but there were no phones.

181
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,345
What?

182
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,977
We're done, right?

183
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,148
Well, you've confessed to everything,

184
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,774
and we've got solid evidence.

185
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,533
But there's one thing
I really want to ask you, Mr. Go.

186
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,830
I've checked the transactions
of your illegal gambling ring.

187
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,042
Every month for six years,

188
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,878
you've consistently cashed out
the money at ATMs.

189
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,047
Always 80 percent of your revenue.

190
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,010
I'm sure you didn't just save them
somewhere else.

191
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,723
What did you do with all that money?

192
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,354
What do you think?
I've put it to good use.

193
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,985
Where's your phone?

194
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,992
I saw you talking on the phone,

195
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,037
so don't try to play tricks on me
and tell me.

196
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,664
What did you do with it, you punk?

197
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,333
What phone?

198
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,462
Stop saying nonsense, Professor Yu.

199
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,802
You've made your confession,

200
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,012
but you're going to play dumb about this?

201
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,812
There's something in that phone, right?

202
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,031
You're not in charge of this case.

203
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,868
Do I need to answer his questions,
Captain Choi?

204
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,330
What are you scared about?

205
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,332
You're making it obvious.

206
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,595
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM

207
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,682
Gosh, he doesn't even have
an accent anymore.

208
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,475
My gosh.

209
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,191
-What is it?
-Hello, Professor.

210
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,653
Put away your phone from your ears.

211
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,530
Keep some distance from it.

212
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,365
It's a video call.

213
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,617
What are you guys doing?

214
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,162
To celebrate the success
of our first investigation,

215
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,873
we came to the beach!

216
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,130
Professor, can you see?

217
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,591
It's the emerald green sea!

218
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,598
You should stop seeing
all the gray buildings

219
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,600
and look at the sea too. Here.

220
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,727
Professor?

221
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,437
What happened? Professor?

222
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,315
He hung up.

223
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,692
At least it was longer
than Professor Kwon's call.

224
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,818
His call lasted one second.

225
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,279
Hey, Beom-tae.

226
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,573
Take a photo of me with the sea behind me.

227
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,657
-Again?
-Again.

228
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,326
I got already got you
more than a hundred photos.

229
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,911
I need at least a thousand photos.

230
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,081
-Jeez…
-Let's go. Come on.

231
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,874
-Here.
-No!

232
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,211
Okay, stay there. Wait.

233
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,213
Okay, good. Now smile.

234
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,673
Show me a big smile. Give a wink.

235
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,968
-Good.
-Let me see.

236
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,474
The sea is so nice.

237
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,938
I know. It's so refreshing.

238
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,023
Shall we take a walk?

239
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,776
They will take more than 30 minutes
to take photos.

240
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,735
Okay.

241
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,073
-Hey, I took a lot of photos.
-Let me see.

242
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,783
Gosh, this is tiring.

243
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,537
-Hey, Beom-tae. Let's go.
-What? Where?

244
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,163
-Let's just go.
-Why?

245
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,791
-Just go. Come on.
-Why? Where are we going?

246
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:46,959
Why?

247
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,086
Why?

248
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,789
So your mother's having another trial?

249
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,417
Yes. The attorney called me this morning.

250
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,710
-Really?
-Yes.

251
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,253
That's a relief, Kang-hui.

252
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,755
It seems you like it more than I do.

253
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,259
I was worried that

254
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,636
I might have to arrest her by myself

255
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,138
as a police officer.

256
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,141
But I think it was a good decision

257
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,601
to become a police officer.

258
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,688
I could save my mom because of it.

259
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,235
What? Are they doing a flea market?

260
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,116
They're so pretty.

261
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,785
-So pretty.
-What about this one?

262
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,996
That's pretty. Try it on.

263
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,055
Before your mom's trial,

264
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,723
let's pay her a visit together.

265
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,267
-A visit?
-Yes.

266
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,396
I want to tell her in person.

267
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,440
About what?

268
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,610
That we're dating?
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,903
Not that.

270
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,447
That she has a great daughter.

271
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,033
I see.

272
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,039
By the way, are we not going to
tell the guys that we're dating?

273
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,084
Well, I kept it from my mom
since I didn't want to make a fuss.

274
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,585
We should tell the guys.

275
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,712
Let's go and tell them.

276
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,047
Really?

277
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,674
Of course it's true.

278
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,092
You're the only one who didn't know.

279
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,720
How could all of you not tell me about it?

280
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,681
Anyway, we need to go now.

281
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,016
Wait. Well…

282
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,936
But still,
how can we leave them alone here?

283
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,771
There's the bus and everything.

284
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,356
They can take care of themselves.

285
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,108
Just trust me on this.

286
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,402
You don't understand
because you've never dated.

287
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,696
What? I've never dated?

288
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,658
Hey. Have you ever had a girlfriend?

289
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,410
I had one when I studied abroad.

290
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,161
Her name was Krystal.

291
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,415
Really? So you've had one!

292
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,375
She really liked me, you know.

293
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,628
Gosh, so you've had a girlfriend.

294
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,714
Of course I have.

295
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,383
Then where did you meet her?

296
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,136
When I studied in LA,

297
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,887
I had a house party at my place.

298
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,223
-Gosh.
-That's when I met her.

299
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,350
It's like a movie.

300
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,436
-How old were you?
-When I was 21.

301
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,729
-When you were 21?
-Yes.

302
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,564
-Was she pretty?
-She was older than me.

303
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,864
Where did they go to take photos?

304
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,866
Joon-wuk is not answering too.

305
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,745
Those fools. No way!

306
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,084
Have a great time.

307
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,504
By the way,
there's no direct bus to Seoul.

308
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,590
Those crazy punks!

309
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,594
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

310
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:39,107
DO NOT ENTER
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

311
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,697
I'm sure there's something in that phone.

312
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,076
I'm going to find it no matter what.

313
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,251
Gosh.

314
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,713
It must be around here somewhere.

315
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,773
Damn it…

316
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,612
HELP ME!

317
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,447
What's this?

318
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,752
I like scallops too.

319
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,673
You can have this.

320
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,299
You must be tired from coming
all the way here.

321
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,969
It's okay. Of course I should come.

322
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,555
You didn't have your wallet,
and the taxi ride would cost 200,000 won.

323
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,060
It seems like
someone's not happy to see me.

324
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,313
That's not true.

325
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,317
-A bottle of soju and beer, please.
-Sure.

326
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,779
Looks like someone wants a drink.
Okay, let's drink until we drop.

327
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,489
I won't drink.

328
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,575
One of us has to drive, you know.

329
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,827
It's okay. Don't worry.
Our chauffeur will be here.

330
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,454
-A chauffeur?
-Or…

331
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,373
we can find a place to sleep.

332
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,961
I came all the way here for you,
so don't make me regret it.

333
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,527
Sun-ho, how come you're so manly today?

334
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,528
No, stop teasing me.

335
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,789
You see,

336
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,334
I don't envy you guys at all.

337
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,295
Even if I could turn back time,

338
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,464
I'd never go back to the time
when I was your age.

339
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,633
Come on. You're lying.

340
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,968
Why not?

341
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,179
Because I'm sick of it.

342
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,140
Why did I get excited

343
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,143
and upset so easily back then?

344
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,939
I know everything now,
so nothing can faze me.

345
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,108
Whether it's love or just affection…

346
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,320
My gosh, that's very sad.

347
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,990
No. It's convenient, not sad.

348
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,204
-Kang Sun-ho.
-Yes.

349
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,332
How did you and Yu Dong-man first meet?

350
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,251
You already knew each other
at your interview.

351
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,630
That's right.
I've been curious about that too.

352
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,720
At first, we were like enemies.

353
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,141
My gosh. When he came to get me,

354
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,602
I thought I was done for.

355
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,146
-What?
-He came to get you?

356
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,233
You? Why?

357
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,610
Professor Yu?

358
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,075
Professor Choi!

359
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,204
This place is so far away!

360
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,165
He's here! Our chauffeur is here!

361
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,875
Yu the chauffeur!

362
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,377
She's drunk again.

363
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,586
Professor Yu!

364
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,090
Come and join us. Come here!

365
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,928
You see,

366
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:41,057
I have to find
a critical piece of evidence.

367
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,519
This is obstruction of justice.

368
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,604
The investigation is over now.

369
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,274
What do you need to find?

370
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,944
Why did you drink so much?

371
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,864
The ocean breeze felt nice.

372
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,367
It was nice to see those youngsters
having a great time.

373
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,369
The grilled clams were delicious,

374
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,747
and the person I wanted to see came.

375
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,251
Are you always like this?

376
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,462
What do you mean?

377
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,632
Are you always this straightforward?

378
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,053
It depends on who I'm talking to.

379
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,972
Why? Do you not like it?

380
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,436
Goodness.
Just be quiet and get some sleep.

381
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,564
Let's put on some music.

382
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,026
Gosh, why are you being like this?

383
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,154
I should get some sleep. Let's sleep.

384
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,490
-Seriously.
-Let's sleep.

385
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,201
Goodness. Don't lean on me.

386
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,619
I'm tired.

387
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,455
Hold on. Go the other way.

388
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,248
It's more comfortable here.

389
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,793
Don't be so mean. Let me get some sleep.

390
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,295
Gosh, Professor Choi.

391
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,340
You're really something.

392
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,513
She's such a handful.

393
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,631
-Sun-ho!
-Hey.

394
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,844
My gosh, what is this?

395
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,512
-Beom-tae, check this out.
-What's up?

396
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,055
It looks like he's been working out.

397
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,515
-Let me see.
-Hey! Stop.

398
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,767
-Oh, my.
-Stop it!

399
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,185
-I've been working out too.
-Me too.

400
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,438
-Are you sure?
-No?

401
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,529
Well…

402
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,742
You must find it funny that I'm doing this

403
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,326
after I wrote a letter like that,

404
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,706
but I promised my students
that I would come back,

405
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,292
so I wanted to keep my promise.

406
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,008
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing
because I think it's funny.

407
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,468
It's all right.

408
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,886
It is funny.

409
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:28,224
Anyway, thank you
for rejecting my resignation.

410
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,018
I really appreciate it.

411
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:36,608
To tell you the truth, your letter
made me think about a lot of things.

412
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,652
The word "teacher" consists of characters

413
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,988
that mean "ahead" and "life".

414
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,616
We were just born ahead of our students

415
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,243
and experienced things
before they do in life.

416
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:52,665
If we do the right things
so we can serve as an example

417
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,753
and pave the path for them,

418
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,755
then that's enough.

419
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,717
And I will ruthlessly get rid
of anyone who tries to meddle

420
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,386
and make that path difficult
for our students.

421
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,766
My gosh.
We're on the same page about that.

422
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,978
So with that said,

423
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,524
I hope that was the last time
you pull off a dangerous stunt

424
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,611
with our students.

425
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,615
How did you know?

426
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,202
Professor Kwon told me.

427
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,830
He called me right before the arrest.

428
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,833
I see.

429
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,345
-Why? What did you do?
-Hey, guys!

430
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,721
Guys.

431
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,598
Hey.

432
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,808
Did you hear that?

433
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,810
The person who arrested Professor Go…

434
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,651
Rumor has it
that one of our professors did it.

435
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,114
-And?
-And?

436
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,034
-Yes. Who else?
-Who else?

437
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,329
-The police?
-No, not the police. You know…

438
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,834
-Who else?
-No, that's it. Just the cops.

439
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,793
Hey.

440
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,422
-You know we have to keep it to ourselves.
-You stay out of this.

441
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,758
Who else? Do you know
if anyone else was involved?

442
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,138
-No.
-I'm sure there was someone else…

443
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,848
No, no one else was involved.

444
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,308
That's what I heard.

445
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,268
-There was someone else.
-No.

446
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,394
There was.

447
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,523
Attention, everyone.

448
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:48,156
I'm sure you're aware
your roommate changes every semester.

449
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,326
The room allocation
has already been completed.

450
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,620
Everyone, please take out your phone.

451
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,455
As soon as you check the school website,

452
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,874
you will pack your things
and move to your new room.

453
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,083
Go.

454
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,088
SECOND SEMESTER ROOM ALLOCATION

455
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,009
Beom-tae! We're roommates!

456
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,177
What?

457
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,139
We're roommates again.

458
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,557
Let's have another great semester.

459
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,726
This is awesome.

460
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,562
Sun-ho, who's your roommate?

461
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,361
PARK MIN-GYU

462
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,949
It'll be okay.

463
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,202
Min-gyu might be a little cranky,

464
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,496
but…

465
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,291
at least he's handsome.

466
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,501
That's right.

467
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,587
Min-gyu is definitely good-looking.

468
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,505
That's right.

469
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,634
Just accept it.

470
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,804
Hi, handsome Min-gyu.

471
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,641
Can you guys get out?
This is a small room.

472
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,143
-Sure, of course.
-Sorry. Let's go.

473
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,312
-Let's go.
-We'll catch you later.

474
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,910
Min-gyu.

475
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,457
We'll be sharing the room
for the semester,

476
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,085
and we can't change our roommates,

477
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,671
so I hope we can get along.

478
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,013
You're still making promises
that you can't keep.

479
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,974
-What?
-Just take care of Kang-hui.

480
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,644
Although I'm not sure
how long she'll be with you.

481
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,111
Why that jerk…

482
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,827
What?

483
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,759
It's 300 euros?

484
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,235
Is it a luxury brand or something?
How annoying.

485
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,404
What's annoying?

486
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,618
-What's that?
-What?

487
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,953
It's nothing.

488
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,791
Did you ask Ms. Baek
if you could change your room?

489
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,170
Yes. She just told me
to move out of the dormitory.

490
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,963
I guess you'll just have to stay with him.

491
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,759
I should try and get along with him.

492
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,844
You're so nice, Sun-ho.

493
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,327
I like Sun-ho. You like Kang-hui, right?

494
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,829
Na-rae.

495
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,248
Why don't we form an alliance?

496
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,000
An alliance?

497
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,169
I'll help you, and you'll help me.

498
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,922
If it still doesn't work,
then we'll just give up.

499
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,758
"Misery loves company."
Is that what this is?

500
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,885
Hey, that makes us look pathetic.

501
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,681
"Two hands are better than one."

502
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,849
How about that?

503
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,106
Then why don't we…

504
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,764
What's that?

505
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,268
What? It's nothing.

506
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,203
What is that?

507
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,622
A gift from my boyfriend.

508
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,958
Oh, I see.

509
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,514
Do you really think
it was the right decision?

510
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,184
Sorry?

511
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,771
The professors taking the students
to arrest Professor Go.

512
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,274
You knew
that could put everyone in danger.

513
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,990
That's why I opposed your return.

514
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,411
Although Professor Seo,
Professor Kwon, and Professor Choi

515
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,331
decided to turn a blind eye to it.

516
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,167
Wait.

517
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,297
How did you know
I arrested them with the kids?

518
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,928
I heard it from Professor Seo.

519
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,514
Apparently,
Professor Kwon called Professor Seo.

520
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,778
What's this about?

521
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,029
Why on earth

522
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,240
did you call Professor Seo
before the arrest?

523
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,117
What are you talking about--

524
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,160
Cybercrime investigation
is all about information.

525
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,539
What was your ultimate motive
for leaking our information?

526
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,833
We got our students involved.

527
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,794
I thought it was a must

528
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,672
to tell the head professor
in case of accidents.

529
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,551
What's your problem?

530
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,930
What are you accusing me of?

531
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,058
Why would you say that I'm accusing you?

532
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,355
I could've asked you
for no special reason.

533
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,316
You didn't just ask me a question.

534
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,488
I think you're only hearing
what you want to hear

535
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,157
and seeing what you want to see.

536
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,831
I know you've been investigating
this case for a long time.

537
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,000
But it's over now.

538
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,961
You should let it go already.

539
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,088
I'm saying this because I'm concerned.

540
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,554
The new semester begins tomorrow,

541
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,431
so you should have a nice dinner

542
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,516
and get refreshed, okay?

543
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,778
KWON HYUK-PHIL

544
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,659
Hey.

545
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,126
Did you eat?

546
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,259
Thank you.

547
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,515
-Why are we having jokbal?
-You seemed to like it last time.

548
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,351
No, I'm asking why you suddenly
wanted to eat with me.

549
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,936
Well…

550
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,564
Someone told me to eat something nice

551
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,566
and get refreshed.

552
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,944
Also, I realized

553
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:09,281
that I've never treated you
to a nice meal.

554
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,699
What do you mean?

555
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,619
We had takeouts
while talking about the case every night.

556
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,413
Did we?

557
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,334
But it is much better
to eat in a restaurant.

558
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,758
But why do you look so down?

559
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:34,306
Jeez, what is it? Spill it.

560
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,309
Professor.

561
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,982
This is really my friend's story.

562
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,318
He said he got a gift for his girlfriend.

563
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,114
Something rather cheap but really pretty.

564
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:57,121
But the jerk who likes his girlfriend
also got a gift for her.

565
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,248
And it was of a luxury brand.

566
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,251
His girlfriend will be much happier

567
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,629
with the gift of the luxury brand, right?

568
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,759
Are you dumb or something?

569
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,140
Even if it's something cheap,
it makes you happy

570
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,600
if it's from someone you like.

571
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,561
If the gift is from someone she hates
even if it's expensive,

572
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,647
she'll wonder why he gave it to her.
That's what she'll think.

573
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,401
Also, if the girl doesn't like you
for giving a cheap gift,

574
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,694
then stop seeing a brat like her.

575
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,071
Why would you call her a brat?

576
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,452
Then why do you look so down?

577
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:44,418
This is actually the story of my friend.

578
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,506
My friend told his close friend

579
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,884
to keep a secret.

580
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,886
It was a secret
that should never be revealed.

581
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,722
He repeatedly told his friend
never to tell anyone.

582
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,977
But his friend told the secret
to someone else right away.

583
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,021
Why do you think he did that?

584
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,316
What's there to think about?
It's because he's a bad friend.

585
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,320
Why would you keep someone
like him as your friend?

586
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,739
Secrets are meant to be kept.

587
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,534
I never befriend someone
who can't keep his mouth shut.

588
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,786
Just have the jokbal.

589
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,913
A beer and soju, please.

590
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,706
Stop drinking already.

591
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,124
Whatever. Let me drink more.

592
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,001
Gosh, he's drinking so much
in broad daylight.

593
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,887
Where are you going?

594
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,139
To dig something.

595
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,559
-Sorry?
-Never mind.

596
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,019
I'll tell you when I find it. Go on in.

597
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,647
Okay. See you.

598
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,069
Goodness, that punk.

599
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,617
Stand tall, you punk!

600
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,911
We might not have money,
but we have pride!

601
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,706
What are you talking about?

602
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,417
What do you think? Good luck!

603
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,183
Even if it's something cheap,
it makes you happy

604
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,227
if it's from someone you like.

605
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,779
Hey, Kang-hui.

606
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,198
Where are you?

607
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,499
What? I thought you were at the dormitory.

608
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,753
I stepped out to grab a bite
with Professor Yu.

609
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,136
Isn't this so pretty?

610
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,263
What?

611
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,098
I love it.

612
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:14,985
What's wrong?

613
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:21,950
Nothing. Shouldn't we
get back for the roll call?

614
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,497
No one else is here.

615
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,792
-Let's go.
-Okay.

616
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,309
It's not here either.

617
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,270
Darn it.

618
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,318
Where could it be?

619
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,203
Hold on a second.

620
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,052
Darn it.

621
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,225
What?

622
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,195
Jeez. Go Deok-bae, that scumbag!

623
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,617
That jerk…

624
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,749
What's wrong with this?

625
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,293
Is it dead?

626
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,010
I know you've been investigating
this case for a long time.

627
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,720
But it's over now.

628
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,693
CAPTAIN

629
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,408
Hey, it's me. Are you at the precinct now?

630
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,454
Go Deok-bae, you're dead meat now.

631
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,331
Excuse me.

632
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,458
-Professor Choi?
-May I ask you something?

633
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,295
I'm here to meet Han Jeong-sik,

634
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,255
the head of Investigation.

635
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,883
His office is at the end
of the hallway, on the right.

636
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,927
Thank you.

637
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,384
This punk…

638
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,844
He bluffed about obtaining

639
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,429
a critical piece of evidence.

640
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,639
Where did he go?

641
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,366
RECENT CALLS

642
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,958
The site will go live at 9 p.m. tonight.

643
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,211
Professor Choi and I will each take one.

644
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,672
I think they found out
that we hacked them.

645
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,592
There's no way
our information leaked though.

646
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,609
The phone is turned off.

647
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,485
Please call again another time.

648
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,335
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

649
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,504
A new semester,
but Constitutional Law isn't over.

650
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,215
My point exactly.
We're only halfway through.

651
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,801
How are we going to hold out?
It'll be intense.

652
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,970
You buffoons!

653
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,806
You jerks don't even understand
why the law matters!

654
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,558
Calm down, Joon-wuk.

655
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,560
Article 21 of the Constitution states that

656
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,146
even idiots like them have the right
to freedom of expression.

657
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,691
We should be patient,
as future judicial experts.

658
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,652
KWON HYUK-PHIL

659
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,862
What is that about?

660
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,824
Joon-wuk, let's go to class.

661
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,118
You idiots.

662
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,373
-Come on. Let's go.
-Right.

663
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:26,171
I'm telling you.
I saw it with my own eyes.

664
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,221
You don't have any classes today, right?

665
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,108
-Hello.
-Hello.

666
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,738
You're busy.

667
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,032
Maybe I shouldn't have asked you
to hang out with me.

668
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,702
It's okay. The judo class begins tomorrow.

669
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,496
You said Gossi Beer opened

670
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,916
after you joined the University, right?

671
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,546
Yes. About three years
after I was transferred here.

672
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,965
I see. That means you've known

673
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,550
Go Deok-bae for a long time.

674
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,427
Were you two close?

675
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,637
How close could we have been?

676
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,390
He owned a pub,
and I was just one of his customers.

677
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,726
That's right.
You don't know him that well, right?

678
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,395
Of course, I don't.

679
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,565
By the way,

680
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,693
what were you doing
at the Seoul headquarters yesterday?

681
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,824
I think I saw someone who looked like you.

682
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,246
Come on.
Not many women are as pretty as I am.

683
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,458
It was me. I stopped by to see a friend.

684
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,211
I'm here to meet Han Jeong-sik,

685
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,255
the head of Investigation.

686
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,597
Was it about two years ago?

687
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,600
One of the former professors
at the Police University

688
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,268
was transferred there.

689
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,480
A female inspector.
She invited me to her wedding,

690
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,981
but I won't be able to make it,

691
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,817
so I stopped by to see her
and give her my wedding gift.

692
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,870
Aren't we getting in?

693
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,748
Right, yes.

694
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,133
There is a clause that states

695
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,678
a guilty verdict can only be given
when there is no reasonable doubt.

696
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,639
And the police protocol states

697
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,974
we must investigate any given case

698
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,185
and the cause of death of a case

699
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,647
until all reasonable doubt is ruled out.

700
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,273
In these two sentences,

701
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,193
"reasonable doubt" has different meanings.

702
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,531
A suspicion
that the defendant may be guilty.

703
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,908
And reasonable doubt.

704
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,285
A doubt that the defendant
may not be guilty.

705
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:07,541
The latter leads to
the presumption of innocence.

706
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,085
According to the precedent,

707
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,420
the Supreme Court uses
the standard of the Common law,

708
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,464
which states
that reasonable doubts need proof.

709
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,258
It also uses German law,

710
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,677
which states
that it needs proof and probability

711
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,388
that the court can
make verdicts with certainty.

712
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,807
Those are the standards
that the Supreme Court uses.

713
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:27,936
Kang-hui.

714
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,691
Can I talk with you for a minute
if it's okay?

715
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,234
Sure.

716
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,284
Last time,

717
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,579
I was so upset

718
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,249
that I made a mistake.
I'm sorry about that.

719
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,918
It's fine. It's all in the past.

720
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,924
I heard your mother
is having another trial.

721
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,426
Yes.

722
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,512
Speaking of which,

723
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,932
I want to help you
if you encounter a problem.

724
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,435
Can I do that, at least?

725
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,187
I'd be grateful.

726
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,390
Kang-hui.

727
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,435
-Kang-hui.
-Yes?

728
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,812
-Are you listening?
-Sorry. What did you say?

729
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,482
That I'm grateful too.

730
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,445
I…

731
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,906
I didn't think you'd wear that.

732
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,036
-What?
-What?

733
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,958
I gave you that bracelet.
Didn't Na-rae tell you?

734
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,452
Kang-hui.

735
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,248
What's the matter with you?

736
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,377
Why didn't you tell me
that bracelet wasn't from you?

737
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,962
Why didn't you say
that you don't want me to wear it?

738
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,214
I thought it was from you.

739
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,801
How could you do nothing about it?

740
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,178
It's not that I wanted to.

741
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,848
I also didn't like it,
and it made me feel so small.

742
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,100
But I couldn't act on my emotions

743
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,518
because…

744
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,022
you seemed to like it.

745
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,276
Even so, why would you hold back
with something like this?

746
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,611
Aren't you supposed to be my boyfriend?

747
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,576
Whatever. Let's just stop.

748
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,329
Fine.

749
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,042
I'll act on my emotions from now on.

750
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,295
Don't ever wear the bracelet
that Min-gyu gave you.

751
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,629
And…

752
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,302
I want you to wear this only.

753
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,278
Wait. This is…

754
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,240
You were looking at it
when we were at the beach.

755
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,871
It's nothing expensive

756
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,499
or nice, so…

757
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,544
Okay, so will you put it on me already?

758
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:57,705
They say red coral protects you
from bad luck and brings you a fortune.

759
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,669
But I'll protect you from bad luck,

760
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,297
so you'll only need to wait
for your fortune.

761
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,053
You picked a bracelet that resembles you.

762
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,224
I'm saying that I love it.

763
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,690
It's prettier
than what Min-gyu got you, right?

764
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,400
Of course. Why even bother to ask?

765
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,484
Are you sure?

766
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,446
It's not that cheap though.

767
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,655
How much is it?

768
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,908
-I don't know.
-Okay, you don't have to say it.

769
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,264
Dong-man.

770
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,201
Are you doing okay?

771
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,748
I'm sorry.

772
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,876
At least you know.

773
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,379
I'm more at ease now.

774
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,134
I don't have to lie anymore.

775
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,348
You ended it for me.

776
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,893
You crazy punk. Cut the nonsense.

777
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,482
Your mother…

778
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,527
cried a lot.

779
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,613
What's done is done,

780
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,699
so you'll only need to reflect
on yourself.

781
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,495
Don't refrain from seeing your family.

782
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,457
I came to tell you this.

783
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,640
You should stop coming to see me.

784
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,728
We can see each other again

785
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,856
after I pay for what I did.

786
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,234
When we do,

787
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,821
I'll tell you why I did what I did.

788
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,119
And don't get hurt.

789
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,756
Cheol-jin.

790
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,346
Let me ask you one last thing.

791
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,311
Is Go Deok-bae…

792
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,772
the last person we needed to arrest?

793
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,550
Professor Yu, are you in your office?

794
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,097
My roommate is keeping an eye on me,

795
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,474
so I can't go to your office.
I can only talk to you through this.

796
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,229
Anyway, you were right.

797
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:36,317
That it matters more who gave the gift
than how much it cost.

798
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,040
You're finally back, Yoon.

799
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,630
Oh, right. You're not Yoon.

800
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,175
You're Kang Sun-ho.

801
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,813
Is Go Deok-bae

802
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,691
the last person we needed to arrest?

803
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,821
Back then and even now,

804
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,657
I can only tell you this one thing.

805
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,077
That the culprit is
in the Police University.

806
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,080
That's all I know.

807
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,126
So with that said,

808
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:40,047
I hope that was the last time you pull off
a dangerous stunt with our students.

809
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,091
We got our students involved.

810
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,302
I thought it was a must

811
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,554
to tell the head professor
in case of accidents.

812
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,055
By the way,

813
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,849
what were you doing
at the Seoul headquarters yesterday?

814
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,476
A female inspector.

815
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,771
She invited me to her wedding,
but I won't be able to make it,

816
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,440
so I stopped by to see her
and give her my wedding gift.

817
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,369
RECENT CALLS

818
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,937
How do you think a hacker
ended up in the Police University?

819
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,440
What is this?

01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,654

821
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,328

Namyang-dong 37-1, Jongno-gu, Seoul.

829
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:11,240
Officer Yu Dong-man let off
Kang Sun-ho, the hacker.

830
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,367
YU DONG-MAN

831
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,913
Did he help you?

832
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,377
Who are you?

833
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,256
Was his name Kang Sun-ho?

834
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,175
He's an interesting character.

835
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,678
I guess you're fond of him, right?

836
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:17,014
The case of the illegal gambling ring.
I don't think we are done yet.

837
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,684
Be honest with me.
Is there something I should know?

838
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,435
Do as I say.

839
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,479
Nothing will happen, right?
Everything will be okay, right?

840
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,815
Will you join hands with me and live?

841
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,901
Or will you fall off the cliff
with Yu Dong-man?

842
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,445
The choice is yours, Kang Sun-ho.
