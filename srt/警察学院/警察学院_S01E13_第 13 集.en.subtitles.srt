1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:07,674
LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,594
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,306
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

4
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,820
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,511
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,710
Human life…

7
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,879
is a tenacious thing.

8
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,510
It'd have been easier

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,720
if you just died in the accident.

10
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,434
Why make it hard

11
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,561
for both of us?

12
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,288
The higher-ups are telling you to stop.

13
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,749
If you keep at it,

14
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:09,129
someone else might get hurt.

15
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,716
It could be the hacker you let go,

16
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,261
Kang Sun-ho.

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,139
He'll probably be next.

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,475
Make a wise choice.

19
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,188
Don't let them hurt the kid, okay?

20
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,482
You don't want him

21
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,443
to end up like Park Cheol-jin.

22
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,405
Do you?

23
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,295
I'll leave you a gift,

24
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,631
so take a look at it when you wake up.

25
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,495
SUSPECT INTERVIEW REPORT
NAME: KANG SUN-HO

26
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,624
What is going on?

27
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,928
So tell me, Jang Jae-gyu.

28
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,181
The jerk who not only ran
an illegal gambling ring

29
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,392
but also tried to kill someone.

30
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,645
Who is the scumbag hiding
in the Police University?

31
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,363
POLICE

32
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,447
Darn it…

33
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,119
Do you think you can catch the culprit
if I tell you who it is?

34
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,414
You'll never catch that jerk.
Do you want to know why?

35
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,041
Because there's no evidence.

36
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,170
Then I should put you behind bars first!

37
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,463
You punk!

38
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,305
Go that way and search the area.

39
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,599
At KNPU, there's a safe

40
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,893
which Go Deok-bae and the head
used to exchange things.

41
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,521
There, you'll find
the gambling ring's ledger.

42
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,773
Ledger?

43
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,651
Kang Sun-ho, you go find it.

44
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,073
I'll give you the key.

45
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,328
You take the ledger

46
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,246
and give me the money in the safe.

47
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,707
-As if!
-You punk!

48
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,085
You have to catch that scumbag soon anyway

49
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,046
before things get worse for Yu Dong-man.

50
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,716
But I have to say, I'm curious too.

51
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,054
To see what choice you'll end up making.

52
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,852
Darn it.

53
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,634
Why does this have

54
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,929
your name and Sun-ho's name written on it?

55
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,601
He said the higher-ups wanted you to stop.
What does that mean?

56
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,353
And what does he mean

57
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,730
by Sun-ho being their next target?

58
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,275
Professor!

59
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,282
It was just an immature mistake he made

60
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,202
to earn money
to pay for his father's surgery.

61
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,290
That's why I let him go.

62
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,297
Sun-ho…

63
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,300
Where is he now?

64
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,028
Let's go this way.

65
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,980
Spill it.

66
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,650
You just woke up.

67
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll tell you when you get better.

68
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,448
Just spill it, you punk.
I'm not going to die.

69
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,911
Jang Jae-gyu

70
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,455
blackmailed me through Black Net,

71
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,249
so I tracked him down.

72
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,835
I figured out his location by hacking him.

73
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,507
I was going to tell you,

74
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,009
but you got into an accident,

75
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,262
and I anonymously reported
Jang Jae-gyu's location

76
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,475
to Detective Joo,
thinking we must catch him.

77
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,896
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,859
What did he blackmail you with?

79
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,449
Your report?

80
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,454
Were you trying to destroy it
after catching him?

81
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,958
Did you have to act up

82
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,961
and do illegal hacking
just so that you can destroy your report?

83
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,337
No.

84
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,173
I was going to find the culprit

85
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,759
hiding in our school
after catching Jang Jae-gyu.

86
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,345
What did you say?

87
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,138
You wrote it in your notebook.

88
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,850
Seo Sang-hak,
Kwon Hyuk-phil, and Choi Hee-su.

89
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,894
One of them is the real culprit,

90
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,646
and I went to catch them.

91
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,278
There's a safe in KNPU

92
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,489
that Go Deok-bae and the culprit
used to trade things.

93
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,784
The illegal gambling ring's ledger
is in it too.

94
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,663
Professor Yu.

95
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,542
If we find it,
we'll be able to catch the ringleader.

96
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,379
Who told you that?

97
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,340
Jang Jae-gyu, that jerk?

98
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,304
Are you out of your mind?

99
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,182
-You believe what a criminal said?
-I know.

100
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,312
He must've thought

101
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,522
it'd be easy to get rid of me

102
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,233
since I have a record of illegal hacking.

103
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,487
But I can't avoid it even if I want to.

104
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,281
Nothing will change if I stop.

105
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,242
I should keep going
to get something out of it.

106
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,037
That's what you told me.

107
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,623
-You punk.
-Even if you stop me,

108
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,542
I'll do it anyway.

109
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:34,342
You only got injured this time,
but you never know what might happen next.

110
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,846
I must catch that jerk

111
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,223
before anything worse happens.

112
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,018
Sun-ho.

113
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,356
I'm sorry…

114
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,984
about everything.

115
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,406
Hey, Sun-ho.

116
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,200
Hey. Kang Sun-ho!

117
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,797
-You guys…
-No, you can't go.

118
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,509
-Kang-hui.
-You should listen to Professor Yu.

119
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,844
Or just listen to me.

120
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,431
Do you think you're already in the force?

121
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,558
Don't fool yourself.
You're still a student.

122
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,727
With what you've done so far,

123
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,021
you've already crossed the line.

124
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,566
So you should stop.

125
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,280
One of the professors is the real culprit?

126
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,783
Is this true?

127
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,619
So everything you said in there
is true, right?

128
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,754
Do it.

129
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,925
-You should go for it.
-What did you say?

130
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,427
But…

131
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,096
let us join you.

132
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,476
Sun-ho, let us join.

133
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,357
Who do you think we are?

134
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,944
Even Professor Yu who worked as an officer

135
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,362
for more than 20 years got hurt.

136
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,656
He got lucky. He could've died.

137
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,577
This isn't practical training.
It's a real crime scene.

138
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,745
And Sun-ho is saying he'll go there!

139
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,289
If it's that dangerous,

140
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,541
then we should go with him.

141
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,961
That way, it'd be less dangerous for him.

142
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,921
Professor Yu told us

143
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,174
that if we don't give up,

144
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,384
justice will prevail.

145
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,517
No.

146
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,437
You'll have to give up this time.

147
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,318
I'm going to stop you guys at all costs,
and nothing will work the way you want.

148
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,778
Go ahead and try if you can.

149
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,048
What? Really?

150
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,678
I'm glad to hear
that Professor Yu woke up.

151
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,973
Yes. I got it.

152
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,102
Professor Yu is recovering.

153
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,023
Who wants to come with me and visit him?

154
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,277
I'll go next time. I have a class later.

155
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,532
I see. What about you, Professor Kwon?

156
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,826
I'll pass too. There's something
I need to find out before seeing him.

157
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,463
I have an urgent issue to discuss with you

158
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,257
to tighten the rules
and conduct of students.

159
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,134
Tighten the rules?

160
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,973
No way. Are you serious?

161
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,057
Yes.

162
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,143
They got caught drinking outside
without permission.

163
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,896
Those unlucky punks.

164
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,107
How did they get caught?

165
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,693
They got drunk and hit on girls.
And one of them…

166
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,445
turned out to be Guidance Director.

167
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,905
What?

168
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,825
-For real?
-Yes. Isn't that crazy?

169
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,494
It's so scary.

170
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,912
I just got chills.

171
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,173
It's a simple math question.

172
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,218
It was far past 2 a.m.

173
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,345
The students who got changed in secret

174
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,139
went out of the premises
without permission.

175
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,974
Then they headed to a pub.

176
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,352
They had so much fun
and drank all they wanted.

177
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,812
Here's the question.

178
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,981
How many penalty points
should I give them?

179
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,192
-Well…
-Around 30?

180
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,904
-Around 30 points?
-It's 60 points!

181
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,865
A total of 60 penalty points!

182
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,158
Ms. Baek.

183
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,618
Deep breaths. Relax.

184
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,330
I am relaxed!

185
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,962
What's the role of
a student council president?

186
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,007
Maintaining student discipline,

187
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,842
directing and controlling
overall school life…

188
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,885
That's right.

189
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,721
That's precisely the president's duty.

190
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,642
-What about the chief of management?
-Yes, ma'am.

191
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,977
What about the chief of education?

192
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,522
Why are you neglecting your duties?

193
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,400
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

194
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,905
From this point forward, we're going
to tighten the student rules and conduct.

195
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,866
Professor Seo gladly agreed with it.

196
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,035
From now on,
if students get more than 30 points,

197
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,204
they'll be on probation.
Once they get more than 60,

198
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,164
we'll hold a disciplinary committee

199
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,333
and review the students

200
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,585
and take appropriate disciplinary action.
Understood?

201
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,004
-Yes.
-Yes, ma'am.

202
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,589
Understood?

203
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,715
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

204
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,176
-Get out.
-Let's go.

205
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,306
You too. Get out.

206
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:20,104
GUIDANCE DIRECTOR BAEK HUI

207
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,981
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY
DISCIPLINARY RULES

208
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,024
AFTER CHANGE: PENALTY POINTS 30 TO 100

209
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,109
As you can see,

210
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,903
if anyone leaves the premises
without permission after the roll call,

211
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,280
they'll be on probation
no matter what their reasons are.

212
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,949
We should take turns

213
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,118
to patrol at night after the roll call.

214
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,911
Even if they're your seniors,
juniors, or classmates,

215
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,955
give them penalty points
without mercy. Got it?

216
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,124
-All right.
-Got it.

217
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,668
Gosh, everyone's going to blame
the student council.

218
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,964
"Understood?"

219
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,137
Make sure to supervise them thoroughly.

220
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,972
Hey, you're wearing slippers outside.

221
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,224
I'm going to kill them all.

222
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,566
-Sun-ho.
-Hey.

223
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,028
Kang-hui is in the dormitory.

224
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,071
I think she's still very upset.

225
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,783
Did you hear
how they tightened the student rules?

226
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,453
Why of all times…

227
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,122
I know, right?

228
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,167
We'll be okay though, right?

229
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,376
Well…

230
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,296
We'll just have to give it a try.
Right, Sun-ho?

231
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,175
You're right.
Sun-ho, what should we start with?

232
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,636
Before that,

233
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,722
I need to talk to you both.

234
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,022
-So…
-You were the accused in a case,

235
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,691
and Professor Yu
was the inspector in charge?

236
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,154
Regardless of the situation,

237
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,116
I shouldn't have committed a crime.

238
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,245
I thought it was the easiest way.

239
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,085
I'm sorry for telling you this so late.

240
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,219
It would've been better
if we were friends back then.

241
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,805
I could have lent you the money
right away…

242
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,307
But you guys are here with me now.

243
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,520
Anyway,

244
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,772
I have no excuse
even if I'm expelled from the school,

245
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,733
and I have nothing to lose.

246
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,736
So it's okay.

247
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,698
You don't have to do this with me.

248
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,372
Let me do it by myself.

249
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,707
It's something
I should take care of myself.

250
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,131
Hey, Kang Sun-ho.

251
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,430
Even though this might have started
because of you a year ago,

252
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,474
that's not the case now.

253
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,228
Right. This is not just for you.

254
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,481
We want to catch those jerks

255
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,276
that are talking about justice
in front of the students.

256
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,738
In fact, that jerk could be one of them.

257
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,990
Among the three.

258
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,285
That person could be one of the professors

259
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,578
or not.

260
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,704
He's right.

261
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,831
We're trying to check,

262
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,332
hoping that it's not one of them.

263
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,838
Let's not discuss this again.

264
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,339
We've decided

265
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,426
on that night already.

266
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,971
Do you get it? You punk?

267
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,974
That's right. Do you get it?

268
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,648
I get it, but what's up with that voice?

269
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,778
Gosh. How was it?
Wasn't I so cool just now?

270
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,989
You were awesome.

271
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,117
So…

272
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,244
What should we do first?

273
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,371
Right. What's the plan?

274
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,626
Just say it.

275
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,463
I was awesome, right?

276
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,468
If you keep at it,

277
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,305
someone else might get hurt.

278
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,975
It could be the hacker you let go,

279
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,685
Kang Sun-ho.

280
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,730
He'll probably be next.

281
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,593
Why is she so cold?

282
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,223
So when are you coming?

283
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,396
Why are you not answering, you wench?

284
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,856
Mom, what did you say?

285
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,943
You said you'd come to see me this week.

286
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,320
You said you'd come with your friend

287
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,198
and told me to behave
and watch my language and all.

288
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,158
You've made a fuss about it.

289
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,539
Well, I don't think
I can make it this week.

290
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,001
Why? Did you break up already?

291
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,920
-What?
-Or did he say

292
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,965
he doesn't want to come
because I'm in prison?

293
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,260
Gosh, I said I'd be there with my friend.

294
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,344
What are you saying?

295
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,180
Your friend, my foot, you wench.

296
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,933
He seems like a nobody, so just dump him.

297
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,937
You've never met him.
Why would you say that?

298
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,569
When you're old like me,
you just know it, you wench.

299
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,488
I've told you not to curse.

300
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,490
What's up with your language?

301
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,909
It's not like
I'm not asking you a big favor.

302
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,203
I'm just asking you not to curse.

303
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,956
Why are you taking it out on me,
you wench?

304
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,127
Hey! You think I'm a pushover, don't you?

305
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,921
You wench, hang up!

306
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,843
Gosh.

307
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,722
Kang-hui?

308
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,947
Is there something going on?

309
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,119
Well, you didn't have breakfast,

310
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,539
and it seemed that you were arguing
over the phone.

311
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,794
Are you watching me all the time?

312
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,799
I don't want to.

313
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,719
But seeing your face makes me worried.

314
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,516
Why? What's going on?

315
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,562
Well, Min-gyu.

316
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,662
Let's talk later.

317
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,666
-We have judo in the afternoon, right?
-Right.

318
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,847
Luckily, your car was sturdy.

319
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,558
If it wasn't, you could have died.

320
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,434
Do you know that?

321
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,437
Gosh, it could have been easier
if I had just died.

322
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,608
Let's go. He's fine already.

323
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,363
Oh, right.
The doctor was looking for his guardian.

324
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,739
-Really?
-Yes.

325
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,534
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

326
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,458
He's gone. Tell me about it.

327
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,252
What?

328
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,671
He's gone, so just tell me what it is.

329
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,299
Oh, right.

330
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,426
I've searched on KICS.

331
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,972
The report from October 21st, 2020,
the one you've told me about.

332
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,473
It wasn't on the server.

333
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,934
It wasn't?

334
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,228
If it's not on the server,

335
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,606
it means that it was written
but not uploaded.

336
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,776
I guess it was Cheol-jin.

337
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,820
Pardon?

338
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,031
Then…

339
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,201
If it's not on the server,

340
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,162
there won't be any problem…

341
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,169
If it was done
without finishing the investigation,

342
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,589
the report wouldn't have any legal force.

343
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,467
But you know,

344
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,594
the charge is still there.

345
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,472
If you get anything
and somehow summon him,

346
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,933
it will get complicated.

347
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,042
MUPUNG JUDO CLUB

348
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,637
The steps are important.

349
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,514
But the most important thing is,

350
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,935
don't try to pull with your arms.
Use the weight.

351
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,527
The basic shoulder throw

352
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,404
and the two arm shoulder throw
you just saw now.

353
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,072
Do you see the difference?

354
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,991
-Yes.
-Yes.

355
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,410
All right. Min-gyu, go back to your seat.

356
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,370
Let's start sparring

357
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,997
before we wrap up the class.

358
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,958
Regardless of sex, pair up and get ready.

359
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,005
AN HAE-JU

360
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,965
CHA SEONG-SU

361
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,801
NOH BEOM-TAE

362
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,894
Don't go easy on your opponent
just because they're the opposite sex.

363
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:45,812
Be respectful.

364
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,189
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

365
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,067
You still haven't had a change of heart?

366
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,195
I know that you've been very patient.

367
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,866
-But Kang-hui…
-Just answer my question.

368
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,177
Let me ask you one last time.

369
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,470
Are you really not changing your mind?

370
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,850
Can't you support my decision
one last time?

371
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,186
So you won't change your mind.

372
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,399
I'm sorry.

373
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,467
Don't apologize.

374
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,178
Because I'll probably have to

375
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,473
apologize to you
for what I'll do to you from now on.

376
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:18,530
CHUNGRAM LOUNGE

377
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,202
Let's talk.

378
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,000
That couple must have had a fight.

379
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,268
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

380
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,811
Forgive me.

381
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,567
I wanted to tell you many times.

382
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,653
I wanted to tell you everything,

383
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,157
but I couldn't…

384
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,661
because I was afraid you'd hate me.

385
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,416
I wanted to believe that it'd be forgotten

386
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,127
if I never brought it up.

387
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,592
But when I saw the report,
I realized something.

388
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,761
What I did,

389
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,846
the crime I committed…

390
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm the one who has to live with it,

391
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,270
not anyone else.

392
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,360
That's why I want to catch the culprit
with my own hands.

393
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,947
-So please…
-That's why you must stop.

394
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,952
Because I know that you'll be reckless

395
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,414
and fight head-on without even
thinking about the consequences.

396
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,211
Professor Yu said

397
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,423
it was just an immature mistake you made
when you were younger.

398
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,011
Right, I'm sure
it was just a mistake back then.

399
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,222
But if you go any further now,

400
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,682
it won't be a mistake anymore.

401
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,269
You'll have to take responsibility
for everything.

402
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,693
You may have to give up
becoming a police officer,

403
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,988
and you may get expelled.

404
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,408
Are you really ready
for such consequences?

405
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,249
Are you?

406
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,550
Then right now,

407
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,178
you probably need good luck

408
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,848
more than I do.

409
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,230
Take it.

410
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,698
KANG SUN-HO

411
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,622
You don't want him
to end up like Park Cheol-jin.

412
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,332
Do you?

413
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,675
Dong-man.

414
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,972
You called me here,
but you weren't in your room.

415
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,059
My goodness. How are you feeling?

416
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,229
What is that?

417
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,360
You told me to be a real journalist,
not a trashy reporter.

418
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,655
I worked very hard for a month
without sleeping

419
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,408
or even taking showers
to gather all the information.

420
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:20,248
This is the gambling ring's
bank transaction report?

421
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,165
Yes.

422
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,502
The thing is,
even the police are suspicious

423
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,045
because 80 percent of the income

424
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,672
is being withdrawn every month.

425
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,342
If they've been withdrawing
a huge amount every time,

426
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,927
they must've bought gold

427
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,679
or stored it in a safe somewhere.

428
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,765
It's either that, or they spent the money.

429
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,809
But where did they spend all that money?

430
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,813
Maybe they bribed someone,

431
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,440
so they wouldn't be caught.

432
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,151
They bribed someone?

433
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,321
I need you

434
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,991
to tail someone.

435
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,913
How many zeroes are there?
One, two, three, four…

436
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,667
Gosh, this is a lot of money.

437
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,711
It doesn't look like he has insurance.

438
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,297
All Dong-man has is debt.

439
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,840
I'm sure he's broke right now.

440
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,510
Should we raise funds to help him through
the National Police Agency's website?

441
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,638
-Or start a supporters foundation.
-A foundation?

442
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,353
That little…

443
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,897
Be quiet.

444
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,567
Damn it. I can't believe
that jerk is my supervisor.

445
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,907
Just stay there. I'll come to you.

446
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,860
You couldn't even take care of that kid.

447
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,658
He wasn't just some kid.

448
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,953
So?

449
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,373
What will you do now?

450
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,792
Kang Sun-ho will open it.

451
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,380
-What?
-He'll find the safe and open it

452
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,549
because what he's looking for is in there.

453
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,554
You'd better take care of this
properly this time.

454
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,765
If you leave anything
that has my name on it,

455
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,309
you're finished too.

456
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,022
Chief Han.

457
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,650
We have our deal too,

458
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,569
so you shouldn't be disrespectful to me.

459
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,490
But let me ask you something.

460
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,325
Who on earth is that person?

461
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,037
It's one of the professors
at the Police University.

462
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,998
Is it a man or a woman?

463
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,253
It's none of your business,

464
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,213
so just get your job done.

465
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,550
Oh, boy.

466
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,179
You seem very anxious.

467
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,848
Don't worry.

468
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,808
I'll get all the documents and flee.

469
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,019
I have a solid plan.

470
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,105
Just set up everything,
so I can stow away safely.

471
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,650
I'm going to leave this country
as soon as the job is done.

472
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,178
If you go out now,
I'm going to report you.

473
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,849
If you go out after the roll call,
you'll get 30 penalty points.

474
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,852
You know
that you'll be on probation, right?

475
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,190
You always act out on your own.

476
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,275
Don't you even feel sorry for Kang-hui?

477
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,424
Joon-wuk.

478
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,177
Let's go.

479
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:52,937
Here it is.

480
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,899
-Hey.
-It's this way.

481
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,071
How do we turn off this thing?

482
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,494
And…

483
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,581
What are you guys doing?

484
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,333
-Gosh, he startled me.
-Hey.

485
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,252
-It's nothing.
-What? What do you mean?

486
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,629
-What is this?
-It's nothing. Let's go.

487
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,214
-It's nothing.
-Come here.

488
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,341
Beom-tae, it's this way.

489
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,592
Oh, it's that way.

490
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,304
No, let's go this way.

491
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,305
It's nothing!

492
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,890
Where did he come from?

493
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,925
Make sure to tell me
if you feel any discomfort.

494
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,302
Okay, I will.

495
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,779
What's that?

496
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,615
Gosh, you startled me.

497
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,658
Darn it.

498
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,786
They're painkillers.

499
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,329
Why are you collecting them?

500
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,791
Are you going to swallow them all
and kill yourself?

501
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,545
That's right.
And I'm going to take someone with me.

502
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,880
What?

503
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,303
I'm fine.

504
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,679
-I'm fine!
-Come on.

505
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,188
It seemed like he was meeting someone.

506
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,483
Are you sure we'll find something

507
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,985
about the illegal gambling ring
if we dig into him?

508
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,738
I don't know about that either.

509
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:09,990
What?

510
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,869
I'm not after the illegal gambling ring.

511
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,704
What did you say?

512
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,626
I'm after the punk
who's blackmailing my student.

513
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,795
What?

514
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,513
Hey, how do you zoom in?

515
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,974
Press the magnifying glass.

516
00:40:56,162 --> 00:41:00,249
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

517
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:03,919
Sun-ho.

518
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,589
We figured it out.

519
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,093
We checked it all.

520
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,096
After they switched
to the new security company,

521
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,764
only three places changed their keypads.

522
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,100
And that building is the only one

523
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,602
that uses a security card.

524
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,354
There are only three places

525
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,398
that changed their keypads.

526
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,109
The library, the gym,

527
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,153
and the shooting range.

528
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,448
Right? You got a hunch, right?

529
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,493
Students are prohibited to enter,

530
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,911
and the security is intense.

531
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,622
But it's easy for the professors
to come and go.

532
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,336
I need to check the place.

533
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,589
Now? But there are so many people.

534
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,300
Sun-ho.

535
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,511
Give me the security card.

536
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,180
We'll go check the place
after the roll call.

537
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,057
What?

538
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,392
You can't leave your room
because of Min-gyu anyway.

539
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,729
There's no way we'll be caught
since we're roommates.

540
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,982
That's right. We'll just check.

541
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,319
We'll use the security card
and see if it opens.

542
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:11,987
It won't put us in trouble.

543
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,708
It's already time
for the evening roll call.

544
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,128
-Hello.
-Hey.

545
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,214
Tae-jin and Seong-su are doing

546
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,382
the night patrol this week, right?

547
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,716
-Yes.
-Yes.

548
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,301
Wait, Min-guk.

549
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,471
Can I take Seong-su's place this week?

550
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,475
You said you had an assignment to finish.

551
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,977
Oh, right.

552
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,854
I'll cover next week then.

553
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,525
Okay. Tae-jin and Min-gyu
should do the night patrol this week.

554
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,068
Okay.

555
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,448
MEN'S DORMITORY

556
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,892
We're only going to check and come back.

557
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,478
-Okay.
-All right.

558
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,237
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO RUN THIS PROGRAM?

559
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,474
-What?
-What? Is it a blackout?

560
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,477
Looks like
only the main building's power went out.

561
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,395
Gosh, the circuit breaker
must be off again.

562
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,606
-Call the facilities team.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:14,234
INDOOR SHOOTING RANGE

564
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,402
This is the one.

565
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,865
-Gosh, you startled me.
-Quiet. I got a call.

566
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,744
Hey, Sun-ho. We just got here.

567
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,038
We'll head back after we check.

568
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,082
I'll scan it now.

569
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,379
-Security deactivated.
-It worked.

570
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,388
Noh Beom-tae! Jo Joon-wuk!

571
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,059
Darn it.

572
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,395
Gosh, the light.

573
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,234
Min-gyu, you're not going to report us
to the SC, right?

574
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,028
We'll be in big trouble if you do.

575
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,280
Please don't report us.

576
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,866
We're classmates, you know.

577
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,368
Come on, Min-gyu.

578
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,000
They must have a reason.

579
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,670
If we just corner them,

580
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,797
they won't be able to answer us.

581
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,550
Shouldn't we give them more time?

582
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,928
We've given them more than enough time.

583
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,972
They left the premises
after the roll call,

584
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,807
and they snooped around the area

585
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,600
the students are forbidden to enter.

586
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,019
And a student council officer
caught them red-handed.

587
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,648
They couldn't tell why they were there.

588
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,483
They were trying
to enter the shooting range.

589
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,194
So how dare they plead the Fifth?

590
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,988
Do they think the school is a joke?

591
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,865
I actually think
they deserve to be expelled.

592
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:47,119
We need to punish them sternly
so that we can tighten the rules.

593
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,663
Let's hold a disciplinary committee
right away.

594
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,131
What do you think, Professor Kwon?

595
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,352
It looks like they're holding
a disciplinary committee right away.

596
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,189
What do we do?

597
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,620
Guys, what happened?

598
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:34,374
Min-gyu found us while patrolling
and followed us.

599
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,380
Hey. If they want to reprimand us,
we'll just deal with it.

600
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,673
I'll tell them.

601
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:47,095
I'll go in and tell them
that I put you up to it…

602
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,639
Listen to yourself.

603
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,474
Do you want to make us look like fools?

604
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,646
This is something
that we need to deal with.

605
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,649
You should go deal with your problem.

606
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,236
Here.

607
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,823
We'll see you later.

608
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,133
I'm sure they won't be expelled.

609
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,135
This is just to scare them.

610
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,556
They went into a shooting range
where real guns are.

611
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,683
This would be a huge deal
even in the military.

612
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,642
Then what will happen?

613
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,270
-Are you sure they went in there?
-What?

614
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,982
Did they really touch firearms?

615
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,026
Well…

616
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,613
According to freshman Park Min-gyu,
the first witness,

617
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,324
the two students were seen
standing by the entrance,

618
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,743
not inside the shooting range.

619
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,372
The student council questioned them,

620
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,499
but both of them refused to tell us
why they were seen

621
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,877
in front of the shooting range
at that hour.

622
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,885
Okay.

623
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,888
You may leave now.

624
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:21,857
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

625
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,276
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

626
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:51,970
Kang-hui.

627
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,687
Right, I'm sure
it was just a mistake back then.

628
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,731
But if you go any further now,

629
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,983
it won't be a mistake anymore.

630
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,654
You'll have to take responsibility
for everything.

631
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,328
This is something
that we need to deal with.

632
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,373
You should go deal with your problem.

633
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,887
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

634
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,525
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

635
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,819
Damn it, this brat…

636
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,076
OH KANG-HUI

637
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,579
What is it?

638
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,991
This morning, the committee issued
a summons to this disciplinary hearing.

639
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:39,119
Noh Beom-tae and Jo Joon-wuk
of the 41st batch

640
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,079
are here to attend the hearing.

641
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,831
Confirm that
the aforementioned statements are true.

642
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:47,711
Yes, sir.
I am Noh Beom-tae from the 41st batch.

643
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,882
Yes, sir.
I am Jo Joon-wuk from the 41st batch.

644
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,927
This disciplinary hearing is being held

645
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,929
because the two of you

646
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,474
violated Article 47 Clause 1
of the Code of Conduct.

647
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,476
You may submit
written or verbal statements

648
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,479
along with any evidence you might have
to explain yourselves.

649
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,898
And you may ask the committee
to review its decision

650
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,108
within ten days once the decision is made.

651
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,652
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

652
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,448
At 00:11 a.m. on September 7th,

653
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:20,410
Noh Beom-tae and Jo Joon-wuk
of the 41st batch

654
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,122
left the dormitory without permission
after the evening roll call

655
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,125
and entered the shooting range,
a restricted area…

656
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,468
Mr. Yu…

657
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,096
Mr. Yu Dong-man?

658
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,147
There was a power outage
in the main building at that time,

659
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,690
so nothing was recorded.

660
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,567
What? A power outage?

661
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,821
That's right.
The facilities team came and checked.

662
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,199
-What?
-What's going on?

663
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,372
Are you going to plead the Fifth?

664
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,474
INDOOR SHOOTING RANGE

665
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,315
Security deactivated.

666
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,071
SHOOTING RANGE

667
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,034
Security deactivated.

668
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,189
What?

669
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,191
There's a time limit?

670
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,135
Thirty seconds.

671
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,798
Get up, Kang Sun-ho.

672
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,140
Get up if you don't want me
to blow up your head.

673
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,938
Get up slowly.

674
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,649
Good.

675
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,864
I knew it.

676
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,117
I knew you'd make this choice.

677
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:39,664
You and I are the same.
We both break rules.

678
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,250
But you're a student of KNPU,

679
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,420
and I'm just a fugitive.

680
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,677
I think you and I are no different.

681
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,305
Don't you think?

682
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,479
You punk.

683
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,818
He's different from you.

684
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,788
So save your nonsense for prison,
you jerk.

685
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,844
Kang-hui.

686
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,975
I told Min-gyu to keep an eye
on you guys and Sun-ho.

687
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,563
-What?
-What are you talking about?

688
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,024
Why did you do that?

689
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,485
Because I didn't know
you'd take it this far.

690
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,278
I thought you'd give up.

691
00:58:56,074 --> 00:59:00,078
I thought that was the only way
I could protect Sun-ho.

692
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,381
Listen to me carefully.

693
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,133
Since things turned out this way,

694
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,344
hold the professors up
in the disciplinary committee.

695
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,181
Plead the Fifth
until the end and stall for time.

696
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,767
We're going to stop

697
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,019
the real owner of the safe from showing up

698
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,772
while Sun-ho tries to open the safe.

699
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,574
It'll be dangerous.

700
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,410
For both you and me.

701
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,747
We might get expelled if things go wrong.

702
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,755
Do you think you can still do it?

703
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,473
That's the only way we can protect Sun-ho.

704
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,395
He's right. We'll do it no matter what.

705
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,372
Professor Yu, it's me, Kang-hui.

706
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,708
Beom-tae and Joon-wuk's
disciplinary committee will be held.

707
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,127
And it looks like
Sun-ho will see this to the end.

708
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,381
I need to be by his side, Professor.

709
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,011
Until I get there,

710
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,390
don't get hurt, no matter what.

711
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,673
Kang-hui.

712
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,009
Hurry up and take that.
We don't have much time.

713
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,846
Okay.

714
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,281
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT
CHIEF HAN JEONG-SIK

715
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,627
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

716
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,695
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

717
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,241
Did you see the photos?

718
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,536
You punk. What are you playing at?

719
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,704
What do you think?

720
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,082
I'm trying to arrest you all.

721
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,253
-Sun-ho, hurry up!
-Okay.

722
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,317
ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION DAY
AUGUST 27TH, 2016

723
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,695
The money that people use
to bet on this site

724
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,114
is all saved as cryptocurrency.

725
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:06,783
It's the same website.

726
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,425
ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION DAY
AUGUST 27TH, 2016

727
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:34,310
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

728
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,983
Yu Dong-man, you punk!

729
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,694
Shut your mouth and listen to me.

730
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,449
If you mess with my students again,

731
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,204
I'm going to chase you
to the ends of the earth to catch you.

732
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:02,421
I was the one who told them to do it.

733
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:07,009
So that I could catch the criminal
hiding in our school.

734
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,557
So…

735
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,184
talk with me from now on

736
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,812
instead of them.

737
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,712
There's someone who gets paid
more than Han Jeong-sik.

738
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:28,591
We used that money to defend
your pathetic sense of justice!

739
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,761
I told you. I'll chase you
to the ends of the earth.

740
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,970
Let's go, Professor.

741
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,931
Kang Sun-ho will get expelled.

742
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,223
Do you even think of me
when you make decisions?

743
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,100
The woman you talked with…

744
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,478
He had double eyelids, and he was tall.

745
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,146
It was all you, Choi Hee-su.

746
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,315
Come to the school.
I'll wait for you here.

747
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,984
I told you that I'd take care of it.

748
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,945
-You're under arrest.
-Take Dong-man.

749
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,530
-Captain!
-Professor Yu.

750
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,449
What are you doing?
