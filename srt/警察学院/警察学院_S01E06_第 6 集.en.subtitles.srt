00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,561
DORMITORY

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,396
You're so heavy.

8
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,821
Kang-hui…

9
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,947
Be quiet.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,200
This is driving me crazy.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,419
STUDENT ID
OH KANG-HUI

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,218
KANG-HUI

13
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,847
Hey, do you think it's really okay
to ignore her call?

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,390
You punk!

15
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,019
If you're a loyal friend,
you shouldn't pick up.

16
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,729
I know this best.

17
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,731
Wait, what time is it now?

18
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,859
-It's 1 a.m.
-What?

19
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,278
-If they get caught outside…
-They'll face disciplinary action!

20
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,738
-No!
-Gosh!

21
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,289
I can't breathe!

22
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,791
Please keep quiet.

23
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,085
Come on, Kang-hui.

24
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,630
-Will you be quiet?
-Oh Kang-hui!

25
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,465
Oh Kang-hui!

26
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,843
Oh Kang-hui!

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,595
Oh Kang-hui!

28
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,431
-They will be expelled instantly.
-Oh Kang-hui!

29
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,100
-They will be expelled instantly!
-Oh…

30
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,311
-You will be expelled!
-Oh…

31
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,359
Oh Kang-hui, you'll be expelled!

32
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:45,308
Darn it. Hey. Kang Sun-ho. Please wake up.

33
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,311
Will you please wake up? gosh.

34
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,067
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

35
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,411
Who's on duty tonight?

36
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,122
Where did they go? Goodness.

37
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,540
This is so upsetting.

38
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,128
Officer Nam!

39
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,008
Salute. Officer Nam Hyeon-tae reporting.

40
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,553
How many duty officers
are on night duty tonight?

41
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,723
Must you count?

42
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,393
How many are there? Hurry up!

43
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,728
-There are five.
-Call all of them right now.

44
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,606
I think a rat is hiding in this place.

45
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,360
What's all this fuss about
in the middle of the night?

46
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,153
You know, last year,

47
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,407
a junior brought in her boyfriend secretly

48
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,576
and got expelled because she was caught
by Guidance Director.

49
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,039
What about Kang-hui?
Why isn't she coming out?

50
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,375
Well.

51
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,460
She's in the bathroom.

52
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,366
Beom-tae, you should

53
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,327
go first.

54
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,914
You're saying you'll go first, right?

55
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,753
That's right. I'll cover your back.

56
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,590
If you go first, I'll cover your back.

57
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,094
-Good plan.
-Good plan.

58
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,648
You should go first!

59
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,442
Be quiet! You said you'll go first.

60
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,611
-You should've gone first.
-You said you'll go.

61
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,875
-We're doomed.
-We're doomed.

62
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,920
Those rats.

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,345
Whatever jumps out from that room,

64
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,139
don't lose any one of them. Got it?

65
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,100
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,769
Excuse me, Ms. Baek!

67
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,648
-What is it?
-I have something to tell you.

68
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,233
Okay. Let's talk later.

69
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,317
Open it.

70
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,447
I think it's a violation of human rights
to do a roll call at this hour!

71
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,701
If you don't want your rights
to be violated, go back to your room.

72
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,204
What are you waiting for? Open it.

73
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,166
You need to treat the students
with the right to decide

74
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,876
-as individual beings…
-Hey!

75
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,630
Kang-hui, I did all I could!

76
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,340
-I can't believe it.
-Open it now.

77
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,257
Park Min-gyu?

78
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,093
What are you doing here?

79
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:04,942
Professor Choi.

80
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,324
Ms. Baek.

81
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,452
What are you doing here right now?

82
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,414
Listen.

83
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,917
Can't I get a room in the dormitory too?

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,213
I want to share the energy of the youth.

85
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,508
I want to feel their vibes.

86
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,718
If you're drunk, you should've gone home.

87
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,180
Why do you always…

88
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,766
Why do you do this all the time?

89
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,809
That's right. I have my own home.

90
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,770
But there's no man.

91
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,897
I want to live in the dorms too!

92
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,857
But there's no extra room here.

93
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,109
How come it's always out of things?

94
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,987
Why is it always out of things?

95
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,573
There's nothing for me.

96
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,700
You're out of your mind right now.

97
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,744
Let go of me.

98
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,580
Move.

99
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,458
There's nothing for me.

100
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,088
Ms. Baek isn't the rude type.

101
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,090
She's just very responsible, that's all.

102
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,550
Get back to your work.

103
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,803
I'll pay you back with fried chicken
for the extra work you did tonight.

104
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,350
STORAGE

105
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,125
STUDENT ID, OH KANG-HUI

106
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,008
Are you okay, Sun-ho?

107
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,303
Be careful.

108
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,681
Gosh, that punk.

109
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,517
What on earth is going on?

110
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,187
We ran into Min-gyu
when we were getting out of the dorms.

111
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:10,109
If he didn't step in to help,
we'd have been in big trouble. Right?

112
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,403
Yes. Hey, Min-gyu.

113
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,239
I didn't know you were this nice.

114
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,284
Do you find this funny?

115
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:20,870
No.

116
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,084
What happened to your shirt, Kang-hui?

117
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,757
-What are you looking at?
-No, I'm not looking.

118
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,429
You should get back.

119
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,140
The lights are still on.

120
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,975
The Women's Dormitory
will be doing the roll call again.

121
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,810
Okay.

122
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,520
Thanks.

123
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,566
Then should we get going now?

124
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,069
Right, it's too late.

125
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,863
-Hey, Sun-ho.
-Sun-ho.

126
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,698
Hey, Beom-tae, Joon-wuk.

127
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,633
My head…

128
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,058
Where is it?

129
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,148
-You haven't found it yet?
-No.

130
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,402
Why don't you just get a new one?

131
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,529
It'd be uncomfortable
without the student ID.

132
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,451
That's when he showed up,

133
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,911
and we could get away with it.

134
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,496
So Min-gyu helped us?

135
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,289
Well…

136
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,208
It just turned out like that.

137
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,877
Sun-ho.

138
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,005
You really don't remember
what happened yesterday? Not at all?

139
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,012
I must have made mistakes
to Kang-hui, right?

140
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,598
"Mistakes"?

141
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,809
You call that a mistake?

142
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,977
You filthy…

143
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,813
Sun-ho, it's okay.

144
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,190
It happened when you were drunk.

145
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,861
Let's just hope
that she takes it into account.

146
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,903
Let's eat first.

147
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,991
What Min-gyu said yesterday
was so cool, right?

148
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,203
-What's so cool about it?
-Why? What did he say?

149
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
"Hey, Beom-tae, Joon-wuk."

150
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,629
Kang-hui wasn't here today.

151
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,383
If the rumor spreads,
and she gets in trouble,

152
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,011
I won't stand it then.

153
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,181
-Min-gyu said that?
-Yes.

154
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,308
He did.

155
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,810
I thought he would report it
to the student council

156
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,812
and make a big fuss out of it.

157
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,524
I didn't know, but Min-gyu is a real man.

158
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,861
Even I almost fell for…
Gosh, it's bulgogi.

159
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,405
-Bulgogi.
-Sun-ho, it's bulgogi.

160
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,490
Whatever.

161
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,408
Help yourselves!

162
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,460
Kang-hui!

163
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,714
It's over.

164
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,216
Is it over?

165
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,135
This bulgogi sauce is amazing.

166
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,179
-Right.
-Look at its color.

167
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,348
-Eat, Beom-tae.
-Okay.

168
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,141
Hey, Sun-ho!

169
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,561
Gosh, how did I run into him
just like that?

170
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,064
Kang-hui!

171
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,196
Kang-hui.

172
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,913
Yes? What's up?

173
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,830
Well…

174
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,259
Oh…

175
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,518
Well…

176
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,354
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.

177
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,567
You're sorry?

178
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,653
Well, I mean…

179
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,200
Well, I don't remember anything

180
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,035
from last night.

181
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,038
I think I blacked out.

182
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,879
I see. So you don't remember anything?

183
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,719
If you don't remember what happened,
does it mean it never happened?

184
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,430
-What?
-Because of jerks like you,

185
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,558
there are punks
who ask for a reduced sentence

186
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,852
claiming that they were unfit and drunk.

187
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,814
-Kang-hui.
-So you remember my name?

188
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,692
What? Why don't you forget that too?

189
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,171
Hey.

190
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,257
Has it ever crossed your mind

191
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,801
that your thoughtless behavior
could put Kang-hui in trouble?

192
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,518
By the way, what did you do to Kang-hui?

193
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,278
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

194
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,613
Come this way.

195
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,743
Goodness. I guess something
has happened to that detective.

196
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,453
Why?

197
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,790
You must not be sober from last night,

198
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,292
but you're checking the CCTV footage
first thing in the morning.

199
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:05,089
That day, he was drunk

200
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,549
-and lost his wallet.
-Goodness…

201
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,679
It's troublesome for detectives
when they lose ID cards.

202
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,722
Gosh, what do we do?

203
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,058
Just wait. I'll look into it.

204
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,748
I taught the kids how to use
their knives in real-life situations.

205
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,083
"In real-life situations"?

206
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,712
I was convicted twice.

207
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,523
Size 285mm?

208
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,697
He was here…

209
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,117
Gosh, what a sight.

210
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,537
Why are you checking out my smelly shoes?

211
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,166
Was Cheol-jin here alone that day?

212
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,211
Watching the footage helped me remember.

213
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,213
He was here alone.

214
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,468
He barely touched his food
and had about two bottles of soju.

215
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:37,222
I think he left after that.
Here, take a look at this.

216
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,932
Okay, let me see.

217
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,127
It was raining,
and there were no customers.

218
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,130
He got in the taxi
but didn't say where to go.

219
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,968
He said just go, but where is there
to go in that area?

220
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,889
So I just headed to the fishery.

221
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,724
But then, he must have been nauseous.

222
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,559
He suddenly made a scene
and told me to stop the car.

223
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,814
Sir, please stop the car.

224
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,951
On my way to the fishing grounds,

225
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,662
I saw someone throwing up
on the side of the road.

226
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,288
He wobbled a bit. I guess he was drunk.

227
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,417
Hey, Mr. Sung! Aren't you having lunch?

228
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,754
-I can go, right?
-There's one last thing.

229
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,758
At that hour, why did you go
to the Police University?

230
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,717
DO NOT ENTER

231
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,303
I went there because Mr. Go called me.

232
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,431
Are you close with Mr. Go?

233
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,184
We always go to his place.

234
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:11,024
But he can't remember that?

235
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,195
Professor Go.

236
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,031
Something's fishy.

237
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,429
Do you like fishing?

238
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,222
I didn't at first.

239
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,474
But I liked how it felt

240
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,519
when I hooked a fish
as soon as it bites the bait.

241
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,022
I got to like it as I came here
from time to time.

242
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,692
I should've caught culprits like that.

243
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:59,031
It's all noisy and confusing
both at the school and the field.

244
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,325
But it seems quiet when I come here.

245
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,206
Can I try casting that?

246
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,876
It's expensive.

247
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,883
You have no friends, right?

248
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,051
What?

249
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,227
-Hey, did you check it?
-I did.

250
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:33,023
The calls from the burner phone
to Inspector Park were too short,

251
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,150
and they went through too many stations.

252
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
So it's hard to specify.

253
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,323
Detective Joo, can you check on someone?

254
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,035
So what you saw

255
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,913
is that Kang-hui's shirt
was missing a button?

256
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,916
And her face was beet red.

257
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,418
No, that is not reasonable suspicion.

258
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,712
You both had drinks, and it was cold.

259
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,341
Gosh, what on earth happened that night?

260
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,676
Listen up.

261
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,095
Here's what I think.

262
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,516
Hey, Oh Kang-hui. What did I do so wrong?

263
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,935
Is it a crime to drink? Is it?

264
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,273
Hey! How dare you rip a woman's shirt?

265
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,945
Hey. I know I was drunk,
but why would I grab her by the collar?

266
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,029
He's right.

267
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,824
Every investigation
begins with a hypothesis,

268
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,992
but that's just wrong.

269
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,201
You think so?

270
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,244
What do you think?

271
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,662
Well…

272
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,179
Hey!

273
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,308
-Calm down.
-What are you imagining?

274
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,434
-Sun-ho.
-Got a death wish?

275
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,060
Calm down, Sun-ho.

276
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,770
-He's got a dirty mind.
-I mean,

277
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,148
we should consider all possible scenarios.

278
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,484
And what else can happen between
a man and a woman in a storage room?

279
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,614
Come here.

280
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,701
-Hey, don't!
-My gosh!

281
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,119
That little…

282
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,956
Where did this jerk go?

283
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,423
If you don't remember what happened,
does it mean it never happened?

284
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,011
What did you do, you crazy idiot?

285
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,096
Hey!

286
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,058
Why are you swearing in the hallway?

287
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,934
What? What's this weapon for?

288
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,563
-Why did you have to hit me in the head?
-Why are you yelling at me?

289
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,274
Do you know how many times I called you?

290
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,650
Get your act together.

291
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,736
Put that back and come with me.

292
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,578
Why did you call me?

293
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,206
Hey, are you not going
to investigate the case?

294
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,333
That.

295
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,043
What?

296
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,253
"That"?

297
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,631
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,639
What is it? Why are you upset?

299
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,394
Professor, is there a special technique

300
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,064
for investigating a suspect
who had a blackout?

301
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,817
-What?
-You know,

302
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,402
when you need to interrogate
a drunk suspect.

303
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,695
Or it could be a witness.

304
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,240
You need to interview the witnesses first.

305
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,660
Then based on witness statements
you've collected,

306
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,287
you can put the puzzle together
and find evidence.

307
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,914
No, I'm not talking about that.

308
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:36,873
No?

309
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,210
Then what?
You mean, investigative hypnosis?

310
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,878
Stuff like that?

311
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,464
I don't know, you punk!

312
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,799
Is that even important now?

313
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,384
You wanted me to tell you.

314
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,386
Why did you call me?

315
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,846
Right.

316
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,225
We have the base station
for the burner phone,

317
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,060
but the location keeps changing.

318
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,311
BASE STATION OUTGOING CALLS

319
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,274
I've actually been doing some thinking
while going over Mr. Park's call log.

320
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,278
Why don't we try to analyze
this burner phone's call patterns?

321
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,321
What do you mean?

322
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,448
There's a program that analyzes
call patterns and frequency.

323
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,534
If we look into the base station
using that,

324
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,745
we should be able to track down
the person using the burner phone.

325
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,998
Do you think this is like some spy movie?

326
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,045
The software is used by the FBI,
but I can code the program.

327
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,298
Although it'll take some time.

328
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,092
About two weeks, I think.

329
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,721
-Should I do it or not?
-Hey!

330
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:36,266
If there's something like that,
we should try it right away!

331
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,768
Now, this is the Yoon I know.

332
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,188
Great. You focus on what you're good at.

333
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,023
I'll do the same.

334
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,692
This is what a truly ideal
joint investigation should be like.

335
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,862
-My goodness.
-Right, sure.

336
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,489
All right, then. Get some rest.

337
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,033
Okay, you too.

338
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,205
By the way, you only had
a couple of drinks last night.

339
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,247
Did you black out?

340
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,960
Investigating a blackout, my foot.

341
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,670
No, it's not that.

342
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,548
Then retrace your steps
to where you blacked out.

343
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,218
Evidence and clues

344
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,844
are always left at the scene.

345
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,180
It really is not that.

346
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,120
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

347
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,419
What? Why won't this open?

348
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,007
It has to be somewhere around here.

349
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,270
Hey! You, suspect!

350
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,484
Are you

351
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,362
looking for this piece of evidence?

352
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,364
What…

353
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,751
Are you guys dating?

354
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,836
No.

355
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,216
Sun-ho, did you think you were dating?
Why are you quiet?

356
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,260
Hey…

357
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,305
Right.

358
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,598
Such words aren't important.

359
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,517
If you like each other,
that's all that matters.

360
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,273
But why do I suddenly feel like
I need a drink in broad daylight?

361
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,527
I'm off.

362
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,362
Professor.

363
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,992
Can you please not tell anyone about this?

364
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,661
Hey, I'm not dumb.

365
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,788
I'm taking off
to give you two some privacy.

366
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,473
Kang-hui.

367
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,976
I…

368
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,813
I don't want it
to be something that didn't happen.

369
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,858
What are you talking about?

370
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,903
Everything that happened to us
in the storage room that night

371
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,946
did happen.

372
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,991
I didn't imagine it or see it in my dream.

373
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,911
It all actually happened,

374
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,455
so I'll take responsibility for it.

375
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,919
-For what?
-Everything.

376
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,554
You don't remember, do you?

377
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,223
What?

378
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,142
How dare you try to trick me?

379
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,396
I can't believe this. Kang Sun-ho.

380
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,523
-You don't remember, do you?
-Kang-hui…

381
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,024
Why are you acting like you do?

382
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,652
Kang-hui, let's talk it out.

383
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,737
"Talk it out"? How? Get back here.

384
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,657
-Gosh, that punk…
-Kang-hui, please.

385
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,575
Instead of investigating the case…

386
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,535
I'll take responsibility.

387
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,038
He's busy with his love life.
So much love in the air.

388
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,333
Goodness.

389
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:36,047
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

390
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,883
I sent you some info on Professor Go.

391
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,473
Let's see what your deal is.

392
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,199
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

393
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,034
CHUNGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL TEAM LIST

394
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,078
TEAM BLUE, TEAM WHITE

395
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,621
The team list is out!

396
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,042
Sun-ho! We're on the same team.

397
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,044
-What's going on?
-Look at this.

398
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,212
-What is it?
-Hey, look!

399
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,922
-Gosh.
-It's Eon-ju!

400
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:18,882
I knew it.

401
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,634
Eon-ju and I are meant to be.

402
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,096
Hey, it's just a coincidence.

403
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,306
No.

404
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,390
This is fate.

405
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,641
KANG SUN-HO

406
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,185
OH KANG-HUI

407
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,355
-Hey! Are you guys really my friends?
-Come on!

408
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,233
Don't get so worked up already, buddy.

409
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,653
The team that wins

410
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,698
will be granted special weekend leave!

411
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,450
Really? Not just for a day
but the whole weekend?

412
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,744
Hey, Sun-ho.

413
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,704
Let's make sure to win.

414
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,622
Let's do that.

415
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,460
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

416
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,504
-We can do this.
-Let's go.

417
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,130
Come on!

418
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,757
THE 41ST CHUNGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL

419
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,010
Gosh, all the airheads are on my team.

420
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,097
Tell me about it.

421
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,475
I heard Professor Kwon
is a black belt holder.

422
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,312
Hey, do you want to see how good I am?

423
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,857
Sure. Please make sure to win.

424
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,821
Before that, we need to wrap up something.

425
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,738
Sorry?

426
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,162
Professor Go was a convicted criminal?

427
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,166
He was convicted twice for running
an illegal gambling house ten years ago.

428
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,963
On top of that, he's the last person
Cheol-jin was with that night.

429
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,423
And his shoe size is 285mm.

430
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,511
Then could he be…

431
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,431
I only have
circumstantial evidence for now.

432
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,309
But we must check.

433
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:54,978
How?

434
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,657
Fishing.

435
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,037
Gosh, you guys must be really close.

436
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,167
I'm sorry about last time.

437
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,754
No, it's okay.
I know that it was a mistake.

438
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,675
Right. Did you find the wallet?

439
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,554
Now that I got the license plate number,

440
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,722
I'm sure I'll find it.

441
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,224
That's good news.

442
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,560
Anyway, tell me if you need anything.

443
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,020
-Sure.
-Okay.

444
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:52,285
So are you done making the program?

445
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,870
Professor Yu will throw bait.

446
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,747
Yes, it's nearly done.

447
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,083
I think we'll be able to find
the movements of the burner phone.

448
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,961
The laptop is in your room, right?

449
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,923
If he's the culprit,
he won't be able to refuse this bait.

450
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,092
-Yes.
-Take good care of it.

451
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,303
Once they find out where he went,

452
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,221
they'll be able to find the culprit
right away.

453
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,522
The first appeal of the two men
who were convicted

454
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,232
of running an illegal gambling site

455
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,611
using tens of billion won
will be held on the fifth of next month.

456
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,948
During the first trial
that was held last month,

457
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,824
the judge sentenced the two criminals

458
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,160
to ten months and two years
in prison respectively

459
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,664
for running an illegal gambling site.

460
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,957
A gambling fraud?

461
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,918
Hey, isn't that your mom's trial?

462
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,419
They insist

463
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,338
-that they only lent the money.
-Right. It's my mom's.

464
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:49,550
They're maintaining
consistent arguments to file an appeal.

465
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,594
The prosecution said they will be looking

466
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,346
for more witnesses who can testify…

467
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,723
Isn't this Kang-hui's mom?

468
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,934
She must be so embarrassed.

469
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:58,851
So?

470
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,812
What do you mean, "so"?

471
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,272
The gossip must be
keeping them entertained.

472
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,233
They're enjoying the gossip
in every possible way.

473
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,945
Since it's her mother's trial,
Kang-hui must want to go.

474
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:14,200
If we win at Chungram Sports Festival,
we'll get special leave, right?

475
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,326
-Yes.
-Yes.

476
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,996
Why would you come, Grandma?
It's too much work.

477
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,333
Just listen to me, will you?
I said I'll go.

478
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,839
Grandma, I'm not mad.

479
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,800
Why would I be mad at you?

480
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,055
Grandma, I need to go back to class.

481
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,807
I'll call you again.

482
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,647
Why do you always

483
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,942
have my back against the wall, Mom?

484
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,626
What did you just say you looked into?

485
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,545
Well…

486
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,631
The judge for your mother's trial.

487
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,759
He's dealt with such cases often,

488
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,677
so I heard he doesn't give
harsh sentences.

489
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,140
So don't worry.

490
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,184
Okay?

491
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,397
Were you always interested
in other people's business?

492
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,441
You know that's not true.

493
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,443
I do, so why are you doing this?

494
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,529
-Kang-hui.
-Just talk behind my back

495
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,489
like other kids do.

496
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,116
Otherwise, just mind your business.

497
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,935
Kang…

498
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,384
On the day of Chungram Sports Festival,

499
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,803
the building will be completely empty.

500
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:42,515
If he's the culprit, he will show up
on the day of Chungram Sports Festival.

501
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,310
Did you put the proximity sensors
on the laptop?

502
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,604
Here.

503
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,401
-You punk.
-Pardon?

504
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,778
Come on. Will you get to your senses?

505
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,737
Right.

506
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,408
-What is this?
-It's a smartwatch.

507
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,785
Connect it to your phone
and keep checking it.

508
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,746
Okay, Professor Yu.
I'll do anything for you.

509
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,083
I'll do anything to help you.

510
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,502
So let's participate
in Chungram Sports Festival first.

511
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,505
-What did you say, you punk?
-I must win the prize.

512
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,465
I really need to.

513
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,676
Since you're on our team,

514
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,720
why don't we prepare
for the sports festival first?

515
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,931
Gosh, you weren't listening to me.

516
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,727
I need to win.

517
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,312
No,

518
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,022
I must win.

519
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,484
Listen to me carefully.

520
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,572
On the day of Chungram Sports Festival,
the building will be completely empty.

521
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,412
I'm going to win that special leave.

522
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,541
I'm going to win this
to give my special leave to Kang-hui.

523
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,962
-Pass it to me!
-Go!

524
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,216
It's only a practice.
Aren't we training too hard?

525
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,718
-Aren't we?
-We must win no matter what.

526
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,845
Let's go! Hurry up.

527
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,722
Wait up!

528
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,653
Gosh, this punk.

529
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,533
-Hey!
-Gosh, you scared me.

530
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,370
You need to control your breathing.

531
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,038
Breathe in deep.

532
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,207
MOM'S TRIAL

533
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,856
Thank you.

534
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,473
Gosh, why did they get me this shirt?

535
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,188
What is he up to every night?

536
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,946
Hey.

537
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,408
When I was your age,
I ran 100m in 10 seconds.

538
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,995
No, you didn't.

539
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,291
I did, you punk!

540
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:59,086
You'd have become a track
and field athlete instead.

541
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,298
Why do you always want
to have the last word?

542
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,675
Why would you want
to beat me all the time?

543
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,016
Let's go.

544
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,102
Hey.

545
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,481
Sun-ho.

546
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,027
I only touched your mouse,
and this showed up.

547
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,615
How did you know?

548
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,951
Did you catch him? Who is it?
Who is that punk?

549
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,578
Professor Yu?

550
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,913
Jeez.

551
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,794
You punk! Why did you touch his laptop?

552
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,546
At this rate, you'll become a thief.

553
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,006
Gosh, that startled me.

554
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,508
"A thief"?

555
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,259
Leave him be. He's just cranky.

556
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,345
What's that?

557
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,180
Apparently, this is our uniform.

558
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,437
"Oh Kang-hui." Team White.
Put a checkmark and take your uniform.

559
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,066
Kang Sun-ho, right?
Put a checkmark and take your uniform.

560
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,151
Okay.

561
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,945
Team White.

562
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,283
-I'm on Team White too.
-I see.

563
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,750
Why aren't you asking?

564
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,422
About my mom's trial.

565
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,465
You must know about it too.

566
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,718
I was waiting
until you wanted to talk about it.

567
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,971
Like now.

568
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,307
It's nothing nice.

569
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,021
Why are you so serious
about the sports festival?

570
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,151
I have to win the special leave,
that's why.

571
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,112
Why? Do you have to go somewhere?

572
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,738
Yes.

573
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,033
Where? Do you have to go
see your mom or something?

574
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,870
I don't have a mom.

575
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,417
I'm sorry.

576
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,671
But I do want to go see my dad.

577
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,717
After I see you at your mom's trial.

578
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,682
That's why I have to win
the special leave.

579
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,310
For you as well.
I should take responsibility.

580
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,022
Responsibility for what?
Why do you keep saying that?

581
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,321
He remembers.

582
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,907
Of course.

583
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,783
I should take responsibility.

584
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,827
I have to.

585
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,206
He knows what happened that night.

586
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,457
So, Kang-hui.

587
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,168
Let's go together, okay?

588
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,299
I should take responsibility.

589
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,678
You crazy punk.

590
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,390
I am a crazy punk.

591
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,976
Still, let's go together, Kang-hui. Okay?

592
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,103
Kang-hui!

593
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,900
Let's go together, okay?
I'll make sure we can go.

594
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,238
-Look at this.
-Come on in.

595
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,073
This is amazing!

596
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,407
Come check this out!

597
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,994
-The uniform looks great on you.
-Come on in.

598
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,579
Here you go.

599
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,166
Those people aren't from our school.

600
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,960
You didn't know?

601
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,045
The cafeteria is closed on the day
of Chungram Sports Festival.

602
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,548
Instead, we order food
from restaurants in the area.

603
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,342
The restaurant owners are already here
to drop off the food,

604
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,718
so they can watch the games.

605
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,265
Nice! Professor Go is here.

606
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,725
-Chicken! I want chicken!
-Hello, Professor Choi.

607
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,895
-Chicken and beer go hand in hand.
-My gosh.

608
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,148
-Good luck today.
-Thank you.

609
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,528
It's so refreshing.

610
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,871
The last character
of "Chungram Sports Festival" means "war."

611
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,463
In other words,

612
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,925
it's like a fierce war
made to look like a sports festival.

613
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,065
To win this war,

614
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,110
we must get the upper hand
in the first fight,

615
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,361
at all costs.

616
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,114
-Go, team!
-We got this!

617
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,283
Hey, bring it on!

618
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,244
Come here. Bring it on.

619
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,621
Are you going to fight with your mouth?

620
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,123
-Kwon Hyuk-phil!
-Kwon Hyuk-phil!

621
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,499
-Go, team!
-Invincible Team White!

622
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,792
-Go!
-Hey!

623
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,960
-Come here!
-Hey!

624
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,010
He's biting me!

625
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:04,016
My gosh, Professor Yu is really something.

626
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,810
My goodness. Can I go in instead?

627
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,021
I can easily beat them all.

628
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,025
I'll pull some strings,
so you can join us next semester.

629
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,321
Professor Kwon is doing his best too.

630
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,282
They're the same age, right?

631
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,200
Yes.

632
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,245
They seem to be good friends.
It's good to see them getting along.

633
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,099
-Go, Team White!
-Go, Team White!

634
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,892
-We're invincible!
-We're invincible!

635
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,603
-Go, Team White!
-Go, Team White!

636
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,982
This is getting more interesting!

637
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,528
-Well done!
-My, look at that.

638
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,114
-Thank you.
-This looks great.

639
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,281
Nice, pizza.

640
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,950
That looks delicious.

641
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,410
-Hey.
-My gosh.

642
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,703
This is like a buffet. I love this.

643
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,372
It is nice,

644
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,208
but why do I feel
like I'm watching Hometown Report?

645
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,043
I know.

646
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,212
There's too much going on. It's not good.

647
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,089
Drink up.

648
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,091
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

649
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,428
-Have a beer.
-Thank you.

650
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,054
Drink up. It'll cool you down.

651
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,765
My gosh. You came
to deliver this yourself.

652
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,184
-Doesn't it look amazing?
-Thank you.

653
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,780
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

654
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,455
-Go!
-Good luck!

655
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,748
Go for it!

656
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,126
Get them!

657
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,419
Darn it!

658
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,546
I told you to target the head!

659
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,090
I got it. Hey!

660
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,302
Make them pass out!

661
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,763
My gosh, he's saying
all the things I want to say.

662
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,600
They should target the head indeed.

663
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,310
-Hey!
-Goodness.

664
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,270
Easy, guys! You'll get hurt.

665
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,065
-Go!
-We got this!

666
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,066
-We got this!
-Go, team!

667
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,167
-Let's score another!
-We can do this!

668
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,170
-We got this.
-Let's go.

669
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,556
No!

670
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,367
-I'm…
-Oh, no.

671
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,868
-A double nosebleed…
-My gosh.

672
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,787
-It's a double nosebleed.
-Gosh.

673
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,789
-Are you okay?
-My goodness.

674
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,417
-Beom-tae, my gosh.
-Beom-tae.

675
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,794
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

676
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,170
Are you all right?

677
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,800
We're getting a new professor?
No one told me about it.

678
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,343
That's…

679
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,685
Sorry.

680
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,146
They had to pause the game because of me.
It ruined the momentum.

681
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,774
No, it's okay. We were losing anyway.

682
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:41,900
Let's just accept it.

683
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,152
But the score is still one to one.

684
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,573
Yes, we can beat them in the relay race.

685
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,658
Yes, that's right!

686
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,494
Sun-ho has been
training so hard for this day.

687
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,122
You went for a run even on the days
we didn't have running drills.

688
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,836
If we win the special leave,
go out for dinner with me.

689
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,254
That jerk!

690
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,923
He's chatting with her again! That little…

691
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,307
About the special leave.

692
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,102
You know how we can use it
on Saturday, right?

693
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,356
Meet me at the front gate at 11 a.m.

694
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,338
How are you feeling? Good?

695
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,964
Yes.

696
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,425
You need to do well. You can do it!

697
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,552
-Good luck!
-Thank you.

698
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,892
-You can do it.
-Good luck, Sun-ho!

699
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,102
Let's go, Team Blue!

700
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,399
Let's go!

701
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,485
-Professor Yu!
-Good luck!

702
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,865
You must win the race. You must.

703
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,325
Gosh, you punk.

704
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,494
Okay, I heard you. I will.

705
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,495
Good luck.

706
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,757
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

707
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,967
-Let's go, Team Blue!
-Run!

708
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,972
You can do it. Good luck!

709
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,391
You can do it!

710
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,233
KANG SUN-HO

711
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,967
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

712
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,055
-Run!
-Go get it!

713
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,726
-Run!
-You got this!

714
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,272
You're almost there. Pass it to me!

715
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,482
Let's go!

716
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,193
-Go!
-All right!

717
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,029
He's winning!

718
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,073
No!

719
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,325
Team White!

720
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:44,374
If I win this race,
I'll give the prize to Kang-hui.

721
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,586
And I'm going to ask her out.

722
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,629
I'll tell her I like her.

723
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,716
I won't let you win.

724
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,437
Hurry up!

725
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,566
-Hurry up!
-Kwon Hyuk-phil, let's go!

726
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,234
Good luck!

727
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,452
You know how we can use it
on Saturday, right?

728
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,371
Meet me at the front gate at 11 a.m.

729
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,503
No, this can't be him.

730
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,963
-You got this!
-Let's go!

731
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,428
On the day of Chungram Sports Festival,

732
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,014
the building will be completely empty.

733
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:44,643
If he's the culprit, he will show up
on the day of Chungram Sports Festival.

734
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,402
If I win this race,
I'm going to ask her out.

735
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:26,059
-Good luck!
-Team White!

736
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,522
-No!
-Professor Kwon!

737
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:34,651
-You can do it!
-Go, Professor Yu!

738
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,279
-Go, Professor, go!
-What?

739
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,197
-Go, Professor, go!
-Where did he go?

740
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,491
What's going on? Where is he going?

741
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,452
-Hey!
-Where is he going?

742
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,288
Damn it!

743
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,174
DORMITORY

744
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,140
MEN'S DORMITORY

745
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,603
I got you, punk!

746
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,054
Gosh, we almost won…

747
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,190
We were almost there though. Darn it.

748
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,776
-We won!
-Darn it.

749
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,070
Darn it.

750
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,213
You…

751
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,841
What are you doing here?

752
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,093
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

753
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,597
I asked what you are doing here!

754
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,433
Why are you yelling at me?

755
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,226
They told me not to return
because of the aftereffects.

756
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:17,689
Therefore, I was appointed as a professor
at Korean National Police University.

757
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,149
So we're colleagues now.

758
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,109
What?

759
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,705
You lost.

760
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,460
What happened to Sun-ho
and Professor Yu though?

761
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,753
I don't know.

762
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,671
Did something happen to them?

763
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,924
Hey, Sun-ho! What happened?

764
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,468
Kang-hui.

765
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,848
Let me explain what happened.

766
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,953
THE 41ST CHUNGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL

767
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,007
What did I expect?
That was so foolish of me.

768
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,529
Kang-hui.

769
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,241
If it's not something urgent,
can we talk later?

770
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,534
I'm a bit tired.

771
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,833
I can hand over

772
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,794
the special leave to someone else.

773
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,262
You need to attend your mother's trial.
You should use it.

774
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,266
Didn't I tell you this before?

775
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,519
Either talk behind my back
or just ignore it.

776
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,444
Do you really not know why I'm doing this?

777
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,571
No, I don't. Why are you doing this?

778
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,966
I'll carry this
to the meeting spot for you.

779
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,886
It says you can't use
the suspect's statement

780
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,679
as evidence against him at his trial.

781
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,601
FRESHMAN OH'S SHOCKING SECRET

782
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,895
Director Baek.

783
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,901
Please take down the post
against Oh Kang-hui on our website.

784
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,155
Please hurry before she sees it!

785
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:17,827
I…

786
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,250
I like you.

787
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,826
Cheol-jin asked for it,
saying he wants to work by your side.

788
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,995
That's why I transferred him there.

789
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,205
Even so…

790
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,332
How could you do this
without talking to me first…

791
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,418
Anyway, okay. I have to go.

792
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,546
What happened?

793
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,470
Because of this…

794
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,098
Do you know

795
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,767
what I had to give up because of this?

796
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,686
What?

797
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,190
Someone sneaked into my empty room
and went through my laptop.

798
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,151
The frame for my family photo is broken.

799
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:37,865
CAPTAIN

800
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,659
Goodness.

801
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,703
Professor.

802
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,669
Professor.

803
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,215
Professor.

804
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,116
Maybe the real war

805
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,244
was just beginning.

806
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,998
Why did you lie to me?

807
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:12,126
I wanted to kick you, but I took it out
on the poor trash can instead.

808
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,962
-The tickets for Asan have sold out.
-What?

809
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:18,132
I've got a date today. What are you up to?

810
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,926
I have very important plans.

811
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,344
-What?
-Noh Beom-tae?

812
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,054
Why was Mr. Park
suddenly transferred here?

813
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,556
Am I the only one who thinks it's odd
that he came here now?

814
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,976
I guess you and Sun-ho are very close.

815
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,813
What do you think he gained
from planting that bug?

816
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,565
-Kang Sun-ho.
-You said the culprit is here.

817
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,151
I must catch the culprit at all costs.
