1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:07,674
LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,594
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,306
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

4
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,820
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,553
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,556
Exam papers were leaked

7
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,060
right before the final exams
at Korean National Police University.

8
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,228
The cradle of justice,
Korean National Police University.

9
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,898
KCS will report thorough coverage
of the corruption case

10
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,400
that overshadows the school's philosophy.

11
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,530
It hasn't been a year since Professor Yu
was appointed to this school,

12
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,909
but he leaked the exam paper
of the subject he's teaching.

13
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,412
According to the Asan Police Station,
Yu denied all charges at first,

14
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,415
but he ended up admitting them
during the investigation.

15
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,631
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,906
I was the one

17
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,991
who leaked the exam paper.

18
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,124
What do you think you're doing?

19
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,877
You should've been the one to cuff me.

20
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,672
Hey, Park Cheol-jin!

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,854
I was just trying to make
some money on the side

22
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,481
but ended up coming this far.

23
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,443
Hey, you idiot!

24
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,780
You should have given up
when you found the bug.

25
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,325
What was the point of me
acting like I lost my memory?

26
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,536
You just wouldn't hit the brakes.

27
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,746
You jerk! Shut your mouth!

28
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,041
Senior Inspector Yu Dong-man.

29
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,210
My supervisor.

30
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,174
You no longer need to have my back.

31
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,554
You crazy idiot!

32
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,997
What is happening, seriously?

33
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,750
Professor Yu cried.

34
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,294
I can't believe he cried.

35
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,005
Professors are humans too.

36
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,966
They can cry when they're sad and upset.

37
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,282
CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM

38
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,169
Hey, Kang-hui.
You should get back to school.

39
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,255
Don't wait for me. Just get going.

40
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,923
I'll take Professor Yu…

41
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,342
Oh, Professor…

42
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,523
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

43
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,608
To make me write an article about it.

44
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,169
I'm Im Hyeon-seok, a reporter from KCS.

45
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,088
Professor Yu Dong-man, right?

46
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,593
We received a tip
from one of your students

47
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,305
about an exam leak case
at the Police University.

48
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,348
And the school is trying to cover it up.

49
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,143
Get lost.

50
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,146
Did you take bribes? Is that it?

51
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,689
Stupid reporters.

52
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,400
Did you not hear what I said?
I said, get lost.

53
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,069
How would you feel
if I were condescending toward cops?

54
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,448
We're just trying to do
some fact-checking,

55
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,283
so we can tell the public the truth.

56
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,661
Truth, my foot.

57
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,205
You jerks don't care about that.

58
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,083
How dare a corrupt cop try to lecture me?

59
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,003
I have the perfect headline
for this article.

60
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:41,382
"Police Corruption Comes to Light
Through Corrupt Police Officer."

61
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,510
I'll make sure
it's reported in a scandalous manner.

62
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,679
You know how the people
get riled up so easily.

63
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,434
-Is that it?
-What?

64
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,687
A cop who's a total jerk

65
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,941
engaged in a bunch of corrupt acts
and tried to cover them up.

66
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,028
But did he do it alone?

67
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,780
What was concealed?

68
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,948
How much of it was fabricated?

69
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,327
If you want to cook up a story,

70
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,622
do it properly
so that everyone will be intrigued.

71
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,457
That is, if you're a real journalist,

72
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,126
not a trashy reporter.

73
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,213
Do you want to be ostracized or something?

74
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,756
If he still

75
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,050
doesn't show up despite that,

76
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,054
then I should be ostracized.

77
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,972
What?

78
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,643
Hey, Reporter Im!

79
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,688
You should leave. Go now!

80
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,358
He's still under investigation,

81
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,193
and they embargoed this case.

82
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,028
-Fine.
-Leave.

83
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,280
-Let me have some coffee.
-Coffee, my foot. Go!

84
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,241
There are only two.

85
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,701
So go home now.

86
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,042
Let's start with the report.

87
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,711
Are you serious?

88
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,511
You intentionally admitted all charges
when I was present.

89
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,389
Wouldn't a reporter write an article
in such a situation?

90
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,348
Of course they would, right?

91
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,436
-What do you want to say?
-You knew, right?

92
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,604
That the real culprit,
Park Cheol-jin would turn himself in

93
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,856
if the news is reported.

94
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,192
I heard you two were partners.

95
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,861
Is that why?

96
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,616
You should focus
on writing articles, not scenarios.

97
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,787
Darn. You clearly said

98
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,874
that you should be ostracized
if he doesn't show up.

99
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,209
Of course I should,

100
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,921
since I couldn't catch
a partner doing something sneaky

101
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,339
when I'm a detective myself.

102
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,094
That's why I waited
until he confessed his own crime.

103
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,138
And he did show up. Isn't that enough?

104
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,225
You'd better keep your eye on this case.

105
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,269
Keep an eye on the detective
in charge of this case,

106
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,854
how the case unfolds,

107
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,190
and the truth behind the case.

108
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,443
Keep your eye on these
and write up good articles.

109
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,278
That's if you're a real journalist,

110
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,905
not a trashy reporter.

111
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,408
I'll also do the same
as a detective, not a pig.

112
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,868
Why do you keep talking down to me?

113
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,286
You do it too if you're offended.

114
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,705
Why that…

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,418
Reporter Oh, it's me.

116
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,004
Who is the detective in charge
of the paper leak case in KNPU?

117
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,562
Professor Yu.

118
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,731
Hey.

119
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,744
Let's go back to school.

120
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,914
Okay, Professor Yu.

121
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,800
-Have a good day, sir.
-Good work.

122
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,478
MONEY DEPOSITED

123
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,736
Mr. Park, your address

124
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,323
is Unit 301, Gyeongam Studio Apartment,

125
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,159
Haengyeong-ro 21, Yangjin-myeon, Asan.

126
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,828
Is it correct?

127
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,746
Yes.

128
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,043
Actually,

129
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,045
I have something to confess

130
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,922
regarding the illegal gambling site,

131
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,549
other than the exam paper leak case.

132
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,009
Could you contact
Crime Investigation Team One

133
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,260
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency…

134
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,139
Your mother is Kim Yeong-suk,

135
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,600
and your sister is Park Na-hyeon.

136
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,311
Am I right?

137
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,898
-What are you--
-Shut your mouth.

138
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,945
It's an order from higher-ups.

139
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,118
You've got to protect your family first.

140
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,030
PARK CHEOL-JIN'S ADDRESS

141
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,158
UNIT 301, GYEONGAM STUDIO APT
HAENGYEONG-RO 21, YANGJIN-MYEON, ASAN

142
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,036
One, two.

143
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,997
One, two.

144
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,749
DORMITORY

145
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,251
The finals will resume from today, right?

146
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,046
I was hoping
the Investigation Studies exam

147
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,214
would be canceled.

148
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,217
I didn't study last weekend.

149
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,301
You never do.

150
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,803
You're right.

151
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,848
Do you think Professor Yu is okay?

152
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,186
No sleep and no proper meals

153
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,188
for the past few days.

154
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,649
I'm okay.

155
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,235
The face is all haggard.

156
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,614
Gosh, it's so upsetting.

157
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,951
Do you think Professor Yu is okay?

158
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,332
Every faculty member is down,
so Professor Yu must be feeling worse.

159
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,638
We had a scandalous incident recently,

160
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,141
but we should wrap up the finals well.

161
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,436
Professor Yu, is your exam today?

162
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,189
Yes, I'm giving an exam today.

163
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,651
All right.
Those who are done with their exams,

164
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,612
please finish grading them
within this week.

165
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,907
There are still a few reporters
snooping around the campus.

166
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,911
Please refrain yourselves
from talking with reporters.

167
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,415
All right.

168
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,667
That's all for today's meeting.

169
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,839
I was waiting for your apology,

170
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,757
but you're leaving.

171
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,844
What? Did I say something wrong?

172
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,763
Our reputation is ruined
because of one person.

173
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,724
Or is it two people?

174
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,480
You're right.

175
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,983
Classless jerks caused trouble
and ruined the school's reputation.

176
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,735
I'm sorry about that.

177
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,114
He seems fine.

178
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,409
Did you see that? How dare he?

179
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,745
I don't think
Professor Yu did anything wrong.

180
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,914
You never know.

181
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,874
They used to be partners.

182
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,209
Come on.

183
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,920
Please don't be like this.

184
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,631
Professors should also take exams

185
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,466
before they get appointed.

186
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,719
I didn't work so hard
to get into this school

187
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,805
to learn from some jerk like Yu Dong-man.

188
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,643
-Doesn't it make you mad?
-Of course it does.

189
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,854
By the way, who is the student
that tipped off the press?

190
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,023
I'm curious too. Who did that?

191
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,983
Hey, does that even matter?

192
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,027
What matters is that a fraud like him

193
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,071
is still teaching us.

194
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,408
It's not like we can petition
for his dismissal.

195
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,494
I know.

196
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,595
Today is the final exam and the last class

197
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,431
of Investigation Studies
for this semester.

198
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356
I…

199
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,608
Aren't you going to hand out the papers?

200
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,499
Why?

201
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,459
A professor who accepted bribes like me

202
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,837
should shut his mouth
and hand out the exam papers?

203
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,592
Bear with it
even if you don't want to listen to me.

204
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,176
If you can't,

205
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,178
you may walk out of class.

206
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,972
I'll give you an F as I'm petty.

207
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,726
I'm sorry
that it took longer to make the exam.

208
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,438
I'm also sorry that the reporters

209
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,023
are hanging around the campus.

210
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,817
I'm so sorry
that I canceled the class so many times

211
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,527
during the first semester.

212
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,988
I was going to apologize like this,
but forget it.

213
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,532
Let me just say one thing.

214
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,162
Just because you hate the professor,
don't hate the subject.

215
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,247
That'll be your loss.

216
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,416
Got it?

217
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,882
I'll give you 70 minutes. Let's begin.

218
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,190
INVESTIGATION STUDIES
EXAM QUESTIONS

219
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:02,169
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT
OF AN INVESTIGATION?

220
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,639
PERSEVERANCE

221
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,557
PASSION!

222
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,936
EVIDENCE

223
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,646
EVIDENCE

224
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,661
-Did you get the last question?
-How was it?

225
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,578
Well…

226
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,499
What he said earlier…

227
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,127
He meant we must hate the sin,
but not the sinner, right?

228
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,587
He meant that we can hate the sinner

229
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,881
but shouldn't hate
the Investigation Studies.

230
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,634
It's the professor.

231
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,269
I'll be off.

232
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,815
About Professor Yu's confession…

233
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,317
I guess that was a false report.

234
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,737
Of course it must be.

235
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,489
Gosh, who is the one
that sent a tip to the news?

236
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,950
I'm sure that it was one of the students.

237
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,290
What matters is why he did it,
not who did it.

238
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,710
I'll get going.

239
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,296
I'm leaving too.

240
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,090
POLICE UNIVERSITY

241
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,635
So it was you.

242
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,181
Right.

243
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,308
I tipped off.

244
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,269
-Why?
-I thought it was wrong.

245
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,355
An insider committed a crime

246
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,357
at a place full of police and trainees.

247
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,650
But the grown-ups were covering it up.

248
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,613
Someone was unjust,

249
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,156
and the school wasn't fair.

250
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,076
I didn't learn to overlook those things.

251
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,495
Is that so?

252
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,207
But what does drawing attention
to an unfinished investigation

253
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,250
have to do with justice or fairness?

254
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,632
If you did it because of me,

255
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,051
don't do it ever again.

256
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,428
Why not?

257
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,891
Is it because you won't change your mind
no matter what I do?

258
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,975
No.

259
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,436
It's because you're a good person.

260
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,358
Just like you said,
you make just and fair choices.

261
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,611
So don't turn your choice into nothing
because of me.

262
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,201
And you're right. I won't change my mind.

263
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,256
If it won't change no matter what,

264
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,091
I'll just do as I wish.

265
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,219
I will never give up on you,

266
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,637
and I'm going to make

267
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,806
meaningless choices because of you.

268
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,144
-Hey, Park Min-gyu.
-From now on, I won't hide my feelings.

269
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,322
Cheol-jin refused all the visits,

270
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,116
so don't waste your time, okay?

271
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,577
Gosh. How can he be so brazen?

272
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,121
Any updates on the investigation?

273
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,957
Since he's from our precinct,

274
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,042
they won't share information with us.

275
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,170
They won't even let us
have a peek at his statement.

276
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,006
Okay. I got it.

277
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,014
Professor. Do you have time
for a judo match with me?

278
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,895
YU DONG-MAN, KANG SUN-HO

279
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,940
Gosh.

280
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,915
Gosh, you punk.
Haven't you learned anything?

281
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,754
Hey. Just use your words.

282
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,426
You're the one who needs to talk.

283
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,472
About what happened and what will happen…

284
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,890
Aren't you going to say anything?

285
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,435
You know

286
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,729
that I'm on your side.

287
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,024
Are you trying to comfort me?

288
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,109
I'm telling you
since you don't seem to know that.

289
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,323
-So what's your plan?
-What about it?

290
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,616
We should get the culprit.

291
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,284
Mr. Park isn't at the end of this.

292
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,372
The burner phone user
that called Mr. Park is.

293
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,629
Why are you doing this?

294
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,674
Since when

295
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,593
did this investigation
become such a big deal to you?

296
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,056
If I hadn't hacked back then,

297
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,142
you would have caught
the illegal gambling ring.

298
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,104
Then Kang-hui's mother

299
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,941
wouldn't have stood trial
for something she didn't do.

300
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,946
Whether you hacked or not,

301
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,199
it's my fault as a detective
that I failed to catch them.

302
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,951
She got fooled

303
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,453
saying they would cancel her debt
for her account.

304
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,247
And that's on her.

305
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,794
Did you know about it?
About Kang-hui's mother's trial?

306
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,713
Do you think I didn't know that

307
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,589
when I was making a fuss
trying to catch the culprit?

308
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,176
The trial is still in progress,

309
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,178
and we can get the evidence
to turn the tables around.

310
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,474
You must think I'm a pushover.

311
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,937
Then when will we start
the investigation again?

312
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,106
Professor?

313
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,361
KANG SUN-HO

314
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,043
This is most frequently used

315
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,253
by cops in real situations.

316
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,965
Master this and come back later.

317
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,927
Who will you catch
when you can't even beat me?

318
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,685
YU DONG-MAN
POLICE UNIVERSITY

319
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,733
We should get the culprit.
Mr. Park isn't at the end of this.

320
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,706
Take them here. This way.

321
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,707
Put them down.

322
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,890
POLICE

323
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,101
POLICE

324
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,857
ACQUIRED EVIDENCE NUMBER 4

325
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,192
ACQUIRED EVIDENCE NUMBER 7

326
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,071
We seized and searched your place.

327
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,075
The burner phones and fake passbooks
that you said you used for the crimes.

328
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,910
We have seized them as evidence.

329
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,497
Your accomplice, the taxi driver,

330
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,292
also confessed that it was you
who gave orders to him.

331
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,794
I guess you will be transferred

332
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,462
to the detention center soon.

333
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,177
From now on,

334
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,639
do not say anything

335
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,308
or hear anything.

336
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,814
You know what I mean.

337
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,660
They've got the evidence of him

338
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,579
running the illegal gambling ring.

339
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,039
He will be transferred
to the detention center soon.

340
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,593
That little…

341
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,891
That punk…

342
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,729
How many years do I get
if I commit murder?

343
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,981
It depends.

344
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,609
I'm not sure what you get
for accidental murders caused by jealousy.

345
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,777
-How dare he touch her?
-That little…

346
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,946
Which do you think is better?
A gun or a knife?

347
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,406
Well…

348
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,911
-Wouldn't a gun be better?
-Shoot him.

349
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,747
You get reduced punishment
if you have an accomplice, right?

350
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,958
Yesterday's enemy is today's friend?

351
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,087
Let's just say
it's to defeat the mutual enemy.

352
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,596
She smiled.

353
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,183
Hey! Don't smile for him!
Why is she smiling?

354
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,353
Myeong-jung is in deep trouble now.

355
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,521
He's a public enemy now.

356
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,607
Beom-tae and Joon-wuk
have joined forces now.

357
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,777
What about you and Professor Yu?

358
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,861
What?

359
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,031
Didn't you call me here
to tell me about that?

360
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,200
Oh, right.

361
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,494
Let's sit down.

362
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,467
We're not transferring
Mr. Park Cheol-jin today.

363
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,012
You won't see him, so please leave.

364
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,223
Then…

365
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,893
could you relay my message to him?

366
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,565
-Kang-hui.
-So?

367
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,236
When did you find out the investigation
was connected to my mom's case?

368
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,989
Only a little while ago.

369
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,993
I found out the day
we attended your mother's trial.

370
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,911
But I think
Professor Yu has known all along.

371
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:25,667
He said we could still catch the culprit
because the trial isn't over yet.

372
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,963
He's been investigating the case
from the beginning,

373
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,589
but what about you?

374
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,385
Why do you keep digging
into the case with him?

375
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,931
Because I

376
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,183
ruined it once.

377
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,980
And that's why he lost those scumbags.

378
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,402
That's how it started.

379
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,615
But while investigating the case with him,

380
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,410
I've learned how not to give up

381
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,121
or run away even when I'm scared.

382
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,414
ASAN POLICE STATION

383
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,168
And that I have to be ruthless

384
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,421
when and if anyone around me
is suspected of a crime.

385
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,345
That is how I can truly protect those
who are dear to me as a police officer.

386
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,684
I wanted to be a police officer like that.

387
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,229
I really wanted to be like that.
That's why

388
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,774
I have made up my mind

389
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,985
to keep investigating the case
and see it through.

390
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,282
And is Professor Yu
a police officer like that?

391
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,863
Hello, Mr. Attorney.

392
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:24,577
I'd like to see my mom.

393
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,086
"My brakes stopped working long ago,

394
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,214
so watch out
and look after yourself, idiot."

395
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,590
Said your "crazy supervisor".

396
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,136
What does that mean?

397
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,764
It means that he'll take this to the end.

398
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,570
CASE SUMMARY

399
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,659
It began with the illegal gambling ring.

400
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,413
Then Kang Sun-ho
hacked into their account.

401
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,666
All their websites and accounts are gone.
There's no way we can catch them.

402
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,002
The year we spent working on them
was all for nothing!

403
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,546
-What's going on?
-You're suspended. Get out of here!

404
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:22,343
After that, Cheol-jin got attacked
while trying to give me the information.

405
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,637
The jerks running the illegal site
you're after…

406
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,390
They are the Police University's…

407
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,730
The first time Cheol-jin got hurt,

408
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,148
we had two suspects.

409
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,817
Go Deok-bae and Kwon Hyuk-phil.

410
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,904
But right after confirming
Professor Kwon's alibi,

411
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,616
we caught Park Cheol-jin.

412
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,035
That means the owner
of the burner phone called him,

413
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,621
and he came to the school.

414
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,291
The calls, travel route,
and the same cell site.

415
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,461
I kept seeing the same pattern.

416
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,048
Park Cheol-jin was taking orders
through the burner phone.

417
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,674
And…

418
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,678
the listening device I found in my office.

419
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,392
Within the 3km radius,

420
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,354
there's only one person
whose alibi I have not confirmed yet.

421
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,691
KWON HYUK-PHIL, GO DEOK-BAE

422
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,202
GO DEOK-BAE

423
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,913
Go Deok-bae.

424
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,842
GOSSI BEER
CLOSED FOR VACATION

425
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,186
Damn it. Of all days…

426
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,165
GO DEOK-BAE

427
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,042
AMOUNT DUE, CUSTOMER DETAILS

428
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,043
What?

429
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,337
Why is his electricity bill so high?

430
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,048
TOTAL: 1,517,530 WON

431
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,596
DRIVER'S LICENSE EXAM CHECKLIST

432
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,226
All Police University graduates
will be sent out to the field

433
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,895
immediately upon graduation,

434
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,979
which means

435
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,815
you'll be expected to drive
the patrol cars right away.

436
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,234
Hence, a driver's license is a must. Okay?

437
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,569
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

438
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,040
So our vacation begins
as soon as we get a driver's license?

439
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,753
We have to get a driver's license
and get Myeong-jung away from her.

440
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,254
We're so busy.

441
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,299
-My gosh.
-Seriously.

442
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,303
What are you doing? Looking for me again?

443
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,268
Did you have trouble
falling asleep last night?

444
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,646
-No.
-Hold on.

445
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,230
I'll go get an energy drink for you…

446
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,983
No, it's okay. I slept well.

447
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,736
I'll head in first.

448
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,998
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

449
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,468
PROPERTY REGISTRATION DETAILS

450
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,806
OWNER: GO DEOK-BAE

451
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,647
2-STORY BUILDING WITH A BASEMENT

452
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,109
Basement?

453
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,242
Where is the basement?

454
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,245
I don't see any doors or stairwells to it.

455
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,168
What are you doing?

456
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,421
Didn't you get my text?

457
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,632
Gossi Beer is closed,
so we're meeting at the jokbal place.

458
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,846
Let's go.

459
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,393
Let's raise our glasses.

460
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:44,022
Despite the unfortunate incidents,

461
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,234
we managed to wrap up
the semester successfully,

462
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,695
so I wanted to thank all of you.

463
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,489
Please enjoy all the food and drinks.

464
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,491
Let's all have fun.

465
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,160
Cheers. Good work, everyone.

466
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,536
-Good work.
-Good work.

467
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,422
Their portions are big.

468
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,424
-All right, let's eat.
-Okay.

469
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,218
I haven't had a bite yet,
but I already feel rejuvenated.

470
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,678
Is it the power of collagen?

471
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,228
It's so chewy.

472
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,730
It sure is the power of collagen.

473
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,738
What are you doing? Look at Professor Yu.

474
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,406
Drink up.

475
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,122
Gosh, what's with him?
Why is he so feisty today?

476
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,543
Mind your own business
and just eat your collagen.

477
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,093
May I say something?

478
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,596
Sure, go ahead.

479
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,519
Thank you all for working so hard
to clean up the mess

480
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,312
made by the rookies.

481
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,690
I would like to apologize to all of you

482
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,984
on behalf of Inspector Park Cheol-jin.

483
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,903
I'm sorry.

484
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,197
At least he knows.

485
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,204
Why would you apologize on behalf of him?

486
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,916
Well, when your brother causes trouble,

487
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,919
you apologize on his behalf.

488
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,880
Drink up.

489
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,971
And there's no such law in this country.

490
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,474
I'm saying it's not your fault.

491
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,502
I should lift my leg more.

492
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,635
Who will you catch
when you can't even beat me?

493
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,615
So that wench told me to wash her panties.

494
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,452
She said
she's the head of our cell or something.

495
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,661
I was dumbfounded.

496
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,997
Do you know what I did with her panties?

497
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,796
I ripped them to pieces.

498
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,300
Mom.

499
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,762
I asked if it was true
that you didn't do it.

500
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,725
Hey, it was hilarious.

501
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,811
They only give you two pairs in here.

502
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,022
Mom!

503
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,278
Anyway, she tried to steal
someone else's panties.

504
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,030
Mom!

505
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,575
Why are you yelling at me?

506
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,205
Why do you suddenly act
like you believe me?

507
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,875
Would you believe me
if I say that I didn't do it?

508
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,420
You don't believe a word I say
just like my attorney.

509
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,715
What are you talking about?
I'm your daughter.

510
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,764
You didn't run
the illegal gambling site, right?

511
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,641
Right?

512
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,518
I said I didn't.

513
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,020
I didn't.

514
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,189
I didn't, you brat.

515
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,440
Think about it.

516
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,860
They change the website address
dozens of times a day.

517
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,862
They repeatedly open the site
and close it.

518
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,616
Do you think I have the brains for that?

519
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,536
So you're innocent, right?

520
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,580
If this turns out to be a lie,

521
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,043
I will cut all ties with you.

522
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,338
Why?

523
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,507
What are you going to do?

524
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,595
Hey, Oh Kang-hui!

525
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,639
She missed my entrance ceremony,

526
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,558
but I'll make sure
she attends my graduation.

527
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,951
Sun-ho!

528
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,288
Why won't you pick up your phone?

529
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,124
Sorry, I was practicing.

530
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,209
What is it? What happened?

531
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,920
I want to investigate the case with you.

532
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,090
-What?
-I want to investigate the case

533
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,967
with you and Professor Yu.

534
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,137
Even if my mom turns out
to be the real culprit,

535
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,639
I need to find out myself.

536
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,977
Kang-hui, I couldn't tell you this,

537
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,397
but this case could be really dangerous…

538
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,025
From the moment my mom went
to prison when I was five,

539
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,611
my life has always been in danger.

540
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,196
So I'm not afraid of anything.

541
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,576
There's only one thing I'm afraid of.

542
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,829
That I might run away.

543
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,460
I don't intend to run away,

544
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,089
and I want to catch all those jerks
and save my mom.

545
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,675
I'll talk to Professor Yu.

546
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,970
And…

547
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,348
I like you, Kang Sun-ho.

548
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,479
I told you. I'm not going to run from it.

549
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,579
Say something.

550
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:48,988
I also won't…

551
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,950
run from it any longer.

552
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,536
Tell me more about that.

553
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,664
You said you've dated someone,

554
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,708
although you couldn't get married.

555
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,462
Gosh.

556
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,548
Tell me your story!

557
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,217
Who was it? Was she pretty?

558
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,428
She was the ugliest one in our precinct.

559
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,475
I always wondered whom she'd marry.

560
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,685
But it turned out that I was that guy.

561
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,688
If she was pretty, I'd have been upset,

562
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,732
but why did she have to be ugly?

563
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,401
Why did you break up with her?

564
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,113
Did you fall out of love
just like in a movie?

565
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,118
An accident.

566
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,120
An accident?

567
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,250
-Please calm down.
-Eun-ju!

568
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,918
Eun-ju!

569
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,464
While chasing the illegal gambling ring,

570
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,635
she got hit by a car
that went through a red light.

571
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,178
Boom.

572
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,392
It ended the same way as mine.

573
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,354
It must've been hard.
How did you bear with it?

574
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,147
You know…

575
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,317
I was determined to see

576
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,071
the end of the case
that Eun-ju couldn't finish.

577
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,867
What about you? How did you bear with it?

578
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,995
Me?

579
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,123
The world didn't change,

580
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,041
so I changed myself.

581
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,843
So…

582
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,430
To finish what Eun-ju couldn't,

583
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,766
you want to be a detective,

584
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,477
not a professor?

585
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,566
At first, she was the reason,

586
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,029
but now it's because Cheol-jin got hurt.

587
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,573
Now…

588
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,908
You know

589
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,620
that I'm on your side.

590
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,873
I'm afraid someone else might get hurt.

591
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,672
Just stick to being a professor.

592
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,341
You startled me.

593
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,343
You're not the only detective
in the world.

594
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,263
Just stick to being a professor.

595
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,516
I'd love to,

596
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,935
but wherever I go,

597
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,065
people next to me get hurt or die.

598
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,739
That's why
I'll just stick to being a detective.

599
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,627
"The road narrows…"

600
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,296
"The car in front of you…"

601
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,560
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

602
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,568
Sweet dreams.

603
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,945
What?

604
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,280
Sorry, wrong text.

605
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,574
Have a good night.

606
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,951
KANG SUN-HO

607
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,452
Goodness…

608
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,253
I'll practice hard so I can help you more

609
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,587
with the investigation.

610
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,737
KANG SUN-HO

611
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:48,704
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

612
00:45:55,461 --> 00:46:00,757
CASE SUMMARY

613
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,052
CASE SUMMARY

614
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,350
KANG SUN-HO

615
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,608
KWON HYUK-PHIL

616
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,713
YU DONG-MAN

617
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,471
My gosh, what is this dazzling object?

618
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,640
It's my driver's license.

619
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,434
Stop bragging about it.

620
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,687
Sun-ho and Beom-tae were
the only ones who didn't pass.

621
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,358
That's okay.
Everyone deserves three chances.

622
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,734
Right, Beom-tae?

623
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:01,693
That's right.

624
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,195
It took me three tries to get here.

625
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,364
I'll need three tries
for a driver's license too.

626
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,033
And my dad said he'd give me his car

627
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,911
once I got my license.

628
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,121
-What? That's awesome. For real?
-Yes.

629
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,041
What kind of car is it?
From a domestic brand? Imported?

630
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,087
Right! I heard your family is
one of the wealthiest families in Asan.

631
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,004
Hold on.

632
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,884
Is there another Beom-tae
at our school aside from me?

633
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,388
-No.
-No, right?

634
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,685
What?

635
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,523
-Are you wearing perfume, Kang-hui?
-No.

636
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,362
Well, it's probably her shampoo.

637
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,034
Jeez, you fool.

638
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,245
I can't believe you didn't pass
your driver's license test.

639
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,039
I passed the functional and written exams.

640
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,208
I just failed the road test.

641
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,502
Shut it and just come with me.

642
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,766
Hey, you fool!
Do you think this is a joke?

643
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,809
Just go!

644
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,894
I am driving.

645
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,313
Why are you yelling at me?

646
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,440
You're driving on the shoulder!

647
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,483
Put your turn signal on, change lanes,

648
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,277
and step on the gas.

649
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,323
Don't you know that it's against the law

650
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,950
to drive under the minimum speed limit?

651
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,453
Goodness, you're so frustrating.

652
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,957
STUDENT DRIVER

653
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,250
What's that jerk's problem?

654
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,793
What? Who?

655
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,756
Hello, good day.

656
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,675
We're driving on Dangjin-ro 12-gil
at the moment.

657
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,012
And I think I just spotted a drunk driver.

658
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,306
Hold on, the plate number is…

659
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,183
Change lanes, go!

660
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,809
That black vehicle.

661
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,356
It's 8773.

662
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,817
Yes. 60 and N as in "news."

663
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,611
And 8773.

664
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,905
Yes, we'll keep following the vehicle.

665
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,699
Please send a patrol car
as soon as possible.

666
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,368
Yes, thank you.

667
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,536
You heard that, right?

668
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,747
Do you think it's a drunk driver?
In broad daylight?

669
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,499
He seems to be staying in the lane.

670
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,125
You fool!

671
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,795
What if that jerk causes an accident

672
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,589
under the influence
and kills an entire family?

673
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,175
Will you come to your senses
after reading an article about it?

674
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,525
Keep going?

675
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,904
Stay in the lane! Focus.

676
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,741
Good. You're doing well.

677
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,786
Don't be nervous.

678
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,622
You're good.

679
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,683
What would you have done
had I caused an accident?

680
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,060
Of course,
I would not have let that happen.

681
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,106
Goodness.

682
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,859
Why are you giving me that look?

683
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,654
Thanks to you, I'll be a great driver.

684
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,364
I'm glad to hear that.

685
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,868
You learned one useful thing from me.

686
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,746
What I mean is…

687
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,957
What you saw and learned
during the investigation

688
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,376
isn't a proper way to do things,

689
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,586
so forget all about it.

690
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,839
From now on,
only remember the things that you learned

691
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,425
from your professors
at the Police University.

692
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,634
You got that?

693
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,052
No, I don't want to.

694
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,054
I went through hoops to learn them.
Why should I forget them?

695
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,807
I will remember all of them
and put them to use.

696
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,352
Goodness. Just listen to me, you punk.

697
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,105
You're only 20 years old.

698
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,358
You need to love, travel, and fight.

699
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,320
Enjoy your youth and life.

700
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,781
The investigation isn't everything.

701
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,201
Right, make sure
you practice judo more though.

702
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,953
I'm already doing all those things.

703
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,706
Also, I know…

704
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,334
investigation isn't everything.

705
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,587
But it means a great deal to me
because we're doing it together.

706
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,176
You taught me judo and how to drive

707
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,428
so I wouldn't fall behind.

708
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,227
I'll master them during the summer break,

709
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,355
so call me if you find out anything.

710
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,106
I'll come right away.

711
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,279
Okay?

712
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,829
Okay. I will.

713
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,915
Enjoy your summer. Have fun.

714
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,140
What's going on?

715
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,855
-What is it?
-What?

716
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,274
You keep chuckling all by yourself.

717
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,067
What is going on?

718
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,361
Well, you know.

719
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,947
I'm just excited about our summer break.

720
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,284
I'm excited just thinking about it.

721
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,370
-I'm stoked!
-Me too!

722
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,415
So? Do you have plans?

723
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,417
Yes.

724
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,836
I'll study Investigation Studies.

725
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,088
What? You'll study?

726
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,506
When the summer break begins,

727
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,343
you should go see a doctor first, okay?

728
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,027
Yes, did you look into it?

729
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,236
Yes.

730
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,906
The electricity bill
that you sent me a photo of…

731
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,909
Something else caught my eye
other than the amount.

732
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,578
I could be wrong, but it seems fishy.

733
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,580
What is it?

734
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,624
Considering the size of Gossi Beer,

735
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,501
it would've been more beneficial
to get a regular account,

736
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,670
but it's registered
as a commercial account,

737
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,255
which is more expensive.

738
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:39,883
What about it?

739
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,261
Those who own Internet cafes
or mine for cryptocurrency…

740
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,098
In other words, it's a common trick
used by people who do things

741
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,059
that consume a lot of electricity

742
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,938
to lower their electricity bills.

743
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,982
A: WE HAVE THE BASE STATION
FOR THE BURNER PHONE…

744
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,069
What is this?

745
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,740
"We have the base station
for the burner phone,

746
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,742
but the location keeps changing."

747
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,413
There's a program that analyzes
call patterns and frequency.

748
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,456
If we look into the base station
using that,

749
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,835
we should be able to track down
the person using the burner phone.

750
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,546
Do you think this is like some spy movie?

751
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,715
The software is used by the FBI,

752
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,466
but I can code the program.

753
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,593
Although it'll take some time.

754
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,555
About two weeks, I think.

755
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,848
Damn it…

756
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,317
So it was you?

757
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,280
He was right under my nose.

758
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,370
Professor Go, that scum.

759
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:41,421
DORMITORY

760
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,217
Transferring to voicemail…

761
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,802
Why isn't he picking up?

762
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,225
KANG SUN-HO

763
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,105
KANG SUN-HO

764
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,148
Where are you?

765
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,150
You should check out my driver's license.

766
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,444
Sun-ho.

767
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,113
They told us to return the laptops
before leaving.

768
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,198
Oh, right.

769
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,992
I'll transfer my files first.

770
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,160
Sure.

771
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,423
COPYING FILES
FROM DESKTOP TO USB DRIVE

772
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,097
What's this program?

773
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,731
BASE STATION OUTGOING CALL RECORDS

774
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,986
COPYING FILES TO USB

775
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,124
BASE STATION OUTGOING CALL RECORDS

776
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,084
CELL PHONE 1

777
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,676
NUMBER TRACKING

778
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,344
GPS TRACKING

779
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,356
The burner phone is on.

780
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,586
Sun-ho.

781
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,679
What do you mean?

782
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,140
I was in the club room,

783
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,101
and Professor Seo told me that.

784
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,534
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
YU DONG-MAN

785
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,833
This is Yu Dong-man.

786
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,797
You once asked me this.

787
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,049
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
YU DONG-MAN

788
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:34,052
Whether I'll be a professor
or a detective.

789
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,221
And that I'll need to choose one.

790
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,062
Honestly, I thought being a professor

791
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,606
wasn't a bad option.

792
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,914
But I was learning more from the kids.

793
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:04,999
It was embarrassing.

794
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,210
CHUNGRAM LOUNGE

795
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,004
I thought it'd be better…

796
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,259
to catch the bad guys who are below me

797
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,678
than to learn from the kids
who are better than me.

798
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,139
That's why…

799
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,352
I'm going back to being a detective.

800
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,461
It can't be true.

801
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,630
It can't be…

802
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,723
YU DONG-MAN

803
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,354
Gosh, you rude little punk.

804
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,148
Don't you know how to knock?

805
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,109
What is it? What now?

806
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,402
What's with that look?

807
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,600
Professor Seo,

808
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,311
please take good care…

809
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,110
of those airheads.

810
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,365
I'M GOING BACK TO BEING A DETECTIVE

811
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,826
Professor Yu.

812
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,595
I got in danger
while chasing the illegal gambling ring

813
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,972
to help solve your case.

814
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,976
Which crazy punk dared
to touch my daughter?

815
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,561
Please tell him when you see him

816
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,229
that it'll take a week
to process his resignation.

817
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,397
Where do you think he went?

818
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,734
I'm sure Professor Yu is
where the culprit is.

819
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,861
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

820
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,155
Who is he? Maybe he's a wanted person.

821
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,115
I saw his face, and it was him.

822
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,576
I'll be out of the country
once things get sorted out.

823
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,578
I have something to tell you.

824
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,830
The last signal was picked up
in Changrim-dong.

825
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,331
If we go now,

826
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,376
we should be able to catch
those jerks in the gambling ring.

827
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,711
So I'll get going alone.
