1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:02,919
LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,587
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,427
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,974
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,232
If I need to be worthy of a second chance,

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,446
I will prove it by leading my unit
to victory in the last training.

8
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,157
And if I fail to prove it then,

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,200
I will withdraw

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,245
without making any excuses.

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,542
So can you please
decide after the training?

12
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,961
Whether I deserve to stay in this school

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,172
or not.

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,849
I must've been out of my mind.

15
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,851
What on earth did I just say to him?

16
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,977
Darn it.

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,231
Captain! Are you okay?

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,525
Look at you, you're sweating.

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,735
It's all my fault.

20
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,696
If only I hadn't suggested
eating instant noodles…

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,989
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,242
We should've listened to you
when you said we shouldn't eat it.

23
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,495
Why did you stay up and wait?
You should've just gone to bed.

24
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,539
How could we, after what we heard?

25
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,125
What? What did you hear?

26
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,418
We didn't hear everything,

27
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,422
but we heard how you said
you'll lead our unit to victory.

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,343
Sun-ho.

29
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,221
You applied to other universities
as well, right?

30
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,639
Hey!

31
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,518
Why would he need to go
to a different university?

32
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,561
Does it even make sense to you?

33
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,272
Us, suddenly beating the other teams.

34
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,650
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,905
2021 POLICE UNIVERSITY FRESHMAN LIST
NAME: KANG SUN-HO

36
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,951
NAME: KANG SUN-HO

37
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,495
PARENTS DECEASED
GUARDIAN YOON TAEK-IL

38
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,206
I wondered why his ID was Yoon.

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,916
GUARDIAN: YOON TAEK-IL

40
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,420
How dare you do this
to someone who has raised you?

41
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,339
You pathetic fools.

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,095
NAME: KANG SUN-HO

43
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,893
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

44
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,813
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

45
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,273
-One.
-Three.

46
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,816
-Two.
-Four.

47
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,235
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

48
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,114
So far, seven people have dropped out.
And three were expelled.

49
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,283
So there are 60 of you at the moment.

50
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,078
We have a week left in this training.

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,080
Based on all your performances,

52
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,082
the second unit
is beating all the other units.

53
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,334
Applause.

54
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,427
The second unit
led by Captain Oh Kang-hui will be

55
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,387
excluded from the last training session.

56
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:04,267
In this training session,
the first unit led by Captain Park Min-gyu

57
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,854
will go up against the third unit
led by Captain Kang Sun-ho.

58
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,943
Now, I'll tell you
what you'll be trained on in this session.

59
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,778
From all the way over there

60
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,739
to here.

61
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,824
-From all the way over there…
-Move.

62
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,040
Just think of it
as a survival paintball match.

63
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,958
A shot here, a shot there!

64
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,630
What's with him?

65
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,258
"Don't tell our enemies about my death."

66
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,262
Each unit will be split into two teams.

67
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,889
-One will attack.
-Charge!

68
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,184
The other team practices defense.

69
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,978
It's one of
the ROK Army's actual drill sessions.

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,565
The Chungram Training is a condensed
version of the ROK Army's training.

71
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,942
That's why we do this.

72
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,276
So we'll do it over there?

73
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,113
Most of the trainees who don't get in
are pushed out at this stage.

74
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,199
But I'm sure

75
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,493
at least some of us will make it.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,162
If we don't want the entire team
to be disqualified,

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,041
we need our captain to come up
with effective strategies and plans.

78
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,546
-Sun-ho.
-Yes.

79
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,925
-We'll be okay, right?
-Yes.

80
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,647
So? What will you do about Kang Sun-ho?

81
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,566
Not sure.

82
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,235
What should I do?

83
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,569
What's there to think?

84
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,196
Aren't you going
to return to the precinct?

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
Darn it.

86
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,116
I know.

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,535
What should I do about that?

88
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,415
Just disqualify him
and continue to get help from Yoon.

89
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,583
What about Kang Sun-ho?

90
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,963
I know who Kang Sun-ho is
because I saw it with my own eyes.

91
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,923
Gosh, why are you being like this?

92
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,216
This is so unlike you.

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,094
You do all sorts of reckless things
to catch criminals.

94
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,804
Go home. Get lost.

95
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,726
Well, why don't you
just give up on the illegal gambling site

96
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,978
and just beg Captain on your knees?

97
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,315
I can beg him with you if you want me to.

98
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,650
Get out! Go home!

99
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,402
Get lost, will you?

100
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,656
I'll leave after I finish this.
Why are you so angry?

101
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,949
Darn it.

102
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,080
You're already having a strategy meeting?

103
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,957
Yes.

104
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,502
As you said,
this isn't really about winning.

105
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,337
I want to do my very best

106
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,841
because this is my last chance.

107
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,260
I'm glad to hear this.

108
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,222
Yes, just do everything you want,
so you won't have any regrets.

109
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,977
This moment will never come again.

110
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,938
And I'm going to do what I want
at this moment without any regrets.

111
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,316
Hey! Oh Kang-hui!

112
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,699
Hey, what's with that smirk?

113
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,661
That sounds just like
what my crush once said.

114
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,956
Who?

115
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,459
What?

116
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,087
Who's the girl you have a crush on?

117
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,049
It's…

118
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,885
What was her name?

119
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,305
Forget it. It's none
of my business anyway.

120
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,975
I need to stop jumping to conclusions.

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,396
Well… I was wondering, just in case,

122
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,233
if the spiel about your dream
of becoming a cop was a lie.

123
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,404
But you've proved that I was wrong.

124
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,034
No one here is more serious
about this than you are.

125
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,164
So about me jumping to conclusions,

126
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,251
I'll apologize to you
once we're officially admitted.

127
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,510
I'll tell you…

128
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,932
who it is once we're officially admitted.

129
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,228
Hey, you'd better keep your word.

130
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,357
Then I should be
rooting for your unit too.

131
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,449
Then I should be
rooting for your unit too.

132
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,285
I refuse to leave.

133
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,164
I will get in, no matter what.

134
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,962
Guys.

135
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,298
Hey, guys.

136
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,133
Guys! Attention.

137
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,136
Throw some ideas around.

138
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,054
Brainstorming might work, you know.

139
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,139
Ideas?

140
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,226
-That's random.
-Ideas?

141
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,687
I mean, you know. Just anything.

142
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,105
It could be anything.

143
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,608
Isn't that your job, Captain?

144
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,985
Otherwise, why do we even need a captain?

145
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,282
Hey, come on. Sun-ho is saying
we should use our teamwork.

146
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,075
The team spirit.

147
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,538
We'll obviously lose.

148
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,999
What's the point
of having a strategy meeting?

149
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,960
Hey, Seong-su.

150
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,630
-Don't be like this.
-Let go.

151
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,343
Let's be honest. Do you really think
we can beat Min-gyu's team?

152
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,720
That team has some of the strongest guys.

153
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,516
You tell me. Am I wrong?

154
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,821
I wish someone could give me
some pointers.

155
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,366
Why don't you

156
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,827
go talk to Professor Yu Dong-man?

157
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,330
He's our training advisor, you know.

158
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,791
And you personally know him.

159
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,627
He'll probably give you some pointers.

160
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,719
LET'S MEET

161
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,388
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING IN PERSON

162
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,185
Forget it. He's of no use anymore.

163
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,400
Should I just swallow my pride

164
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,195
and get down on my knees?

165
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,909
Gosh, seriously.

166
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:42,290
Even if I get down on my knees,
I should get a lead, at least.

167
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,417
Goodness, this will make me lose face.

168
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,460
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

169
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,506
What are you doing here?

170
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,305
I came to ask you something, sir.

171
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,018
I told you that
I'll lead my unit to a victory,

172
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,939
but could you help me out a little?

173
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,485
-What?
-I really want to continue studying here.

174
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,613
I'd rather die than withdraw.

175
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,573
So I'm desperate to win,

176
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,494
but could you help me out just a little?

177
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,581
Don't come closer!

178
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,751
Sorry?

179
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,046
Stand there and talk. Right there.

180
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,925
Just as you told me,

181
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,846
I want to repay my dad
for the rest of my life.

182
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,018
I want to stand on my own.

183
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,773
So could you please help me?

184
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,985
Please, I beg you.

185
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:06,123
-Professor Yu.
-Fine! Don't come any closer.

186
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,458
Did you just agree to help me?

187
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,090
Gosh, that airhead.

188
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,549
This is giving me a headache.

189
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,344
If you help me, I'll do anything for you.

190
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,221
You name it. I'll do anything you say.

191
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,728
-What's the problem?
-Sorry?

192
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,148
I have no clue

193
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,109
how I should prepare

194
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,069
for the last training.

195
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,488
What did you say, you punk?

196
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,867
Gosh, what's so hard about it?

197
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,121
The location is decided,
so it's obvious how your unit should move.

198
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,374
How can you not come up with a strategy
for such an easy mission?

199
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,585
Once you graduate from the university,
you'll become a squad captain.

200
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,796
How can you ask me for help?

201
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,006
-Gosh.
-Does that mean

202
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,175
you'll help me for real?

203
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,635
No, that's not what I meant.

204
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,679
Then I'll come back at noon tomorrow.

205
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,514
-What?
-I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you!

206
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,975
Hey! That brat…

207
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,226
Thank you so much.

208
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,270
That crazy…

209
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,022
My gosh.

210
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,406
Darn it!

211
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:25,578
He can't even come up with a strategy,
so how does he think he'll manage in here?

212
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,415
Combat strategy.

213
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,876
I have no idea either.

214
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,920
Why are there so many?

215
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,222
Hey, ace.

216
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,726
How is the preparation going?

217
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,729
I'm not preparing anything special.

218
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,941
That means you think
you can beat us easily, right?

219
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,235
I mean we'll do our best
as we always have.

220
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,029
That's only courteous
for the opponent team.

221
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,197
That's kind of cool.

222
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,960
-I can do it.
-Where should it go?

223
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,172
-Over there. I'll do it.
-It's okay. I'm done with my lunch.

224
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,179
Same to you.

225
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,146
Did you stay up all night?

226
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,149
-No.
-Okay.

227
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,029
The only advice I can give to your unit…

228
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:48,911
But…

229
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,331
why should I help your unit?

230
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,753
Because it's not just me who needs to win

231
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,838
at the last training session.

232
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,343
All of my unit members need to pass this.

233
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,305
You punk, how could you sell
your own unit members?

234
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,516
Of course I should sell them if I must.

235
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,687
This is my last chance.

236
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,192
Even if you do that, it'll never work.

237
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,239
Do you think you can sell
a unit made of airheads?

238
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,699
What do you mean?

239
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,033
Before planning a strategy,

240
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,578
you should get to know more
about your unit members.

241
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,789
You're not even capable of winning,
but you're only seeking a way to win.

242
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,082
That's why it won't work.

243
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,711
What is it? Are you disappointed

244
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,380
because you didn't get to hear
the answer you waited for?

245
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,134
No, sir. Thank you.

246
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,137
A miracle? A surprise?

247
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,472
If that's what you're hoping for, wake up.

248
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,392
Don't you think
you should know your place?

249
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,603
Since this is your last chance?

250
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,567
A miracle, a surprise, a dream.
Can't I even hope for them?

251
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,320
Just get to the point
and say you want me out.

252
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,625
Whatever!

253
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,377
I'm sure he understood me.
Gosh, he's such a headache.

254
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,965
You still haven't understood me?
Okay, then…

255
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,383
What are you talking about?

256
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,889
I couldn't have done this all by myself.

257
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,848
Thank you.

258
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,683
Didn't you get any sleep?

259
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,728
-I did.
-Come on.

260
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,271
The lights were on all night
in your office.

261
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,275
My gosh. Why did she
check on my office all night?

262
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,444
She's one dangerous woman.

263
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,667
There are only two reasons

264
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,877
why you can't sleep.

265
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,213
Either you have too many worries
or you're lonely.

266
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,883
The answer for both is the same.

267
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,511
Just follow your heart.

268
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,515
Seriously, what's her deal?

269
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,269
Excuse me…

270
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,023
Gosh, she's so weird.

271
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,150
"Follow my heart"?

272
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,445
Whatever.

273
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,281
Gosh, I should just get some sleep.

274
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,041
Darn it…

275
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,962
Will you please let me get some sleep?

276
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,886
Bird, did something happen?

277
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,932
I couldn't get online for a while
because I was busy.

278
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,476
I wanted to meet you too.

279
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,395
Bird.

280
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,188
Bird.

281
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,488
No, it was nothing.
I dealt with it already.

282
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,616
You scared me. I'm glad to hear that.

283
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,494
Right. I got into the Police University.

284
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,789
Look at this brat,
he keeps talking as if we're buddies.

285
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,584
But I don't think
I can continue studying here.

286
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,502
It's not easy holding out.

287
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,090
You're giving up already
when I just congratulated you?

288
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,053
It's not that I'm giving up.

289
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,096
Someone told me to.

290
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,807
He said I'm only looking for a way to win
when I'm not capable of it.

291
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,851
Gosh, this brat.

292
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,897
Who? Are you sure he really said that?

293
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,942
Did he really say only that?

294
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,738
Before planning a strategy,

295
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,074
you should get to know more
about your unit members.

296
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,618
You're not even capable of winning,
but you're only seeking a way to win.

297
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,577
That's why it won't work.

298
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,131
You're one talented guy
when it comes to hacking.

299
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,716
It's not like you to be intimidated.

300
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,358
BIRD HAS LOGGED OUT

301
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,568
I believe that you'll do well.

302
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,337
Guys, we'll have a strategy meeting later,
so please tell everyone to gather.

303
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,091
Captain! Did you come up with a plan?

304
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,427
Kang Sun-ho.

305
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,976
Let's play fair and square tomorrow
so that no one gets hurt.

306
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,025
Of course.

307
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,613
But, Park Min-gyu,
you won't be able to defeat us tomorrow

308
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,116
if you can't make any changes.

309
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,250
Are you guys shooting a commercial?

310
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,338
Come out, everyone.
We'll begin our last drill.

311
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,341
-What?
-What's this?

312
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,509
-Wasn't it tomorrow?
-Are we doing it today?

313
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,136
-What do we do?
-Hey, what should we do?

314
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,429
-What's this?
-Sun-ho.

315
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,438
The drill was supposed
to be on tomorrow night.

316
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,608
Gosh. Why so suddenly?

317
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,739
All right. First and third unit captains,
come out.

318
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,548
The team that pulls out
the other team's flag first will win.

319
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,009
You've got an hour.

320
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:23,096
What's more important than winning
is not having any injured members.

321
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,557
Keep that in mind.

322
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,725
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

323
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,393
All right, you fools. Let's begin.

324
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,853
-Let's begin!
-Let's begin!

325
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,189
The first unit, get moving.

326
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,024
-The third unit, follow me.
-Good luck.

327
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,108
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

328
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,196
Move forward.

329
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,874
Forward.

330
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,255
The smoke shell is set.

331
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,975
-The flagman, go up.
-Yes.

332
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,184
Plant the flag.

333
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,269
Yes, sir.

334
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,779
Sun-ho, what's our strategy? Just tell me.

335
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,572
Are we striking first?

336
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,449
Or surprise attack?

337
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,910
No, we're…

338
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,833
Assemble, everyone.

339
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,501
-Assemble.
-All right.

340
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,753
Okay, let's cheer up.

341
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,090
Charge at them no matter what.
Let's get it done quickly.

342
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,883
The first unit, let's go!

343
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,176
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

344
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,344
We are…

345
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,680
going to give up.

346
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,057
What? We're going to give up?

347
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,809
-Hey, we can't give up.
-Darn it.

348
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,769
What are you talking about?

349
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,440
We won't pull out the flag.
That's our strategy.

350
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,858
Was that the strategy?

351
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,484
We won't make it
by taking the bull by the horns.

352
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,779
We will block the first unit
that'll come for our flag.

353
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,197
So no one will be able to
pull out the flag.

354
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:08,285
And if only one of us
can make it through the end…

355
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,912
That means we could get a chance
to pull out the flag.

356
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,372
-That's right.
-Right.

357
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,832
I understand your point,

358
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,043
but there must be someone
who guards the flag

359
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,627
at Min-gyu's base camp.

360
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,798
I don't think so.
I bet most of them will come down.

361
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,470
They won't feel the need to do so
because they think we're weak.

362
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,100
But we're not, you know.

363
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,394
We've also come this far.

364
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,814
So, guys. Don't be intimidated.

365
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,775
I trust you guys.

366
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,777
Sure thing.

367
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,613
It's not over until it's over.
Don't be intimidated.

368
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,490
-Sure thing.
-Of course.

369
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,699
-We can do this!
-Sure.

370
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,993
-Third unit, we can make it!
-Yes!

371
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,495
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

372
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,704
-We go!
-That little…

373
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,830
All right. Let's do this.

374
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,166
Guys, stay in your position
and be on guard.

375
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,586
We'll take them down
when they come close enough.

376
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,521
The first unit, ready.

377
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,022
The third unit, ready.

378
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,821
So can you please
make up your mind after the training?

379
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,824
Whether I deserve to stay in this school

380
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,826
or not.

381
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,956
We're all ready.

382
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:38,917
Okay.

383
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,850
How could that jerk be the unit captain?

384
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,726
"We're going to give up?"

385
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,104
He must be crazy.

386
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,314
Hey, what are you going to do?

387
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,900
I'll go there first and pull out the flag.

388
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,529
No way. They will raid us all
if we leave our position.

389
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,446
Darn it.

390
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,284
You're not coming?

391
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,287
Seong-su.

392
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,123
I don't think this is right. Don't go.

393
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,168
Make sure you don't regret it
after we fail.

394
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,336
You guys are such cowards.

395
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,057
Halt.

396
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,852
Isn't it too quiet? It's odd.

397
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,854
They must be scared to death.

398
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,023
Hey, let's get it done.

399
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,482
-Let's go!
-Darn.

400
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,902
My gosh.

401
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,724
Five died in the first unit.

402
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,226
Eight died in the first unit.

403
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,561
Five died in the third unit.

404
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,814
What's gotten into that foolish captain?

405
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,201
Sun-ho, I think our strategy is working,

406
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,577
just like you said.

407
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,955
-Hey, we're going to win.
-Right.

408
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,584
Hey! Goodness.

409
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,129
-My gosh.
-Gosh, he's our member.

410
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,673
He approached us so suddenly.

411
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,299
Hey, why are you here anyway?

412
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,010
Seong-su went in alone
to pull out the flag.

413
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,263
I tried to stop him,
but I couldn't. Sorry.

414
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,681
-What?
-What?

415
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,391
My gosh. Just now?

416
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,978
You should've stayed there at least.

417
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,523
Are you telling me
that no one's guarding that point?

418
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,235
What do we do, Captain? Hey, Captain.

419
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,778
Sun-ho. What do we do?

420
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,453
-What should we do?
-My gosh.

421
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,540
We need to guard our flag,
so let's go back to the base camp.

422
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,208
I'll stay and cover from here. Retreat.

423
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,918
-Everyone, retreat.
-Retreat.

424
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,045
-Everyone, charge.
-Charge.

425
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,363
What do we do now, Sun-ho?

426
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,366
Sun-ho. Captain!

427
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,336
I will prove it by leading my unit
to a victory at the last training.

428
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,046
And if I can't still prove it to you then,

429
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,467
I will withdraw
without making any excuses.

430
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,429
What's more important than winning
is not having any injured members.

431
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,514
Keep that in mind.

432
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,599
Sun-ho!

433
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,067
Kyeong-hun, at ten o'clock.
At two o'clock.

434
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,279
Guys.

435
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,532
For now, we have to make sure
none of us gets hurt.

436
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,202
-Let's guard here right now.
-Got it.

437
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,537
-Joon-wuk, at 11 o'clock.
-At 11 o'clock.

438
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,872
-At three o'clock.
-Okay.

439
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,094
Beom-tae, magazine!

440
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,559
Beom-tae!

441
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,610
Hey! Are you okay?

442
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,655
-Are you all right?
-Sun-ho.

443
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,032
It hurts.

444
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,243
You both did great.
Let me handle the rest.

445
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,121
-We're counting on you.
-Guys! Charge!

446
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,455
Charge!

447
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,928
-Third unit, four out.
-First unit, six out.

448
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,704
First unit, one out.

449
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,279
What happened?

450
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,327
Everyone's dead in the first unit.

451
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,079
Third unit is the winner.

452
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,705
-We won?
-Did she say "third unit"?

453
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,290
-We won?
-For real?

454
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,000
-How did this happen?
-We won!

455
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,877
-What happened?
-Did we really win?

456
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,552
-We won!
-Hold on, guys.

457
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,346
Who was it that shot the paintball
at the end?

458
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,891
-What?
-Who cares? We won, Sun-ho!

459
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,228
-We won!
-We won!

460
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,939
-We won!
-Yes!

461
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,988
Hey!

462
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,994
You punks. Be quiet!

463
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,663
STAFF ONLY

464
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,792
-Don't worry.
-Please take good care of him.

465
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,228
How is Seong-su?

466
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,106
We'll have to see
how he recovers after the surgery.

467
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,610
-Hey.
-I will…

468
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,155
drop out.

469
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,077
You were right, Professor.

470
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,414
I'm clearly underqualified,
but I tried to hold out.

471
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,252
And I was arrogant
because I didn't know my place.

472
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,547
I was clueless.

473
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,260
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,099
Sit down.

475
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,352
Come on, sit down.
Let me have a look at your leg.

476
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:09,320
I asked the nurse to get me
these supplies.

477
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,405
Hey.

478
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,032
I can dress your wound.

479
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,200
Hang on.

480
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,832
Goodness.

481
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,296
Hey, are you okay?

482
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,381
Yes.

483
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,470
My goodness.

484
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,267
Was it about five years ago?

485
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:45,106
When I had to arrest a dirtbag in Incheon,
I got so carried away

486
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,985
that I ignored my colleague's injury
and chased him by myself.

487
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,739
I still regret it every day.

488
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,867
Had I managed to keep my cool,

489
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,953
my colleague
would have never been stabbed.

490
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:05,168
Hey, the lesson here is that…

491
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,962
Don't think that you always
have to look straight ahead.

492
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,340
It's okay to turn around
once in a while, all right?

493
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,344
It's okay to make mistakes
when you're still in school.

494
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,931
Learn from them and don't repeat
the same mistakes out in the field.

495
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,729
And no one won or lost
in today's training.

496
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,909
EMERGENCY

497
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,840
That brat. At least he understood
what I said earlier.

498
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,221
What's he doing?

499
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,223
That's cheating!

500
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,203
Yes, Yu Dong-man speaking.

501
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,554
-You jerks!
-Hey, what are you doing?

502
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,264
-Come on out, jerks!
-Sir.

503
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,557
-My gosh!
-I'll kill you all.

504
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,394
-Sir!
-Hey!

505
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,979
-Stop.
-Please calm down.

506
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,274
What did I do so wrong?
Why must I put up with this?

507
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,775
I'm warning you. Put that down.

508
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,403
You wish. No! I don't want to!

509
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,821
-Hey.
-Calm down.

510
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,490
-Calm down, please.
-I'm going to slit my wrist!

511
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,997
Don't come near me! Hey!

512
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,625
Stay away, you jerks!

513
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,043
-Get lost!
-Please calm down!

514
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,714
-Go!
-Hey!

515
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,009
Hey, do you want to die?

516
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,011
Sir, please. Don't do this.

517
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,930
Don't tell me what I can or can't do.
Who do you think you are?

518
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,517
Clearly, we're the police
who are here to serve and protect.

519
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,188
Goodness, that's dangerous.

520
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,068
Let the kid go. Come here.

521
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:40,907
Hold on a second.

522
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,161
Looks like we need to get him treated
before arresting him.

523
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,039
-Hand him over.
-Yes, sir.

524
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,999
What's your deal?

525
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,168
-Sir.
-Yes.

526
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,045
Behave yourself and get it treated.

527
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,881
When you sober up a little,
we'll get your statement.

528
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,176
You're in the wrong.

529
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:03,137
Don't blame the alcohol. This is all you.

530
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,182
But even if you're
the biggest scumbag on the planet,

531
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,226
we need to get you treated
when you're hurt.

532
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,228
As police officers,
that's what we must do.

533
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,440
So be quiet
and just get that treated, okay?

534
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,317
Good.

535
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,947
Wait.

536
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,950
Who are you?

537
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,701
-Me?
-Yes.

538
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,707
I'm a professor at the Police University.

539
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,794
And you?

540
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,504
He is…

541
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,841
a freshman at the Police University.

542
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,979
-Well done.
-How did he calm him down?

543
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,152
I wonder what's going on.

544
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,666
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

545
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:17,545
Goodness, look at your faces.

546
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,463
You all look scared white.

547
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:24,218
The goal of our last training session
was not to win a flag

548
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,180
but to see how you trust
and follow your unit members.

549
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,100
Although it was a complete mess.

550
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,563
You should never forget
what you experienced today.

551
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,190
That way, you'll become a police officer

552
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,652
who can protect your fellow officer
at the scene.

553
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,196
From now on,

554
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,284
I'll watch how you'll change
from the mess you are.

555
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,120
-What happened?
-What is he saying?

556
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,456
-Didn't we fail?
-What?

557
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,790
What is he saying?

558
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,210
That means you all passed, you airheads.

559
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,894
-Be quiet!
-My goodness.

560
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,147
Hey!

561
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,943
Good work, everyone.

562
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,029
Tonight,

563
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,698
-you can have late-night snacks.
-Yes! Snacks!

564
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,991
BARBECUE PORK

565
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,454
-Yes!
-We made it.

566
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,791
Sun-ho, I'm so relieved.

567
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,126
-Good work, Joon-wuk.
-Goodness.

568
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,087
-Let me join you guys!
-Sure.

569
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,590
Sun-ho, how did it go
with Seong-su? Is he okay?

570
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,635
The surgery went well.
He'll get discharged soon and return.

571
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,805
-I'm so relieved.
-We made it!

572
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,682
I'm so happy!

573
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,200
I'll tell you who it is

574
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,119
once we're admitted officially.

575
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,163
Then I should be
rooting for your unit too.

576
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,805
Did you always like baseball?

577
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,229
Congratulations. I hope we'll get along.

578
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,108
Okay.

579
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,652
Congratulations to you too.

580
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,655
About that misunderstanding I had…

581
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,574
Let me apologize. I'm sorry.

582
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,244
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

583
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,705
I actually came to this school

584
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,416
because of you.

585
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,546
It's you.

586
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,148
Captain! Come join us.

587
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,484
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

588
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,161
Hold on, Kang Sun-ho.

589
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,499
As you said, I think
I should do my best from now on.

590
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,084
Congratulations on your victory.

591
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,048
And no one won or lost
in today's training.

592
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:50,925
I was told

593
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,761
there's no winner or loser today.

594
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,055
Congratulations on getting accepted.

595
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:09,235
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

596
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,038
You look amazing.

597
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,917
Excuse me, do you know where Beom-tae is?

598
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,877
-Are you Beom-tae's father?
-Yes.

599
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,881
Hello, sir. I'm Beom-tae's
closest friend, Jo Joon-wuk.

600
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,550
-Hello.
-Beom-tae!

601
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,842
-Yes?
-Your father is here.

602
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,177
-Beom-tae!
-Dad!

603
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,804
He's my dad.

604
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,806
Congratulations.

605
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,184
Dad!

606
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,188
-You're here.
-Hey.

607
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,107
Hold on, Dad.

608
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,613
My, the uniform suits you so well.

609
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,199
My son, you look so good.

610
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,786
Well done, Sun-ho.

611
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,290
Thank you for everything, Dad.

612
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,462
The ceremony will start soon.

613
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,132
Everyone, please take your seat.

614
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,844
Freshmen, please wait in your seats.

615
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,346
I'll sit over there, so hurry up
and go to your seat.

616
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,890
-Okay. I'll see you later, Dad.
-Okay. Go.

617
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:42,036
You were assigned a position here
because of that incident, right?

618
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,998
No, not exactly.

619
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,878
I'm so sorry for what happened.

620
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,799
I saw Sun-ho's personal profile.

621
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,886
You must've gone through a lot.

622
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,682
He's still young, so he can make mistakes.

623
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,895
I know that he's doing really well,
so everything is fine.

624
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,065
Also, I'll make sure to guide him

625
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,443
to become a good police officer,
so don't worry.

626
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,155
Thank you, Detective.

627
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,948
No, I mean, Professor.

628
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,743
Thank you so much.

629
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,874
Freshmen, I welcome you all.

630
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,711
On top of legal and academic knowledge,

631
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,131
I sincerely hope
that you'll become officers

632
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,759
with an upright character
and excellent leadership

633
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,638
so that you can communicate
with the citizens and relate to them.

634
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,181
I will root for all of you.

635
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,771
Salute to the president.

636
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,482
Salute to the president.

637
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,942
-Salute!

638
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,984

-Freshman oath.

643
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,502
As I join the Police University…

00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,422
-As I join the Police University…
-As I join the Police University…

00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,965

About-face!

656

Salute to your parents.

657
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,421
Salute to your parents.

00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,881

POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

660
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,751
Hey, Detective Joo.

661
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,714
Captain!

662
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,383
Who called that punk?

663
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,551
Detective Joo.

664
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,763
I heard you got a lead on the jerks
who run the illegal gambling site.

665
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,889
What about it?

666
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,099
Did you track down
the cryptocurrency exchange?

667
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,226
Did you track down
their cryptocurrency transactions?

668
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,686
You brat. Yu Dong-man!

669
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,812
Come on, Captain.

670
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,441
I told you I have to catch those jerks.

671
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:03,403
You don't belong here.

672
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,073
You're now a professor
at the Police University,

673
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,576
which means this case
is no longer your business.

674
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,454
Forget it! I can look into it myself.

675
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,665
Why are you being like this, seriously?

676
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,416
Of all the countless
gambling rings out there,

677
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,920
why waste all your time and money
on them and destroy your own career?

678
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,422
Why are you doing this?
What is your reason?

679
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,930
Why do I need a reason
to catch criminals when I'm a cop?

680
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,436
-Hey.
-Hey, where are you?

681
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,817
They'll no longer give me updates
on the investigation,

682
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,527
so I need you to keep me updated.

683
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,655
Just return to the precinct.

684
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,907
Hey, seriously! They won't take me back.

685
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,826
Are you going to stay at the university?

686
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,995
-Yes.
-To get Yoon's help?

687
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,580
-No.
-Why not?

688
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:59,876
You fool. I taught him
that he must always follow the rules.

689
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,504
So how can I make him
illegally hack the site again

690
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,590
just so I can catch those scumbags?

691
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,883
That will make me a hypocrite. Am I wrong?

692
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,886
Hey, don't you worry about a thing.

693
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,513
The only change is where I'm at.

694
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,057
Nothing else changes.
I'll continue to track them down.

695
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,769
I'll catch them with my own hands
and return to the precinct,

696
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,564
so just make sure you keep me updated

697
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,065
with the investigation, okay?

698
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,860
It's easier said than done.

699
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,653
Gosh, you little…

700
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,824
I'm cutting you some slack because
I still feel bad for chasing that dirtbag

701
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,409
when you were hurt.

702
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,670
Right, I'm well aware. That day,

703
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,257
you said you'd always be right behind me.

704
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,969
Hey, a year will fly by in no time.

705
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,056
Goodness.

706
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,892
It still hurts on rainy days.

707
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,727
And I still turn around in panic mode,

708
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,313
thinking someone might attack me
from behind. So please

709
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,899
don't leave me alone.

710
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,654
Hey, what's with you today?
Are you already drunk?

711
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,865
Forget it. I will just
have to die at the very worst.

712
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,494
Gosh, don't make such ominous remarks.

713
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,703
Right.

714
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:21,375
Your hunch was right.
Yesterday, I got a call from…

715
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,710
-Where are you going?
-The restroom.

716
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,004
That little…

717
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,679
HOW CAN YOU SEND DONG-MAN HERE
WHO'S BEEN AFTER US?

718
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,013
TAKE CARE OF HIM TODAY

719
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,241
You're acting strange these days.
Is something up?

720
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,743
Hey, hold on.

721
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,625
This guy is a cop,
so make sure you don't speed.

722
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,876
-Okay.
-Great.

723
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,087
Get going.

724
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,516
NO CALLER ID

725
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,148
Yes.

726
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,692
Right.

727
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,031
If we rush this, things might go south.

728
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,617
Let's give it some more time.

729
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,253
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

730
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,130
The orientation will end this week,

731
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,258
so please thoroughly prepare
for everything.

732
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,802
Yes, sure thing.

733
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,016
-You're teaching the first class.
-Yes.

734
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,478
Go easy on them.
Don't scare them off right away.

735
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,646
Well, then let's wrap up the meeting here.

736
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,566
-Just a moment.
-Yes, Professor Yu.

737
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,569
What do I need to prepare
for the orientation?

738
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:18,325
Just nail down the direction
of your course for the whole year.

739
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,493
I see.

740
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,411
-One more question.
-Sure.

741
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,996
When's my turn?

742
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:29,127
I'm sure the schedule
has been emailed to you already.

743
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:34,633
I see. I haven't checked my email yet.
Well, I'll be off then.

744
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:44,559
Detective Yu is finally
becoming a real professor.

745
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,523
-Hello.
-Hello.

746
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,274
-Hello.
-Hi.

747
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,740
-Do a good job.
-Pardon me?

748
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,494
I said, do a good job.
I'll be watching you the whole year.

749
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,748
-Yes, sir.
-What's with that smirk? You punk.

750
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,845
I am Professor Kwon Hyuk-phil, who will be
teaching the Constitutional Law course.

751
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,514
You'll get an F if you're late twice,
miss even just one class,

752
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,432
or fail to hand in any of the assignments.

753
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,644
You cannot request a grade change.
There will be no exceptions.

754
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:33,066
You get an F twice,
and you'll be expelled.

755
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,778
Since this is our first orientation,

756
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,573
let's talk about the police and civilians.

757
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,327
LABOR UNION PROTEST CASE, YEAR 2018

758
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,455
This is the labor union
protest case from 2018.

759
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,665
Anyone familiar with it?

760
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,880
Yes.

761
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,091
After a long-standing confrontation
between the police and protesters,

762
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,845
four of the protesters got injured,
and all of them were arrested.

763
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,722
The police's abuse of power

764
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,016
against innocent civilians

765
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,934
was heavily criticized.

766
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,604
It's a very famous case.

767
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,939
Can anyone tell us more about it?

768
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,609
Yes.

769
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:21,281
This specific protest
was done in an ambush style.

770
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,618
The police ordered protesters
to disperse three times, but they refused.

771
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,537
The protesters' actions
threatened public order.

772
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,875
I believe the police handled it
appropriately within the law.

773
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,627
My gosh, he's good.

774
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,629
All right. Does anyone think differently?

775
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,970
Kang Sun-ho,
why don't you tell us what you think?

776
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,941
Hold on a second.

777
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,527
Looks like we need to get him treated
before arresting him.

778
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,322
Before taking them down…

779
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,368
I mean, protection should've been
the police's priority over the arrest.

780
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,913
Protesters are also civilians
whom we must protect.

781
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,920
All right. Then here's another example.

782
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,090
A police car transporting
an apprehended murder suspect

783
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,174
got into an accident.

784
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:26,680
The murder suspect was critically injured
and eventually died.

785
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,183
His family demanded compensation
from the government,

786
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,435
insisting that the incident occurred
while on official duty.

787
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,855
And the court ordered
that the bereaved be compensated.

788
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,736
His indictment was terminated,

789
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:46,616
and the officer who caused the accident
was dismissed and punished.

790
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,660
Kang Sun-ho,

791
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,579
who do you think was "protected"
in this case?

792
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,916
The murder suspect? The police?

793
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,794
The bereaved now
that the case can't be indicted?

794
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,594
-That's…
-No.

795
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,722
I want Kang Sun-ho
to answer this question.

796
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,557
It's…

797
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:16,688
Didn't you say just now
that the police must protect everyone?

798
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,775
Did you come to this school
without even considering these things?

799
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,445
Or, do you not care at all?

800
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,655
Answer me.

801
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,414
I apologize.

802
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,416
I'm not sure.

803
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,792
These two things are

804
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,211
never allowed in my classes.

805
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,089
Not answering

806
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,885
and giving an answer
that you can't back up.

807
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,721
That's it for today.

808
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,937
Are you all right, Sun-ho?

809
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,490
That was so scary.

810
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:14,079
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

811
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,334
ORGANIZATION CHART

812
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,714
CYBERCRIME, CHIEF HAN JEONG-SIK

813
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,676
Yu Dong-man speaking.

814
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,137
Hey, it's me. Chief Han Jeong-sik.

815
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,723
Why don't you cancel
your transfer to the university

816
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,308
and just go to Seocho Police Station?

817
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,477
Their Violent Crimes Unit
is short-staffed.

818
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,229
Why?

819
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:45,151
Well, Captain Choi asked me
to send you there.

820
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,530
We don't need you back here,
so stop calling me.

821
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,533
There's something.

822
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,787
There's definitely something…

823
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,166
What could it be? Darn it.

824
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,087
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

825
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,966
Gosh, that punk, Cheol-jin.

826
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,593
He said his scar hurts when it rains.

827
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,430
HOW CAN YOU SEND DONG-MAN HERE
WHO'S BEEN AFTER US?

828
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,515
TAKE CARE OF HIM TODAY

829
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,434
IF YOU DON'T STOP HIM, IT'S OVER FOR YOU

830
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,773
MY ONE AND ONLY SUPERVISOR

831
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,485
MY ONE AND ONLY SUPERVISOR

832
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,869
-What?
-You rude punk.

833
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:40,206
Hey, do you want to have pork belly
since it's raining?

834
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,167
What does rain have to do with pork?

835
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,918
How are they not related?

836
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,796
When your scar hurts,
you should have some meat.

837
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,762
-Dong-man.
-What is it?

838
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,265
Why do you sound so down? What is it?

839
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,058
You won't give up, right?

840
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,687
Give up what? What are you talking about?

841
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,651
You'll never give up
on going after those jerks, will you?

842
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,905
Gosh, don't you know me?

843
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,908
Where are you?

844
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,285
Did you drink?
Do you want me to pick you up?

845
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,125
The jerks running the illegal site
you're after…

846
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,674
They are the Police University's…

847
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,144
Hey, Cheol-jin.

848
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,730
Cheol-jin. Park Cheol-jin!

849
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,898
Cheol-jin!

850
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,321
I MUST

851
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,326
PROTECT EVERYONE

852
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,630
I BELIEVE THAT YOU'LL DO WELL
BIRD HAS LOGGED OUT

853
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,756
He's not here.

854
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,470
Why don't we meet up?

855
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,596
Yes.

856
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,141
I will do it…

857
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,533
-Professor Yu.
-Kang Sun-ho.

858
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,701
Yes, sir.

859
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:43,121
You said you'd do anything for me
if I helped you out, right?

860
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,291
-Help me.
-Pardon?

861
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:47,875
Help me…

862
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,170
so that I can catch those jerks.

863
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,258
-What are you talking…
-With your hacking skills,

864
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,969
we can catch those jerks.

865
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,722
Yoon.

866
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,684
"Yoon"?

867
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,065
Are you…

868
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,818
That's right. I am…

869
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,364
Bird.

870
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,450
What?

871
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,031
Something must be going on
with Kang-hui and Sun-ho.

872
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,949
I knew it. Like attracts like.

873
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,243
Kang-hui's mother
was convicted four times.

874
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,496
How could the daughter of a criminal
become a police officer?

875
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,665
Those jerks involved
in the illegal gambling site.

876
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,917
I think they're at our university!

877
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,711
This is the last piece of advice.
Leave without causing any trouble.

878
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,129

01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,881
I can't guarantee that.

880
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,300
If I help you,
does that make hacking legal?

881
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,177
Those damn bastards.

882
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,139
I'll catch them
and make them pay for this!
