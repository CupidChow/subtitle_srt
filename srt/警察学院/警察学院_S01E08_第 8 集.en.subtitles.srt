LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,587
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,427
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,016
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,185
Jeez. Fine, I'm coming.

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,312
-Damn you.
-Shut it.

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,733
4 YEARS AGO

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,027
Is it the dirtbag in Incheon?

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,278
I'll go with you.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,196
Go away, punk. You're so annoying.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,407
What are you going to do all by yourself?

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,367
Don't you know that
the award ceremony is tomorrow?

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,495
And it's been a year since I joined
Crime Investigation Team One.

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,872
I'm your partner.

16
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,250
Partner, my foot. Give me a break.

17
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,668
Go away.

18
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,672
I'll show you
that I deserve to be called your partner.

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,051
Gosh, seriously…

20
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,596
Stop, you jerk!

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,516
-Hey!
-Stop right there!

22
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,823
I told you not to follow me!

23
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,242
-Damn it!
-Jeez.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,125
Damn it.

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,045
Step back.

26
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,485
Darn it. Where did he go?

27
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,977
No!

28
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,484
Cheol-jin!

29
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,032
That crazy scum!

30
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,788
Let go!

31
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,832
Let go of me, you jerk!

32
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,208
Cheol-jin!

33
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,423
I said, let go of me, you jerk!

34
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,633
I'll never let you go!

35
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,136
Dong-man!

36
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,651
Over there!

37
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,327
I'm sorry I left you behind.

38
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,704
I'm supposed to be your partner.

39
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,457
You don't have to be sorry.

40
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,838
Now that I have a stab wound,

41
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,465
it's kind of cool,

42
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,176
but it was really scary.

43
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,680
How will I ever
go after a suspect alone at night?

44
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,308
You will never go out alone, you punk.

45
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:51,856
From now, I'll always be behind you,
so don't be scared.

46
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,401
Darn it.

47
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,446
Darn it.

48
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,825
My gosh…

49
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,669
Dong-man.

50
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,512
The fingerprints on this laptop

51
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,265
weren't found on this remote control
you brought

52
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,601
but on this plastic cup.

53
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,688
Professor Yu.

54
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,369
I can't stop working on this case.

55
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,205
No. I won't.

56
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,417
You said the culprit is here.

57
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,504
How did you…

58
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,755
I must…

59
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,300
catch the culprit at all costs.

60
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,634
So that

61
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,429
I can protect

62
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,223
the people I love.

63
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,353
I've made up my mind,

64
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,397
so you should decide.

65
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,941
I must…

66
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,320
see the end of this case.

67
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,406
Dong-man.

68
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,632
DEFENSIVE TACTICS

69
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,096
It looks like he's back…

70
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,392
Where's Sun-ho?
Is he at the library to save our seats?

71
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,520
Everyone is there
because our finals started.

72
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,690
Who are you? Do you know me?

73
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,985
I'm here to see my friend, Sun-ho.

74
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,487
-Please leave.
-I'm leaving!

75
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,863
-Go!
-Come on!

76
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,450
Sun-ho!

77
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,539
Hi.

78
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,167
Wait. That seat is reserved.

79
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,669
Sorry.

80
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,552
Where did he go to have it out
with the professor?

81
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,658
Why are you drinking so much?
Do you want to get drunk?

82
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,118
My gosh.

83
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,967
You go first.

84
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,760
Sorry?

85
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,598
Go ahead and explain
why you think he's the culprit.

86
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,310
What? What are you talking about?
Are you calling me the culprit?

87
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,698
I finished analyzing
Mr. Park's communications data.

88
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,491
What?

89
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,245
When a burner phone
that got a signal from a cell site

90
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,664
near our school called Mr. Park's phone,

91
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:41,127
his phone picked up a signal
from the same cell site a few hours later.

92
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,462
Several times.

93
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,216
So?

94
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,218
That means the owner
of the burner phone called him,

95
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,095
and he came to the school.

96
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,017
The calls, travel route,
and the same cell site.

97
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,936
I kept seeing the same pattern.

98
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,022
What nonsense are you spewing, you punk?

99
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,774
Hey! This is unbelievable.

100
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,865
Are you certain of the causality?

101
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,117
Are you sure that's all there is?

102
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,955
Wasn't there a case where I called him,
and he came over to the school?

103
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,418
Your speculation lacks basis.

104
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,632
But that doesn't mean that it's not true.

105
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,679
Why did you come to our school

106
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,307
when Professor Yu didn't call you?

107
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,900
Why is this jerk talking nonsense?

108
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,196
Dong-man, it's not me.
Why would I do something like that?

109
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,782
Shut your mouth and follow me.

110
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,791
Why that little…

111
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,768
Dong-man, you don't believe him, do you?

112
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,273
Dong-man. Say something!

113
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,946
Why did you touch Sun-ho's laptop?

114
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,287
Dong-man.

115
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,789
You mean the one on his desk?

116
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,457
I just took a look because I got curious.

117
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,377
What about you?

118
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,338
Why are you looking into
my communications data?

119
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,757
What are you accusing me of?

120
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,760
We don't know if you were injured
while carrying out a sting operation

121
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,305
or if you're just putting on a show

122
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,725
because you're working for those jerks.

123
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,059
Are you serious?

124
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:08,357
We don't know if you touched his laptop
to dig something up from it or not!

125
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,156
Is that really what you think?

126
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,951
I've been working
as your partner for six years,

127
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,494
and I even got stabbed!

128
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,083
That's why I know you well.

129
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,837
I know the face you make when you lie.

130
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,220
Just go, Cheol-jin.

131
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,809
Sir, can you make a U-turn?

132
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,704
Do I make a U-turn or not?

133
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,958
Mr. Park Cheol-jin.

134
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,466
You were in my car last time too.

135
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,969
I can't do this.

136
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,597
I want to stop here.

137
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,269
This is too much.

138
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,354
Seriously.

139
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,276
Sir, please stop the car.

140
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,573
I can see that you remember it.

141
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,828
He will call you.

142
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,136
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

143
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,680
Are you almost done
with submitting the exam papers?

144
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,224
Yes, except for the Investigation Studies.

145
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,476
I see.

146
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:53,647
Professor Yu, you must upload them
to the cloud by tomorrow night.

147
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,194
Professor Yu?

148
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,863
-What?
-The exam papers.

149
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,950
Right. I got it.

150
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,746
Okay, then. Let's wrap it up here.

151
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,415
-Okay.
-Good job, everyone.

152
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,710
Do you want to go for a drive
after submitting them tomorrow?

153
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,669
Where to?

154
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,924
You know. Misa-ri or Yangsu-ri.
Anywhere that ends with "ri".

155
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,258
Why would you go there?

156
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,885
It's dark, narrow, and accident-prone.

157
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,470
That's why we're going there.

158
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,680
It's dark and narrow,
and I'm hoping for some accidents there.

159
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,354
What happened? Did he just turn me down?

160
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,156
Gosh, the deadly exams are coming up.

161
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,158
I already messed up my mid-terms,

162
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,536
so I'm dead if I mess it up again
in the finals.

163
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,121
Right, you're dead already.

164
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,581
No, I'm not.

165
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,438
How is it going with studying?
Want some coffee?

166
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,030
Here you go.

167
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,077
So, did things go well with Professor Yu?

168
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,164
Not yet. I think he needs more time.

169
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,918
But I'm sure he'll be fine soon.

170
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,338
From what I know, he's always like that.

171
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,049
I thought you were
just investigating together,

172
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,509
but I guess you guys got close too.

173
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,428
We always fight.

174
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,138
That means you guys are close.

175
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,266
If not, why would you even fight?
You'd just ignore each other.

176
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,480
So when are you going to tell me about
that investigation you're doing with him?

177
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,566
Well…

178
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,362
We haven't had it out yet.

179
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,949
-I'm sorry.
-What's there to be?

180
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,913
And I'm going to
have it out with you after him.

181
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,416
It's about time we have it out
and decide what we are.

182
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:26,675
Hey, I'm not asking
because I want to have it out with you.

183
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,637
I was curious since it seemed like
it was related to my mom.

184
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,438
What? Why are you smiling now?

185
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,360
I don't think now's the time for this.
Let's go. I'll finish it off.

186
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,196
What do you mean by that?

187
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,906
Hey, Kang Sun-ho!

188
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,956
INVESTIGATION STUDIES EXAM

189
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,383
Sir, are you available now?

190
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,259
How long have you known?

191
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,888
How long have you known that
the culprit is in the Police University?

192
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,475
After the sports festival.

193
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,855
I heard you talking with Mr. Park.

194
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,939
You punk.

195
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,692
Why would you eavesdrop
on grown-ups talking?

196
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,194
Why didn't you tell me about it?

197
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,655
I wasn't so sure about it.

198
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,867
It could've just confused
the investigation.

199
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,910
Still, we even found the bug.

200
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,704
Isn't that clear enough?

201
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,708
Nothing is ever clear enough.
You've never done a proper investigation.

202
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,215
We first went after
the illegal gambling ring.

203
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,302
Whether they are
in the Police University or not,

204
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,220
they are close to us. That's a fact.

205
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,767
If Cheol-jin is the culprit,

206
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,019
don't you think we should investigate

207
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,772
how deep he is involved,

208
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,316
and who is hiding behind him?

209
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,908
So that means you're going to do it right.

210
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,119
You won't back off no matter what, right?

211
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,585
Did you even hear what I said?

212
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,797
Of course I won't back off.

213
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,507
What do you want me to say?

214
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,053
You can't avoid it even if you want to.

215
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,305
Nothing will change if I stop.

216
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,475
I should at least keep going
to get something out of it, right?

217
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,564
I don't know what's at the end
of this investigation,

218
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,650
but we'll see when we get there.

219
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,865
I'll stop him from doing anything.

220
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,284
I'll do whatever I can

221
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,663
to stop him from investigating.

222
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,374
I'll get it done this time.

223
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,836
If you give me one last chance…

224
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,034
YU DONG-MAN

225
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,143
Why did I choose
to become a police officer?

226
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,479
Tell me about it. If we mess up the exams

227
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,024
and fail to graduate,
we won't be able to become one anyway.

228
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,028
Gosh, study more
instead of worrying about it.

229
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,654
-I can't focus on studying.
-Guys.

230
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,199
Do you know what this is?

231
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,826
-What is this?
-What's that?

232
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,038
-Goodness!
-Why?

233
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,500
The legendary graduate, who got
straight-As in every class for four years,

234
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,002
is now at the main office,

235
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,005
so-called the next commissioner.
Do you know him?

236
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,673
-Of course I know.
-This is…

237
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,885
These are the sample questions
that he used to study.

238
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,303
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

239
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,223
-How much for a page?
-Give your price first.

240
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,475
There won't be any negotiations, right?

241
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,646
Guys, we're at the Police University.

242
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,231
If you get into something speculative…

243
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,483
-Fried chicken.
-Okay, fried chicken.

244
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,444
And pizza.

245
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,655
-Pizza?
-And beer.

246
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,907
Beer?

247
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,866
I'm not in.

248
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,745
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'll be off.

249
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,789
-And a blind date.
-Really? Blind date?

250
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,915
And the blind date expenses.

251
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,333
-Are you sure?
-Yes, totally.

252
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,785
Stop staring at me
and read your book, will you?

253
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,578
Okay.

254
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,380
Right, did the talk
with your professor go well?

255
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,843
I did talk to him but…

256
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,306
Sorry.

257
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,603
Just until the exams are over.

258
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,522
After that,

259
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,567
you'll have to tell me everything.

260
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,653
Okay, I will.

261
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,948
Try to focus again.

262
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,491
Okay.

263
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,343
Hey, Min-gyu. Did you see this?

264
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,099
Give it back when you're done.

265
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,738
Mr. Park Cheol-jin seemed
to have regained his memory.

266
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,782
You didn't know?

267
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,722
CHEOL-JIN

268
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,524
PROFESSOR BAEK

269
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,361
-Hello?
-Professor Yu.

270
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,490
I got a report from a student.

271
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,995
It says that the sample questions
going around the students seem to be

272
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,997
the exam paper for Investigation Studies.

273
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,676
Professor Yu, is it true?

274
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,012
Is it the exam paper for the finals?

275
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,389
Yes, it is.

276
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,099
How did this get out?

277
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,896
The exam for Investigation Studies
hasn't been uploaded yet though.

278
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,900
Did you print a copy of it by any chance?

279
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,405
Yes, I printed a copy last night
to do a final check.

280
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,199
Then do you remember
if anyone visited your office

281
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,577
after you finished writing
all the exam questions?

282
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,583
First, let's check the CCTV footage

283
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,335
-from the camera in the hallway.
-Okay.

284
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,713
Yes, Mr. Hyun.

285
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,594
Professor Yu, can I have a word with you?

286
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,932
The sample questions
you were looking at this morning?

287
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,894
Yes. Apparently, they were
for our Investigation Studies exam.

288
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,313
I guess they were leaked somehow.

289
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,232
Where's Professor Yu?

290
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,028
It's been reported
to Asan Police Station as well.

291
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,615
They called and said their officers
are on their way now.

292
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,868
I see.

293
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,163
Let me ask you again.

294
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,083
After you completed writing
all the exam questions,

295
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,003
did anyone visit your office that night?

296
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,342
One of my students stopped by.

297
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,303
Was it Kang Sun-ho again?

298
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,766
Yes. It was Sun-ho.

299
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,810
But we just talked.
And until he left my office,

300
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,606
I was there with him the whole time.
The CCTV footage will prove it.

301
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,401
The laptop you submitted
for fingerprint analysis

302
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,862
is also his, isn't it?

303
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,661
You're not getting Sun-ho

304
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,914
involved in your private matter, are you?

305
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,420
I hope that is not the case, Professor Yu.

306
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,010
You may return to your office.

307
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,014
Yes, sir.

308
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,191
You're not getting Sun-ho

309
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,194
involved in your private matter, are you?

310
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,073
I hope that is not the case, Professor Yu.

311
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,119
Gosh, I have a headache now.

312
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,088
What is this?

313
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,599
What in the world…

314
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,439
Professor Yu Dong-man,
we're from Asan Police Station.

315
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,775
-What's that behind you?
-Nothing.

316
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,736
What is this?

317
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,702
Professor…

318
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,375
Professor.

319
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,345
Professor. Wait.

320
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,680
Say something! Please?

321
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,931
This can't be true.

322
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,143
-Professor!
-Just a moment.

323
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,733
Professor Yu can get in my car.
We'll follow you.

324
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,402
But we were told to
arrest him immediately.

325
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,239
You don't have solid evidence yet,
so it's unnecessary to do this

326
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,616
in front of the students.

327
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,618
From the tone of my voice,

328
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,745
you can tell I'll take issue
with this talk if it drags on.

329
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,039
And from the look on my face,

330
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,416
you can tell I want to wrap it up
if you got my point.

331
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,382
You know
where Asan Police Station is, right?

332
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,026
STOP

333
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,549
You didn't have to do this.

334
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,093
I said we should go for a drive.

335
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,513
Although it's bright out,
and we're driving on a wide road.

336
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,433
But there has been an accident indeed.

337
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,311
A case, not an accident.

338
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,730
It is an accident.

339
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,941
An accident that was sprung on you
out of the blue.

340
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:04,451
Did this happen
because I didn't hit the brakes?

341
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,956
I wonder if this was done to stop me

342
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,333
because I wasn't going to stop.

343
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,677
I'm not sure
if this is an appropriate analogy,

344
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,014
but there's a day
I regret the most in my whole life.

345
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,477
That day, I had an awful dream.

346
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,481
So I told my husband
to skip work for just one day

347
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,316
and go to the beach with me.

348
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,986
But he was so adamant about going to work.

349
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,240
He was like that.
Regardless of what I said,

350
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,869
he remained stubborn
and did everything his way.

351
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:54,292
If I knew we'd never be able
to go to the beach again,

352
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,670
I should've stopped him at all costs.

353
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,840
I should've done everything
I could to stop him.

354
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,468
I should've done everything, anything.

355
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,012
I regret it every day.

356
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,770
You need to stay alive

357
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,940
to forgive and make up.

358
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,904
Don't you think so?

359
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:23,298
LEE JU-WON

360
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,266
LEE JU-WON

361
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,149
He can't deny it.

362
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,735
They even found
an envelope of money in his office.

363
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,487
But I find it suspicious.

364
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,990
They found the evidence too easily.
It's strange.

365
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,199
That's true.

366
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,161
He was once called
a legend of Investigation Studies.

367
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,496
I don't think he'd have been this sloppy.

368
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,664
Exactly.

369
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,292
He doesn't seem like the type
to receive bribes either.

370
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,795
-Right?
-You never know.

371
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,882
He'll either be dismissed or fired.

372
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,510
Do you think they'll fire him?

373
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,901
So that means you're going to do it right.

374
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,362
You won't back off no matter what, right?

375
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,656
Of course I won't back off.

376
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,783
What do you want me to say?

377
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,328
Hello.

378
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,540
Sun-ho.

379
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,090
All right. Thank you.

380
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,386
They're starting his investigation now.

381
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,183
Why won't they let us see
the CCTV footage?

382
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,406
Take a careful look.

383
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,700
Someone turned the CCTV camera,

384
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,201
so it caught nothing.

385
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,621
Tell me about it.

386
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,667
Seeing how he knows the angle,
it must be someone from inside.

387
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,876
Who's your accomplice?

388
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,130
Whether it's a student or not,
you must've done this

389
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,632
so that it wouldn't catch you
accepting the ten-million-won bribe.

390
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,300
Someone from inside.

391
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,515
Professor Yu, why don't you just confess?

392
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,684
They're analyzing the footage now,

393
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,185
and the arrest warrant
will be issued soon.

394
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,565
Dong-man!

395
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,737
Gosh, why are you here?
This is humiliating.

396
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,488
You brat!

397
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,408
So you know this is humiliating?

398
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:02,790
I know you're a nutjob,
but you wouldn't do something so low.

399
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,625
You punks!

400
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,964
I know, right? Why is he doing this?

401
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,592
What did you say?

402
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,180
If he wanted to frame me,
then he should've done a better job.

403
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,186
You know who did it, don't you?
Who is it? What's this about?

404
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,315
Did he do this to stop me
from investigating any further?

405
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,194
Tell me what this is about.
It's frustrating.

406
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,073
Captain, I have a favor to ask.

407
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,576
Here, have some tea.

408
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,956
The night before the exam paper
was leaked,

409
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,168
you were with Professor Yu
in his office, right?

410
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,173
Yes, I went to talk to him for a second.

411
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,760
May I ask what it was about?

412
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,975
I was stuck
while studying Investigation Studies,

413
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,436
so I wanted to ask him.

414
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,274
Just this month alone,

415
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,403
you visited Professor Yu's office
more than ten times.

416
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,323
Were you there to ask questions
on Investigation Studies?

417
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:28,251
You shouldn't make that face
when the police ask you a question.

418
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,091
Let me see.

419
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:40,388
He was arrested without a warrant,
so Professor Yu will be detained

420
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,723
for about 36 hours.

421
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,311
If you want to prove his innocence
before he's cornered,

422
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,230
you must hurry.

423
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,361
You may leave.

424
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,113
Yes, sir.

425
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,298
You did it, didn't you?

426
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,594
Just go and study for your exams.

427
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,263
I'll make sure

428
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,767
to find evidence on you.

429
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,605
I'd love to see you try.

430
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,317
I'm not sure if a greenhorn
like you can do that though.

431
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,867
Sun-ho!

432
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,207
It's really strange though.

433
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,251
Why did the culprit share the paper
when he could've had it for himself?

434
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,087
The police are investigating it,

435
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,715
so wouldn't they find it strange too?

436
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,968
Since an envelope of money was found,

437
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,386
so they'll investigate
based on the evidence,

438
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,596
not the circumstance.

439
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,849
Then they'll miss the golden time.

440
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,559
Still, I think the police

441
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,103
will find a suspect
from the students first.

442
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,104
I think so too.

443
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,607
And that'd be me.

444
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,943
What?

445
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,945
What? It's you?

446
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,073
I went to see Professor Yu

447
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,992
in his office the night before.

448
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,706
But still, you didn't leak the paper.

449
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,999
Of course he didn't.

450
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,795
Professor Yu didn't do it either.
He's being framed.

451
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,842
I must catch the culprit.

452
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,389
Speaking of which,

453
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,977
can you guys help me?

454
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,275
Never mind. It's exam week.

455
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,194
I'll get going.

456
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,660
Kang Sun-ho!

457
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,163
What do you think you're doing?

458
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:15,084
Of course we must help you
when you're in trouble.

459
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,046
Exams? They're not important at all!

460
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,841
He's right.

461
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,969
Sun-ho, I might not be of much help,

462
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,721
but I…

463
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,015
I want to help you too.

464
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,311
You would've done the same
if this happened to me.

465
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,731
That's right, brother.
Don't underestimate us.

466
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,690
We're friends, after all.

467
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,531
You guys…

468
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,285
Hey, don't get emotional.
We're running out of time.

469
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,411
You're right.

470
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,621
Don't get emotional.
We're running out of time.

471
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,664
What shall we start with?

472
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,315
It looks like most of the kids
from our year bought the leaked paper.

473
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,234
Then Beom-tae and Joon-wuk,
start with questioning.

474
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,737
Question those
who didn't buy the paper like me,

475
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,113
or those who borrowed it.

476
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,742
And those who didn't buy it
when they're likely to do so.

477
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,245
Let's narrow down suspects
by questioning them.

478
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,874
Also, find out Dong-gu's alibi
since he sold the paper.

479
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,167
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

480
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,837
What about us?

481
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,423
We must go to the crime site first.

482
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,843
Evidence and clues
are always left at the scene.

483
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,845
Let's go.

484
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,352
They haven't caught the culprit
when there's a camera right here?

485
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:02,149
We'll find out if we can
watch the footage even just once.

486
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,152
Let's see if we can do that.

487
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,154
No.

488
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,075
Those at Asan Police Station
believe that this case

489
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,244
could have been an inside job,

490
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,703
so even the professors
aren't allowed to access it.

491
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,831
Then can we take a quick look at it here?

492
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,999
Goodness. I already said no.

493
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,876
Get out.

494
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,923
I think I saw someone fiddling
with the CCTV camera in front of

495
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,299
Professor Yu's office.

496
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,177
You saw who it was?

497
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,304
Was it a man or a woman?

498
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,475
That I don't know. It was too dark.

499
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,770
Get out. Go.

500
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,981
-Please…
-Go, get out.

501
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,944
SITUATION ROOM

502
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,323
So it's true that the CCTV caught
someone fiddling with the camera.

503
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,533
I'm impressed.

504
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,541
The other guys must've
finished their job by now. Let's go.

505
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,920
Can you let go?

506
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,923
Right.

507
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,678
Shall we?

508
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,680
-Let's go.
-Okay.

509
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,188
Dong-gu got his hands on the exam paper

510
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,607
on Monday, around midnight.

511
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,903
He found it on top of the printer
in the Dormitory copy room.

512
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,072
According to him,
that was when he printed copies of it.

513
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,953
There are seven students
who didn't buy those copies.

514
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,538
Dong-gu the seller,

515
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,290
Kang-hui, Jae-gyeong,

516
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,792
Sun-ho, Min-gyu,

517
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,171
Seong-su, and Hae-ju.

518
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:50,216
Wait. Cha Seong-su
and An Hae-ju didn't buy it?

519
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,300
Right?

520
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,971
Those two, of all people,
must have bought it.

521
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,516
What's more shocking is that

522
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,060
over 80 percent of the students
bought the copy.

523
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,686
That's right.

524
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,065
Park Dong-gu should become
a salesman, not a cop.

525
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,651
So we have two suspects.

526
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,278
I'll talk with Hae-ju.

527
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,573
Joon-wuk and Beom-tae,
you two talk with Seong-su.

528
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,034
I'll see if we can get our hands
on the CCTV footage somehow.

529
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,834
We'll be able to save Professor Yu, right?

530
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,595
Are you going to keep up
this uncooperative attitude?

531
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,765
Mr. Yu Dong-man!

532
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,892
Goodness.

533
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,634
I talked to Hae-ju.

534
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,179
She said the one who left the copy room
before her was wearing a neon watch.

535
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,639
Check Cha Seong-su's watch.

536
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,683
If it's a neon watch,
he's the one who found it first.

537
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,227
INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE, 4 MEMBERS

538
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,608
It's exam time. Shouldn't you be studying?

539
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,778
I have somewhere to be.
Let's talk another time.

540
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,363
What about me?

541
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,326
"Another time," again?

542
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,703
I…

543
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,831
I like you.

544
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,587
I don't expect you
to give me your answer now.

545
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,549
I'm just telling you how I feel.

546
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,553
Okay, I see…

547
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,306
Then let's talk another time.

548
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:11,523
THE 41ST CHUNGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL

549
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,031
WOMEN'S DORMITORY

550
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,284
Okay. Let's just talk now.

551
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,538
Min-gyu, there's someone I like.

552
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,794
I can't afford to worry
about how upset you are

553
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,214
because I'm so worried
about him right now.

554
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,299
Who is that?

555
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,886
Is it Kang Sun-ho?

556
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,764
I have to go.

557
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,236
You'd like to see the CCTV footage?

558
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,322
Yes. I know
that I'm not allowed to view it,

559
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,409
but I figured you probably can access it.

560
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,080
That's a lot to ask.

561
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,665
Right, I apologize.

562
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,501
I'm aware it's a lot to ask,
but I wanted to give it a shot.

563
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,837
Why is that?

564
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,965
Because trying is better

565
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,050
than doing nothing.

566
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,555
There are times when doing nothing
is better for your own sake.

567
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,725
I've got nothing to lose,

568
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,728
and nothing will change
if I stand still and do nothing.

569
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,980
When you're investigating a case,

570
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,733
you must keep
pushing forward to find clues.

571
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,237
That's what Professor Yu taught me.

572
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:46,326
I'm worried you'd trip and fall
if you keep pushing forward.

573
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,537
But that's not a failure.

574
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,957
Wouldn't it be a process
to learn to walk straight?

575
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,252
I still remember what you told us

576
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,630
when we went to the shooting range
for the first time.

577
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,258
You said we as police officers
must pick up guns

578
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,553
to protect and save lives, not to kill.

579
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,559
Would you hand me a bullet,

580
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,729
so I can protect Professor Yu?

581
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,079
At three o'clock. A neon watch, confirmed.

582
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,751
At eight o'clock. Also confirmed.

583
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,173
What are you guys doing?

584
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,343
No matter the angle,

585
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,346
-it is indisputably neon.
-What?

586
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:57,231
I heard the CCTV footage shows
the person who first found the exam paper.

587
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,776
Hey, what do you mean?
There are no cameras there…

588
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,947
So it was you.

589
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,545
Cha Seong-su, you have
the right to refuse to make a statement.

590
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,422
Don't move! You'll be given
a chance to explain yourself

591
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,840
and have the right to an attorney.

592
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,260
You may request the court
to review the legality of this arrest…

593
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,511
-That's not right.
-What?

594
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,888
Take it up with the Leadership Room,
not the court.

595
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,683
-Stay still.
-Let me go, you crazy jerks!

596
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,355
Hey, you'll break my arms!

597
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,997
-Hey, Beom-tae.
-Seong-su did find it first.

598
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,083
But someone was in the copy room
before he got there.

599
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,793
What?

600
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,263
Can we talk?

601
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,979
If you've got something to say,
just say it and leave.

602
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,440
I told you.

603
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,777
I will find evidence
to prove that you did it.

604
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,072
I have Cha Seong-su's statement

605
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,910
that he ran into you in the copy room
the night the exam paper got leaked.

606
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,666
Such statements or circumstantial clues
cannot serve as admissible evidence.

607
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,506
Which is why I'm planning to secure
physical evidence as well.

608
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,719
That way…

609
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,347
I can save Professor Yu,

610
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,932
your supervisor.

611
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,936
I'm going to save him.

612
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,357
Do you really think…

613
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,943
saving Dong-man from this case

614
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,238
is a good thing for him?

615
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,533
This time, it was only an exam paper.

616
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,411
Aren't you scared that something worse

617
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,872
might happen to him next?

618
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,712
No, I'm not scared.

619
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,423
That must be exactly

620
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,926
what they want.

621
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,850
Us getting scared because of this incident
and stepping back

622
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:44,106
so that we stop investigating any further.

623
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,904
Both Professor Yu and I

624
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,157
will never give those jerks
what they want.

625
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,080
Are you sure…

626
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,834
you can handle this?

627
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,338
Do you think you can stay

628
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,551
next to Dong-man until the end
without running away?

629
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,764
Yes.

630
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,237
He's better than me.

631
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,540
Have you checked on it, Captain?

632
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:47,043
Cheol-jin did withdraw ten million won.

633
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,629
What on earth is going on?

634
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,800
Did he get blackmailed or something?

635
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,888
Okay, Captain. I'll call you again.

636
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,647
Can I make another call?

637
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,447
Hello?

638
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,574
It's me.

639
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,452
We have all the witness statements,

640
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,830
but we don't have the final blow.

641
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,081
That hurt.

642
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,626
Where did Sun-ho go?

643
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,799
Let's find the last piece of evidence.

644
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,550
-What is that?
-What is it?

645
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,345
-What is that?
-What is that?

646
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,721
Did you find something?

647
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,702
Yes.

648
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,747
I have something to report.

649
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,130
Pause it.

650
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,971
What? Only his hand was caught.

651
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,474
Wait. I'm sure it's a man's hand.

652
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,935
The culprit is a male.

653
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,488
I don't think we'll be able to tell
who turned the camera.

654
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,630
What are you doing?

655
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,221
I can see something!

656
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,308
We got him!

657
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,977
Hey, but isn't he

658
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,396
the new professor?

659
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,608
He is. It's Professor Park Cheol-jin.

660
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,115
Let's go.

661
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,786
Did he get blackmailed or something?

662
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,254
Sir.

663
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:41,009
-All right.
-Let's go.

664
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,097
There are only two.

665
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,355
No!

666
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,233
It still hurts on rainy days.

667
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,069
And I still turn around in panic mode,

668
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,487
thinking someone
might attack me from behind.

669
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,113
-So please…
-I'll never let you go!

670
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,198
Cheol-jin!

671
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,783
Dong-man!

672
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,910
Don't leave me alone.

673
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,747
I'll show you
that I deserve to be called your partner.

674
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,250
My gut feeling tells me
that this case is dangerous.

675
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,420
I was appointed as a professor
at Korean National Police University.

676
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,422
-What?
-Cheol-jin asked for it,

677
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,882
saying he wants to work by your side.

678
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:25,804
From now, I'll always be behind you,
so don't be scared.

679
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,848
You will never give up, will you?

680
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:33,436
You'll never give up
on going after those jerks, will you?

681
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,700
Let's…

682
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,829
start with the report.

683
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,873
Are you serious?

684
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,882
I got the permission slip
to go out from Professor Seo.

685
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,135
The taxi is here. Let's hurry.

686
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,905
Hello. This is Seo Sang-hak.

687
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,827
What did you say?

688
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,541
Exam papers were leaked

689
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,961
right before the final exams
at Korean National Police University.

690
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,297
The cradle of justice,
Korean National Police University.

691
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,883
KCS will report thorough coverage
of the corruption case

692
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,802
that overshadows the school's philosophy.

693
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,431
It hasn't been a year since Professor Yu
was appointed to this school,

694
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,809
but he leaked the exam paper
of the subject he's teaching.

695
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:58,313
According to the Asan Police Station,
Yu denied all charges at first,

696
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:01,816
but he ended up admitting them
during the investigation.

697
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,903
Why did he admit them all of a sudden?

698
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,905
He didn't do it.

699
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,740
Sir, could you speed up a little?

700
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,741
Sure.

701
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,456
The police are suspecting him
of solicitation,

702
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,208
and they will investigate further

703
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,877
to find the illegal dealings made.

704
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,379
Im Hyeon-seok, KCS News.

705
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,685
It's still under investigation,
so we're not sure…

706
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,105
There's nothing we can say.

707
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,732
-I'm sorry.
-That's…

708
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,779
Where is Mr. Park Cheol-jin?

709
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,989
Who gave you the money?

710
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,575
I have no idea.

711
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,413
I heard I'd get paid in cash
if I handed over the exam paper.

712
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,040
I thought you wanted us
to start writing a report.

713
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,292
What is this?

714
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,002
Gosh.

715
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,729
What are you talking about?

716
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,050
Hello?

717
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,678
It's me.

718
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,766
I was wondering if you were doing okay.

719
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,189
You picked up. I guess you're fine.

720
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,484
-That's all I needed to know.
-Dong-man.

721
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,031
How can you worry about me…

722
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,827
even in this situation?

723
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,248
I told you that I'd protect you.

724
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,587
That damn promise.

725
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,715
I'm finally keeping my word, you punk.

726
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,247
I was the one

727
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,374
who leaked the exam paper.

728
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,922
What do you think you're doing?

729
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,260
You should've been the one to cuff me.

730
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,137
Hey, Park Cheol-jin!

731
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,319
I was just trying to make
some money on the side

732
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,905
but ended up coming this far.

733
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,909
Hey, you idiot!

734
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,288
You should have given up
when you found the bug.

735
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,791
What was the point of me
acting like I lost my memory?

736
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:51,212
-You just wouldn't hit the brakes.
-You jerk! Shut your mouth!

737
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,382
Senior Inspector Yu Dong-man.

738
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:56,759
My supervisor.

739
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,390
You no longer need to have my back.

740
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,061
You crazy idiot!

741
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,370
I didn't get into this school
to learn from some jerk like Yu Dong-man.

742
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,080
Who is the student
that tipped off the press?

743
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,540
If you did it because of me,
don't do it ever again.

744
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,085
-How dare he touch her?
-She smiled.

745
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,252
Don't smile for him!

746
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,504
So you're innocent, right?

747
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:18,049
If this turns out to be a lie,
I will cut all ties with you.

748
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,718
I want to investigate the case with you.

749
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,221
And I like you, Kang Sun-ho.

750
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,974
What you saw and learned
isn't a proper way to do things,

751
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,102
-so forget all about it.
-No, I don't want to.

752
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,562
I went through hoops to learn them.
Why should I forget them?

753
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,689
Okay. I will.

754
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,274
The burner phone is on.

755
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,151
So it was you?
