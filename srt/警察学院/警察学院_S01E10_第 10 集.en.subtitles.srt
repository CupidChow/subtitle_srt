1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:07,674
LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,594
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,306
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

4
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,820
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,636
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,348
This is Yu Dong-man.

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,187
You once asked me this.

8
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,316
Whether I'll be a professor
or a detective.

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,026
And that I'll need to choose one.

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,280
Honestly, I thought being a professor

11
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,699
wasn't a bad option.

12
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,580
But I was learning more from the kids.

13
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,707
It was embarrassing.

14
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,629
I thought it'd be better

15
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,633
to catch the bad guys who are below me

16
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,469
than to learn from the kids
who are better than me.

17
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,681
That's why

18
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,894
I'm going back to being a detective.

19
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,815
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

20
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,049
It can't be true.

21
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,343
It can't be…

22
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,560
YU DONG-MAN

23
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,209
Professor Yu.

24
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,062
Sun-ho.

25
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,118
Is Professor Yu really not in his office?

26
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,958
He left this in my office.

27
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,088
Please tell him when you see him

28
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,424
that it'll take a week
to process his resignation.

29
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,564
THIS IS YU DONG-MAN

30
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,149
Professor Seo,

31
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,861
please take good care of those airheads.

32
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,619
You're only 20 years old.
You need to love, travel, and fight.

33
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,872
Enjoy your youth and life.

34
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,583
The investigation isn't everything.

35
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,220
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

36
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,943
Please leave a message after the tone.

37
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,615
I didn't call to persuade you
to come back,

38
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,742
so make sure you listen to this.

39
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,037
The burner phone
that kept calling Mr. Park Cheol-jin.

40
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,165
It turned on. And I got the location.

41
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,668
If we go now,

42
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,880
we should be able to catch
those jerks in the gambling ring,

43
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,341
so call me.

44
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,386
Or answer your phone!

45
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,480
That burner phone…

46
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,192
It's the scumbag
who framed my mom, isn't it?

47
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,252
I totally knew something was up.

48
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:39,005
Sun-ho always sneaked out at night.

49
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,967
We promised we'd never
keep secrets from each other.

50
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,052
You liar!

51
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,596
Let's go. You said you have the location.

52
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,267
-Let's go to Beom-tae's place first.
-What?

53
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,020
As members of the KIU,
we can't take a taxi.

54
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,521
What? "KIU"?

55
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,734
Kang Sun-ho's Investigation Unit.

56
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,278
KIU, in short. Don't you remember?

57
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:07,283
The heroes who solved
the exam leak case! It's us!

58
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,951
"Heroes"?

59
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
Yes, heroes!

60
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,915
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go.

61
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,750
-Let's go.
-All right.

62
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,964
Get up.

63
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,469
-Kang-hui.
-You might break down at this rate.

64
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,721
And I won't be able to bear that.

65
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,975
I know that the anger
is boiling up inside you.

66
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,102
I know you're upset.

67
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,480
So meet Professor Yu
and say what you have to say.

68
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,649
"How could you do this
without telling me a word?

69
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,151
You can't leave like this.
You're such a show-off.

70
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,694
So what if you're a professor?"

71
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,991
Besides, where do you think

72
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,952
he went after handing in his resignation?

73
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,578
He must've left to catch the culprit.

74
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,001
I'm sure Professor Yu is
where the culprit is. Okay?

75
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,922
Let's go.

76
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,696
Stop it already.

77
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,659
Why do you keep calling him
when he's not picking up?

78
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,621
So that he can call me back
anytime he wants.

79
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,711
He ran away without saying goodbye.
It can't be easy for him to call us.

80
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,213
He must be really embarrassed.

81
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,799
That's why I'm giving him a chance.

82
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,927
I'm leaving him room, so he can come back.

83
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,013
Or at least he can call us back.

84
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,981
Where on earth is he?

85
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,453
Who is he?

86
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,914
He's a long-term stay guest.

87
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,625
He doesn't even fish,

88
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,043
and he's always in his room.

89
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,003
Maybe he's a wanted person.

90
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,130
No way.

91
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,299
That can't be.

92
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,780
PROFESSOR KWON HYUK-PHIL
KANG SUN-HO

93
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,365
PROFESSOR CHOI HEE-SU
PROFESSOR SEO SANG-HAK

94
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,512
GO DEOK-BAE'S LOCATIONS

95
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,148
I staked out for 48 hours,

96
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,277
and all of a sudden
he's nowhere to be seen?

97
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,906
Go Deok-bae, that fatty.

98
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,826
Where on earth is he?

99
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,085
-Hey, how did it go?
-Dong-man.

100
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,128
Hey, I'm here.

101
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,551
Excuse me.

102
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,558
The last signal was picked up
in Changrim-dong.

103
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,187
Isn't that
where the international street is?

104
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,313
Yes.

105
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,899
Professor Yu must be
somewhere there too, right?

106
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,498
MONEY EXCHANGE, TRANSFER

107
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,976
This is where
the last signal was picked up.

108
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,146
There are more alleys than I thought.

109
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,942
-Why don't we split up and look for him?
-No.

110
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,069
Beom-tae and I will go that way.

111
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,362
Wait.

112
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,780
Still, it's…

113
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,074
It's fine. It's bright
and there are many people.

114
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,952
-Okay.
-You two should go that way.

115
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,620
We'll call you when we find Professor Yu.

116
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,415
-Let's go.
-See you later.

117
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,791
See you.

118
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,547
Do you think the culprit is here?

119
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,925
Now that we're here,

120
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,261
I feel so lost.

121
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,599
What would Professor Yu have done
in this situation?

122
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,355
Honestly, I resent him a lot.

123
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,110
He turned himself in
and left school as he likes.

124
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,696
He doesn't care about the promise
he made to me.

125
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,157
I resent him for acting as he pleases.

126
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,704
But still, I hope he's here.

127
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,379
Shall we go find him?

128
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,719
It is Professor Go!

129
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,057
Gossi Beer was closed,
so I thought you went on a trip.

130
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,395
Are you okay?

131
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,941
I was just startled

132
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,567
to see you guys here.

133
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,237
I know. How did we run into you here?

134
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,031
What are you doing here, by the way?

135
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,367
-Here?
-Yes.

136
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,163
I'm here to get some groceries
because they sell unique sauces here.

137
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,166
What about you guys?

138
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,671
-We're--
-Our classmate, Min-ho, lives here.

139
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,048
-Min-ho?
-So we decided to have lunch here.

140
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,134
Is that so?

141
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,514
There are a lot of good restaurants
in that alley.

142
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,724
Okay. Thank you.

143
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,726
-See you next semester.
-Enjoy your lunch.

144
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,894
-Bye.
-Bye.

145
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,940
What's wrong?

146
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,776
I was going to ask him
if he saw Professor Yu.

147
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,279
He seemed a little suspicious.

148
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,531
Something about his clothes

149
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,783
and his bag looks suspicious.

150
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,537
Give me your phone.

151
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,586
Dong-man, Go Deok-bae's car was spotted

152
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,671
on the international street
in Changrim-dong.

153
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,049
Gosh, that jerk. Did he flee already?

154
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,802
My gosh.

155
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,513
Why on earth did he come
to the international street?

156
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,350
I know, right? Why did it have to be here?

157
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,768
Tell me about it.

158
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,897
I'm sure he's not here for sightseeing.

159
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,481
What's in this area?

160
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,485
Well, they sell tacos, pho, curry, and…

161
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,613
I didn't mean food.

162
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,864
You didn't mean food?

163
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,325
There are many foreigners here,

164
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,701
so there must be many banks

165
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,245
and currency exchange booths, you punk.

166
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,915
They do illegal transactions

167
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,666
in foreign currencies here.

168
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,960
Illegal transactions?

169
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,546
Exchange booths? That's right!

170
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,426
Gosh.

171
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,679
I must be really lonely
to have gone this far.

172
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,602
What?

173
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,987
I'm seeing things now. What a mess.

174
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,907
Wait.

175
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,040
Professor Go is the culprit?

176
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,251
No way. It can't be.

177
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,754
-He can't be, right?
-I have no idea.

178
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,715
He could be here for grocery shopping.

179
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,008
Grocery shopping?

180
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,552
Gossi Beer is closed
during summer vacation.

181
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,141
The maximum transmission range
of this listening device is 3km.

182
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,770
The only person within the distance
who'd listen in on our talks is Mr. Go!

183
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,563
We don't know that for sure yet.

184
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,191
Professor Yu was right.

185
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,653
What are you talking about?

186
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,488
Which direction did Professor Go go?

187
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,407
He went to that alley.

188
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,033
Let's go then.

189
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,786
What are you guys doing here?

190
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,579
Professor.

191
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,091
Is it really okay for us to stay here?

192
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,720
Hey, didn't you see
the fierce look in his eyes?

193
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,474
Okay. It'd be better for us
to stay here then.

194
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,726
Right.

195
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,857
Aren't you going to answer me?

196
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,608
What are you guys doing here?

197
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,196
What were you doing here then?

198
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,157
What did you say?

199
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,744
Professor Go is the culprit, right?

200
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,414
How did you know that?

201
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,167
The burner phone that was used
to call Mr. Park was turned on.

202
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,586
We've followed
the GPS location of that phone,

203
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,213
and we ran into Professor Go here.

204
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:29,965
What?

205
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,927
How did you do that so easily?

206
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,888
No, I mean…

207
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,767
You ran into him? Who did? Was it you?

208
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,852
No.

209
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,396
It wasn't me. Beom-tae and Joon-wuk did.

210
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,444
You punk!

211
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,655
Did you completely forget
how Cheol-jin got hurt?

212
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,617
You dared to come here,

213
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,243
and you even brought your friends.

214
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,704
You shouldn't have left
if you were worried about it.

215
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,631
You shouldn't have left
in the first place,

216
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,300
so we wouldn't have had
to come here looking for you.

217
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,054
You trusted and waited for Mr. Park.

218
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,849
Don't you think
I'm worth your trust as well?

219
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,106
How would I trust you
when you're acting like this?

220
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,567
Hey. Because you poked
around here and there

221
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,860
without knowing anything,

222
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,612
we only lost track of Professor Go.

223
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,698
Do you think I've been
only watching him all this time

224
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,492
because I couldn't get him?

225
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,994
I've been struggling around the clock

226
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,539
to gather enough solid evidence
to get him for good.

227
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,457
Did you even consider that, you brat?

228
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,922
Just take them and go home.

229
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,216
My gosh.

230
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,301
Have you ever thought of me
as your partner?

231
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,351
Don't run away and answer me.

232
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,644
Gosh, you punk.

233
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,480
Answer me, mister.

234
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,607
What? "Mister"?

235
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,402
Why? You're not even a professor anymore.

236
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,654
Hey, Kang Sun-ho!

237
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,157
The last question
of the Investigation Studies exam.

238
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,159
The most important element
of an investigation.

239
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,203
I wrote "partner" as an answer.

240
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,247
That's what I've learned.

241
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,834
PARTNER

242
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,009
That's the only thing I learned
in the past six months.

243
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,054
But it's all useless now.

244
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,100
Hey, you punk.

245
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,731
YU DONG-MAN

246
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,167
Sun-ho…

247
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,087
What?

248
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,136
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

249
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,430
Professor Seo said you have a week

250
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,848
before it's processed.

251
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,434
I'll get my mind off of it now,

252
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,103
so do as you wish.

253
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,439
Wait…

254
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,735
My back.

255
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,907
I hurt my back.

256
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,450
-Your back?
-My back.

257
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,750
-Are you okay?
-Gosh!

258
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,836
-Should I take you to the hospital?
-I didn't see that coming.

259
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,592
It feels like my spine is broken.

260
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,052
I'm sorry, Professor.

261
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,762
My goodness.

262
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,015
So you're calling me a professor again?

263
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,351
Well, I got so angry back then.

264
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,605
Why did you submit your resignation
and investigate on your own?

265
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,440
You said I was your partner.

266
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,903
Gosh, my back…

267
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,697
Should I head to the hospital now?

268
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,533
There's no need.
Just follow the navigation system.

269
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,331
If you get to me this fast,

270
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,167
my decision to leave goes to waste.

271
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,591
You must feel ashamed.

272
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,012
But what about it?

273
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,014
What?

274
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,516
Can't a professor feel ashamed?

275
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,688
I've been ashamed countless times.

276
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,691
I was ashamed because I was young
and didn't know anything.

277
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,611
When you act like
you don't even care about me,

278
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,407
I felt ashamed thinking,

279
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,120
"Was I the only one
who thought we were partners?"

280
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,832
So,

281
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,835
this is your last chance.

282
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,796
If you ever do something like this again,

283
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,424
I will never see you again.

284
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,510
Gosh, that's so scary.

285
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,805
-I mean it.
-I mean it too, you punk.

286
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,851
Gosh, it hurts.

287
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:41,026
Someone asked if he was a wanted man,
then I felt something obnoxious about him.

288
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,195
So I took a peek.

289
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,322
I saw his face, and it was him.

290
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,449
It was the professor
at the Police University

291
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,450
who came here a couple of times.

292
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,329
You've called the right person.
So where is it?

293
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,039
It's the second floor up there.

294
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,208
He left earlier and didn't come back yet.

295
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,417
You can go and take a look.

296
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,838
-Thank you.
-No problem.

297
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,343
Goodness.

298
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,227
I told him to come here
when he feels lonely, and he did.

299
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,147
ILLEGAL GAMBLING SITE LOG

300
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,065
HOW DO THESE SITES OPERATE?

301
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,039
What are all these?

302
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,838
Professor Go?

303
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,058
You're here.

304
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,270
Where is Park Cheol-jin's stuff?

305
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,313
I've got them already.

306
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,236
Detective Bae.

307
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,738
He likes money so much,
and it's kind of tiring.

308
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,242
It doesn't matter
as long as the ties are cut off.

309
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,287
Is everything ready for the event?

310
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,290
We've done it many times.

311
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,084
We need a big one before we lie low.

312
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,811
Gosh.

313
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,815
I told you to go home.
Why did you guys follow us?

314
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,192
I need to do this investigation.

315
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,528
It's related to my mom's case.

316
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,530
And we even know who the real culprit is.

317
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,365
I can't go back like this.

318
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,493
I need to catch that culprit.

319
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,913
Gosh, you're giving me a headache.

320
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,167
Joon-wuk and I ran into Professor Go.

321
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,086
Right. We are in danger.

322
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,130
Our cover is blown.

323
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,592
We can't risk putting our families
in danger by going home like this.

324
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,719
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

325
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,847
Why are you guys doing this to me?

326
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,266
What's that all about?

327
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,193
Let's talk, Professor Yu.

328
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,989
All the documents in your room…

329
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,115
What are they for?

330
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,203
Why did you go through my things?

331
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,663
Is the owner of Gossi Beer

332
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,290
really the culprit
who ran the illegal gambling ring?

333
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,585
Yes, I think so.

334
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,797
So the kids chased him and ran into him?

335
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,091
Yes.

336
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,927
What on earth were you thinking?

337
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,680
Why are you yelling at me?

338
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,350
I handed in my resignation
to prevent a situation like this.

339
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,060
Are you saying you did nothing wrong?

340
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,980
No. I said that because
you suddenly raised your voice at me.

341
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,439
Enough, both of you.

342
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,733
You should've quit investigating it
when you're a professor.

343
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,652
What will you do with these kids now?

344
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,196
I handed in my resignation
to go back to being a detective.

345
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,823
I've done enough!

346
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,117
-Enough, both of you.
-Forget it.

347
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,535
What are you going to do about them now?

348
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,412
I'll take responsibility for everything!

349
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,956
How? What will you do if they get hurt?

350
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,416
I said, enough!

351
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,086
We don't have time for this.

352
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,380
The owner of a pub right
by the Police University

353
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,549
turned out to be the one
who ran the gambling ring.

354
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,468
The kids are in danger now.

355
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,304
Do you really want to fight right now?

356
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,851
-What about the police?
-We can't tell them.

357
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,894
They have Cheol-jin in custody.

358
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,521
Someone else could be in on this.

359
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,280
I'll figure it out on my own.

360
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,615
You'll figure it out? How? With the kids?

361
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,580
We should step in.

362
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,124
What?

363
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,960
We should catch him.
Our students are in danger now.

364
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,548
Are you kidding me right now?

365
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,426
Okay. I love you, Dad.

366
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,931
I told my parents
that I'm taking summer courses.

367
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,225
All right.

368
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,686
It's not a lie though.

369
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,564
It's like a summer course
for Investigation Studies. Right?

370
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,524
What about you, Sun-ho?
Have you called your family yet?

371
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,609
I did, earlier.

372
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,903
By the way,

373
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,823
did he start the illegal casino site
while working right by our school?

374
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,992
-When did he start it?
-I wonder too.

375
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,204
He must have made a lot of money.

376
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,290
Why did he keep running Gossi Beer?

377
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,709
In Asan, of all places.
This isn't Gangnam.

378
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,880
Who cares about a criminal's history?

379
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,008
I guess he blew all his money on gambling.

380
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,179
What's taking the professors so long?

381
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,224
I have friends in the force
whom I can trust.

382
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,102
I told you.
We can't get the police involved.

383
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,270
They'll just cut off another tail.

384
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,272
How are the three of us
going to arrest those jerks, then?

385
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,816
Three? No.

386
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,317
There are seven of us in total,
including the kids.

387
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,861
They're in their first year.

388
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,780
They're still freshmen!

389
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,574
We'll just get their help
with the investigation.

390
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,493
The three of us can arrest those jerks.

391
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,746
What?

392
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,917
If you think it'll be hard,
you don't have to join us.

393
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,377
I don't want to force you.

394
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,881
I'm sure Professor Choi and I
can do it on our own.

395
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,635
Professor Kwon, please.

396
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,971
I think this is wrong.

397
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,141
In my book, this just can't happen.

398
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,821
We should catch him.

399
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,948
Our students are in danger now.

400
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,340
Professor Kwon is right.

401
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,927
It's crazy that we're getting
the kids involved in this.

402
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,388
You're right.

403
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,392
We may be pushing them
deeper into danger, not protecting them.

404
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,483
But wouldn't it be better
to keep them in sight?

405
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,402
I got so worried
when you weren't in sight.

406
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,451
Anyway, I'll help.
That's the right thing to do.

407
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,708
For both you and Professor Kwon,

408
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,503
this will be a long night.

409
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,378
The most important element
of an investigation.

410
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,756
I wrote "partner" as an answer.

411
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,510
When you act like
you don't even care about me,

412
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,137
I felt ashamed thinking,

413
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,723
"Was I the only one
who thought we were partners?"

414
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,258
Did you sleep well?

415
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,678
-Yes. What about you?
-Me too.

416
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,305
What a beautiful day.

417
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,522
Hey.

418
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,566
Why are you lying down there?

419
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,741
Gosh, that silly goose.

420
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,619
My goodness.

421
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,343
Don't eat the greens.

422
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,094
It tastes fresh. I like it.

423
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,687
Professor Choi Hee-su will be
helping us out.

424
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,817
First, let's come up with a solid plan.

425
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,987
We'll work in teams of two.

426
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,366
Sun-ho and I will start

427
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,784
with searching Gossi Beer,

428
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,953
where Go Deok-bae used to stay.

429
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,623
Professor Choi and Kang-hui.

430
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,960
The two of you can…

431
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,253
We'll look into online gambling.

432
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,548
Okay, sounds good.

433
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,135
What about me and Joon-wuk?
What can we do?

434
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,848
We'll do anything you say, Captain Yu.

435
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,018
-Captain? Yes, Captain.
-Captain.

436
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,895
Beom-tae and Joon-wuk can…

437
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,480
My goodness.

438
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,155
The two of you can come with me.

439
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,749
Professor Kwon, Beom-tae, and Joon-wuk

440
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,210
will first go and check Changrim-dong,

441
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,170
where Professor Go was spotted yesterday.

442
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,799
Find out why that jerk went there

443
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,051
and what he did while he was there.

444
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,221
We have a suspect in mind

445
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,724
but no solid evidence or clues whatsoever.

446
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:42,186
Our priority is to find solid evidence
so we can arrest him.

447
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,397
Put your amazing teamwork to use

448
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,067
and make sure
you bring back results. Okay?

449
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,610
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

450
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,866
Changrim-dong?

451
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,295
So the property register says
that there's a basement here?

452
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,338
That's right. Get this.

453
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,592
It's a pub, but it uses
industrial levels of electricity.

454
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,054
That means
he definitely did something else here.

455
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,805
How can we check though?

456
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,812
What?

457
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,148
Are you going to stop me
from breaking in again?

458
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,232
No.

459
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,528
These outlaws commit crimes
and do all sorts of bad things.

460
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,280
We must put them behind bars.

461
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,950
You little punk.

462
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:47,627
Did we run into Professor Go around here?

463
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,671
All I see are currency exchange shops.

464
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,715
He must've gone into one of them.

465
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:57,470
Then let's act like we're customers
and find out what he bought in this area.

466
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,972
A sting operation is illegal.

467
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,642
We have to do the legwork
and gather the info we need.

468
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,603
How would you define a sting operation?

469
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,607
-Noh Beom-tae?
-Sorry?

470
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,361
Oh, it's…

471
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,157
I mean, it's…

472
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,702
It uses a trap
to catch master criminals and…

473
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,246
Then when is a sting operation

474
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,831
allowed to be carried out?

475
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,791
-Jo Joon-wuk.
-Sorry?

476
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,668
To give them a chance…

477
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,837
To someone who's planning
to commit a crime,

478
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,923
giving a chance and providing
an appropriate environment is legal.

479
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,759
Inducing an innocent man to commit a crime

480
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,053
when he doesn't intend to,
then it's illegal.

481
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,555
That's right.

482
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,890
We're only going to specify

483
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,434
what Professor Go was here to buy.

484
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,523
Is the investigation method we're using
a sting operation or questioning?

485
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,650
-Questioning…
-A sting operation.

486
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,986
-A sting operation!
-Questioning!

487
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,158
When I come back,

488
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,493
you'd better be prepared with the answer.

489
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,246
You'll need a basis
for your answer as well.

490
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,082
Wait here.

491
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,208
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

492
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,425
-He's so scary.
-What's the answer?

493
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,441
Do you want me to come with you?

494
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,526
It's okay. I'll go on my own.

495
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,695
But…

496
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,740
do you really think your mother knows?

497
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,204
They change the website address
dozens of times a day.

498
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,539
They repeatedly open the site
and close it.

499
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,458
Do you think I have the brains for that?

500
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,796
Yes. A thief knows thieves best,

501
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,091
and my mom knows about that best.

502
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,261
I'll be right back.

503
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,075
Gosh.

504
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:30,998
Look!

505
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,168
-Oh, gosh.
-Goodness.

506
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,837
There's no way a basement is there.

507
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,631
They always

508
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,927
hide it thoroughly. Okay?

509
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,762
It could be behind the mirror.

510
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,639
No, it's not.

511
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,225
That's right! Underneath the carpet.

512
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,060
If you remove it,

513
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,812
there could be something…

514
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,815
It's just a regular floor.

515
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,947
Hey, what's that?

516
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,177
What is this place?

517
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,431
Goodness.

518
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,901
My gosh.

519
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,823
This darn jerk.

520
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,075
They actually operated the site here.

521
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,329
How could they run it
right in front of the KNPU?

522
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,291
You can't see
what's right under your own nose.

523
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,460
They must've moved their base
somewhere else, right?

524
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,545
Of course.

525
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,341
Gamblers can't quit gambling that easily.

526
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,389
It's your first time
seeing me in my uniform.

527
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,515
Why aren't you saying anything?

528
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,060
It's not my first time, you wench.

529
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,354
I saw you in it during my trial.

530
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,607
-You saw me?
-Of course.

531
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,444
You were glaring at me,
so how could I have missed that?

532
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,450
Whatever. I have something to ask you.

533
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,286
Remember what you said
last time I was here?

534
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,706
About the illegal gambling ring.

535
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,629
You said they repeatedly
open and close the site.

536
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,006
Why you little…

537
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,468
Why do you keep bringing that up?

538
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,805
I must figure this out, that's why.

539
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:56,310
Then how do you know it's the same site
when they open a new one?

540
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,564
Leave. You should go.

541
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,611
I got in danger
while chasing the illegal gambling ring

542
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,822
to help solve your case.

543
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,293
So…

544
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,338
I need your help.

545
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,471
Which crazy punk

546
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,598
dared to touch my daughter?

547
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,853
They must be dying to be beaten by me.

548
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,232
Nobody, not even gods,
should dare lay a finger on my daughter.

549
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,442
Absolutely nobody!

550
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,949
Why would you want to fight with gods?

551
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,576
So what if they're gods?

552
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,038
I'll fight with anyone
who messes with you.

553
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:05,379
So you need to pull yourself together.

554
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,505
You are Oh Kang-hui,

555
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,009
the daughter of the nasty Oh Jeong-ja.

556
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,388
You're way smarter than me,

557
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,308
and you're so much better than me!

558
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,992
What can I do for you?

559
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,600
Let's go.

560
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,233
It's me.

561
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,112
Can't you tell from my voice? I'm Ms. Oh!

562
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,161
Find out where Chewing Gum is
within an hour.

563
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,044
This is what happened
in the exchange office of Changrim-dong.

564
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,555
Illegal transaction?

565
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,932
What are illegal transactions?

566
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,146
According to Article 16
of the Foreign Exchange Control Act…

567
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,608
I'm so sleepy.

568
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,237
Just move on. So what happened?

569
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,171
What do you think he wants?

570
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,550
Maybe a forged passport or a burner phone?

571
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,679
He can't be a cop, can he?

572
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,682
Hey, he doesn't look like a cop at all.

573
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,892
He's obviously like one of us.

574
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,188
Forged passport, a burner phone.

575
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,940
Is that all you can provide?

576
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,776
-Are you…
-Are you Japanese?

577
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,613
A forged passport and a burner phone?

578
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,782
Is he planning to flee the country?

579
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,327
Yes, but he's going to go
on a spree first.

580
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,163
I talked with my mom on the phone.

581
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:47,374
There's this woman called Chewing Gum
who betrayed my mom.

582
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,709
Anyway,

583
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,795
she's the VIP customer
of the illegal gambling ring we're after.

584
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,549
-And?
-They sent out invitations

585
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,218
to the VIP customers
to their newly opened site,

586
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,888
saying they're having an event
to celebrate it.

587
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,724
Twice as much chance of winning a jackpot.

588
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,564
Let's go meet Chewing Gum.

589
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,150
Be careful.

590
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,617
Professor, can I talk to you?

591
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,542
As long as we can access the site,

592
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,169
I can track down
their IP address right away.

593
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,382
If we find their address
and catch them red-handed,

594
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,801
we'll be able to arrest Professor Go too.

595
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,057
Gosh, you.

596
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,602
Just go around and tell everyone
that you're a hacker.

597
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,229
Then what else can we do?

598
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,114
Yoon has a backtracking program, not you.

599
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,782
Yes,

600
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,368
but it's for backtracking online accounts,

601
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,245
so I'll need to code the program again

602
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,746
to track their IP address.

603
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,498
It'll take some time.

604
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,625
-How long?
-Two days.

605
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,794
Finish it by tomorrow.

606
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,422
Tomorrow?
I told you I need at least two days.

607
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,257
Code it with all your might.

608
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,633
Then you can do it.

609
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,802
Even with all my might,
I can't do it here.

610
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,595
Darn it.

611
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,153
On the phone,
you'll see a text message with a link.

612
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,572
Check the link and get rid of the phone.

613
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,323
Then what will you do?

614
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,951
I'll just get a new phone.

615
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,164
At my mom's trial,
you gave an incriminating statement.

616
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,917
So why are you trying to help me now?

617
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,504
I saw your mother cry.

618
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,216
Kids are nothing but a nuisance.

619
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,720
Pay for my coffee too.

620
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,745
I can use the LAN cable,
so it'll be faster to code it here.

621
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,625
Okay, then let's get started.

622
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:38,879
TO: SUN-HO

623
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,088
TWICE AS MUCH CHANCE OF JACKPOT
VIP LINK CLICK

624
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,882
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

625
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,175
The site isn't up and running yet.

626
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,386
But I can use this to track them.

627
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,431
I'll code the program before they go live
and get their IP address.

628
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,059
With the IP address,
we can find out where they are,

629
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,521
so we can raid them
as soon as the site goes live.

630
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,314
Yes.

631
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,734
These scumbags…

632
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:22,548
Professor Yu and Sun-ho
won't be back until tomorrow.

633
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,715
So just go to bed.

634
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,800
Okay.

635
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,427
And one more thing…

636
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,513
that woman was wrong.

637
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,475
-Sorry?
-You aren't a nuisance to your mom.

638
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:38,355
If anything, she should be grateful
to have a daughter like you

639
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,278
So be proud and sleep well
with a smile on your face.

640
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,196
You were amazing today,

641
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,823
and you did an excellent job.

642
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,908
Good night.

643
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,132
Life is a comedy.

644
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,012
We're figuring out how to catch them

645
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,015
in the very space they used
to do the illegal deeds.

646
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,853
When you caught me
and took me to the police station,

647
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,398
I really didn't know I'd end up

648
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,525
at the Police University with you.

649
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,825
You'll return to school
once the investigation is over, right?

650
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,911
That will depend on how you behave.

651
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,663
Why are you being so difficult?

652
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,125
I wouldn't be bothering with you
if I really hated you.

653
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,543
What?

654
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,629
I'm not sleeping,

655
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,964
so you'd better not slack off.

656
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,085
DATA GENERATION COMPLETE

657
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,344
Let's get started, Bird.

658
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,644
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO RUN THE PROGRAM?

659
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,439
-Can we begin now?
-Yes.

660
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,608
Okay.

661
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:27,107
There are two escape routes,
here and here.

662
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,693
Professor Choi and I will each take one.

663
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,448
The site will go live at 9 p.m. tonight.

664
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,783
We'll raid them
as soon as the site goes live.

665
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,201
The four of you

666
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,245
should stay here and monitor everything.

667
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,873
We're not going with you?

668
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,083
Information and speed are the keys

669
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,252
to solving cybercrime cases.

670
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,131
If the server goes down
or the database is destroyed,

671
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,301
the evidence will be gone,
so we can't arrest them.

672
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,971
That's why we need you guys to stay here

673
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,265
and monitor everything
until we arrest all of them.

674
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,476
Let us know
if you notice anything suspicious.

675
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,393
Will do.

676
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,606
But do you really need
all four of us to do it?

677
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,736
Yes, all four of us
should probably do it together.

678
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,698
No mistakes are allowed.

679
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,825
Let's not waste our time.
We won't lose them.

680
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,746
We will catch them tonight,
no matter what.

681
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:23,747
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

682
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,169
Is it done?

683
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,511
All the setup has been completed.

684
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,763
The site will go live

685
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,056
in six hours.

686
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,363
By the way,
who figured out the IP address for us?

687
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,032
Someone I know.

688
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,451
A hacker who's been helping me
since my detective days.

689
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,287
Where's Professor Kwon?

690
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:08,250
He went to pick up
some dinner for the kids.

691
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,671
This must be stressful for him, right?

692
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,008
He does everything by the book, you know.

693
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,680
But now he's going against the rules
and principles he had set for himself.

694
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,768
But you know,

695
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,812
do you think someone who did

696
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,981
such a thing
right in front of the Police University

697
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,983
had any rules or principles?

698
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,987
Honestly,
I don't even know how we got here,

699
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,282
but when I actually see
Professor Go later today,

700
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,910
I won't even know what to say.

701
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,916
I'm beginning to understand
how you must've felt

702
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,753
when you saw Cheol-jin.

703
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,343
When this is all over,

704
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,471
let's go for a drive like we said.

705
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,768
Then don't you dare sprain your ankle

706
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,021
or get a single scratch
on your face today,

707
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,898
so we can both look good

708
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,566
on our date.

709
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,539
Professor.

710
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,251
I have something to tell you.

711
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,067
Is it going to rain?

712
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,404
They said it'd be sunny today.

713
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,499
The site will go live in just an hour.

714
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,209
Okay, let's go.

715
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,632
Make sure to call me
if something comes up.

716
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,011
Professor Choi, be careful.

717
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,514
Don't you know
I was on the national judo team?

718
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,516
They should be the ones to watch out for.

719
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,146
-Professor Kwon.
-Professor Kwon.

720
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,272
Forget it.

721
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,942
When I come back, you'd better be prepared

722
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,860
with the answer and the basis for it.

723
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,619
I'll be right back.

724
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,048
You should stay out of it
when we arrest them.

725
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,300
Only Professor Yu and I have
the authority to investigate.

726
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,928
I have two veterans with me.
I'm not worried at all.

727
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,513
Let's just be done with it.

728
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:33,038
What's happening?
They're deleting the data.

729
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,206
-What?
-Let me see.

730
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,221
-What is it?
-They're not there.

731
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,463
You should block the escape routes first.

732
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,673
-I'll go and check their base.
-Okay.

733
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,442
Professor Choi's line is busy.

734
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,986
Professor Kwon isn't picking up.

735
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,156
-What about Professor Yu?
-I'll call him again.

736
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,828
Why are they not picking up?

737
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,251
Yes. We should finish it before that.

738
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,629
Okay. Got it.

739
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,690
Hurry up!

740
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,027
-How many more minutes until it blows up?
-Ten minutes.

741
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,034
We have ten minutes left.

742
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,203
I'll be out of the country
once things get sorted out.

743
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,331
Yes, Professor.

744
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,172
Wrap this up.

745
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,340
I'll see you in Thailand.

746
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,273
Yes, I'm on my way, so get the boat ready.

747
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,422
I got you, you little punk.

748
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,014
Did that catch you off guard?

749
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,444
Darn it.

750
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,988
KANG SUN-HO

751
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,533
-What is it?
-She's not picking up.

752
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,117
We got the wrong place.

753
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,704
They're running a program
to blow up the site.

754
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,208
The firewall went down,
and I got their final IP address.

755
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,459
A self-destruct program?

756
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,753
I think they found out
that we hacked them.

757
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,632
There's no way
our information leaked though.

758
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,263
The others might be in danger,

759
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,265
so I'll get going alone.

760
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,600
-Hey! You punk!
-Professor Yu.

761
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,561
You should hurry.

762
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,437
Gosh.

763
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,683
Professor Yu!

764
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,979
Professor Yu, are you okay?

765
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,814
Damn it!

766
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,070
Why you…

767
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,676
Who are you trying to mess with, you jerk?

768
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,404
Damn it!

769
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,914
Let go of me!

770
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,591
-Run!
-Hurry!

771
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,219
-Block the route!
-Spread out!

772
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,691
Go Deok-bae, you're under arrest
for running an illegal gambling house,

773
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,484
violating the Game Industry Promotion Act,

774
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,236
the Electronic Financial Transactions Act,

775
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,655
the Act on Regulation and Punishment
of Criminal Proceeds Concealment,

776
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,240
the Telecommunications Business Act,

777
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:45,118
and the Act on Information
and Communications Network Utilization.

778
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,744
You have a right to an attorney.

779
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,371
You have the right to remain silent

780
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,997
and the right to explain yourself.

781
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:53,710
You also have the right to challenge
the legality of your confinement.

782
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,003
But just don't.

783
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,422
You're dead meat now.

784
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,610
To celebrate the success
of our first investigation,

785
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,528
we came to the beach!

786
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,946
-Have a great time.
-Let's go.

787
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,698
There's no direct bus to Seoul.

788
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:06,866
Those crazy punks!

789
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,243
-What is that?
-A gift from my boyfriend.

790
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,536
I love it.

791
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,246
Stand tall, you punk!

792
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,831
We might not have money,
but we have pride!

793
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,708
-What are you talking about?
-What do you think?

794
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,418
Good luck!

795
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,379
I'm here to meet Han Jeong-sik,
the head of Investigation.

796
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,174
I hope that was the last time
you pull off a dangerous stunt

797
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,467
with our students.

798
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,053
How did you know
I arrested them with the kids?

799
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,097
You're finally back, Yoon.

800
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,643
How do you think a hacker
ended up in the Police University?
