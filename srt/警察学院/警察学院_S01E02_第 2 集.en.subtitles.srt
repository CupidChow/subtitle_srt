1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:02,919
LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,587
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,427
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,016
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,517
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,019
The Police University?

8
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,854
Not a chance.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,148
Get out.

10
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,859
Did you not hear me?

11
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,361
You're not getting in.

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,076
Just a moment.

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,496
Well, I'm not sure what's going on.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,331
But why don't we interview him first--

15
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,959
If you don't know what's going on,
please stay out of it.

16
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,253
Professor Yu, watch what you say.

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,464
We're conducting interviews here.

18
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,175
That's exactly right.

19
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,302
We don't know what's going on here.

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,721
What did he do?

21
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,808
It's not like he committed a crime.

22
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,646
Well, is he your sworn enemy or something?

23
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,609
If it's something we need to know,
please tell us now.

24
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,403
Or you tell us.

25
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,994
It's something personal.

26
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,412
Is that so?

27
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,417
If it's something personal,
you shouldn't bring it into this.

28
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,752
Isn't that right?

29
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,922
Can we begin the interview now?

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,517
Please help him get in.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,976
Gosh, look at this.

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,522
He did so poorly on the practical test.

33
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,691
But he did pretty well
on the written exam.

34
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,736
If I get in, I'll work hard
to build up my physical strength.

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,990
Really? Then you should join
the judo club.

36
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,617
-Pardon me?
-The judo club.

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,369
Make sure you join us.

38
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,581
Judo? Not everyone can do judo.

39
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,292
He's so unfit. Goodness.

40
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,878
You'll have to take
several English classes here.

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,713
You should study English more.

42
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,800
He can't even speak Korean properly.

43
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,426
English? Come on.

44
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,147
Professor Yu, why don't you
ask him a proper question?

45
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,655
Do you think dirtbags like criminals
can be rehabilitated?

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,996
Yes.

47
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,875
I believe the absence of crimes
doesn't make a healthy society,

48
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,252
but chances of rehabilitation do.

49
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,964
Despite facing punishment, reflecting on
their wrongdoings, and making amends,

50
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,091
if they are still labeled as criminals,

51
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,929
they face prejudices and biases
and may end up repeating the same offense.

52
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,765
-That truly breaks my heart.
-That little punk…

53
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,143
On the other hand, for criminals
that show no sign of rehabilitation,

54
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,770
I also agree
that they must be severely punished.

55
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,693
I see. Is there anything
you'd like to say before we wrap up?

56
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,618
To tell you the truth,
being a police officer isn't my dream.

57
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:23,786
No.

58
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,707
I never had anything to call "my dream."

59
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,335
To me, a dream job…

60
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,047
was always a blank.

61
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,217
But I saw someone

62
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,803
whose dream job
was getting into the Police University.

63
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,142
Perhaps, I applied here
because I was copying that person.

64
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,811
But…

65
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,482
the fact that I now had a dream…

66
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,988
My father was over the moon
when he found out about it.

67
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,576
I had never seen him so happy like that.

68
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,957
If I can call this desire a dream,

69
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,668
I cannot give up on this dream now.

70
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,505
I might not be qualified yet

71
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,090
or have a long way ahead of me.

72
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,177
But if you give me a chance
to achieve my belated dream,

73
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,265
I will study hard and give it my all.

74
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,350
I really want

75
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,769
to attend the Police University.

76
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,366
INTERVIEWER

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,951
Let me borrow that.

78
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,050
APPLICATION FORM

79
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,804
You can't get in here, you punk.

80
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,100
All right. Thank you for coming in.

81
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,312
Thank you.

82
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,233
That little…

83
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,072
He'll pass.

84
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,995
Hey, you.

85
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,333
-"Hey, you"?
-Well, what was it?

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,461
-What's your name?
-Don't you know who I am?

87
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,300
Right. Didn't we meet
at Seocho Police Station?

88
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,426
No.

89
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,305
Right. It was the Jongno Police Station.

90
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,222
No.

91
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,225
The North Gyeonggi Province?
Or was it in Mapo?

92
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,020
Come on. You changed a lot.

93
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,897
It was Gwangjin Police Station.

94
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,275
Or was it in Incheon?

95
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,904
Who are you?

96
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,993
All right. Why don't we take a break?

97
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,119
Gosh. That punk.

98
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,752
Is there Inspector Yu Dong-man?

99
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,878
4 YEARS AGO

100
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,673
The next model police officer
is Superintendent Kwon Hyuk-phil

101
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,175
of the Administration Division.

102
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,557
I believe that's Inspector Yu Dong-man.

103
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,850
Hey, get a grip.

104
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,811
You can't go up there, covered in blood.

105
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,937
Hey!

106
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,397
Let me borrow that.

107
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,987
Congratulations, Inspector Yu.

108
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,700
I don't need this.

109
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,203
Let me say one thing.

110
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,539
Do you think this stupid photo op

111
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,167
can hide the fact
that it's a mess out there?

112
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,587
If we had everyone in here as our backup,

113
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,966
the rookie at my station
wouldn't have been stabbed today.

114
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:05,883
Hey! Come down.

115
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,552
-You know?
-Come here.

116
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,428
-Come on, man.
-Let go of me.

117
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,432
Model police officer, my foot!

118
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:18,020
Real model police officers
aren't here to receive awards.

119
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,148
Those who put their lives
on the line to fight the crimes

120
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,858
are model police officers. Okay?

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
Don't just stand there.
Get him out of here!

122
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,988
-Hurry.
-Get him out of here now!

123
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,366
Everyone, please calm down.

124
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,326
-Let go of me!
-Hey.

125
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,954
Let go!

126
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,080
Hey!

127
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,668
TWO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF POLICE OFFICERS

128
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,299
Unbelievable.

129
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,384
Gosh.

130
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,222
Isn't he the detective from before?

131
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,932
It's a surprise to see him here.

132
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,443
Do you know who Albert Camus is?

133
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,612
I don't.

134
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,114
Do you know what he said?

135
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,658
"Failing to punish yesterday's crime

136
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,578
is equivalent to encouraging
tomorrow's crime.

137
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,246
It is indeed a foolish thing."

138
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,751
Right. It was foolish of me
to cut you loose.

139
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,836
And our encounter here today shows

140
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,588
how foolish you are
to have such a pipe dream.

141
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,926
Do you know who Jonas Salk is?

142
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,888
“Life is an error-making
and error-correcting process.”

143
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,349
We're done here, right?

144
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,937
That little…

145
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,961
-My goodness.
-Look.

146
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,296
So what?

147
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,633
Are you here to say goodbye?
Looking like that?

148
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,136
Look at you scowling at me.
Are you trying to kill me with your glare?

149
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,555
Once I go to the slammer this time,

150
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,723
I'll probably get out
by the time you graduate.

151
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,642
I should have one last look at my wench.

152
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,019
Don't call me that. You sound so ignorant.

153
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,648
Fine. Good for you.
You must be happy to be so smart.

154
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,986
I went through all that trouble,
so you wouldn't end up like me.

155
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,779
What? I sound ignorant?

156
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,325
Stop it. Or I'm going to kill myself!

157
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,161
What a nasty girl you are.

158
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,329
Everyone!

159
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,250
My daughter tells me
she wants to die before me.

160
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,793
You little…

161
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,264
You darn brat.

162
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,932
That's enough. Let's go.

163
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,767
I gave you enough time.

164
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,853
You're just a police officer, right?

165
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,231
When my daughter graduates
from this school, she'll be an inspector.

166
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,399
Do you know that?

167
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,693
Hey. Take a good look at this jerk.

168
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,112
And don't forget his face. Got it?

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,249
Don't sell it now.

170
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,710
Sell it when the gold price goes up. Okay?

171
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,382
Let's go. Fine. I'll go.

172
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,888
Come on. This is enough.

173
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,477
I don't want you in my life!

174
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,503
Just three seconds.

175
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,340
It will pass if you just endure
those three seconds.

176
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,943
Why do you always show up when I'm crying?

177
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,696
Why do you always show up
when I'm humiliated?

178
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,494
Sorry.

179
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,957
Leave me alone. I don't want to see you.

180
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,213
That's right.

181
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,924
Only a fool would leave
when a girl tells him to leave.

182
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,886
My son isn't a fool. He can never be.

183
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,474
Gosh. That fool.

184
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,909
My gosh.

185
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,499
BESTIE

186
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,920
Seung-beom probably hasn’t had dinner yet.

187
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,714
He never skips a meal, you know.

188
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,676
By the way, who is she?

189
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,179
-Sorry?
-She's pretty, and she seemed nice.

190
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,308
Do you have feelings for her?

191
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,896
Is she the reason you want
to enter the Police University?

192
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,525
I can tell from your look, you see.

193
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,902
It's not like that.

194
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,570
Don't deny it. I can tell.

195
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,328
My gosh.

196
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,675
Are you upset?

197
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,596
Lunatic. What's there to be upset about?

198
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,349
You look sullen. Mr. Yoon…

199
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,312
Because Dad and I ate out without you.

200
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,774
Hey. Can't I do that?

201
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,068
You're being absurd, you punk.

202
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,575
Why didn't you tell me?

203
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,662
Did you think I'd stop you
from going to college?

204
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,039
Seung-beom…

205
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,999
It baffles me when I think about it.

206
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,293
Why did you say yes when I asked you
to enlist in the army together?

207
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,004
-Get lost if you're done.
-Hey.

208
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,174
If you want to have a conversation,
just talk. Don't get angry.

209
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,175
Conversation?

210
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,678
Have we ever really had one?

211
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,722
You never discuss anything with me.
You always tell me later.

212
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,974
Damn it.

213
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,768
You're always the mature one,
and I'm the ten-year-old kid.

214
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,940
Don't come after me.
I'm not just upset. I'm furious.

215
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,366
-Here.
-Thank you.

216
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,790
I feel excited at the thought
of beginning a new semester.

217
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,333
I see.

218
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,379
If you stay at the school,
you'll know how I feel, Professor Yu.

219
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,134
I don't ever want to know that.

220
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,014
My gosh.

221
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,474
Hello, professors.

222
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,144
We'll start the orientation
for the new semester now.

223
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,688
I'm Guidance Director, Baek Hui.

224
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,983
For Public Administration,
Professor Seo Sang-hak

225
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,694
will be the head professor
for freshmen as always.

226
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,778
Thank you.

227
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,116
Professor Choi Hee-su will be
in charge of Judo.

228
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,327
I'm Choi Hee-su.

229
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,705
And for Law, Professor Kwon Hyuk-phil
will be in charge.

230
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,873
Thank you.

231
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,255
-What is it?
-What are you doing now?

232
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,758
What I'm doing now
is none of your business.

233
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,218
-Well, I guess it is.
-What's up with this punk?

234
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,428
And for Investigation Studies,

235
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,764
the newly-appointed
Professor Yu Dong-man will be in charge.

236
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,932
Jeez.

237
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,643
Professor Yu Dong-man?

238
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,604
Yes.

239
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,274
Right. I'm Yu Dong-man.

240
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,734
I got an important call.

241
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,488
He got a call.

242
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,199
-For policy analysis…
-Are you at the school now?

243
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,410
Goodness, you adapt so quickly.

244
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,080
Gosh, I guess I've gone too easy
on you these days.

245
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,499
They will recruit more officers
in two weeks.

246
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,835
If you lose this chance,
you can't come back even if you want to.

247
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,296
Darn it…

248
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,510
Hello.

249
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,303
Here are your drinks.

250
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,597
My goodness. This is really…

251
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,848
Hold on.

252
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,476
This is the signature drink of Gossi Beer.

253
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,645
-You have to taste it as it is…
-I'm mixing it with soju.

254
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,523
Me too.

255
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,985
Then you should have ordered
a bottled beer.

256
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,573
What's wrong with him?

257
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,909
So what?

258
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,412
What do you mean, "so what"?

259
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,873
We're tracking several
cryptocurrency exchanges now.

260
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,460
We expect it'll take three months
to track them down.

261
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,630
Three months?
Not three days or three weeks?

262
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,632
Do you know how many
cryptocurrency exchanges there are?

263
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,301
We don't have enough budget to start with,

264
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,012
and I'm doing all the work.
It's killing me.

265
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,973
Don't you see how haggard I look?

266
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,730
-You've always looked like that.
-You…

267
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,398
Just…

268
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,942
Get down on your knees
and apologize to Captain…

269
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,901
Are you insane?

270
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,154
This is about my pride now.

271
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,240
Your pride, my foot.
You just don't want to lose face.

272
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,825
And even if we find them,

273
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,453
we can't track their accounts
since they've changed the exchange.

274
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,622
We have to ask Yoon now.

275
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,168
We must catch those jerks.

276
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,213
Dong-man.

277
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,882
Is this about
the 100 million won you lost?

278
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,008
What did you say?

279
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,887
Well, even if that's the case,
I honestly can't understand.

280
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,472
You didn't even care about this case.

281
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,058
The case belonged to Cybercrimes
in the first place.

282
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,142
My gosh.

283
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,062
Or…

284
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,607
is it because of the person
who died in the accident?

285
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,485
Shut your mouth, you punk.

286
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,572
Seriously…

287
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,827
My gut feeling tells me
that this case is dangerous.

288
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,497
Who are you to talk about the gut feeling?

289
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,623
Gosh.

290
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,543
I was going to tell you this
when I have clear evidence.

291
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,796
They shut down the casino.

292
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,799
They keep slipping away.
There's something fishy about it.

293
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,594
I think this is out of our league.

294
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,018
You're writing a scenario
instead of working.

295
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,311
My gosh, seriously.

296
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,314
This is my gut feeling
as a police officer.

297
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,275
Your gut feeling, my foot.
Stop that nonsense.

298
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,152
What? "This is out of our league?"

299
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,947
How could you talk like that
as a police officer?

300
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,948
Gosh, seriously.

301
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,118
There's one more, you punk.

302
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,244
My gosh.

303
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,290
You're not going to talk to me?

304
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,752
Do you want me to apologize this time too?

305
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:51,880
What did you say?

306
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,763
Enough. Let's stop this.

307
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,474
It's not over.

308
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,229
-You little…
-I told you to stop.

309
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,899
-I told you to stop.
-Bring it on, you punk.

310
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,455
Do you still think I'm a loser?

311
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,959
Answer me. Do you still think I'm a loser?

312
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,172
If you can't give me that punch,
you're really a loser.

313
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,757
Hit me. I said to hit me!

314
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,637
"It's none of your business
whether I go to college or not."

315
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,431
"Did the interview go well?"

316
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,766
"I hope you get in."
Shouldn't that come first?

317
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,686
Can you call yourself my friend?

318
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,271
Can you call yourself my brother?

319
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,107
You're a loser
who can't even say that stuff.

320
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,151
Go ahead. Hit me, jerk.

321
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,903
What about you?

322
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,404
You've done judo for ten years.

323
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,032
You can obviously beat me and put me down.

324
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,034
But you let me give a beating
and fall on purpose.

325
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,160
Even now, you're going easy on me.

326
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,287
You're a loser, you punk.

327
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,542
Would you stop losing?

328
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,879
I won't lose anymore.

329
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,380
I'll never lose!

330
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,648
Are you hurt?

331
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,776
It must hurt. Let me see.

332
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,195
You lunatic.

333
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,910
How was your interview?

334
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,371
I did well, you punk.

335
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,915
Congratulations, you punk.

336
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,834
That crazy punk.

337
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,715
Hold on a second.

338
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,470
WISH FOR ADMISSION

339
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,889
It's here.

340
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,940
"You have passed
the 2021 Freshman Admission Examination."

341
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:19,069
"You have been admitted
to Korean National Police University."

342
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,570
-"Admitted!"
-Goodness. Hey.

343
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,656
Oh, my gosh.

344
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,908
WISH FOR ADMISSION

345
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,411
I've been admitted.

346
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,080
Yes! I'm going to be a police officer!

347
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,002
Why do you check it over and over again?

348
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,628
Can't you see it says "admitted"?

349
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,297
Your second son
is going to be a police officer.

350
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,048
A grade six civil servant.

351
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,975
Dad, really?

352
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,936
Are you going to open it?

353
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,276
Here.

354
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,530
What is it?

355
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,824
It's a spam message.

356
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,577
Hold on a second.

357
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,539
MILITARY MANPOWER ADMINISTRATION

358
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,499
MR. YOON SEUNG-BEOM,

359
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,501
CONGRATULATIONS
ON JOINING THE MARINE CORPS

360
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,502
Congratulations.

361
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,175
Talk about perfect timing.

362
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,761
Well done.

363
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,346
-Here.
-I want some too, Dad!

364
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,806
Don't drink without me.

365
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,821
Get going. Give Sun-ho a ride, Dad.

366
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,532
I can go by myself.
You should see Seung-beom off.

367
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,785
I have a work trip, so I should get going.

368
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,538
Take good care of yourself, both of you.

369
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,963
Seriously. If you grow old like that,
you'll be all alone and lonely!

370
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,425
We'll call you, Dad!

371
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:13,934
You should get going.

372
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,820
Seung-beom!

373
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,034
What? What is it?

374
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,499
Go to college
when you complete your military service.

375
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,877
I'll attend your college entrance ceremony
no matter what.

376
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,255
I'll be there at all costs,

377
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,006
so go to college.

378
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,218
-Hey.
-Promise me that you will.

379
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,555
I was going to anyway, you twerp.

380
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,765
Did you think you'd be the only one
with a college degree?

381
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,102
And Kang Sun-ho.

382
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,022
Isn't that your train?

383
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,983
What are you talking about?

384
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,777
-Hey.
-Hurry!

385
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,117
Car 17, seat number 8C.

386
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,495
Okay, it's here.

387
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,549
You can have it.

388
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,969
Thanks.

389
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,032
You must be thirsty.

390
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,075
I'll go get something quickly.

391
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,993
No, it's okay.

392
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,037
-I'll be quick.
-No, don't bother.

393
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,582
Sorry.

394
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,752
Then I'll get you water
whenever you're thirsty

395
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,462
during our training.

396
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:06,963
Why?

397
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,219
I'm just so happy to see you again.

398
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,306
I want to do whatever I can
to see you once more.

399
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,701
What? Speak.

400
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,288
-What?
-Go ahead and speak.

401
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,000
No. It's nothing.

402
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,419
I can carry this for you, your suitcase.

403
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,546
Okay?

404
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,382
Sure, if you want to.

405
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,008
All right, I'll carry it for you.

406
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,264
Hold on.

407
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,309
Hang on.

408
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,604
Hey, I got it.

409
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,856
No, I can do it.

410
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,108
I should just wheel it.

411
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,862
Why is this stuck?

412
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,792
Are you freshmen at the Police University?

413
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,793
What?

414
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,503
Yes.

415
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,425
Me too.

416
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,593
I'll carry this
to the meeting spot for you.

417
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,015
No, it's okay. I can carry it myself.

418
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,774
Darn it.

419
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,110
It's nice to meet you all.

420
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,363
I'm Guidance Director Baek Hui
at the Police University.

421
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,033
For the next two weeks, you'll partake
in our Chungram Training Program.

422
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,534
Chung as in "blue",
and ram as in "cradle".

423
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,620
It encapsulates our determination
to grow talent in this cradle.

424
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,999
But unlike its beautiful name,
this intense, rigorous training program

425
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,085
will make you think of your mother
at every moment.

426
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,337
But you must stay strong

427
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:11,963
and get through it.

428
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,132
The future of the police.

429
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,509
That's you.

430
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,262
I hope all of you
complete the training successfully

431
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,515
without anyone getting hurt or giving up.

432
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,477
Applause, please.

433
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,111
What can I do to return to the precinct?

434
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,529
All this is driving me crazy.

435
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,408
THE CHUNGRAM TRAINING ENTRANCE CEREMONY

436
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,748
That punk.

437
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,420
I can't believe you actually came here.

438
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,844
Do you think I'm a joke?

439
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,889
I honestly don't understand
why you're being like this.

440
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,683
You told me I should repay my dad
for the rest of my life.

441
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,310
Yes, that's right.

442
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,521
But you said yourself

443
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:13,358
that life is a process where one works
on correcting one's mistakes.

444
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,610
I'm trying to correct my mistake here.

445
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,862
Letting you off like that
was clearly a mistake.

446
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,533
You can't get into this school, you punk.

447
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,994
You won't even be able
to set foot in here after this.

448
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,037
Do you understand?

449
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,499
I've already been admitted.

450
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,460
We'll see about that.

451
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,011
WELCOME TO THE CHUNGRAM TRAINING PROGRAM

452
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,054
It's so nice here.

453
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,724
This is so awesome.

454
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,768
This is the Police University.

455
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,858
-Hey!
-Gosh.

456
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,609
I knew you'd get in.

457
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,029
Right? It's so nice to see you again.

458
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,031
I'm Noh Beom-tae.

459
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,370
I can't believe you actually came here.

460
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:12,083
By the way, how do you know
Professor Yu Dong-man?

461
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,545
I met him a while back.

462
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,088
Lucky you!

463
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,800
They say connections
are everything in this country.

464
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,094
-We're more like enemies.
-What?

465
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,846
We're set after this training, right?

466
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,099
What? This is only the beginning, buddy.

467
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,935
Let's get through the training

468
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,855
and make it to
the final admission stage. Okay?

469
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,939
-Sounds good.
-Yes!

470
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,233
Wait, we can be disqualified
even at this stage?

471
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,403
Of course. I guess you came here
not knowing anything.

472
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,448
Tons of people give up
during the Chungram Training.

473
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,045
If you get
on the drill instructor's bad side,

474
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,297
you won't even last two days.

475
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,593
I wonder which professor
will be our drill instructor.

476
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,970
Give us someone who's easygoing, please.

477
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,340
Nice to meet you.
I'm Senior Inspector Yu Dong-man.

478
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,968
I'll be guiding you guys
through the entire training.

479
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,177
Let me warn you first.

480
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,304
Don't stand out and behave yourself.

481
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,099
Stay out of trouble
and focus on the training.

482
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,727
If I spot you doing anything funny,
you'll be disqualified.

483
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,773
No exceptions.

484
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,695
We will now begin the training.

485
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,532
-Fifty-one!
-Fifty-one!

486
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,284
-Fifty-two!
-Fifty-two!

487
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,327
-Fifty-three!
-Do it properly!

488
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,079
-Fifty-four!
-Arms all the way up!

489
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,789
-Fifty-five.
-Watch your elbows!

490
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,249
-Fifty-six.
-Do it right!

491
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,375
-Yes, sir!
-Fifty-seven!

492
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,837
-Hey. How much longer…
-I can't hear you!

493
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,131
How much longer must we do this?

494
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,426
Don't tell me
this will end with one of us dying.

495
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,344
Who's talking right now?

496
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,263
-Raise your arms.
-Do you want to go home?

497
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,348
-Line up.
-Halt!

498
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,477
-Kang Sun-ho, you're the center.
-Center!

499
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,063
-Gather around him.
-One, two.

500
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:47,155
You will divide into
three autonomous units from this point on.

501
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,490
You will move, stay, and train together.

502
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,202
And every unit will have a unit captain.

503
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,413
If your unit members fail
to keep up with the training,

504
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,166
the captains will be responsible
for everyone's failure.

505
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,500
Don't forget that.

506
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:04,923
Despite this huge risk, is there anyone
who's brave enough to volunteer?

507
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,429
You all applied to become police officers
to protect our people.

508
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,097
Do we only have cowards here?

509
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,267
Trainee Park Min-gyu!

510
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,769
I'll do my best!

511
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,064
What about the second unit?

512
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,276
Trainee Oh Kang-hui.
I would like to volunteer.

513
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,235
Great.

514
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:30,990
All right. For the caption
of the third unit…

515
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,135
You over there.

516
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,346
Pardon?

517
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,558
-Me?
-Yes.

518
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,144
It looks like you could use some courage.

519
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,689
So you will be the captain
of the third unit.

520
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,321
Let's see if you can last here.

521
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,118
Seriously? How petty.
I thought you were a grown-up.

522
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,370
Why is he scowling at me?

523
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,497
Stop glaring at me, punk.

524
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,125
Is he asking for a beating?

525
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,626
Stop glaring.

526
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,255
I knew it. Connections always matter.

527
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,094
I should work harder.
Get a grip, Noh Beom-tae.

528
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,022
Were you able to get in touch
with the hacker, Yoon?

529
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,817
-Are you sure you guys are close?
-I'm busy right now.

530
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,569
And there's a kid I need
to kick out of the program too.

531
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,529
-Who?
-Kang Sun-ho.

532
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,698
What?

533
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,242
The kid who made you get demoted?

534
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,326
Bye.

535
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,334
What?

536
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,503
Gosh. That airhead.

537
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,762
CHEOL-JIN

538
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,722
I really have a bad feeling about this.

539
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,265
Can you just
get on the team leader's good side

540
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,516
and come back to the force?

541
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,894
Gosh. Why does he keep telling me

542
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,854
he has a bad feeling about this?

543
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,911
"A bad feeling", my foot.

544
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,666
Seriously. What's up with Yoon?

545
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,752
Track Yoon's IP address.

546
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,470
YU DONG-MAN WAS COMING AFTER US

547
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,847
HOW CAN YOU SEND HIM HERE?

548
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,184
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ALL OF US CAUGHT?

549
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,853
Charge forward!

550
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,148
Left foot!

551
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,441
Focus!

552
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,153
Left foot!

553
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:18,908
Left foot!

554
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,576
Hey. You'd better focus!

555
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,703
-Left foot.
-What's up with them?

556
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,039
Left foot!

557
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,458
-Left foot!
-They are driving me crazy.

558
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,795
Tell the first and second units
to take a knee.

559
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,673
First and second units. Halt.

560
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,008
Take a knee.

561
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,720
The third unit doesn't understand

562
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,888
the concept of rank and file.

563
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,349
Only the third unit will shout
for three seconds.

564
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,896
I told you to elongate the commands,
so you have time to prepare.

565
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,315
And I told you so many times
to move swiftly.

566
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,358
Goodness.

567
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,110
Only the third unit will try again.

568
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,278
Turn left and go back!

569
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,737
One, two.

570
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,531
-One, two.
-One, two.

571
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,951
What a mess. Tell them to stop.

572
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,578
Halt.

573
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:05,955
Goodness.

574
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,835
The mistakes of the unit members
reflect the competence of the captain.

575
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,546
Captain of the third unit.

576
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,339
Assume a push-up position.

577
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,681
Go down when I say one.
Come up when I say two.

578
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,099
One.

579
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,519
Two.

580
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,355
One.

581
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,525
One.

582
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,571
One.

583
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,158
One.

584
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,952
If the captain's stomach
touches the ground,

585
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,330
everyone in the unit
will go through a drill.

586
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,060
See?

587
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,229
I told you. You're not fit for this.

588
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,696
Everyone in the third unit,
assume a push-up position.

589
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,157
-Assume a push-up position.
-Come on.

590
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,327
-A push-up position.
-A push-up position.

591
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,080
Go down when I say one.
Come up when I say two.

592
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,415
-One.
-One.

593
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,876
-Two.
-Two.

594
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,919
One.

595
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,172
-How odd.
-Two.

596
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,217
He was so upset
like a dog getting dragged to a pound.

597
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,261
Why did he volunteer to train them?

598
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,846
Do you really want to know
the reason behind it?

599
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,431
Or do you just want to get to know him?

600
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,560
-Both?
-Two.

601
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,938
-One.
-One.

602
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,041
Hey.

603
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,128
Are you all right?

604
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,129
The third unit is out.

605
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,811
Hey, try again.

606
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,066
Come on. Why are we watching this?
Get out.

607
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,609
The third unit is out.

608
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,655
-Just do it.
-Do it.

609
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,741
Sorry. I can't go easy on you.

610
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,952
-I need to let my unit eat.
-I'll do my best too.

611
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,546
A full point.

612
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,677
Everyone in the third unit
including the captain seems incompetent.

613
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,762
Come on.

614
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,271
I wanted to be in Min-gyu's unit.

615
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,899
Gosh. I should have been the unit captain.

616
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,525
Darn it.

617
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,527
I can't get disqualified here.

618
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,237
I can't.

619
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,824
They are serving sausages today.

620
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,495
Sausages. How can they
serve sausages today?

621
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,956
Let's be honest here.

622
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,667
Shouldn't Kang Sun-ho
withdraw from the program?

623
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,463
Gosh. How can he lose to a girl?

624
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,425
How can a guy like him be
a unit captain or a cop, no less?

625
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,137
Goodness.

626
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,283
Hey.

627
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,081
What do we have next? The uphill training?

628
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,499
Nice.

629
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,544
We won't have to roll
or fall down at least.

630
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,962
-Nice.
-Who knows?

631
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,673
They might make us roll down the hill.

632
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,716
-What?
-What?

633
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,969
You, over there! What are you wearing?

634
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,393
Are you seriously wearing slippers
right now?

635
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,106
I apologize. I'll go put on
proper shoes right away.

636
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,567
Do you think you're the only one
whose feet hurt?

637
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,278
Everyone here has blisters
on their feet from the training.

638
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,238
Can't you be more considerate?

639
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,073
Hello, ma'am.

640
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,909
I'm Oh Kang-hui,
the captain of the second unit.

641
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,622
I apologize. I spilled water on her shoes.

642
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,500
It's my fault that
she's not wearing proper shoes.

643
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,418
I'm sorry.

644
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,296
Second unit, you've been warned.

645
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,592
Are you all right?

646
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,139
Hey, their unit captain is so cool.

647
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,308
She's really cool.

648
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,351
Are you okay?

649
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,273
Left foot.

650
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,609
One, two, three, four.

651
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,903
One. Two.

652
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,031
-Three.
-Halt.

653
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,407
Halt!

654
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,701
Halt!

655
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,827
-One, two.
-One, two.

656
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,832
This is the Chungram Hill

657
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,377
known as "Panting Pass",
which the University is famous for.

658
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,256
If you can't even go over this hill,

659
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,383
how will you manage
to catch suspects out in the field?

660
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,761
All of you, proceed with the duckwalk.

661
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,305
-The duckwalk?
-Gosh.

662
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,184
I'll give you 15 minutes. The units
that fail to return within 15 minutes

663
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,479
will have a tough night ahead.

664
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,409
PANTING PASS

665
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,801
Keep going. Don't stop.

666
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,849
Are you all right?

667
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,853
Hey. We must keep going.
We have no choice.

668
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,896
Hey, are you all right?

669
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,064
Yes, I'm okay.

670
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,399
Do you want to go home?

671
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,610
-No! I can do it!
-We can do this!

672
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,236
Then move it!

673
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,741
Come on. Pick up the speed!

674
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,035
Hands behind your head.

675
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,119
Keep them clasped.

676
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,413
Guys, we're almost there!

677
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,207
Icy cold water is waiting
for you to cool you down.

678
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,462
Gosh.

679
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,964
-Keep going.
-Go on.

680
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,013
We're almost there.

681
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,348
We're almost there.

682
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,726
Hang in there.

683
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,232
Everyone in the first unit made it.

684
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,192
Keep going.

685
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,989
You don't have much time left.

686
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,826
What's with the third unit?

687
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,085
Beom-tae.

688
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:43,263
-I'll stay behind you and help you.
-No, it's okay. Just ditch me and go.

689
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,016
Hey, time's almost up.

690
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,186
I'm doomed.

691
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,066
We live and die together.

692
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,401
Get up.

693
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,946
Captain…

694
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,031
You can do this. Let's go.

695
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,250
-You got this.
-Beom-tae, keep going.

696
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,377
-Beom-tae.
-You're almost there.

697
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,878
-You got this!
-Keep it up.

698
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:15,963
-You can do it.
-Keep going!

699
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,506
-That's it!
-You got this!

700
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,715
-Keep it up!
-You can do it!

701
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,551
-Just a little more.
-You got this!

702
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,469
-Come on.
-You can do this.

703
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,595
-You're almost there.
-Yes!

704
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,721
Just a little more.

705
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,102
-You can do it.
-You're almost there.

706
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,358
-You can do it.
-You're really almost there.

707
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,677
-Gosh.
-Darn it…

708
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,934
Everyone except for the captain
of the third unit may go to the cafeteria.

709
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:15,063
Captain of the third unit,
duckwalk up this hill again.

710
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,985
-Get up.
-Get moving!

711
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,778
-Get up.
-Move it.

712
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,115
Excuse me, Professor.

713
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,451
He got in late because of me…

714
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:31,163
Who are you trying to help when
you can't even sort out your own life?

715
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,918
What did I do so wrong?

716
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,253
I'm asking because I really don't know.

717
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,090
You're at fault for not excelling.

718
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,052
And for trying to hold out
when you're not qualified to be here.

719
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,221
You don't even know your place,
and that is clearly wrong.

720
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,725
Got nothing to say, right?
Then move, you brat.

721
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,495
Captain.

722
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,208
No one's watching.
Let's just head back, okay?

723
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,001
Captain.

724
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,344
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm okay.

725
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,846
-There's a bench here.
-Great.

726
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,058
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

727
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,938
-I'll go get some pain relief patches.
-I'll bring cold water.

728
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,690
-Wait here.
-We'll be right back.

729
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,649
Thanks, guys.

730
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,409
Here, have some water. You look parched.

731
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,164
I was supposed to do this for you.

732
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,874
Forget it.

733
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,214
You did such a great job.

734
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,509
I don't think I'm cut out to lead a unit.

735
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,136
You're not cut out for it?

736
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:11,972
Captain.

737
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,975
I never asked you for help.

738
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,604
-What?
-By doing that,

739
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:23,150
you're robbing me of the opportunity
to solve the problem on my own.

740
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,868
There's no such thing.

741
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,538
Whether it's for you, Min-gyu, or me.

742
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,248
We've all never done this before.

743
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,920
I really

744
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,131
don't know

745
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,342
what to do.

746
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:55,974
Why don't you

747
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,393
just be yourself?

748
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:05,192
It's not really about doing a great job.
We're all just doing our best, you know.

749
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,656
Stop worrying so much
about what others might think

750
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,115
and just do things your way.

751
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,077
-My way?
-Yes.

752
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,246
You let me hide behind you
and helped Beom-tae today.

753
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,083
That's you.

754
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,141
Hey, Captain.

755
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,069
How did you think to sneak this in?

756
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,447
I've done a lot of research
because I failed to get in twice.

757
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,076
And everyone says hunger
is the biggest hurdle in this training.

758
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,536
Plus,

759
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,289
I wanted to thank you, Sun-ho.
I felt so bad earlier.

760
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,253
I understand,

761
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,172
but I really don't think
we should do this.

762
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,591
If we get caught, we'll be expelled.

763
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,511
Right. Okay.

764
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,388
If that's what you think…

765
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,308
Are you telling me that you want
to throw away instant noodles, comrade?

766
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,187
Smell this.

767
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,692
Look at these noodles.

768
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,906
No. Sun-ho is right.

769
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,825
Sun-ho.

770
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,078
Among everyone I met
at the Police University,

771
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,665
I think you would make the best cop.

772
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,670
You protected our unit
and guided us on the right path.

773
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,549
I'm sure you will become
a really cool cop.

774
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,770
I thought I didn't qualify
to become a cop.

775
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,354
Hey. What are you talking about?

776
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,274
I felt it when I saw you.

777
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,360
We would've been in big trouble
if I was the captain.

778
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,988
I would have already been dead

779
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,866
or committed suicide by now.

780
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,827
Like he said, we shouldn't have this.

781
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,624
Throwing away food is a sin.

782
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,709
We'll finish it in 30 seconds. Okay?

783
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,689
Who's that there?

784
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,068
Who's there?

785
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,238
-Go.
-What's going on?

786
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,114
What do we do?

787
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,995
-Sun-ho.
-Come on.

788
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,085
Sun-ho?

789
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,755
What are you doing here?
What are you hiding in the back?

790
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,049
What is it?

791
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,552
Did you just get in my way?

792
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,057
You're eating instant noodles?

793
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,142
Come with me.

794
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,144
Come out!

795
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,320
OUR COUNTRY HAS FAITH
IN THOSE OF YOU WHO PASS HERE

796
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,950
Let's meet.

797
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,327
I need to talk to you
about something in person.

798
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,893
Answer me right now. Who were the others?

799
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,857
I see. So you'll take the fall
for everyone?

800
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,778
Fine. Let's see
when you'll give up on that idea.

801
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,071
Run 30 laps around the field.

802
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,881
Let's just go and tell him the truth.

803
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,508
At this rate, Sun-ho really might die.

804
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,012
Right. We should just
go through the drills with him at least.

805
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,599
Stop.

806
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,808
Goodness.

807
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,311
Darn it.

808
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,203
Why don't you just be yourself?

809
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,373
You let me hide behind you
and helped Beom-tae today.

810
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,708
That's you.

811
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,044
Look at that.

812
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,047
Keep running
until you give me their names.

813
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,395
I was alone!

814
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,066
Hey, do you think I'm a joke?

815
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,276
Should I check the CCTV footage?

816
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,991
Be it 100 or 200 laps.
I will face all the drills by myself!

817
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,951
I should have stopped them
as their captain.

818
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,369
But I couldn't say no.

819
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,496
It was my mistake
to have eaten it with them.

820
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:56,626
As the captain of the unit,
I have been an embarrassment.

821
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,547
I don't want my fellow unit members
to see me mess up again.

822
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,341
Please let me face the drills by myself!

823
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,428
You're nothing but all talk.

824
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:10,807
Han Min-guk.

825
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,393
Go inside and do the roll call.

826
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:14,978
Yes, sir.

827
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,860
You're still not going
to leave voluntarily?

828
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,530
-Answer me.
-Why?

829
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,825
Why can't I stay?

830
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,958
All you ever did was have
some instant noodles with your friends.

831
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,045
So do you think this treatment
is unfair to you? Is it?

832
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,590
Wake up, punk.

833
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:48,386
To you, this is all too easy.
Breaking the rules comes easy to you.

834
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,055
Doing things that you're not supposed to.

835
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,473
I don't think that's true.

836
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,807
That's not true?

837
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,559
How is it not true?

838
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:58,146
Can't you just think of it
as a mistake and let it go?

839
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,441
It wasn't your first time.

840
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,197
You've done it more than once, you punk.

841
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,078
Dad won't have cancer now. No more cancer.

842
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,206
What should I do?

843
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,880
GO TO COLLEGE!

844
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,010
NEW REMITTANCE 5,000,000 WON

845
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,930
Gosh. That crazy jerk.
Where did he get this much money?

846
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,814
You took out 7 million won at 7:15 p.m.

847
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,441
And you took out
5 million won at 7:18 p.m.

848
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,239
The first time is hard.
It's easy the next time around.

849
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,408
And by the third time,
you won't even feel guilty.

850
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,328
But you want to be a police officer?

851
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,291
Do you get why you can't be a cop now?

852
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,129
And why you don't deserve
to attend the Police University?

853
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,509
What? "A belated dream"?

854
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,636
Goodness. You're all talk.

855
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:15,682
No excuses?

856
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,438
I have nothing to say. I'm sorry.

857
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,273
I see, okay.

858
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,609
I was going to rip your mouth
if you gave any.

859
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,823
I told you it's wrong to stay here
when you don't deserve it.

860
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:35,118
I also said not learning your place
and acting cheeky was also wrong.

861
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,621
Get out on your own.

862
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,377
-I'm sorry.
-Leave, you punk.

863
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,507
I'm sorry. Please give me a chance.

864
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,595
I will never break the rule again.

865
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,388
I will follow the rules.

866
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,975
I will change myself to become someone
that belongs to the Police University.

867
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,144
Just one chance.

868
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,606
Please give me one last chance. Please?

869
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,238
You also need to be worthy
of a second chance.

870
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,532
And you're not worthy of it.

871
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,671
The captain kept saying
that we shouldn't eat it.

872
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,049
We were the ones who wanted to eat it.

873
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,592
It's not Sun-ho's fault.

874
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,595
Sun-ho wouldn't be
going through the drills

875
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,347
if he gave away our names.

876
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,850
He wanted to protect us.
Please don't scold him.

877
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,863
-What is it?
-Don't be shocked.

878
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,908
It's about
your little hacker friend, Yoon.

879
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,910
Yes. Did you find him?

880
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,622
It's Kang Sun-ho.

881
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,042
What are you talking about?

882
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,671
Don't you remember Kang Sun-ho,
the kid we rounded up a while ago?

883
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,298
He was your hacker friend, Yoon.

884
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,469
I can't believe your online friend
turned out to be your enemy in real life.

885
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:21,349
This must put you in a tight spot.
You know?

886
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,862
How can that jerk be…

887
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,089
If I need to be worthy of a second chance,

888
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,969
I will prove it by leading my unit
to victory in the last training.

889
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,598
And if I fail to prove it then,

890
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,725
I will withdraw

891
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,144
without making any excuses.

892
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:12,900
So can you please
decide after the training?

893
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,778
Whether I deserve to stay in this school

894
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,530
or not.

895
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,948
A miracle? A surprise?
If that's what you're hoping for, wake up.

896
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,617
Can't I even hope for them?

897
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,118
Just get to the point
and say you want me out.

898
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,496
I got into the Police University.

899
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,706
Look at this brat,
he keeps talking as if we're buddies.

900
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,124
What will you do about Kang Sun-ho?

901
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,210
"Follow my heart"? What's her deal?

902
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,503
-Who?
-What?

903
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,380
Who's the girl you have a crush on?

904
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,173
I'll tell you
once we're officially admitted.

905
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,092
Then I should be
rooting for your unit too.

906
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,343
I refuse to leave.

907
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:21,594
I will get in, no matter what.

908
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,637
You won't give up, right?

909
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,305
Cheol-jin. Hey, Cheol-jin!

910
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,516
I will…

911
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,267
drop out.
