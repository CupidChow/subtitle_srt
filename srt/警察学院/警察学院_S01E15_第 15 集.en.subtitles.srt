1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:02,919
LOST 100 MILLION WON

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,587
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,427
POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,016
ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

6
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,406
KANG DONG-YEONG, HAN YEONG-SEON

7
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,491
Are you watching over Sun-ho?

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,869
You know that he got into
the Police University, right?

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,376
But now that I know
he is going to become a cop,

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,880
my heart sinks
every time I hear the sirens at night.

11
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,799
You'd better protect Sun-ho at all times.

12
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,013
I wanted to be thanked
for raising him well,

13
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,474
but he grew up so well all on his own,

14
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,517
so I'm grateful every day.

15
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,938
Today,

16
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm going to see our son.

17
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,403
Let's grab a drink together
in my dream when I'm back.

18
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,073
Yeong-seon, you should come too.

19
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,877
Let's go, Sun-ho.

20
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,048
PROFESSOR SEO SANG-HAK

21
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,926
The suspension is
too light of a punishment

22
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,804
for what this student did.

23
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,973
And now, you want to cancel it?

24
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,974
Sir.

25
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,645
What Professor Yu Dong-man
and Kang Sun-ho did

26
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,605
was dangerous indeed,

27
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,901
but they did it to stop the intruder
in possession of a firearm.

28
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,361
And I believe

29
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,989
what they did is in line with the ideals

30
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,076
that we teach and strive to achieve here.

31
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,161
But the rules…

32
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,664
For that, wouldn't giving him

33
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,168
the same punishment
that other students received

34
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,837
be sufficient?

35
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,470
It's all my fault.

36
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,975
I failed to foresee

37
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,769
that it could lead to an accident.

38
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,231
How could you have foreseen the accident?

39
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,191
I could have.

40
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,027
And I had to.

41
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,829
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

42
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,625
I apologize for not being able to stay

43
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,836
until the end of the semester.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,754
Professor Seo.

45
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,841
I made this decision for the sake
of the school and our students.

46
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,428
This way,
the school can protect the students…

47
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,017
no matter what happens.

48
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,831
LEADERSHIP ROOM

49
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,419
I guess I can say…

50
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,964
that I've done enough.

51
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,010
Wait, Kang-hui.

52
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,888
Let's stop it now.

53
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,698
I've finished
all the cleaning and training

54
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,908
I promised to complete.

55
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,620
You mean you finished
cleaning the ladies' room

56
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,081
-on the third, fourth, and fifth floor?
-Yes, ma'am.

57
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,212
I'm sorry
that I went out without permission

58
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,588
while I was on probation.

59
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,008
I'll make sure not to repeat
what I've done.

60
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,760
Can you keep your word?

61
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,514
-Yes.
-I'll keep an eye on you.

62
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,599
Okay, then. You may leave.

63
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,398
So who was it? Which grade was his son in?

64
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,608
It was the father of Kang Sun-ho,
a freshman.

65
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,153
He didn't know he needed prior permission
before entering the premises.

66
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,449
Isn't he on probation at home?
Why is his father here?

67
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,916
The phone is turned off.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,128
Please leave a message after the tone.

69
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,022
I didn't know I had to request visitation

70
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,148
before coming here.

71
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,316
I didn't know that.

72
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,151
Most parents don't know.

73
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,280
Oh, right. Sun-ho is

74
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,325
not on campus because he's with
Professor Yu at the on-the-job training

75
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,659
for Investigation Studies.

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,619
I see…

77
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,414
No wonder his phone was off.

78
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,624
That must be why.

79
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,962
Still, I got to see you.
It was worth the visit.

80
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,301
Actually, I got these for you.

81
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,595
Me?

82
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,181
Sun-ho told me that you love peaches.

83
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,353
He talks about you all the time
when he calls me.

84
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,815
So hearing him talking about you
makes me happy.

85
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,611
Thank you

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,030
for making him talk to me more.

87
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,121
I'm sorry for taking your time
when you must be busy studying.

88
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,290
You should get back inside.

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,253
Thank you for the peaches.
I'll enjoy them.

90
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,005
Thank you.

91
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,384
If you get a break, visit our place again.

92
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,471
I'll make you something delicious.

93
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,723
-Okay.
-See you.

ATTORNEY VISITATION ROOM

95
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,006
We only ran the illegal gambling ring
to help police officers like you.

96
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,677
We used that money
to defend your pathetic sense of justice!

97
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,720
Who told you to?

98
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,184
Professor Seo Sang-hak?

99
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,414
Did he go to his class?

LEDGER
ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION

103
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,504
Take a seat.

104
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,840
It's going to take a while.

105
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,545
Yes, this is Seo Sang-hak.

106
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,797
Are you the guardian of Mr. Seo Min-u?

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,715
We're calling
from Sangjin University Hospital.

108
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,853
Professor Seo Sang-hak.

109
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,189
-Professor Seo!
-Professor Seo.

MUNSEONG POLICE STATION
CHIEF JEONG JUN-HO

111
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:32,715
THE LATE SEO MIN-U
FATHER SEO SANG-HAK

112
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,763
Are you really not going in?

113
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,931
No.

114
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,976
Why did you tell him
you'll wait until the funeral is over?

115
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,564
Because even the inmates in prison
get furloughs

116
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,899
when their family members die.

117
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,485
Then why are you here?

118
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,446
The suspect…

119
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,741
I need to keep an eye on him
since he might run.

120
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,996
What are you looking at, you punk?

121
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,999
You know…

122
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,793
Go Deok-bae told us earlier

123
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,338
that he's responsible
for all the bad deeds.

124
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,842
That Professor Seo had no idea
how it operated.

125
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,762
So what?

126
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,057
I don't believe his nonsense,

127
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,600
and even if he really had no idea,

128
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,018
that doesn't make him innocent.

129
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,355
Nothing changes the fact

130
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:33,067
that he ran an illegal gambling ring.

131
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,654
And as soon as the funeral is over,
he'll be arrested.

132
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,781
Right.

133
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,035
You should go inside and pay respect.

134
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,372
You're not even in the force yet.

135
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,960
You're only a student
who studied with Professor Seo.

136
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,381
Go in there and pay respects.

137
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,568
Attention.

138
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,446
Present arms.

139
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
Order arms.

140
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,603
I see many alumni of KNPU.

141
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,232
It's only natural
since his son went to KNPU.

142
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,443
Was his son really in a coma
for the past ten years?

143
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,738
Yes. He got injured
while chasing a suspect.

144
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,575
How could he keep that from us?

145
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,370
He's been keeping it a secret from us.

146
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,628
He didn't have to tell us.

147
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,298
It's about his family,
and it's a personal matter.

148
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,968
-What?
-Stop it.

149
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,637
You've had enough to drink.

150
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,730
Gosh, both his wife and his son…

151
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,901
What does he have now? Gosh.

152
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,998
Jae-kyeong. Have you seen Kang-hui?

153
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,671
Sun-ho.

154
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,636
Professor Seo canceled your suspension.

155
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,390
You can come to school starting Monday.

156
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,393
It's been hard, right?

157
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,023
And we heard about it too.

158
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,650
You and Kang-hui…

159
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,488
Are you all right?

160
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,283
-How's Kang-hui?
-What?

161
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,493
Is she all right?

162
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,918
Kang-hui went back to school
after giving condolences.

163
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,349
WE RESPECTFULLY EXPRESS
OUR CONDOLENCES

JAN 28TH, 2019
HAN JEONG-SIK

165
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,026
Then on that day,

166
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,904
they used 5,000,000 won that was
donated by Zelkova Tree Foundation

167
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,156
as hospital bills, right?

168
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,952
Okay, I see. Thank you.

169
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,040
Only Chief Han's record is wrong,
so we must be right.

170
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,750
What should we do now?

171
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,462
Captain, Chief Han is going
on leave this afternoon.

172
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,923
He suddenly took sick leave during lunch.

173
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,218
"Sick leave," my foot.

174
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,393
For now, with these two documents,

175
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,311
I'll request a warrant for his arrest.

176
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,564
But we only have
the ledger and delivery records.

177
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,441
I don't think we can connect him
to the gambling ring.

178
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,151
It doesn't matter.

179
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,320
It's a fact that he took the money.

180
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,700
Find solid evidence of him
helping the illegal gambling ring

181
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,659
as fast as you can.

182
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,245
He took that much money from them,

183
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,831
so there must be something
that will connect him to it.

184
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,499
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

185
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,625
Let's go.

186
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,008
Hello?

187
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,385
I'm Professor Kwon Hyuk-phil
at the Police University.

188
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,604
We're going to arrest Chief Han
right away.

189
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,123
I'm sorry for suspecting you,
Professor Choi.

190
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,709
I'm sorry too.

191
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,754
For not telling you the real culprit
when I already knew who it was.

192
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,091
I told him to turn himself in.

193
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,969
He asked me to give him some time
to wrap up his work at school,

194
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,596
so I've been waiting for him.

195
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,141
But then, you came to see me.

196
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,146
How long have you known about this,
Professor Choi?

197
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,275
On the day

198
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,737
we arrested Go Deok-bae.

199
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,621
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

200
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,374
ZELKOVA TREE FOUNDATION

201
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,794
The external hard drive
that we took in as evidence.

202
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,004
It was my husband's.

203
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,299
So I went to see Chief Han.

204
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,388
I wanted to check the evidence again.

205
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,099
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT

206
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,313
There's no such external hard drive

207
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,398
in the evidence list.

208
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,318
That doesn't make sense.

209
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,904
I saw it with my own eyes.

210
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,405
LIST OF EVIDENCE

211
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,242
Maybe you got confused
with something else.

212
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,122
After that, as you know,
I went to see Go Deok-bae.

213
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,458
I thought she was going to Daejeon.

214
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,420
My husband's belonging
was with the illegal gambling ring.

215
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,132
I wanted to know why it was there.

216
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,969
And then,

217
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,471
the foundation came out from nowhere.

218
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,058
About Zelkova Tree Foundation…

219
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
Did Mr. Lee Ju-won start it
in the first place?

220
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,897
In the beginning, yes.

221
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,483
At first, Ju-won

222
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,986
and his partner Min-u,

223
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,321
and Min-u's father, Professor Seo.

224
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,658
These three started the foundation.

225
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,995
But soon…

226
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,876
one died, and one got hurt.

227
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,097
I'm looking for Lee Ju-won.

228
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,141
He's Lee Ju-won, a police officer.

229
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,434
-Where are you going?
-Ma'am.

230
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,727
It was you, right?

231
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,312
He was trying to save you.

232
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,439
That happened to my boy because of you.

233
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,234
He was trying to save someone like you.

234
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,361
My Min-u and Ju-won…

235
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,946
-My goodness.
-Ma'am.

236
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,617
Bring him back!

237
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,370
Bring back my son and Ju-won!

238
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,832
-What…
-My son…

239
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,460
-Because of you!
-What are you talking about?

240
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,003
Why would Ju-won…

241
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,882
Bring him back!

242
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,074
I didn't know either.

243
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,078
That it was Professor Go
who Ju-won and Min-u saved.

244
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,249
What an irony.

245
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,420
I didn't recognize him
when he was right there.

246
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,298
How could you have recognized him?

247
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,050
It's been ten years.

248
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,012
But still,
if I had recognized him earlier,

249
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,349
I would have been able
to stop Professor Seo sooner.

250
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,272
What about that photo?

251
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,900
Five years ago,

252
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,611
Professor Seo said
that he would run the foundation again.

253
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,946
So I was there once.

254
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,284
Since then,
Professor Seo and I have never talked

255
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,369
about the foundation again.

256
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,538
If we bring that up,

257
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,374
we would have to talk about

258
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,751
Ju-won and Min-u again.

259
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,301
You said it's been ten years, right?

260
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,761
Do you think Professor Seo

261
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,848
made that wrong choice

262
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,393
while seeing his unconscious son
for that long time?

263
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,899
Everyone goes through hard times.

264
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,069
If you went through that,

265
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,573
does that give you a right
to pull a stunt like that?

266
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,769
Sun-ho. Let's meet
at school after the weekend.

267
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,066
Leaving just you and Jae-kyeong…

268
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,233
I don't think this is right.

269
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,152
-Let's stay here together, Sun-ho.
-Come here.

270
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,742
Let's go eat something, okay?

271
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,039
Please don't be like this.

272
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,085
Professor Seo.

273
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,605
You need to eat.

274
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,656
You have to eat something

275
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,700
to be able to give your statement.

276
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,538
You must tell them
why you did such a thing

277
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,583
and who else was in on it.

278
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,669
They'll go through
every single piece of evidence

279
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,880
that they've found so far,

280
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,715
so you need to eat
and get your energy back.

281
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:36,099
You see, I don't understand
why you did such a thing.

282
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,560
No, I refuse to understand you.

283
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,273
Even if you say you helped the police
with that money,

284
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,275
you can't deny

285
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,402
that you used your power
to commit a crime.

286
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,698
So please

287
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,287
don't say that you did it
to protect the police.

288
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,125
Officer Kim Eun-ju lost her life
while trying to track down

289
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,379
the illegal gambling ring that you ran.

290
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,092
Inspector Park Cheol-jin,
who believed that it was justice,

291
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,178
is in jail now,

292
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,848
and Go Deok-bae committed another crime
because of you

293
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,519
after serving his time.
And because of what you did,

294
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,566
we have a corrupt officer
like Han Jeong-sik.

295
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,859
That fact will never change.

296
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:37,202
So don't you dare say again

297
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,664
that you did it to protect
that darn belief of yours.

298
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,549
I am…

299
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,137
sorry for everything.

300
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,273
If you want to apologize,

301
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,401
do it to the court and our students,

302
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,404
not to me.

303
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,290
You'll be transferred

304
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,542
first thing tomorrow morning.

305
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,297
Okay.

306
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,091
Let's do that.

307
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,075
Hey, did you arrest Chief Han?

308
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,930
LEDGER

309
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,741
Darn it.

310
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,250
Get him. Go.

311
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,517
-Hey, stop!
-Get him!

312
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,919
Goodness.

313
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,338
RECORDING 01

314
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,425
I was wondering how the money grew,

315
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,345
but then I found out
that you deliberately grew it.

316
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,227
What do you mean, Chief Han?

317
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,232
Come on. Don't be like this.

318
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,110
You and I both know that I have
some shares in the foundation.

319
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:02,490
I worked very hard
to help you stay anonymous.

320
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,951
Have you already forgotten all about it?

321
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,079
Let's talk at the precinct.

322
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,706
I'll tell them everything.

323
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,545
Tell them what?

324
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,340
You see, I respect your wishes.

325
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,721
When you're making a donation
to the Seoul Police Agency,

326
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:28,892
just add a little extra for me.
That's all I ask for.

327
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,270
About 10,000,000 won a month.

328
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,692
Since you got your noble hands dirty,

329
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,071
you should go the full distance, sir.

330
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,783
Even if you quit now,

331
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,660
the crimes you committed won't go away.

332
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:52,582
You don't want another officer
to get hurt like Min-u did, right?

333
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,550
Get him.

334
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,807
Let go!

335
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,148
Chief Han…

336
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,026
Han Jeong-sik,

337
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,028
you're under arrest
for aiding and abetting

338
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,864
the operation of an illegal casino
and accepting bribes.

339
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,283
No, you got the wrong person!

340
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,411
All I did was accept a personal donation.

341
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,706
-You have the right to an attorney.
-Darn it.

342
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,418
Hey, this is all part of
Seo Sang-hak's scheme.

343
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,254
I said, let go. Let go of me!

344
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,549
-Hands off!
-My goodness.

345
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,093
He should be charged
with brawling as well.

346
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,221
I am warning you. You'll regret this.

347
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,431
You're wrongfully accusing
an innocent person!

348
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,349
Let go.

349
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,894
Let go. Hey! I said, let go!

350
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,563
You will regret this!

351
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,649
Darn it. Let go of me!

352
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,861
Let go!

353
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,120
If you want to apologize,

354
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,622
do it to the court and our students,

355
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,292
not to me.

356
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,524
Is it wrong to steal from bad people?

357
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,363
But it's not like
the law will go easy on you

358
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,616
just because you're poor
and had no choice.

359
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,262
WE RESPECTFULLY EXPRESS
OUR CONDOLENCES

360
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,312
Professor Yu.

361
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,898
KNPU NOTICE OF DEATH
INSPECTOR KIM HAN-SOL, AGE 27

362
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,358
HANEUL FUNERAL HALL, 1ST FLOOR

363
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,378
I'm sorry.

364
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,722
What should I do…

365
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,766
so that…

366
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,687
no one gets hurt anymore?

367
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,151
What…

368
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,780
must I do?

369
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,988
Is that your conclusion?

370
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,661
Is that the conclusion you reached

371
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,372
after everything you have done?

372
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,586
I also committed a crime

373
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,714
just like you did.

374
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,635
I needed money
for my father's hospital bill.

375
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,305
That's why
I hacked the illegal gambling ring

376
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,516
and stole their money.

377
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,394
I thought it wasn't a crime
to use the money

378
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,773
stolen from the bad guys.

379
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,194
But Professor Yu told me this.

380
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,115
Just because we have
our stories and excuses,

381
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,284
that doesn't mean we can break the law.

382
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,122
But…

383
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,210
seeing where you are now made it clear.

384
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,880
That we should never break laws.

385
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,551
That we can't protect anyone

386
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,220
by breaking laws,

387
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,097
and that running away

388
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,976
doesn't excuse my wrongdoings.

389
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,280
So please come with me, Professor Seo.

390
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,240
Come with me,

391
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,659
and show me

392
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,786
how you pay for your crimes.

393
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,414
You need to show me

394
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,167
so that I can learn from you,
Professor Seo.

395
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,255
Your initial decision
might have been wrong,

396
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,674
but this time,

397
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,303
you can do the right thing.

398
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,182
I…

399
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,353
I don't deserve to do that.

400
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,989
Of course, you don't.

401
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,914
You're trying to run away like a coward

402
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,625
without paying for what you've done.

403
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,966
It's just as Sun-ho said. Is this it?

404
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,305
I once admired you

405
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,808
as my senior.

406
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,030
Opening the gambling house,

407
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,532
seizure of proceeds from crime,

408
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,452
and additional charges on bribery.

409
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,455
You admitted to all of them.

410
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,374
Mr. Seo.

411
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,418
Come down to the station with me.

412
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,329
Just like that,
the cooperative investigation

413
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,872
between Professor Yu and me
came to an end.

414
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,716
Did you share
any investigation information

415
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,884
with the operator
of the illegal gambling ring

416
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,761
that was run
from December 2016 to June 2021?

417
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,813
Yes. I constantly shared
what Senior Inspector Yu,

418
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,606
the detective in charge, was investigating

419
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,900
on the illegal gambling ring
with Go Deok-bae.

420
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,489
How can you explain
the reopening of the site on June 24

421
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,284
when it went quiet
after the arrest of Park Cheol-jin?

422
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,287
We wanted to make a quick buck
before fleeing to another country.

423
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,122
I'm sorry!

424
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,835
But sir, I'm telling you,
I don't know anything.

425
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:01,714
I only followed the orders
from the higher-ups!

426
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,049
Go Deok-bae, that jerk,

427
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,760
had an officer who could back him up.

428
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,429
So he reassured us
that we'll never get caught.

429
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,432
You can use a lie detector on me!

430
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:15,519
In return, you pocketed
a total of over 200,000,000 won

431
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,774
for the past two years.

432
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,235
You even tried to kill an officer,
after Go Deok-bae got caught!

433
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,447
I did not do anything like that.

434
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,534
Why don't we talk
when my attorney gets here?

435
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,619
No.

436
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,289
Chief Han asked for a slush fund himself.

437
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,124
How did it exactly happen?

438
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,960
Two years ago, Chief Han Jeong-sik

439
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,713
blackmailed us
after finding out the source of funds.

440
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,009
We wired 10,000,000 won
to his fake account

441
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,721
to keep his mouth shut.

442
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,973
I have backup data
that has the texts from him,

443
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,934
demanding me to make a fake account.

444
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,520
I'll submit that as evidence.

445
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,398
You opened the illegal gambling site
and the illegal gambling house

446
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,899
and operated them.

447
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,734
And through the Zelkova Tree Foundation,

448
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:08,030
you bribed some of its profits
to Chief Han Jeong-sik

449
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,281
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

450
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,575
Do you admit all your charges?

451
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,287
I do.

452
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,543
I admit all of my charges.

453
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:55,911
PROFESSOR SEO SANG-HAK

454
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,714
For the time being, Professor Kwon

455
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,049
will stand in as the head professor.

456
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,512
The students are agitated
by what happened on campus.

457
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,722
Please focus on your classes

458
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,392
so that the students can stay on track.

459
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,768
-Okay.
-All right.

460
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,688
I think I get him though.

461
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,400
Why Professor Seo
had to make such decisions.

462
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:28,861
Me too.

463
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,322
When my parents see an article

464
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,365
that says
someone from our school got hurt,

465
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,783
they throw a fit and tell me to quit.

466
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,460
I get what you mean,
but please don't follow them.

467
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,840
I'm sure many others also thought
of helping the good guys

468
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,675
with the money from the bad guys.

469
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,471
But we're all restraining ourselves
from it.

470
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,556
Because it's wrong.

471
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,228
That's why we have laws and society.

472
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,438
Got it?

473
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,861
CHUNGRAM LOUNGE

474
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,657
It's been a week already,

475
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,034
and everyone is still talking
about Professor Seo.

476
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,204
Then let's talk about something else.

477
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,461
Oh, I heard Kang-hui and Sun-ho broke up.
Is that true?

478
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,547
I don't know.

479
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,465
But I don't care now.

480
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,425
Unless Kang-hui wants me,

481
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,219
I can't force her.

482
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,557
Look at you. That was kind of cool.

483
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,771
Oh, right. Why didn't you ask for my help?

484
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,565
You said we should work on it together.

485
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,607
Just because.

486
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,277
It looked like you no longer wanted to.

487
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,903
That's why.

488
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,198
But I think

489
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,952
we did our best to get our crushes
to like us back.

490
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,042
What?

491
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,714
What is this?

492
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,513
My gosh! What is this?

493
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,276
TRADITIONAL TEA HOUSE

494
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,542
You must've been surprised
to get a call from me.

495
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,337
No, it's okay.

496
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,548
What did you want to talk to me about?

497
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,426
I visited the school recently.

498
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,681
I was told Sun-ho was out with you
for on-the-job training.

499
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,685
Right. We were

500
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,521
investigating something together.

501
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,108
But the leadership professor
came out and told me

502
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,153
that Sun-ho was suspended.

503
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,576
Right, that's…

504
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,744
Professor Yu.

505
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,374
What has Sun-ho been up to?

506
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,318
NOTES FOR A GOOD INVESTIGATION

507
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,615
You must be responsible
for your own choices.

508
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,326
The most important part
of an investigation

509
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,787
is catching the culprit.

510
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,455
You're wrong, you punk.

511
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,166
The most important part of
an investigation

512
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,669
is catching the culprit.

513
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,093
What a cop needs the most is
a good partner.

514
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,263
I am wrong sometimes,
and I also make mistakes.

515
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,850
That's why every cop needs a partner

516
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,395
and why two are better than one.

517
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,438
What are you doing here?

518
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,605
Let's go together.

519
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,815
Calm down.

520
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,442
That little rat.

521
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,821
Okay. I will.

522
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,824
Don't avoid anything.

523
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:48,495
Don't stop. Just keep going.

524
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,831
You can't avoid it even if you want to.

525
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,916
Nothing will change if I stop.

526
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,917
You crazy idiot!

527
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,920
I should at least keep going
to get something out of it, right?

528
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,678
Professor Seo Sang-hak.

529
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:11,143
Justice always prevails
as long as we don't give up.

530
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,815
However, if we do not give up…

531
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,651
If the police persevere
and do not give up,

532
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,738
justice will certainly prevail.

533
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,577
So no matter what the case is,

534
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,372
let's never give up.

535
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,500
Do you understand?

536
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,043
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

537
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,012
I'm proud of you
for not dozing off in class.

538
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,180
I want to become a cop soon.

539
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,099
-Me too.
-We can do this.

540
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,995
Did you call your dad?

541
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,873
-My dad?
-Yes.

542
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,586
No.

543
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,088
I've been all over the place.

544
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,674
You know,
on the day we were at the funeral,

545
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,676
your dad visited the school.

546
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,053
What?

547
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,764
He said he was in the area
and stopped by to see you.

548
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,438
I told him you were out
with Professor Yu Dong-man

549
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,064
for on-the-job training.

550
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,818
He asked me
if things were still good between us,

551
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,862
and I said yes.

552
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,075
So if he calls you,
just explain the situation to him.

553
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,291
He bought

554
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,336
some peaches for me,

555
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,008
and he made sure
to only pick out flawless ones.

556
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,221
Tell him I'm very grateful to him

557
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,558
for cherishing me with all his heart.

558
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,736
I just thought about
how awkward it would be if we broke up

559
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:12,574
and thought all would be fine
if we didn't run into each other.

560
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,494
But I was wrong.

561
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,165
This is really hard.

562
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,169
I'm…

563
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,092
I'm really sorry, Kang-hui.

564
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,931
I thought it'd be okay for me…

565
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,519
to stay by your side if I did this.

566
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,857
I thought

567
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,610
I'd feel confident enough…

568
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,406
to be by your side

569
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,909
after I caught the culprit.

570
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,412
I thought…

571
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,207
I'd be qualified…

572
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,753
to become a police officer alongside you.

573
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,551
But that was foolish of me…

574
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,806
because I was wrong.

575
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,154
With that said…

576
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,952
Kang-hui.

577
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,996
We can go out tomorrow, you know.

578
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,585
Meet me at the front gate
at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

579
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,922
I should go.

580
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,969
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

581
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:52,400
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

582
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,787
Wait, Min-gyu.

583
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,299
WELCOME TO
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

584
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,365
Shall we?

585
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,643
AYANG FOREST OF LOVE

586
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,853
It's so pretty.

587
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,901
Why did you ask me to come here with you?

588
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,944
It's where my grandma's house is.

589
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,032
I used to live there
whenever my mom went to prison.

590
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,500
Whenever I came to this park
when I was young,

591
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,502
I always wanted to have this ice cream.

592
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,631
It wasn't even a big deal,

593
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,716
but I couldn't ask my grandma
to buy me one.

594
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,260
I guess I was always on eggshells.

595
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,556
I'm sure
Grandma didn't think much about it at all.

596
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:04,574
YU DONG-MAN

597
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,911
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

598
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,805
Shall we take photos too?

599
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,307
-I'll take one for you.
-Let's take it together.

600
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,687
Excuse me. Would you take a photo of us?

601
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,729
Sure.

602
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,815
Here. One second.

603
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,485
Stand there. In three, two, one.

604
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,530
Can you stand here?

605
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,242
Smile. In two, one.

606
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,911
All right. In three, two, one.

607
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,255
It looks nice.

608
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,557
We've never been on a proper date

609
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,436
while we were seeing each other.

610
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,565
-Kang-hui.
-I know.

611
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,612
I know you're trying to quit school.

612
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,661
I told you earlier

613
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,997
that I came here

614
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,375
every time my mom went to prison.

615
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,296
It's where I say goodbye.

616
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,423
For me, it's where

617
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,218
I said goodbye to mom, waited for her,

618
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,804
and met her again.

619
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,145
But this time, it's you.

620
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,280
I…

621
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,284
I don't want to break up with you.

622
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,621
I really don't want to,

623
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,667
but I am…

624
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,047
not good enough to stay by your side.

625
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,220
-That's why…
-Didn't you hear me?

626
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:36,559
I told you it's where I met my mom again.

627
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,066
What I'm saying is

628
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,652
that you should come back.

629
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,739
You should come back
and meet me here again.

630
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,829
When you don't have to leave me,

631
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,665
come back to me.

DISCONTINUATION REQUISITION LETTER
KANG SUN-HO

633
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,838
Please sign it for me, Professor Yu.

634
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,384
-Hey.
-I've been…

635
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,054
so grateful that you admitted me

636
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,348
into this school.

637
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,521
Thank you for letting such a fool like me

638
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:05,982
have a dream.

639
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,985
Sun-ho. Listen, you punk.

640
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:12,614
What I told Professor Seo Sang-hak…

641
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,325
I meant all of it.

642
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,538
I want to stop running away.

643
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,299
When I can stand tall with confidence,

644
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,261
I'll apply to the school again.

645
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,562
I'm sorry for everything,

646
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,774
and thank you for everything.

647
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:54,030
Having your back made me feel reassured,

648
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,700
and it was really supportive.

649
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,288
I was really happy…

Wait, Min-gyu.

654

Kang-hui,

655
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,334
Beom-tae, and Joon-wuk.

656
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,004
Please take good care of them.

657
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,715
What are you talking about?

658
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,301
You know…

659
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,138
I hope you'll cut them some slack.

660
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,517
Also…

661
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,395
next time we meet again…

662
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,774
let's be friends.

KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

669
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,117
Because it's my dream
to become a police officer.

670
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,246
Dream?

671
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:52,458
My son, Sun-ho,
wants to become a police officer.

672
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,793
Dad!

673
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,877
I…

674
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,714
I will make sure to get in!

675
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,550
Let's go.

676
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:02,844
Sun-ho.

677
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,388
Among everyone I met
at the Police University,

678
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,974
I think you would make the best cop.

679
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,476
It's not over until it's over.

680
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,145
-Third unit, we can make it!
-Yes!

681
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,771
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

682
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,440
That means you all passed, you airheads.

683
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,947
But I've actually
never given it a thought.

684
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,783
What it means to become an officer
and to protect the citizens.

685
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,369
Then you can find your answer now.

686
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,289
We just got into this school.
We just started this journey.

687
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,588
I also won't…

688
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,883
run from it any longer.

689
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:54,562
A way to protect my people.

690
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,272
The right way to protect them.

691
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:59,609
Not as Hacker Yoon,
but as a student of this school.

692
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,779
Can I find the right way

693
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,072
as I work with you?

694
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,699
You won't regret this?

695
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,787
You don't know what will happen,
who you'll meet,

696
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,873
and what kinds of dangerous things
await you.

697
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,501
Will you really be okay?

698
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,921
Yes.

699
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,839
It's because I trust him.

700
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,383
I mean Bird, not you.

701
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,927
-We won!
-Yes!

702
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,011
We won!

703
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,223
-Go, Team White!
-Go, Team White!

704
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,225
-We're invincible!
-We're invincible!

705
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,545
Son!

706
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,639
Dad.
