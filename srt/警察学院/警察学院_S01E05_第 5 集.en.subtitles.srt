00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,587
INTEGRITY, JUSTICE, HONOR

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,798
I'LL DO EVERYTHING WITH NO REGRETS

POLICE UNIVERSITY
41ST ENTRANCE CEREMONY

ALL CHARACTER, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,436
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,729
Stop right there!

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,564
That little…

9
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,774
Hey, you punk!

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,443
Professor Yu!

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,696
I said, stop!

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,115
The jerks running the illegal site
you're after…

13
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,617
They are the Police University's…

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,705
Hey, Cheol-jin.

15
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,832
It rained a lot that night,

16
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,083
so I'm not sure
what got caught on my dashcam.

17
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,001
Thank you.

18
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,544
It's a gray sedan.

19
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,714
-What's the number?
-Isn't that 4, 1?

20
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,968
-It's 4178.
-The truck gets messy.

21
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,475
This is the last piece of advice
I can give politely to a loser like you.

22
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,810
Leave without causing any trouble.

23
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,354
Wait!

24
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,775
Hey, wait!

25
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,031
Hey! Darn it.

26
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,078
What?

27
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,413
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,166
You asked for my help.

29
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,502
Do you still need my help?

30
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,837
What did you say, you punk?

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,799
You asked me to help you
catch those jerks.

32
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,676
Do you still need my help?

33
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,642
I feel like I can

34
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,603
protect those who are hurt

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,190
and catch the bad guys when I'm with you.

36
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,820
A way to protect my people.

37
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,323
The right way to protect them.

38
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,868
Not as Hacker Yoon
but as a student of this school.

39
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,663
Can I find the right way

40
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,207
as I work with you?

41
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,925
You won't regret this?

42
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,472
You don't know what will happen,
who you'll meet,

43
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,809
and what kinds of dangerous things
await you.

44
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,437
I may not be able to protect you.

45
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,940
Will you really be okay?

46
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,359
Yes.

47
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,445
Look at this punk saying yes
without any hesitation.

48
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,073
It's because I trust him.

49
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,409
I mean Bird,

50
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,119
not you.

51
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,330
He can be a little obnoxious,

52
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,541
but he'd never embarrass me.

53
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,087
You always have something to say.

54
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,340
So what's your answer?
Are we in this together?

55
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,849
Well, sure.

56
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,018
Let's do it together!

57
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,231
Then what can I do first?

58
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,191
First off…

59
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,192
Yes?

60
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,944
Go back inside and sleep, you punk.

61
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,780
-Sorry?
-You punk.

62
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,240
You shouldn't be out and about this late.

63
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,993
If you've got things to say,
talk to me during the day.

64
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,204
Don't you know
you can be punished for this?

65
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,832
Right, I'm sorry. Good night, then.

66
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,253
Hey, Kang Sun-ho!

67
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,134
Thanks.

68
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,624
One, two!

69
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,169
All right. Everyone, halt.

70
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,837
-Halt.
-One, two.

71
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,465
-All dismissed!
-Dismissed!

72
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,843
Why is he running again?

73
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,221
Where are you going?

74
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,265
-He's running again.
-Let's go eat.

75
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,975
Come on. Let's go.

76
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,351
Are you sure you won't regret it?

77
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,104
-Where?
-You won't find it.

78
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,105
-What was that?
-I'm starving.

79
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,565
You look like you saw a puppy.

80
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,401
Who? Me?

81
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,111
-When?
-Just now.

82
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,946
Looking at Kang Sun-ho.

83
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,198
What are you talking about?

84
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,616
Someone's in trouble.

85
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,995
If he looks cute to you,
then you're already into him.

86
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,500
Hey, you got the wrong idea.
What is she saying?

87
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,085
What?

88
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,296
You heard I've been going
on blind dates every weekend?

89
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,714
It's not true, right?

90
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,632
That's crazy.

91
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,384
When I close my eyes,

92
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,344
I can still hear him breathe.

93
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,389
What are you talking about? He's dead.

94
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,475
Breathe with people who are alive.

95
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,314
Professor Yu.

96
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,825
Oh, no! You're not hurt, right?

97
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,994
Gosh, what did I tell you?

98
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,329
I told you to come to the judo gym.

99
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,498
At our age, it's natural for the legs
to become weak and give out.

100
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,499
I swear I tripped.

101
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,003
Goodness. A real man
must have strong thighs.

102
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,255
Oh, dear.

103
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,798
Gosh, you.

104
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,009
Darn it.

105
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,428
The school information session
is next week, right?

106
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,931
Yes, the relations team is preparing it
this year as always.

107
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,268
The student council will assist us
with the schedule and documents.

108
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:56,147
The judo club will demonstrate
a judo performance this year.

109
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,523
-Is that so?
-Yes.

110
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,108
That's great.

111
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,781
Right. Professor Kwon,
you have a seminar on public order

112
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,990
this afternoon, right?

113
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,576
Yes. I need to leave by 1 p.m.

114
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,705
You should hurry
since you're leaving for Seoul.

115
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,624
-Can we wrap up our meeting?
-Shall we?

116
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,958
Good work.

117
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,632
Professor Yu looks like a student
when he does things like that.

118
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,967
And I must say he doesn't act his age.

119
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,969
What's wrong with it? It's cute.

120
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,525
Kang-hui!

121
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,530
Why did she have to spew such nonsense?

122
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,470
Kang-hui.

123
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,187
What was that?

124
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,689
Kang-hui.

125
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,774
Kang-hui.

126
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,112
Kang-hui.

127
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,030
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 1

128
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,784
I must've gone crazy.
What's wrong with me?

129
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,244
I must be out of my mind.

130
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,373
Kang-hui.

131
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,374
Hey!

132
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,002
You…

133
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,337
Don't make that toothy smile.

134
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,548
"Toothy"?

135
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,265
You're here. I'm glad I ran into you.

136
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,142
-Follow me.
-Sorry?

137
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,936
What's going on?

138
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,525
Why do you need to check
the dashcam of Professor Kwon?

139
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,987
We don't have much time.
I'll explain later.

140
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,655
Just stall him for ten minutes.

141
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,409
You're not going to rob his car,
are you? That's illegal…

142
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,496
Hey, I'm not robbing his car.

143
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,707
I'm just going to check
the dashcam in his car. That's all.

144
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,751
But you didn't get his permission.

145
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,045
I'll tell him later.

146
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,838
I'll check the dashcam first.

147
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,341
But still…

148
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,676
What's your problem?

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,637
Let's say someone's door is open.

150
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,013
I went into that house.

151
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,099
-Can you call that a crime?
-That's housebreaking.

152
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,561
Since I was in the house already,
I watched their TV.

153
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,562
Is that a crime?

154
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,692
I guess you can't call that a crime.

155
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,111
You see? It's the same thing!

156
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,322
But I'm sure his car is locked.

157
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,953
Professor Yu.

158
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,413
I may not be familiar
with investigation studies,

159
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,167
but I don't think it's right
to break the law while investigating.

160
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:09,131
It's most important to follow the rules
and investigate according to the law.

161
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,800
If that's difficult,
you should ask for cooperation.

162
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,009
You're wrong, you punk.

163
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,013
The most important part of
an investigation is catching the culprit.

164
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,349
You're only half right.

165
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,977
You need to follow the law
while investigating.

166
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,064
But there's only one rule
I'll follow this time.

167
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:29,277
It's to arrest the jerks
who act up and break all the rules

168
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,404
as soon as I can.

169
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,239
But still…

170
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,373
If you want to question
my method of investigating,

171
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,333
come to me after gaining some experience.

172
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,214
There's not much time. Are you in or not?

173
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,305
I'm not sure what the answer is,

174
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,059
but I hope your rules are right.

175
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,569
PROFESSOR KWON HYUK-PHIL

176
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,911
-This is driving me crazy.
-This is Kwon Hyuk-phil.

177
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,627
If you want to question
my method of investigating,

178
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,629
come to me after gaining some experience.

179
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,340
Yes, I'm on my way now.

180
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,136
Okay. Just ten minutes.

181
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,098
Professor Kwon!

182
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,489
I wanted to ask you something.

183
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,617
Now is a bad time. Let's talk later.

184
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,581
There's something
I'm really curious about.

185
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,000
I couldn't even sleep a wink last night.

186
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,252
Could you spare me a minute?

187
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,589
-What's it about?
-Sorry?

188
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,678
The thing is…

189
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,432
Right. I was reading a book about law,

190
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,602
and I was wondering
what the polygraph test was.

191
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,271
That's more related to
criminal investigation than to law.

192
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,440
Right. It's related
to criminal investigation.

193
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,070
So what I really wanted to ask you…

194
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,074
Article 329 of the Criminal Act.

195
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,992
It states that theft is conducted

196
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,371
when the offender takes the other's
belongings against their will.

197
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,291
So how is that different
from embezzlement?

198
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,876
Lies.

199
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,338
-Sorry?
-Even if your face doesn't show,

200
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,007
your body gestures can't lie.

201
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,010
The cognitive dissonance
that occurs when you speak.

202
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,303
-What's it about?
-Sorry?

203
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,806
And the movements of your pupils.

204
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,933
Touching your nose as if you're anxious.

205
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,020
And clenching your fists
as if you want to protect yourself.

206
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,859
Sun-ho,

207
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,903
is it your specialty to waste my time?

208
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,574
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,096
You must be open. No.

210
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,098
You need to be open.

211
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,783
It's most important to follow the rules
and investigate according to the law.

212
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,164
Gosh, why did he have to
make me feel guilty?

213
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,125
Whatever.

214
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,296
Just go in.

215
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,090
Just go in before I change my mind.

216
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,260
Just go in
since I'm breaking the rules anyway.

217
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,768
I can feel the stare.

218
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,146
It feels like someone caught me.

219
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,862
But don't worry.

220
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,033
Hands are faster than eyes.

221
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,921
Goodness, I didn't know
this car was yours.

222
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,840
I was just looking
because it looked so nice.

223
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,758
I saw everything.

224
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,804
-Since when?
-Since the moment you inserted that wire.

225
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,015
I see.

226
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,525
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,735
How could a professor
conspire with a student?

228
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,196
I know, right?

229
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,323
How could a professor…

230
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,205
Anyway, where were you
at 9 p.m. on March 2nd?

231
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,712
-What?
-What were you doing last Tuesday night?

232
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,759
You drove past 39-gil, Jinseon-ro.

233
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,222
There was no path
other than for truck drivers.

234
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,473
Why were you there?

235
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,561
It's not that difficult a question, is it?

236
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,229
It sounds like you're investigating me.

237
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,982
It'd be so nice
if you could just answer my question.

238
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,568
Why should I answer
such an absurd question?

239
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,695
Are you pleading the Fifth?

240
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,866
Kang Sun-ho.

241
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,285
Why are you standing there watching us?

242
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,872
-Go back inside.
-Right. I'm sorry.

243
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,503
We'll continue this conversation
after my seminar.

244
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,135
Why? Are you running away again
like you did yesterday?

245
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,307
What did you say?

246
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,392
I called you, but you ran away.

247
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
Don't cross the line.
This is my last warning.

248
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,822
I've already crossed it, you punk.

249
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,575
I've just about had enough of you, you…

250
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,493
Hey!

251
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,085
What are you guys doing?
You're professors.

252
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,381
You're yelling and screaming
when a student is watching.

253
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,633
Are you crazy? Did you lose your mind?

254
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,968
-He…
-This punk…

255
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,303
Gosh.

256
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,099
I have a temper too.

257
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,268
But I hold it in since we're at school.

258
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,272
Or should I show my temper too?

259
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,818
Goodness.

260
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,653
Where are you going? We're not done…

261
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,823
You can finish that talk with him
out of school later.

262
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,076
You should be setting a good example
to the students, not fighting.

263
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,624
You startled me…

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,418
Gosh, that punk…

265
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,670
That little…

266
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,796
-Gosh.
-Hey!

267
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,007
-Gosh, seriously.
-Does he have a death wish?

268
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,425
You punk!

269
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,348
You can't even do one thing
you're told to do!

270
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,392
You should have clung to his pants,

271
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,520
or you should have
knocked him down or something.

272
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,605
That's the basics of investigation.

273
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,982
Right. I don't know that.

274
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,317
I got in last week.

275
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,361
Investigation Studies
was canceled all week.

276
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,822
I didn't have the time
to learn the basics.

277
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,287
You punk, stop talking nonsense.

278
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,039
What? You didn't have the time?

279
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:24,126
Is that what a student
of this school should be saying?

280
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,755
Before you say something smart to me,
study investigation first.

281
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,215
Jeez.

282
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,846
What is it?

283
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,306
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

284
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,516
Hey, you punk. Are you serious?

285
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,228
You made Detective Joo ask
for a warrant from the prosecutor?

286
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,148
You punk, are you out of your mind?

287
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,738
What am I supposed to do then?

288
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,991
We should at least get a warrant
to get Cheol-jin's phone records.

289
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,411
I know, but why are you doing that?

290
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,999
I know how you feel.

291
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,086
But you're not on this team,
and you don't have the authority.

292
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,170
Didn't I tell you that?

293
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,797
That's what I mean.

294
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,674
If you know how I feel,
then let's get them.

295
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,760
Let's catch those scumbags.

296
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,932
I see. You're going to be
arbitrary like that,

297
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,810
and you'll stop
when Detective Joo gets hurt, right?

298
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,106
Gosh.

299
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,609
You're not the only supervisor
of Cheol-jin and Eun-ju.

300
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,198
I get why you're being so arbitrary
and making a fuss like this.

301
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,826
But if you keep
getting my team into trouble,

302
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,786
I won't let you be.

303
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,919
I'm sorry for handling it

304
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,838
like that.

305
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,112
You're not the only supervisor
of Cheol-jin and Eun-ju.

306
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,204
KIM EUN-JU
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

307
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,290
Hey, where are you going?

308
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,542
We've got the IP address
of the illegal gambling ring,

309
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,751
so we're going out to investigate.

310
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,588
But why are you going out, Sergeant Kim?

311
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,924
Well, they were on my radar
in the first place.

312
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,927
Gosh, it could be dangerous.

313
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,015
Don't worry.
I won't die before my wedding.

314
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,810
Right, did you give
the invitation to Captain Choi?

315
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,811
Not yet.

316
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,189
We're having a gathering tomorrow,
so I'll give it to him then.

317
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,315
I see.

318
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,943
Captain Choi will be shocked.

319
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,070
He will be shocked indeed.

320
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,578
When he sees the name of the groom.

321
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,606
-Eun-ju.
-Hey, hold on.

322
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,066
Gosh, wait.

323
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,235
-Eun-ju. Let me go.
-Dong-man.

324
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,819
-Wait.
-Dong-man.

325
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,488
-Calm down.
-Gosh.

326
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,447
Eun-ju!

327
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,867
Eun-ju! Let me go!

328
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,579
-Let go of me!
-Dong-man.

329
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,122
Eun-ju!

330
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,294
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

331
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,735
YU DONG-MAN, KIM EUN-JU

332
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,287
MARCH 9TH, 2019, SATURDAY 2 P.M.

333
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,180
Hey, start from the shoulder
and land on your back.

334
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,891
Is Sun-ho not here yet?

335
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,603
He said he's meeting the relations team
and the student council for arrangements.

336
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:58,233
Well, he left his phone in the dorm,
so I couldn't tell him.

337
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,901
I will go find him.

338
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,614
Again.

339
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,075
Yes, that's right.

340
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,828
A police university student
should try to learn on his own.

341
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,912
GENERAL INTRODUCTION
TO INVESTIGATION STUDIES

342
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,126
But still, what did I do so wrong?

343
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,322
I got you.

344
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,828
Shouldn't you go to the gym right now?

345
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,747
No, it's okay.

346
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,833
It's for the school information session,
and I'll be practicing tomorrow as well.

347
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,045
By the way,
are you going to read all these?

348
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,963
Is this the spirit of the freshman?

349
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,257
-I'm going to study.
-I see.

350
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,300
By the way, Na-rae.

351
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,555
How can I acquire
dashcam footage as legal evidence?

352
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,266
Well, you need to get a warrant.

353
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,019
A faster way, other than that.

354
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,146
Request cooperation?

355
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,317
But do freshmen learn
about evidence acquisition?

356
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,987
Well, I wanted to study in advance.

357
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,281
Good for you.

358
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,326
Since I'm a straight-A student
in Investigation Studies,

359
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,786
should I teach you about it?

360
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,496
-You're a straight-A student?
-Of course.

361
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,124
That's amazing. Really?

362
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,167
How did you study for it?

363
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,919
-Well…
-I'm really bad at it.

364
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,712
I knew it.

365
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,882
If you teach me, I'll treat you.

366
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,137
I told him not to smile with his teeth.

367
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,055
I'll teach you if you ask.

368
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,433
If you teach me,
I'll learn with all my heart.

369
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,645
Okay. Then drop the honorifics.

370
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,730
Excuse me. Hello.

371
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,108
Can I take Sun-ho with me?

372
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,569
I need to talk to him
about the information session.

373
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,154
Well…

374
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,703
You should have called me.
I would have come right away.

375
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,373
No worries. Then again,
it's not that important.

376
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,878
And about that investigation studies…

377
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,590
Why don't you try image training
before you read all those books?

378
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,967
You should become
both the assailant and the victim.

379
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,223
Think before you learn from someone else.
When are you going to think on your own?

380
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,032
What? You didn't have the time?

381
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,994
Is that what a student
of this school should be saying?

382
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,753
Think before you learn from someone else.
When are you going to think on your own?

383
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,426
Hold on. What's the deal
with Professor Kwon Hyuk-phil?

384
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:14,888
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

385
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,514
If you're still awake, come here at once.

386
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,187
He can come here if he needs me.
Why should I go?

387
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,573
-Why are you still up?
-Why didn't you have dinner?

388
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,326
I asked you first, you brat.

389
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,999
You know, the dashcam.

390
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,086
I was looking up ways
we can get our hands on it lawfully.

391
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,837
And?

392
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,631
First, try requesting a warrant…

393
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,007
And if it was declined?

394
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,842
Then…

395
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,262
Ask to view the evidence…

396
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,181
What if the suspect might destroy it?

397
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,476
-"Suspect"?
-The day of Cheol-jin's accident,

398
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,355
there was a vehicle tailing him
on the same road, at the same time.

399
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,693
The vehicle belongs to Professor Kwon.

400
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,655
That's why I wanted to check
the dashcam footage.

401
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,367
Maybe he just happened to be driving by
because it's near the school.

402
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,370
How do we know if it was a coincidence
or if it was staged as such?

403
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,166
When you're investigating,
you must leave open all possibilities.

404
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,752
You never know when
and where something will turn up

405
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,546
and blindside you.

406
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,934
This is all the material I collected
while chasing the illegal gambling ring.

407
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,438
Every single page is the outcome
of the detectives' hard work

408
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,481
and countless sleepless nights.

409
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,400
I'll come back in a month.

410
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,693
Sit back down.

411
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,031
I'll give you a brief rundown,
so listen up.

412
00:26:56,114 --> 00:27:00,118
The Cybercrimes Unit found out
about a new illegal gambling site

413
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,703
that accepts cryptocurrency.

414
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,164
In our joint investigation with them,

415
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,375
my team found out
that this site was actually

416
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,794
a huge enterprise
operating on and off-line.

417
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,547
Which is why Cheol-jin and I

418
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,258
started doing the legwork.

419
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,302
LEGWORK

420
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,470
In law enforcement,

421
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,971
"legwork" refers to the process

422
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,098
of collecting information
necessary to solve a case.

423
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,268
We also use other techniques
to figure out the motive

424
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,645
and confirm the location
of the crime scene.

425
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,440
An existing modus operandi
can also be used

426
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,524
to uncover additional crimes.

427
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,319
We can also trace stolen goods
and refer to things

428
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,696
like forensic analyses,
phone records, and alibis.

429
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,282
Here's an example.

430
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,869
If the police receive a tip that there is

431
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:47,499
an illegal gambling site
that accepts cryptocurrency…

432
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,710
The police will launch an investigation.

433
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,837
Correct.

434
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,340
During the investigation,
the police find out

435
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,219
that the gambling site
also runs an off-line casino,

436
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,223
so they make a move to catch the person
who actually manages it.

437
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,891
What would that be?

438
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,934
Legwork.

439
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:13,024
Then the police find out
that they use a unique game terminal

440
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,567
that they created.

441
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,904
The police plant a tracker
in the terminal,

442
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,990
so they can track it
and raid the operational headquarters.

443
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,626
They're using the modus operandi, I guess?

444
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,711
"I guess"?

445
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,922
They're using the modus operandi!

446
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,092
Lower your voice, you punk.

447
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,093
Yes, sir.

448
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,222
But they can no longer track it
due to an unexpected accident.

449
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,891
However, they've obtained a program

450
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,644
that lets them trace
major cryptocurrency accounts.

451
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,397
So the police could've caught those jerks
by tracing the transactions

452
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,482
when they were turning
their coins into cash.

453
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
But I stepped in and hacked the site.

454
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,569
Exactly!

455
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,409
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,953
Well, anyway,

457
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,790
so they moved all their major accounts,
the site's now gone,

458
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,750
Cheol-jin got hurt,

459
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,545
and the investigation
is back to square one.

460
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,590
But why do you think that
the person who attacked Mr. Park

461
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,216
was involved in the gambling site?

462
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,929
The jerks running the illegal site
you're after…

463
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,432
They are the Police University's…

464
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,768
Hey, Cheol-jin.

465
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,688
It's just my hunch as a detective.

466
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:41,404
But do you really think we can catch them?

467
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,824
Listen carefully.

468
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,036
No matter how competent
you are as a detective,

469
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,207
you can't control everything
or predict unexpected situations.

470
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,544
That's why some cases are
solved in a few months,

471
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,130
whereas some take decades to be solved.

472
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,591
During that process…

473
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,098
you may have the misfortune
of losing your colleagues on the job

474
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,853
And in some cases, the offenders
end up committing additional crimes.

475
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,566
Each metropolitan precinct's investigation
budget is 300,000 won a month.

476
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,318
The case investigation budget
is only 180,000 won,

477
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,364
which means there are times
when we end up losing suspects

478
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,077
due to our low budget,
which is ridiculous.

479
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,124
However,

480
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,211
if we do not give up…

481
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,965
If the police persevere
and do not give up,

482
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,093
justice will certainly prevail.

483
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,723
So no matter what the case is,

484
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,602
let's never give up.

485
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,605
Do you understand?

486
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,065
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

487
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,947
LECTURE HALL

488
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,032
Let's go. I'm hungry.

489
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,870
-What? What is it?
-Where's Sun-ho?

490
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,330
Gosh, you scared me.
He told me we can go ahead.

491
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,290
Did he?

492
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,501
Professor, I thought
about what we could do.

493
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,087
How about we cause a minor collision

494
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,756
and ask him to show us
his dashcam footage?

495
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,884
That's not against the law.

496
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,597
-I'm sorry.
-No.

497
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:36,394
You're right.
That's like a sting operation.

498
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,355
-Right?
-As long as we get what we need.

499
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,648
Let's go.

500
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:46,988
What's up?

501
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,867
The thing you wanted to get your hands on

502
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,535
by causing a scene
at the parking that day.

503
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,435
FISHING GROUND MANAGEMENT OFFICE
RESTAURANT

504
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,396
It looks like you were mistaken.

505
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,778
Isn't there a program that tells you
whether videos were manipulated?

506
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,862
Go check.

507
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,782
Where are you going?

508
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,702
Captain.

509
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,918
Right, the book.

510
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,920
Gosh.

511
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,338
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

512
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,257
Don't tell me people here look down on you

513
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,511
because you're not
a Police University graduate.

514
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,763
What's with you?
Don't you know what I'm like?

515
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,349
It's not like your heart is made of steel.

516
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,981
I know you also get hurt
by people's words, just like I do.

517
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,442
Gosh, what's with you today?
Are you not feeling well?

518
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,695
You see,

519
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,324
I knew you and Eun-ju
were planning on getting married.

520
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,621
I thought feigning ignorance
would help you move on.

521
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,791
So I pretended not to know until now.

522
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,214
If that's what you're here to say,
just go. I don't want to hear it.

523
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,175
While trying to track down
the gambling ring…

524
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,136
Yes, we lost Eun-ju.

525
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,597
But that was an accident, you fool.

526
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,603
Dong-man, let's not turn Eun-ju's death
into one of those pathetic, soppy movies.

527
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:44,897
Yes.

528
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,525
Eun-ju's death two years ago
was an accident.

529
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,903
But Cheol-jin's case is different.
It was not an accident.

530
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,575
So please, Captain.

531
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,870
Just like how you pretended not to know

532
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,663
about me and Eun-ju all this time,

533
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,999
turn a blind eye to this
just a bit longer.

534
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,753
I must catch those jerks no matter what.

535
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,048
I want to finish
what Eun-ju was working on,

536
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,758
so help me out here.

537
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,598
Gosh, you crazy punk.

538
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,729
I brought you Cheol-jin's phone records.

539
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,150
There isn't much,
but you'll see a suspicious number.

540
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,485
It's a burner phone.

541
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,698
If you just start digging
and end up getting hurt like Cheol-jin,

542
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,949
you're dead meat.

543
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,204
Gosh, he never listens to me.

544
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,458
You're not even giving me a cup of coffee?

545
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,183
ILLEGAL GAMBLING RING, DEAD POLICE OFFICER

546
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,728
SERGEANT KIM EUN-JU DIES IN CAR ACCIDENT
DURING ILLEGAL GAMBLING SITE INVESTIGATION

547
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,900
THE LATE SERGEANT KIM EUN-JU

548
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,743
-How are you?
-I'm totally fine.

549
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,538
Gosh, I can't wait to get out of here.

550
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,665
It sounds like you're back
to your old self.

551
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,501
How come you sound so down?

552
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,128
Just hang up.

553
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,135
I wish it'd rain.

554
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,387
Why is the weather so nice?

555
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,806
Professor Yu.

556
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,726
Hey.

557
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,937
The dashcam footage wasn't fabricated.

558
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,397
And the timecodes
aren't fabricated either.

559
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,901
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

560
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,613
-Okay.
-Professor Yu.

561
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,700
Let me come along.

562
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,036
-To where?
-Aren't you going to the fishing place?

563
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,541
Let's watch the footage together
and listen to their statements.

564
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,085
-And check the scene too.
-What about the roll call?

565
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,129
-I can go alone.
-No.

566
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,256
Let me come along.

567
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,886
You said all sorts of variables
could stab us in the back

568
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,221
during an investigation.

569
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,225
Wouldn't it be better
if there are two of us?

570
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,361
-Here.
-What's that?

571
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,198
PERMISSION SLIP, KANG SUN-HO

572
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,324
PERSONAL REASONS
APPROVED BY YU DONG-MAN

573
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,162
What… This is…

574
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,832
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY,

575
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,168
It's him. Professor Kwon.

576
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,170
He comes two to three times a week.

577
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,257
Why is he so obsessed with fishing?

578
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,134
That's not why he comes.

579
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,803
People who come here
often have problems of their own

580
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,307
because they're distressed
about the money they lost.

581
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,851
Professor Kwon gives them legal advice.

582
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,605
Is that working?

583
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,440
Of course it is.

584
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,254
We've confirmed Professor Kwon's alibi.

585
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:43,386
The time Cheol-jin hung up
the phone was 9:14 p.m.

586
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,350
Sir, is there a sidewalk

587
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,852
that leads to this fishing place?

588
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,024
It's exactly 1,300m away
from here to the scene.

589
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,278
If you can get there within eight minutes,

590
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,196
then Professor Kwon's alibi
won't be valid.

591
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,949
By the way,

592
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,078
may I ask why you are so desperate to
find out whether he's the culprit or not?

593
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,083
I mean, I don't think it's reasonable
to doubt him just because

594
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,460
he was on the same road
at the same time that day.

595
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,429
These are the footprints
of the culprit left at the scene

596
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,638
where Cheol-jin was attacked.

597
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,767
Because it rained that night,
we couldn't preserve them as evidence.

598
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,645
But I could presume his size.
It was 285mm.

599
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,063
His feet are quite big.

600
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,775
Then could Professor Kwon's size…

601
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,309
That's right. His shoe size is 285mm.

602
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,563
Do you need any more reasonable doubts?

603
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,651
Let's go.

604
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,654
He didn't even follow the procedure.

605
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,157
How could he take a student with him?

606
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,993
You're right.

607
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,665
It looks like Professor Yu
likes to put us in a pickle.

608
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,668
Gosh, Professor Seo!

609
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,253
You scared me.

610
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,175
Let's see.

611
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:51,472
Where could a professor
and a student have gone so late at night?

612
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,852
I think it's somewhat romantic.

613
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,464
How long did we take?

614
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,466
Eight minutes and five seconds.

615
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,509
You see?

616
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,095
If we walked a little faster,
it'd have worked.

617
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,139
Yes, I was right.

618
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,100
It's highly likely
that he got himself caught

619
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,602
on the surveillance camera
and walked to the scene.

620
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,231
That sly punk.
I'm going to get him no matter what.

621
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,859
Professor Yu.

622
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,154
If it's proven that the suspect

623
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,905
couldn't have reached the scene
within the given time,

624
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,532
then he'll be cleared of a charge

625
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,326
because his alibi could be
interpreted differently, right?

626
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,578
That's true,

627
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,123
but in this case, he lied about his alibi.

628
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,043
What is it?

629
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,753
The rain.

630
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,547
What?

631
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,215
You said it rained
on the day of the incident.

632
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,345
That day, it says
there was 15mm of rain per hour.

633
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,308
The stone bridge we came across
sinks when it rains here.

634
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,651
Even if he made it out of the bridge,

635
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,362
he wouldn't have gotten here
within eight minutes.

636
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,534
You taught us
that we need to exclude the suspect

637
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,952
from the list of suspects

638
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,788
if his alibi is valid
so that we can specify another suspect.

639
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,583
Gosh.

640
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,752
So…

641
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,087
Professor Kwon should be

642
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,965
excluded from the list of suspects.

643
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,765
I'm rather glad though.

644
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,352
That a professor
from our school isn't a suspect.

645
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,793
Do you think I'm pathetic?

646
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,548
Because I missed the things
that you caught when you're my student?

647
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,841
Not at all.

648
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,135
I didn't realize it before,

649
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,346
but it's really difficult

650
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,390
to chase someone

651
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,601
and catch someone.

652
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,271
My emotions get in the way
of my reasoning.

653
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,606
So how could a professor
be better than a student?

654
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,945
Then what do you think is important?

655
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,738
You know.

656
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,241
People matter the most.

657
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,382
I don't even know how
investigations work, so I'm sorry

658
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,552
for mentioning rules and the law.

659
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,098
You can keep doing that.

660
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:22,850
Sorry?

661
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,645
When I do whatever I want
for my investigation,

662
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,690
you should put a stop to that.

663
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,860
I can't always be right.

664
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,738
I am wrong sometimes,
and I also make mistakes.

665
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,198
Just like you said, I'm a human too.

666
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,245
That's why every cop needs a partner

667
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,832
and why two are better than one.

668
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,258
Anyway, about today…

669
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,845
You just got lucky,

670
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,016
so don't get all arrogant.
Behave yourself, okay?

671
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,768
Yes, sir.

672
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,396
So we can put Professor Kwon
in the clear now, right?

673
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,066
In the clear, my foot.

674
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,110
Now, there's just less chance
of him being the culprit.

675
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,029
-Professor.
-Which is why

676
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,032
we should go and ask him directly.

677
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,701
If he really isn't the culprit,

678
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,037
we will apologize to him properly.

679
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,876
Hey, this reminds me…

680
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,755
I need you to look into this now.

681
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,550
It's Cheol-jin's call log.

682
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,761
CALL LOG

683
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,515
I shall tell you more
when I'm back from the restroom.

684
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,521
My gosh!

685
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,856
Professor Yu seems quite drunk.

686
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,484
No! My goodness.

687
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,819
Let me see.

688
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,238
-My goodness!
-Gosh…

689
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,906
Let me.

690
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,743
Goodness, I'm so sorry.

691
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,871
Right, I'm sure it wasn't intentional.

692
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,836
Don't tell me…

693
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,798
you did that on purpose. Did you?

694
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,385
No, they just slipped out of my hands.

695
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,012
I guess it's an important document.
I'm really sorry.

696
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:28,642
Right, let's try using a hairdryer.
I'll go get it quickly. Give me a second.

697
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:33,021
Goodness. We can just print another copy!

698
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,872
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,875
Then the student council
will manage the attendees

700
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,751
of the school information session.

701
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:55,919
Sure.

702
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,467
The Chungram Sports Festival
is around the corner.

703
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,384
Yes.

704
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,722
I heard the team that wins
will be granted special leave.

705
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,891
Really? That is awesome.

706
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,727
With that said, Kang-hui…

707
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,522
If you're okay with it,
on your first day off…

708
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,857
Kang-hui.

709
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,026
I'm sorry I'm late.

710
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,695
The books were due today,
so I had to stop by the library.

711
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,531
Why did you run
when you knew you'd be late anyway?

712
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,492
-Have some water.
-Thanks.

713
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,793
Thanks, I went through it.

714
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,130
Let me ask you one last question.

715
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,467
Are you sure you only went to
the fishing grounds that night?

716
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,928
Were you really there the whole time?

717
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,723
Look, Professor Yu.

718
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,851
I'm doing this to confirm
so that I can stop suspecting you,

719
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,020
so please answer my question.

720
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,149
I was there the whole time.

721
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,734
Are we good now?

722
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,614
Then did you see anyone on the road…

723
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,573
I did.

724
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,327
On my way to the fishing grounds,

725
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,497
I saw someone throwing up
on the side of the road.

726
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,003
He wobbled a bit. I guess he was drunk.

727
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,422
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

728
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,509
Exactly, shouldn't you
have asked about that first?

729
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,928
Before you tried to break into my car?

730
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,979
A junior colleague of mine got attacked
by an unidentified man near the school.

731
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,941
I thought anyone here could be a suspect,

732
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,735
so I made the mistake of suspecting you.

733
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,907
I apologize for my rudeness.
I admit that it was out of line.

734
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,994
This will not happen again.

735
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,792
That's all?

736
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,383
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY
JUDO CLUB

737
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,931
I accept your apology,
but it won't really cut it.

738
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,892
Let's have a match and let it all go.

739
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,936
Sure, I'm totally fine with that.

740
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,689
But your legs are awfully weak.

741
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,400
Are you going to fight with your mouth?

742
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,820
-Let's begin.
-The first one to get a point wins.

743
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,614
Ready, start!

744
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,032
-Come on!
-Bring it on!

745
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,586
-My nails…
-What happened?

746
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,046
Are you okay?

747
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,269
Gosh, let go.

748
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,981
Hey! Darn it!

749
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,903
-He's really cute.
-Goodness gracious.

750
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,114
-Hey, move your feet.
-Okay.

751
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,325
Are you done cleaning?

752
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,119
We're almost done!

753
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,331
I heard some students sneak out
after the evening roll call.

754
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,918
You know you'll get
30 penalty points for that, right?

755
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,672
If you sneak into
the dormitory of the opposite sex,

756
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,884
you'll face disciplinary action
regardless of the reason,

757
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,552
so you'd better keep that in mind.

758
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,637
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

759
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,973
OH KANG-HUI

760
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,524
I feel like those few stressful days
gave me wrinkles.

761
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,623
It's today, right?

762
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,874
Yes.

763
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:11,383
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

764
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,428
Are you all excited to be here today?

765
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,722
I'm Kang Myeong-jung in my second year.

766
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,806
It's nice to meet you all.

767
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:21,017
You do need good grades to get into
the Korean National Police University,

768
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,686
but a strong sense of duty
is equally important.

769
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,521
The police emblem you see here

770
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,357
shows a sea eagle soaring
with the rose of Sharon.

771
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,568
Only then can you become a police officer.

772
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,361
I suggest you all give it a shot.

773
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:35,407
You'll be expelled if you engage
in an inappropriate relationship.

774
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:39,828
"For the Nation, Justice, and our Honor."
It's the Police University's motto.

775
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,955
On the left,
you see the Coexistence Tower.

776
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,172
Hey!

777
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,798
JUDO CLUB

778
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,738
Here comes the food!

779
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,907
Here.

780
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,242
-You three can share it.
-Over here!

781
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,952
-Fried chicken.
-Thank you.

782
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,125
-Enjoy the sausages.
-Here's your drink.

783
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,419
-Attention!
-Okay.

784
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,629
Professor Kwon wants to say something.

785
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,381
Everyone in the student council,
the judo club, and the relations team.

786
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,758
You all did a great job today.

787
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,136
By the way, where's the professor
in charge of the relations team?

788
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,639
There he is!

789
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,189
No, I don't want to.

790
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,069
Why did you step out when we were deciding
who'd be in charge of each club?

791
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,365
I trust that you'll do your best
to promote our school.

792
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,454
-Here we go
-Here we go

793
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,497
Bunny!

794
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,706
Bunny!

795
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,707
Bunny!

796
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,792
-Bunny!
-Bunny!

797
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,460
-Bunny!
-It's you!

798
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,712
-Busted!
-I saw it too!

799
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,423
-Park Min-gyu and Kang Sun-ho lost!
-You lost!

800
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,425
Drink up

801
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,302
-Drink until you drop
-Drink until you drop

802
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,387
Go for it.

803
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,472
-Bottoms up!
-My gosh!

804
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,143
-What's wrong?
-I have to use the restroom…

805
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,773
Clearly, the student council
can't beat the judo club.

806
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:36,695
Exactly. Even the professor in charge is…

807
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,823
Sober up, will you?
Let's not forget that we're professors.

808
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,741
-Here.
-What are you doing? Drink up.

809
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,119
-Thank you.
-Wait! I'll come to your rescue.

810
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,329
-What?
-She'll drink that for him?

811
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,831
-What is going on?
-My goodness.

812
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,583
She saved me.

813
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,626
Hey, try to sober up.

814
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,257
I drank it for you,
so I get to tell you my wish.

815
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,801
Yes, go ahead. I'll grant your wish.

816
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,512
Then have a judo match
with me every night.

817
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,767
-My gosh!
-Every night?

818
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,020
-You little…
-What…

819
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,276
Why do you keep stepping on my shoe?

820
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,819
My foot hurts.

821
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,279
Follow me.

822
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,244
What is wrong with you?

823
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,496
Can you sober up or not?

824
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,417
Gosh, I'm sorry. Your foot…
I hurt your foot.

825
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,377
I'm so dizzy.

826
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,380
Hey. You only had three glasses.

827
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,965
Will you pull yourself together?

828
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,426
I'm so sorry!

829
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,890
My. Kang Sun-ho!

830
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,354
How old are you?

831
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,398
I was born in 1980.

832
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,944
-Why are you asking that?
-I'm the same age as you!

833
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,862
What? All three of us are the same age.

834
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,364
Let's be friends.

835
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,908
-Hyuk-phil.
-I already have many friends.

836
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,620
Then why don't just the two of us
become friends?

837
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,332
This is an official event.
Why don't we wrap this up and go home?

838
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,711
My gosh, have this before you go.
It's on the house.

839
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,171
It's a stir-fried gizzard!

840
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,757
You're so kind, Professor Go.

841
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,801
Professor?

842
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,594
You were a professor?

843
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:30,016
I taught the kids how to use
their knives in real-life situations.

844
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,353
That's when they started
to call me Professor Go.

845
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,480
"In real-life situations"?

846
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:39,150
I was convicted twice.

847
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:43,238
Don't worry. I haven't
caused any trouble for ten years.

848
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,906
I'm running a pub
near the Police University

849
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,950
so that I can lead a good life.

850
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,873
My gosh, you're so funny.

851
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,296
Is there another pub near here
other than this place?

852
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,549
There are some.

853
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,010
But Professor Go's pub is the best one.

854
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,303
It's like a hideout for us.

855
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,307
Sir, do you remember the guy
whom I came with

856
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,269
who has a big build and a deep voice?

857
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:17,188
He'd go, "Hey, Dong-man."

858
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,315
You know that detective, right?

859
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,026
Of course I do.

860
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,570
You're talking about that detective
with broad shoulders, right?

861
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,948
Did he drink here last Tuesday?

862
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,035
Last Tuesday?

863
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,120
Did he?

864
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,541
Gosh, I can't even remember
what happened yesterday.

865
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,752
Of course. That's only natural.

866
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,920
I can't even remember
what happened yesterday.

867
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,798
By the way, do you have
surveillance cameras?

868
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,550
You must have one since it's a pub.

869
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,140
-Kang-hui, it's so cold.
-Be quiet.

870
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,392
-Why isn't he picking up?
-It's so cold.

871
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,935
-Just hold still.
-It's so cold.

872
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,105
He's so heavy. What do I do?

873
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,275
KANG-HUI

874
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:05,320
Hey, do you think it's really okay
to ignore her call?

875
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,654
You punk!

876
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:10,366
If you're a loyal friend,
you shouldn't pick up.

877
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,744
I know this best.

878
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,037
Wait, what time is it now?

879
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,332
-It's 1 a.m.
-What?

880
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,751
-If they get caught outside…
-They'll face disciplinary action!

881
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,044
-No!
-Gosh!

882
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,380
-Goodness.
-I can't walk.

883
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,341
-Hey.
-Gosh, this is crazy.

884
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,134
Hey, get up.

885
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,140
Hey, you need to walk quietly.

886
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,392
If we get caught,
we'll get disciplinary action.

887
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,020
-Gosh.
-I got this.

888
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,148
Here it is.

889
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,990
Darn it.

890
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,122
Got you, you rats.

891
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,833
Gosh.

892
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,485
These rats.
They're having fun, aren't they?

893
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,246
Gosh, what's this?

894
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,420
Wait a minute.

895
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,507
I will get you no matter what.
Do you hear me?

896
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,594
-What was that?
-This is fun.

897
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,306
I got you, you rats.

898
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,686
Where are they?

899
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,980
I'm going to remove all these stairs.

900
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,699
Kang-hui…

901
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,034
Be quiet.

902
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,329
This is driving me crazy.

903
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,789
Let me see.

904
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,592
STORAGE
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

905
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,598
The codes of behavior
within the residence hall.

906
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,725
Article One.

907
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:44,812
Students cannot enter the residence hall
of the opposite sex for private reasons.

908
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,606
Article Two.

909
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,150
Students must have
strictly wholesome relationships,

910
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,904
and they cannot go beyond moral limits.

911
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,822
I can't breathe!

912
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,823
Please keep quiet.

913
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,409
Article Three.

914
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,872
If a student here makes
physical contact to show sexual desire

915
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,417
and does something to disgrace
the Korean National Police University,

916
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:12,215
they will be expelled instantly.

917
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,216
"Expelled"?

918
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,593
I can't be expelled.

919
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,637
Come on, Kang-hui.

920
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,013
Will you be quiet?

921
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,267
Oh Kang-hui!

922
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,603
Oh Kang-hui!

923
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,480
Oh Kang-hui!

924
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,274
-They will be expelled instantly.
-Oh Kang-hui!

925
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,901
-They will be expelled instantly!
-Oh…

926
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,361
-They will be expelled instantly!
-Oh…

927
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,113
You will be expelled!

928
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,952
Oh Kang-hui, you'll be expelled!

929
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,833
SPECIAL THANKS TO HWANG SEUNG-UN

930
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,788
Since it's her mother's trial,
Kang-hui must want to go.

931
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,748
If we win at Chungram Sports Festival,
we'll get special leave, right?

932
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,250
Who on earth are you?

933
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,752
I'll do anything to help you.

934
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,671
So let's participate
in Chungram Sports Festival first.

935
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,922
What did you do to Kang-hui?

936
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,508
What else can happen between
a man and a woman in a storage room?

937
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,550
What are you imagining?

938
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,136
-You crazy punk.
-I should take responsibility.

939
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,722
I'm going to win this
to give my special leave to Kang-hui.

940
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,601
If he's the culprit, he will show up
on the day of Chungram Sports Festival.

941
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,895
I got you, punk!
