00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,515
How do you think a hacker

7
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,601
ended up in the Police University?

12

00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,507

YU DONG-MAN

17
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,137
Did he help you?

18
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,935
Who are you?

19
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,859
Who are you?

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,788
YU DONG-MAN

PROFESSOR'S OFFICE

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,954
Professors, are you leaving just now?

23
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,266
If this report is revealed,
both you and Yu Dong-man

24
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,226
are finished.

25
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,605
No.

26
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,945
Put your phone down.

27
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,490
Yu Dong-man can't save you now.

28
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,117
Only I can.

29
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,757
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

30
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,806
Do as I say.

31
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,684
Then I'll destroy this report for you.

32
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,939
The choice is yours, Kang Sun-ho.

33
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,443
Will you join hands with me and live?

34
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,403
Or…

35
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,243
will you fall off the cliff
with Yu Dong-man?

00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,549
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

37

YU DONG-MAN

38
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,144
Hey, go ahead.

39
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,688
The number you told me.

40
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,231
It doesn't exist anymore.

41
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,568
The last signal it picked up.
Do you have its location?

42
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,571
Yes. The locations overlap,

43
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,615
but it's near KNPU.

44
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,953
All right. Thanks.

45
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,047
Aren't you going to the meeting?

46
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,508
Just a second.

47
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,765
The investigation is over, and
you caught the caught. What's wrong?

48
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,269
I mean, the lights in your office

49
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,229
didn't go out the whole night.

50
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,398
What about you?

51
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,862
The lights in the judo stadium
were on all night too.

52
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,243
I guess you've been observing me as well.

53
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,915
The senior class is graduating soon
and they'll be joining the field.

54
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,585
I've been busy trying
to teach them all the techniques.

55
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,922
You should go home early.

56
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,468
-It's dangerous at night.
-Then I'll go home early today

57
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,011
while the sun is still up.

58
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,141
PROFESSOR KWON HYUK-PHIL

59
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,484
Our shirts are in matching colors.

60
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,195
Let's go.

61
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,995
Let's finish this quickly
and go save our seats.

62
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,080
We must sit in the front row.

63
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,790
I know. I heard special lecturers

64
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,917
share a lot of their experiences.

65
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,338
Do you know who the special lecturer is?

66
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,464
Of course.

67
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,636
Joon-wuk.

68
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,055
It's not like I know everything.

69
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,726
Where is Sun-ho?

70
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,269
He said he's not feeling well,

71
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,604
so he's skipping breakfast.

72
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,564
What? Why? How sick is he?

73
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,236
Kang-hui, it's not like I know everything.

74
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,073
Hurry up.

75
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,838
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

76
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,322
He's not even picking up. Where did he go?

77
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,706
-Is the lecturer from the agency?
-I'm not sure.

78
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,667
You guys should go ahead.

79
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,882
The special lecture is starting soon.
Aren't you coming?

80
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,509
I am.

81
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,304
Did you see Sun-ho, by any chance?

82
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,725
It looked like he left
for the special lecture already.

83
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,602
Oh, really?

84
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,689
Let's get going. We might be late.

85
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,733
Okay.

86
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,459
YU DONG-MAN

87
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,437
-Hey, Beom-tae.
-Sun-ho, why aren't you coming?

88
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,612
Sorry.

89
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,948
About what?

90
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:57,828
The bracelet. I made all that fuss,
taking it and returning it to you again.

91
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,832
Is that from Sun-ho?

92
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,334
Sorry?

93
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,878
Oh, yes.

94
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,507
It's a bit tacky.

95
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,259
No, it's not.

96
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,261
Yes, it is.

97
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,180
It's cute! I like that it's red.

98
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,391
Sun-ho!

99
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,694
KNPU ALUMNUS SPECIAL LECTURE
WHAT IS "JUSTICE"?

100
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,154
Over here!

101
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,865
I saved your seats. Come here.

102
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,536
Hey, Min-gyu. I saved three seats.

103
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,092
You didn't even pick up your phone.
Where were you?

104
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,263
Oh, I couldn't check my phone.
I went to see Professor Yu.

105
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,224
Are you okay now?
I heard you weren't feeling well.

106
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,393
I'm okay.

107
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,646
The lecture is starting.

108
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,324
Hello, sir.

109
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,161
Hey, Senior Inspector Yu.

110
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,370
They got the real culprit.

111
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,664
They caught him?

112
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,374
I can tell who's guilty.

113
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,419
They can't hide their feelings
in that instant.

114
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,795
Senior Inspector Yu.

115
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,131
Good job.

116
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,973
Today's special lecturer is
the fifth batch of our university

117
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,267
and the head
of the Criminal Investigation Department

118
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,020
at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency,
Chief Han Jeong-sik.

119
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,396
Please give him a big hand.

120
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,823
It's nice to meet you. I'm Han Jeong-sik.

121
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,371
What's the occasion?
You never ask me for a cup of tea.

122
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,332
I was free, so…

123
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,000
I see.

124
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:16,300
Has it been around 30 years
since you started working here?

125
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,760
My goodness.

126
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,888
It's been 28 years, to be exact.

127
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,599
I'm going to retire in my 30th year.

128
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,271
Then half of the force
must've learned from you.

129
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,524
You could say that.

130
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,362
Many of my old students
are still in the force.

131
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,866
Oh, right. Today's special lecturer
is also my junior.

132
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,787
-Your junior?
-Yes.

133
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,295
There's a symbol on our campus
that represents KNPU.

134
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,631
Does anyone know what that is?

135
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,802
It's the Justice Tower.

136
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,804
Correct.

137
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,725
Yes!

138
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,230
The Justice Tower tells us
to be honest and righteous

139
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,399
so that we can become
leading police officers.

140
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,820
It conveys a rather heavy message.

141
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,364
WHAT IS "JUSTICE"?

142
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,490
Justice.

143
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,996
What is justice to you?

144
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,544
For me, it meant catching bad guys

145
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,464
and protecting the weak.

146
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,426
That's what justice meant to me.

147
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,846
But after I joined the force,

148
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,100
I caught a ruthless serial killer

149
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,020
who brutally killed
ten well-off elderly people.

150
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,231
This is what he said
when I asked why he killed them.

151
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,443
He thought he'd be able to address
inequalities by killing the wealthy

152
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,653
since it was their fault

153
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,323
that he was poor and miserable.

154
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,080
WHAT IS "JUSTICE"?

155
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,583
Yes, that's how I reacted too.

156
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,171
The bad guys whom I wanted to catch

157
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,423
had their own sense of justice.

158
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,512
I was dumbfounded by what he said.

159
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,018
That's when I started contemplating
what justice is.

160
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,062
I realized

161
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,690
that everyone's concept of justice
could be very different.

162
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,657
Justice is neither good nor evil.

163
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,036
Justice is somewhere in between

164
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,247
good and evil.

165
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,584
To some, certain laws could seem unjust

166
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,878
although they were made based on justice.

167
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,675
Despite all that,
humans pursue and yearn for justice.

168
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,512
That's because
humans are willing to risk their lives

169
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,807
when they realize
their sense of justice is wrong.

170
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,313
How about we put it this way?

171
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,481
Let's say

172
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,233
you've joined the force.

173
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,026
And you're after a murderer.

174
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,446
But there's a river

175
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,448
between the murderer and you.

176
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,703
The murderer stole a boat
and is trying to get away.

177
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,539
To catch that culprit,

178
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,041
you have to act like him.

179
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,210
You need to steal a boat as well.

180
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,214
What would you do then?

181
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,052
Would you catch the culprit
by stealing the boat?

182
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,639
Or would you let him go

183
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,766
and keep the law?

184
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,147
You.

185
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,066
I'm Noh Beom-tae of the 41st batch.

186
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,610
I won't steal the boat.

187
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,070
I will borrow it from the owner instead.

188
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,536
You.

189
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,831
I'll take my Jet Ski and follow him.

190
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,003
You can sit.

191
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,088
-"Jet Ski," my foot.
-Why?

192
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,506
Okay, next student.

193
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,301
You.

194
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,261
I'll use the gun.

195
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,180
A blank one in the air

196
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,057
and one at the moving boat.

197
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,602
If it doesn't stop them,
I'll shoot the culprit.

198
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,732
I wonder who taught this batch.

199
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,070
The student next to her.

200
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,365
What's your name?

201
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
I'm Kang Sun-ho of the 41st batch.

202
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,585
Okay. What would you do?

203
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,554
I…

204
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,892
I'm not sure.

205
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,815
All right. You can sit.

206
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,070
It's okay if you don't know.

207
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,115
You guys are still freshmen.

208
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,574
But I'm sure

209
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,620
that all of you have answers of your own.

210
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,081
Some would think,
that because they are police officers,

211
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,168
it is right to break the law
if it means catching the culprit.

212
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,337
Some would think,
that because they are police officers,

213
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,216
it is right to always keep the law
no matter what.

214
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,093
That's the justice for them.

215
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,971
But still,

216
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,099
to you who are my juniors
and future police officers,

217
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,309
I want to tell you this.

218
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,937
You must keep asking yourselves
what justice is

219
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,525
and try to answer it on your own.

220
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,446
The question that makes you

221
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,197
doubt your answer every time.

222
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,658
You must keep it

223
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,745
for the rest of your lives.

224
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,207
I'm sure that all of you will become

225
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,334
better police officers than us
who are in service.

226
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,963
You are the proud students
of the Police University.

227
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,675
So I'm sure all of you
will be able to find the answer.

228
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,975
WHAT IS "JUSTICE"?

229
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,814
Then…

230
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,902
How can you catch that murderer

231
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,447
without stealing the boat?

232
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,079
Well…

233
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,582
Maybe you should try to catch him
even if you need to swim?

234
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,419
Catching the culprit on a boat
by swimming after him

235
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,880
is logically impossible.

236
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,008
Even in this hypothetical situation,

237
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,594
you're giving us a meaningless answer
saying that

238
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,346
we should catch the culprit
while keeping the law.

239
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,558
Is that really the justice of the police?

240
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,826
-Chief Han Jeong-sik?
-Yes.

241
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,536
Of course I know him well.

242
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,704
He was the head of my station

243
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,706
when I was first appointed.

244
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,878
He was younger than me,
but he was so arrogant.

245
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,756
Anyway, even now he's so condescending.

246
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,968
Why are you asking about him?

247
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,595
Nothing. I'm just checking up.

248
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
Gosh, you're wasting my time.

249
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,599
You made a fuss saying
that Cheol-jin and Go Deok-bae

250
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,227
should be sent
to different detention centers.

251
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,187
Do you even know how hard it was
to send Go Deok-bae

252
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,981
to the Seoul Namdong-bu Lockup?

253
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,816
And still, you're calling me for that?

254
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,359
Okay, I got it.

255
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,278
Enjoy your meal. Bye.

256
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,321
Gosh.

257
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,750
WHAT IS "JUSTICE"?

258
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,629
Good work.

259
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,223
-Hello.
-How have you been?

260
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,308
Would you like some coffee?

261
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,439
Are you not coming?

262
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,649
I am. Let's go.

263
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,494
I didn't know
that you do lectures like this.

264
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,167
It's a lecture held at my school.
I have to do it even if I don't want to.

265
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,212
I see, your school.

266
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,883
Oh, right. There was this freshman.

267
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,552
Was his name Kang Sun-ho?

268
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,972
He's an interesting character.

269
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,642
He seems enthusiastic.

270
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,228
I think he can be a good one
if he's trained well.

271
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,606
Gosh. Who am I to train him?

272
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,149
He's doing well on his own.

273
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,239
I guess you're fond of him, right?

274
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,991
I can feel your affection for him
in your voice.

275
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,704
By the way,
how do you know Professor Choi?

276
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,920
-Who?
-Professor Choi Hee-su.

277
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,089
I saw you with her a while ago.

278
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,174
Oh, right.

279
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,844
You mean
who's in charge of the judo club here?

280
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,931
She was the wife of one of my colleagues.

281
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,602
He was Inspector Lee Ju-won.

282
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,272
He was an officer. Didn't you know?

283
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,960
REMEMBRANCE OF POLICE OFFICERS
WHO DIED ON DUTY

284
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,463
LEE JU-WON

285
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,801
WE PRAY FOR THE REPOSE
OF THE LATE LEE JU-WON

286
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,263
RIP LEE JU-WON

287
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,765
HE DIED WHILE INVESTIGATING
AN ILLEGAL GAMBLING SITE

288
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,017
"A gambling site"?

289
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,566
KANG SUN-HO

290
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,247
You said you have something to say.

291
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,749
Why aren't you saying anything?

292
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,963
Why are you making that face again?

293
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,383
I can say the same thing to you.

294
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,053
You seemed busy all day today.

295
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,013
You punk.

296
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,140
Are you watching me all the time?

297
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,771
Goodness.

298
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,984
Well…

299
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,946
I am checking up on something.

300
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,991
What is it?

301
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,495
I'm not sure about it yet,

302
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,705
so don't make a fuss about it, okay?

303
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,831
Okay.

304
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,797
The case of the illegal gambling ring.

305
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,007
I don't think we are done yet.

306
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,470
I think there are more culprits out there.

307
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,139
You mean the one that ran away back then?

308
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,933
No, not that guy.

309
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,394
I mean the real ringleader
who Go Deok-bae tried to hide.

310
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,650
On the day we caught Go Deok-bae,

311
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,819
he got rid of his burner phone,

312
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,320
but I managed to find it.

313
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,697
And I got a number from that phone.

314
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,992
But I'm still looking into it,
so wait for now.

315
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,373
Are you surprised?

316
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,378
-No.
-Good.

317
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,421
Whether it was done
by two or three people,

318
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,967
we'll catch them all
and put them behind bars,

319
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,677
so what's there to worry about?

320
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,265
Professor.

321
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,060
If we catch the culprit,

322
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,937
nothing will happen, right?

323
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,731
Everything will be okay, right?

324
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,278
You fool.

325
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,823
Of course.
Why are we even talking about this?

326
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,200
You just wait.

327
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,161
I'll get everything done

328
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,204
and close the case in just a week.

329
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:21,543
So just trust me and focus on school.

330
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,547
I'll let you know
when and if I need your help.

331
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,484
STRANGER: THE CHOICE IS YOURS, KANG SUN-HO

332
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,989
WILL YOU FALL OFF THE CLIFF
WITH YU DONG-MAN?

333
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,803
THE ACCOUNT DOES NOT EXIST

334
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,494
Kang Sun-ho.
Is this how you want to play this?

Can you please stop?

337
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:14,531
Seeing you eat is enough
to make me feel full.

338
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:19,744
Same here.
Just seeing you eat makes me happy.

339
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,708
You're going to eat all this?

340
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,592
Hey! Don't eat my food.

341
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,430
-What?
-Don't eat my food.

342
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,973
It's all mine.

343
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,104
Am I your celebrity?

344
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,565
Will you just admire me
and do nothing forever?

345
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,569
You frustrate me so much.

346
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,447
Man up.

347
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,256
JUSTICE, HONOR

Just one showdown, okay?

The one who loses must give up.

354
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,170
Like a man should.

355
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,630
Like a real man should.

No! Please no…

361
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,177
Let's go, guys.

362
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,679
-Nice.
-That fool.

363
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,787
I think Joon-wuk is
going to ask her out first.

364
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,080
They'll play it fair and square.

365
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,209
Fair and square? That won't be easy.

366
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,589
You seem to be feeling a bit better today.

367
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,425
You seemed pretty downcast yesterday.

368
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,220
It's just…

369
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,806
I want to stay strong until the end.

370
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,318
Then you need to recharge first.

371
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,113
You wanted to stay strong
until the end, right?

372
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,994
Then I should fully recharge my battery
before I go.

373
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,794
When we don't have any classes,
let's go see my mom.

374
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,964
-Really?
-Yes. I want to tell her that

375
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,635
she'd better stay out of trouble
since both her daughter

376
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,346
and her daughter's boyfriend
are police officers.

377
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,851
I guess we're not police officers yet.

378
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,760
You came before I even called you.

379
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,013
How do I look? Does my skin look hydrated?

380
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,224
Oh, my. I thought you were a student.

381
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,726
Your skin is glowing.

382
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,728
Are you done with your classes?

383
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,106
Can't you tell?
I've already taken a shower.

384
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,858
Don't I look all refreshed and cute?

385
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,986
Then since you look
all refreshed and cute,

386
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,487
why don't we go eat something together?

387
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,324
Oh, I'm sorry. I've got plans.

388
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,160
You have plans? Where are you going?

389
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,664
Seoul?

390
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,749
No.

391
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,543
Daejeon.

392
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,420
Daejeon? Why?

393
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,924
Do you want to know why I'm going there
or who I'm meeting?

394
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,552
Both.

395
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,598
My gosh, stop it.
You're making my heart flutter.

396
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,893
Then I'll drive you there.
Let's take my car.

397
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,021
Gosh, I shouldn't have told you.

398
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,273
Now, you're scaring me.

399
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,316
What's going on?

400
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,776
Well…

401
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,739
I want to ask you something on the way.

402
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,909
You can ask me tomorrow.
I can't talk today.

403
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,368
I'll see you tomorrow.

404
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,579
Wait…

405
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,681
Where is she going so early?

406
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,372
I'm only going to check.

407
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,138
-Fried chicken!
-Oh, my.

408
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,684
Dig in. Eat as much as you want.

409
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,603
I put it on my mom's credit card.

410
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:05,149
-Ta-da.
-Hey, eat. You need to eat well.

411
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,325
Joon-wuk,
why did you get all this food for us?

412
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,326
Are you and Eon-ju a couple now?

413
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,996
No. However,

414
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,457
that will happen as soon as I ask her out.

415
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,838
Joon-wuk won't get a second chance
if she rejects him.

416
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,757
Just wait for your turn.
That'd be a better option.

417
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,011
-Right?
-Yes.

418
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,470
But if he doesn't get dumped,

419
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,305
you don't even get a chance.

420
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,683
Exactly.

421
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,270
-I don't want it anymore.
-Come on!

422
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,230
-Forget it!
-We were joking.

423
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,524
-You guys have it all.
-Just have one more bite.

424
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,109
Did that make you upset?

425
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,402
Open wide.

426
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,362
-You have it!
-Come on.

427
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,240
Gosh, he's acting like a child. Come here.

428
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,575
Here. Open wide.

429
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,160
Hey. Come back here.

430
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,520
I thought she was going to Daejeon.

431
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,194
Do you even know how hard it was
to send Go Deok-bae

432
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,737
to the Seoul Namdong-bu Lockup?

433
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,284
Have all the clubs submitted their request
for the festival support fund?

434
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,662
Yes, they all did
except for Relations Team.

435
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:26,249
Gosh, Relations Team again?
Goodness, Professor Yu.

436
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,544
I'll answer it.

437
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,132
Hello, this is
the Leadership Room of KNPU.

438
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,270
KCSI

439
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,479
Professor Seo!

440
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,565
Professor Seo!

441
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,692
-Yes?
-Your shoes.

442
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,696
Oh, right. Thank you.

443
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,450
Give it to me. I'll drive.

444
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,127
KCSI

445
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,187
Please move!

446
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,650
EMERGENCY OPERATING ROOM

447
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,948
Gosh, that punk.

448
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,453
Captain! Are you okay?

449
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,122
Let's hurry. Dong-man is waiting for us.

450
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,582
That punk…

451
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,686
Yes.

452
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,189
Okay, Professor.

453
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,694
Okay.

454
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,870
Professor Yu's operation

455
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,166
went well.

456
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,379
-Thank goodness.
-I'm so relieved.

457
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,429
Gosh, I was so worried.

458
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,080
Are you surprised?

459
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,832
Whether it was done
by two or three people,

460
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,211
we'll catch them all
and put them behind bars,

461
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,004
so what's there to worry about?

462
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,508
So just trust me

463
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,968
and focus on school.

464
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,972
I'll let you know
when and if I need your help.

465
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,046
Are you his guardian?

466
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,007
-Yes.
-Here. This belongs to him.

467
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,903
GO DEOK-BAE
ARRESTED ON JUNE 24TH, 2021

468
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,699
GO DEOK-BAE ARRESTED
JUNE 24TH

469
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,576
GO DEOK-BAE'S BURNER PHONE MISSING

470
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,495
DID HE GET RID OF IT? WHY?
OUR INFORMATION LEAKED?

471
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,289
PEOPLE WHO KNEW ABOUT OUR PLAN

472
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,082
CHOI HEE-SU, KWON HYUK-PHIL, SEO SANG-HAK

473
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,585
CHOI HEE-SU MET CHIEF HAN JEONG-SIK

474
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,879
WHY? WHY DID SHE LIE?

OUR INFORMATION LEAKED?

479
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,433
Could it be…

480
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,895
CHOI HEE-SU, KWON HYUK-PHIL, SEO SANG-HAK

481
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,455
The operation went well.

482
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,291
They said he's going to wake up soon,
so let's wait.

483
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,758
Where did Professor Yu get
into the accident again?

484
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,552
The outskirts of Seoul.

485
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,224
Why was he there?

486
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,144
I'm not sure.

487
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:10,861
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

488
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,613
Hello.

489
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,036
We should go to the hospital today, right?

490
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,497
Yes, we should.

491
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,126
Gosh, a hit-and-run of all things.
It's so horrible.

492
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,089
Did you announce the cancelation
of the Investigation Studies class?

493
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,174
Right. I'll announce it now.

494
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,976
What? So it was a hit-and-run?

495
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,772
That is insane.

496
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,358
The police must have launched
their investigation.

497
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,654
Yes. We will find the driver soon.

498
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,073
No.

499
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,451
We must find the driver.

500
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,954
We must do something.
The class has been canceled,

501
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,456
so let's go see Professor Yu.

502
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,374
Okay, let's do that. We'll go get a pass.

503
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,672
Aren't you going too?

504
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:58,052
There's something I must do
before Professor Yu wakes up.

505
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,390
I won't ask you what it is
that you must do.

506
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,852
Or why you're doing this.

507
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,397
Because there must be a reason
you're not telling me

508
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,733
and why you're doing it alone.

509
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,030
Just don't get hurt.

510
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,952
Be careful, okay?

511
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,791
Hey.

512
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,709
Just one minute.

513
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,631
I need some courage right now.

514
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,944
Yes, rewind a little.

515
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,198
A little more.

516
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,075
-Stop right there.
-Here?

517
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,748
I can't see his face
because of the mask and the cap.

518
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,126
This is driving me crazy.

519
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,754
Wait, Captain.

520
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,131
Right here.

521
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,843
-What?
-Here. Don't you see this?

522
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,556
It's a tattoo, isn't it?

523
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,777
Hey, wait.

524
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,655
Shouldn't we buy some juice
for him or something?

525
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,907
Professor Yu
hasn't regained consciousness yet.

526
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,826
Still, he can drink it when he wakes up.

527
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,827
Let's buy some.

528
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,245
Everyone does it
when visiting the hospital.

529
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,455
Sounds good.

530
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,498
Let's go.

531
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,706
Hello, Mr. Yu Dong-man.

532
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,655
Excuse me.

533
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,533
You're not a nurse, are you?

534
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,259
Kang-hui!

535
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,656
Hey, what's wrong? What happened?

536
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,991
What is going on, Kang-hui?

537
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,459
What do you mean?

538
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,295
Remember the jerk who fled from the scene

539
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,963
the day Professor Go got arrested?

540
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,258
Let me go, you jerk!

541
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,054
Why you little…

542
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,891
I think it was him.

543
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,734
I'll call the professors
and let them know first.

544
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,943
No, don't call them.

545
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,154
What?

546
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,947
I'll be there shortly.

547
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,617
So don't tell the other professors.

548
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,994
You guys should stay
by Professor Yu's side.

549
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,750
PROFESSOR YU DONG-MAN

550
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,844
You idiot.

551
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,764
Okay, I have to go.

552
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,314
Which hospital is Senior Inspector Yu at?

553
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,775
He's at Hankook University Hospital.

554
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,527
Have we found the hit-and-run driver?

555
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,906
It was a car with false registration,

556
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,491
so we don't have a suspect yet.

557
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,284
It'll take a while.

558
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,828
Speaking of which, sir,

559
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,123
could we get a few more officers
on this case…

560
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,292
That jerk.

561
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,631
Hey, Detective Joo.

562
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,549
Yes.

563
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,432
We're going to visit
Professor Yu now, right?

564
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,815
What's wrong?

565
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,234
I need to talk to you.

566
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,654
Unless it's something urgent,
we can talk on the way.

567
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,947
No, we have to talk now.

568
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,657
Before Professor Yu wakes up.

569
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,328
What do you mean?

570
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,914
Be honest with me.

571
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:05,085
Regarding Professor Yu's accident,
is there something I should know?

572
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,756
-What?
-I saw it yesterday.

573
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,009
Professor Yu following you out.

574
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,726
Both of you were in Seoul.

575
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,275
Hee-su.

576
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,850
Deal with Kang Sun-ho first.
Or you're finished too.

577
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,396
Chief Han, this scumbag…

578
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,404
-Hello.
-Hello.

579
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,948
I'm Corporal Joo
from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

580
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,994
I think the location was around here.

581
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,602
-Damn it.
-Hold on.

582
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,479
We can't beat this.

583
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,569
Hey, mister!

584
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,196
You can't smoke in here.

585
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,824
Have some manners. What's his problem?

586
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,867
Hey, look at this. This is…

587
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,453
Hey.

588
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,913
What?

589
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,706
-Do you know me?
-No.

590
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,460
What's with him?

591
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,754
Hey, just drop it. Let's go.

592
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,257
What? Why? He keeps staring at us.

593
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,716
-Come on. Let's go.
-Why…

594
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,134
We're sorry.

595
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,386
Let go.

596
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,067
FILE RECEIVED
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CCTV

597
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,801
Who is he to tell me what to do?

598
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,803
Why would he glare at us?

599
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,888
Stop it.

600
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,016
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

601
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:52,103
Have you seen a man who looks like this
and has a tattoo like this one?

602
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,855
This man… You saw it, right?

603
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,398
The barcode…

604
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,275
I saw him in the internet cafe.

605
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,401
The internet cafe?

606
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,487
I run this internet cafe. What's going on?

607
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,582
What?

608
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,297
Damn it.

609
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,139
The security system has been activated.

610
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,105
Damn it!

611
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,694
What's happening?

612
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,054
What do you think? Are you enjoying it?

613
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,055
Jang Jae-gyu.

614
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,935
Who gives orders
to the murderer Jang Jae-gyu?

615
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,282
Put your phone down.

616
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,534
The man who can save you

617
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,036
is me, not him.

618
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,167
Open the door, Jang Jae-gyu!

619
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,544
Don't you have a spare key?

620
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,838
Damn it!

621
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,423
Open the door, Jang Jae-gyu!

622
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,138
I'll hand over the report.

623
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,432
Open the door!

624
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,150
Open the door, Jang Jae-gyu!

625
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,818
Here's your report.

626
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,435
Human life…

627
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,604
is a tenacious thing.

628
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,610
It'd have been easier

629
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,904
if you just died in the accident.

630
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,493
Why make it hard

631
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,745
for both of us?

632
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,421
Officer.

633
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,383
Damn it.

634
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,433
Turn on the lights now!

635
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,600
Please hurry!

636
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,283
Wait and see. I'll never be caught.

637
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,163
This way!

638
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:06,983
It was you?
The jerk who hurt Professor Yu?

639
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,443
Damn it!

640
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,244
The higher-ups…

641
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:22,999
are telling you to stop.

642
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,294
If you keep at it,

643
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,796
someone else…

644
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,508
might get hurt.

645
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,927
It could be

646
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,471
the hacker you let go,

647
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,681
Kang Sun-ho.

648
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,436
He'll probably be next.

649
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,953
I'll leave you a gift,

650
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,248
so take a look at it when you wake up.

651
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,482
Hurry up! Quickly!

652
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,277
Let go of me, you jerk!

653
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,112
Take this and get lost!

654
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,662
Did you think I'd join hands
with a criminal like you?

655
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,081
Don't flatter yourself.

656
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,709
I'm here to catch
the jerk who gave you orders.

657
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,132
Even if my life ends here,

658
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,635
I'll make sure to catch him
before it does.

659
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,429
So tell me, Jang Jae-gyu.

660
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,598
The jerk who not only ran
an illegal gambling ring

661
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,892
but also tried to kill someone.

662
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,354
Who is the scumbag hiding
in the Police University?

663
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,997
One of the professors is the real culprit?

664
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,040
Who on earth is that person?

665
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,667
Is it a man or a woman?

666
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,170
It was just a mistake he made to earn
money to pay for his father's surgery.

667
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,630
There's a safe in KNPU. If we find it,

668
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,965
we'll be able to catch the ringleader.

669
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,093
No. You'll have to give up this time.

670
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,886
You still haven't had a change of heart?

671
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,972
Can't you support my decision
one last time?

672
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,432
Take it.

673
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,267
I actually think
they deserve to be expelled.

674
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,394
Let's hold a disciplinary committee
right away.

675
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,855
This isn't practical training.
It's a real crime scene.

676
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,898
And Sun-ho is saying he'll go there!

677
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,736
Kang Sun-ho will open it.
Because what he's looking for is in there.
