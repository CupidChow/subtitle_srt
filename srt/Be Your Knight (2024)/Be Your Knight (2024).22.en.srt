00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,820
Let's get in.

3
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,620
Come on. Be careful.

4
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,900
Ms. Ruolan, what's wrong?

5
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,060
Maybe I ran too fast

6
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,620
and skinned my feet.

7
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,940
What are you doing?

8
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,140
Ms. Ruolan,

9
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,020
let me carry you home.

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,380
Okay.

11
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,900
The heels are broken.

12
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,060
Why didn't you

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,780
throw them away?

14
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,900
It's your stuff.

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,140
How can I throw them away?

16
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,980
A lot has happened lately.

17
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,620
I wish I could live a peaceful life

18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,020
like this.

19
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,300
You will, Ms. Ruolan.

Ms. Xiao.

26
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,900
Why do you want to drink with me?

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,100
For your...

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,580
generosity and righteousness,

29
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,180

for forgiving and helping us.

When this is over,

you can thank me

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,500
and have another drink with me.

Here's the invitation
to the charity banquet this month.

Tomorrow will be your last chance

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,940
to defeat Deng Dahai.

37
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,820
Ms. Xiao, what's wrong?

38
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,260
Mr. Ba will be there tomorrow.

39
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,980
You made an offer to him,

40
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,380
but he's very suspicious.

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm still worried about you.

42
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,860
Do you need to reconsider it?

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,580
Ms. Xiao.

44
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,660
We're in a world

45
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,460
of vanity and pleasure.

46
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,180
It's a beautiful empire

47
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,420
of the rich and powerful.

48
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,620
However, this empire is built on

49
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,820
the pain of the common people.

50
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,140
I will try my best

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,700
to eliminate

52
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,500
everything of their evil empire.

53
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,700
You said

54
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,780
I was like Ye Ran.

55
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,780
It turns out you're the one
who's like him.

56
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,740
How come?

57
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,060
Probably because...

58
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,940
husband and wife look like each other.

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,980
Do you know?

60
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,220
The way he looks at you

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,820
is very different.

62
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,300
Why is that?

63
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,500
It's not like

64
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,420
how he looks at me.

65
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,660
Cheng Che,

66
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,820
I'm telling you a little secret.

67
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,660
Actually, I'm not interested in the men

68
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,260
who don't like me at all.

69
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,460
Cheers.

70
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,740
I do have a twin brother.

71
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,100
My mother Xiang Ruoyun

72
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,980
left home over 20 years ago,

73
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,060
and no one knew

74
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,700
she had twins.

75
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,540
I wanted

76
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,500
to live with you,

77
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,660
so I left home and came here.

78
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,500
None of them

79
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,060
can survive.

80
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,620
How could Mr. Ba let a woman join us?

81
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
You've been lying to me.

82
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,260
How can I believe you?

83
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,540
What's wrong with a woman?

84
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,380
I can give Mr. Ba what he wants.

85
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,420
Can you?

86
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,980
I'll kill you!

87
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,180
You don't know who's going to die.

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,340
Deng Dahai,

89
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,540
don't you dare hurt her.

90
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,180
What really matters

91
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,660
is who he is.

92
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,180
I do have a twin brother.

93
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,540
I'll kill you!

94
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,820
I wanted to live with you.

95
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,700

96

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,660

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,740
Mr. Ba hasn't arrived yet.

126
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,220
Hai, why are celebrating?

127
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,780
Let me tell you.

128
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Have you heard it?

129
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,060
Mr. Ba is working on a big deal.

I only provide a place for you
to have meetings.

133
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,100
I don't care

134
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,500
about your business.

135
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
That's right.

136
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,060
Ms. Xiao, as a woman,

137
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,740
you only need to have fun.

138
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,180
You don't understand men's business.

139
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,180
Then I wish you

140
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,300
good luck.

141
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,460
Why are you wearing black?

142
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,540
As the owner of New Fairy,

143
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,980
you need to please the clients.

144
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,420
You can't wear plain clothes.

145
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,740
The weather has been bad lately.

146
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,500
I'm not in the mood for dressing up.

147
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm afraid

148
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,860
a storm is coming tonight.

149
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,220
Ye Ran,

150
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,740
you're awake!

151
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,980
Let's get out of here.

152
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,100
You're not fully recovered.

153
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,420
You should leave!

154
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,460
Listen,

155
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,900
I know what you want to do,

156
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,180
but let's go home

157
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,060
and discuss it first, okay?

158
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,260
Listen to me.

159
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,260
Let's go.

160
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,820
Welcome.

161
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,420
Cheng Che.

162
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,500
What are you doing here?

163
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,980
I didn't invite you.

164
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,900
Mr. Ba, suit yourself.

165
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,980
I'll leave you alone.

166
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
Cheng Che.

167
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,940
What tricks are you trying to play?

168
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,700
Since when

169
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,420
do you get to talk first?

170
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
Mr. Ba.

171
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
They're married. They're our enemies.

172
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,340
Think about it.

173
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,820
Since they came here,

174
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,180
we've had so much trouble.

175
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,940
Something must be wrong with them!

176
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,540
Han Shan is capable,

177
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,780
and I admire him.

178
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,940
Ms. Cheng

179
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,420
also has something special.

180
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,100
She doesn't seem

181
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,700
special to me at all.

182
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,700
I've made the stuff

183
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,260
Mr. Ba has always wanted.

184
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Am I

185
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,780
special to you now?

186
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,500
It's just a piece of trash.

187
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,220
Do you think I'm stupid?

188
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,820
How dare you say Mr. Ba is stupid?

189
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,300
Then don't blame me

190
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,100
for slapping you on behalf of Mr. Ba.

191
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,980
I...

192
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,340
No wonder you're
the chemist couple's daughter.

193
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,660
I've never seen something like this.

194
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,060
Are you the daughter
of Lin Yunsheng and Shen Wanyin?

195
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,500
The clients in Southeast Asia

196
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,020
want high-quality products.

197
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,540
Hai,

198
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,260
send all your ephedra

199
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,100
to Ms. Cheng.

200
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,460
Han Shan and you will assist her.

201
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,180
- Mr. Ba...
- Boss!

202
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,900
Boss!

203
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,860
Something's wrong.

204
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,100
Get out.

205
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,900
Boss...

206
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,380
Didn't you see I was talking to Mr. Ba?

207
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,100
How dare you break in and ruin my plan?

208
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,220
It's serious.

209
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Our ephedra was stolen,

210
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,780
and we couldn't find the thieves.

211
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,580
When did it happen?

212
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,540
Who did it?

213
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
Boss...

214
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,060
A few days ago...

215
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,340
our warehouse...

216
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,460
was stolen.

217
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,700
A few days ago?

218
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
Why didn't you tell me?

219
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,820
They... They beat me up.

220
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,660
I just got out of the hospital

221
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,180
and came here.

222
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,780
This isn't over.

223
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,940
Han Shan,

224
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,580
my ephedra was stolen.

225
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,500
Did you do it?

226
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,820
Hai,

227
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,980
I was in a coma for days

228
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,980
and just woke up.

229
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,300
How can you blame it on me?

230
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,700
Then it's you.

231
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,460
Hai,

232
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,140
no violence.

233
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,780
Mr. Ba was going to let me

234
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,980
use the ephedra in your warehouse.

235
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,060
Why would I

236
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,380
steal it?

237
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,860
Stop lying.

238
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,940
Who else could it be?

239
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,060
Hai,

240
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,740
the stuff was stolen.

241
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,180
We can work together to sort this out.

242
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,340
Just take it easy.

243
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,460
Mr. Ba.

244
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,780
You don't believe me either, do you?

245
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,340
No one believes me.

246
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,620
None of you!

247
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,220
If Mr. Ba didn't hate feuds of brothers

248
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
or want us to cooperate,

249
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,140
I'd kill you right now.

250
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,140
You...

251
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,500
I...

252
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,620
I... Mr. Ba.

253
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,780
How dare he pull out a gun
in front of you?

254
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,060
Mr. Ba,

255
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,220
as the saying goes,

256
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,020
before you hit a dog,
find out who's the master.

257
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,900
I've been loyal to you.

258
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,620
He was so rude...

259
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,100
How can you forgive him?

260
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,420
Loyal to him.

261
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,820
Hai,

262
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,020
your hat is made of

263
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,820
island velvet

264
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,740
from Southeast Asia.

265
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
Who sent it to you?

266
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,140
Do you have friends there?

267
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,220
I bought it from a department store.

268
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,100
Is that so?

269
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,320
