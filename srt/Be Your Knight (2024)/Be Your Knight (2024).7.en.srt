00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,340
Hao?

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,500
Uncle Yu was talking about you
a while ago.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
(Butler Uncle Yu's son, Yu Jiahao)
Why did you suddenly come back?

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,740
I know it's kind of sudden.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,140
I heard

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,900
you were preparing for a wedding.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,420
Is Ms. Ruolan

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,020
getting married?

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,220
Ms. Ruolan is so busy with work.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,740
How can she have time to get married?

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,100
Please get in. I have to work.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,220
Okay.

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,140
Hao?

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,380
Are you Yu Jiahao,

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,700
Uncle Yu's son?

16
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,500
Ms. Ruolan.

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,860
I remember five years ago,

18
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,460
when Uncle Yu sent you to Beihai,

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,660
you were this tall.

20
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,180
Hao.

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,180
Dad.

22
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,940
Sorry, Ms. Ruolan,

23
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,100
I didn't know Hao was coming back.

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,980
I'll tell Old Lady about it

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,460
and ask her to let him stay
and work here.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,780
You don't have to ask her.

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,380
Well, Uncle Yu, you can leave.

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,100
Can you drive?

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,500
Drive the car.

30
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,980
Let's go somewhere else.

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,180

32
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,100
=Episode 7 Dancing in the Dark=

33
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,740
Mr. Thirteen, tell me,

34
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,740
who paid the reporter

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,340
to take photos of Tingdong?

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,820
The debt you owed me

37
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,220
will be cleared.

38
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,380
The debt will remain the same.

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,940
However, Fengxing House

40
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,500
has its rules.

41
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,700
It's important to our reputation.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,100
These photos

43
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,020
cannot be exposed.

44
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,420
It's not easy

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,780
to deal with that reporter.

46
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,540
Wait for my signal.

47
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,180
You must be patient.

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,300
Ms. Xiang,

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,460
if you haven't figured out
how to talk to me,

50
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,020
I'll leave.

51
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,380
Mr. Chen,

52
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,860
name your price.

53
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,460
I want all the photos.

54
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,060
None of them can go public.

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,860
Ms. Xiang, you're very candid.

56
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,220
I want a 30-percent share

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,660
of Jimin Pharmaceuticals.

58
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,820
By the way,

59
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,860
I've got copies.

60
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,340
Mr. Chen,

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,100
you're so funny.

62
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,740
Can you accept

63
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,340
this price?

64
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,620
Don't spoil the fun.

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,420
I heard

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,300
you never got married.

67
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,180
How about this?

68
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,300
If you marry me...

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,100
If you become my wife,

70
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,460
things will be different.

71
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,700
We'll be family.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,340
What's mine

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,020
will also be yours.

74
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Mr. Chen,

75
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,900
we're having a conversation.

76
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,380
It's inappropriate to touch her.

77
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
Hao!

78
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,020
How dare you hit me?

79
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,860
Your dirty hands

80
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,660
touched Ms. Ruolan.

81
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700
Hao.

82
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,380
Stop!

83
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Ms. Ruolan...

84
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,620
I owe you one.

85
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,100
Follow me.

86
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,380
Mr. Chen,

87
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,380
in this world,

88
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,140
some care about money,

89
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,140
whereas others care about respect.

90
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,340
Today, Ms. Xiang gave you money.

91
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,020
Therefore, you have to

92
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,340
show some respect to me.

93
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
In my opinion,

94
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,220
this matter

95
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,820
is over now.

96
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,980
Don't you think so?

97
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,540
Ms. Ruolan, are you alright?

98
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,580
Did I ask you to beat him?

99
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,040
Ms. Ruolan, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,020
Hao, that's not what I meant.

101
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,380
Mr. Chen is a hypocrite.

102
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,260
You beat him,
so he'll certainly get back at you.

103
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,500
It's not worth it!

104
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,020
But Ms. Ruolan, he was...

105
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,340
so rude to you!

106
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,260
Ms. Ruolan, what's wrong?

107
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,260
I sprained my ankle.

108
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,420
What are you doing? Help me!

109
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,740
What are you waiting for?

110
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,780
I...

111
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,500
Ms. Ruolan, pardon me.

112
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,260
What are you doing?

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,140
Why are you holding me?

114
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,620
Stop!

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
They're watching us!

116
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,140

117
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,740
I'm so embarrassed

118
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Put me down.

but need to drink.

208
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,900
Can you drink?

209
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,860
Drink?

210
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,540
I don't need you to teach me.

211
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,100
Of course I know you can drink,

212
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,460
but I'm teaching you

213
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,620
wine tasting.

214
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
It's the first step to get closer

215
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,020
to Xiao Xiao.

216
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,460
Let's begin.

217
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,740
This is red wine.

218
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,300
The first sip is a little bitter,

219
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,940
but it will get sweet as you taste it.

220
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,420
Wait.

221
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,540
You need to hold the stem of the glass,

222
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,740
because the warmth from your hand

223
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,430
will change the wine's temperature,

224
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,900
which ultimately alters its flavor.

225
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,660
Shake the glass before you drink.

226
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,020
Is it good?

227
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,540
This next one is vodka.

228
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,580
It originates from
St. Petersburg, Russia,

229
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,180
and it has the color of glaciers.

230
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,540
Xiang TIngdong has a habit.

231
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,060
He likes to smell it before drinking.

232
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,100
Vodka is very strong.

233
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,620
Then you can try this.

234
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,140
It's champagne,

235
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
a white wine with bubbles,

236
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,340
which tastes a little sweeter
than red wine.

237
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,060
You don't have to drink too much.

238
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,860
I can drink a lot.

239
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,740
Next one.

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,060
Whiskey.

241
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,380
It's bad.

242
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,660
I don't like it.

243
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,580

244
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,620

248
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,900
No, I don't.

249
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,900
Then how about
