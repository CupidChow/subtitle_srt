Tingdong,

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,070
why did you come to Grandmother

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,590
without telling me?

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,640
Tingdong.

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,320
There you are.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,710
Grandmother, I'm back.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,480
Grandmother,

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,830
I saw you sit here alone.

9
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,510
So, I came to keep you company

10
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,830
and talk to you.

11
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,430
How have you been?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,790
I'm aged.

13
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,070
My eyesight is poor, too.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,000
Now, I can't see you

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,590
very clearly.

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,120
My Lady, here is the blanket.

17
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,710
Uncle Yu, leave it to me.

Cheng.

19
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,830
Tingdong.

20
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,950
Don't worry about me.

21
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,880
Go to bed early.

22
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,230

What do you think?

27
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,760
Did you agree to come here

28
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
for your mother Xiang Ruoyun?

29
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,110
Do you hate Grandmother

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,270
for expelling your mother

31
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,480
and try to take revenge?

32
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,510
Yes.

33
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,230
But by accident,

34
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,920
I'll marry my sister-in-law.

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
Mind your language.

36
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,430
You promised me

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,110
you wouldn't hurt anyone in this family.

38
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,440
Do you care so much about this family?

39
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
To make me play my brother,

40
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,880
you lied a big lie

41

at all costs

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,200
and even sacrificed your marriage.

43

We both have selfish purposes.

48
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,280
I don't care about your secrets.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,990
You better not ask what I'm going to do.

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
Keep it hidden.

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,190
Don't let anyone else see it.

52
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
This isn't my real home.

seems

191
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,720
to be fulfilled.

192
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,630
Go arrange it.

193
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,870
I'll move back to the hospital in a few days.

194
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,080
Just now, I...

195
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
Why did you slap me?

196
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
You bad rogue.

197
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,080
Who told you to really kiss me?

198
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,800
Ms. Cheng,

199
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,200
you said you'd take care of that.

200
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,800
But just now, you didn't.

201
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,510
So, I moved us on.

202
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,360
How could you kiss me like that?

203
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,270
Don't you think that was offensive?

204
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,910
I kissed you that way because...

205
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,030
Because what?

206
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,870
Because I was worried...

207
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,710
I might...

208
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,630
I might not target your mouth.

209
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,800
Mr. Tingdong, that means nothing to you.

210
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,030
But to my lady,

211
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,230
that is her first kiss.

212
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,680
- Her first kiss...
- Xin Yi.

213
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
Never mind.

214
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,830
Say no more.

215
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
You go get changed.

216
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,510
We'll serve the tea.

217
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,440
I'm sorry.

218
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
(Hope we can)

219
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,240
(make through what happens next.)

220
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,630
Grandmother, have some tea.

221
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,240
Cheng,

222
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
it doesn't matter

223
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,190
if I drink the tea.

224
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
You're always one of this family.

225
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,440
Grandmother,

226
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,190
have some tea.

227
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,320
Don't bother to do this.

228
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,120
Xiang Tingdong,

229
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,600
how do you have the cheek to be here?

230
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,000
Ms. Ruolan, it's Mr. Tingdong's big day.

231
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,000
How about we talk later?

232
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,600
It's serious. We can't talk later.

233
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,840
Ruolan.

234
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,790
Xiang Tingdong,

235
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,760
what is this about?

236
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,920
Cheng,

237
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,600
is the wedding over?

238
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,430
If it isn't,

239
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
cancel the wedding.

240
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,870
Don't marry a smoker.

241
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,950
Aunt,

242
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,390
is there a misunderstanding?

243
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,760
Tingdong,

244
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,870
check this.

245
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,760
Are you the smoker in the photo?

246
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,670
The man in the photo...

247
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,800
It's not me.
