00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,420
(Private Clinic, Tangcheng)

2
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,940
I didn't know so many things

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,420
happened to the Xiangs back then.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,100
It's all my fault.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,420
He ended up lying here because of me.

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes,

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,020
you made a mistake.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,980
But it wasn't hitting him

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,220
but hiding this from all of us

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,540
and finding someone to replace him.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,260
His brother looks exactly like him

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,780
and deceived the whole family.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,540
This is ridiculous.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,820
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Aunt...

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,740
Cheng,

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,500
Tingdong ended up like this...

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
because of all of us.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,180
We didn't pay enough attention to him.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,620
We didn't even know he was smoking weed.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,900
You hit him

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,540
only to defend yourself.

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,380
You said there's something
more important than your life.

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,060
Is it about your parents?

25
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,060
Yes.

26
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,500
But the truth is still unclear.

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,620
When I make some progress,

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,220
I'll tell you everything.

29
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,300
Tingdong will wake up eventually.

30
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,180
The drama between Ye Ran and you

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,060
has to stop.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,980
Before my mother leaves the hospital,

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,300
this thing

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,100
must be handled properly.

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,660
I know.

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,620
How about this?

37
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,020
After all, Ye Ran is also a Xiang.

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,180
If he's willing,

39
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,340
he can come back to the family

40
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,220
after my mother gets out.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,260
If he doesn't want this...

42
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,020
After all,

43
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,500
we owe him a lot.

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,340
We can give him what he deserves

45
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,020
and let him live the life he wants.

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,380
He doesn't have to

47
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,300
be trapped in our family.

48
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,980
Aunt,

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,660
I started all this.

50
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,060
So, can you let me handle it?

51
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,340
You must be exhausted.

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,380
Get some rest.

53
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,820
I'm sorry...

54
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,780
I'm sorry!

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,420

Ye Ran,

101
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,620
is there anything I can do for you?

102
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,380
Dance for me.

103
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Why do you

104
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,300
suddenly want to see me dance?

105
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,100
I want to see you do the dance you like.

106
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,740
When did you learn to play the piano?

107
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,940
My mother taught me when I was a kid.

108
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,900
She even made a piano model

109
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,180

Maybe...

118
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,940
