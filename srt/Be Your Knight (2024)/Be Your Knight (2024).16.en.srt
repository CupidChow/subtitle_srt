3
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,410
Mr. Ba,

4
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,370
I'll...

5
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,780
Ms. Xiao,

6
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,410
thank you for helping me.

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,980
Not now.

8
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,660
Perhaps I did it

9
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,540
to get you killed.

10
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,540
You wouldn't,

11
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,820
because you and Ye Ran

12
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,180
are similar.

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,820
Both dangerous?

14
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,690
Dangerous...

15
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,410
but righteous.

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,770
Anyway,

17
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,380
thanks.

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,490
Deng Dahai saw you before.

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,410
Don't let him recognize you.

20
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,820
Put this on.

21
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,900
Thanks.

22
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,340
Cheng, it's not a good time

23
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,770
to take a risk.

24
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,740
Mr. Ba...

25
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,050
There's always a risk,

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,770
no matter where we are.

27
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
I have to confirm

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,620
if Deng Dahai is the murderer.

29
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,210
Trust me.

30
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,250
You will have the chance.

31
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,090
Let's go!

32
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,580
Run!

33
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,650
Mr. Han Shan,

34
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,180
Mr. Ba wants to talk to you.

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,620
Okay.

36
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Wait a minute.

37
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,140
The Masquerade

38
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,860
starts now.

39
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,090
Hai, what's wrong?

40
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,340
Why are you so angry?

41
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,140
Mr. Ba.

42
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,900
Can I help you?

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,210
Mr. Han Shan,

44
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,460
you really know how to surprise us.

45
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,650
You not only brought Commander Liu

46
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,650
but found a phony

47
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,700
to risk his life for you.

48
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,620
Hai, what do you mean?

49
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,420
I don't understand.

50
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,700
Fine.

51
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,300
I'll make it clear.

52
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,740
In this world,

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,090
there's someone

54
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,770
who looks exactly like you.

55
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,620
Or I should say

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,460
you look

57
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,210
exactly like Han Shan.

58
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,370
Do you mean

59
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,210
they are two different people?

60
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,020
Show me the photo.

61
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,730
Mr. Ba.

62
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,340
Although

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,610
they look

64
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,610
exactly the same,

65
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,060
there's something different.

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,730
What are you doing?

67
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,020
Well,

68
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,290
you're scared.

69
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,340
Why are you scared?

70
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,610
The only difference

71
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,460
is their eyebrows.

72
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,090
Hai,

73
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,140
no matter how many pictures

74
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,610
you have,

75
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,900
I'll still look the same.

76
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,410
If you have eyebrow slits,

77
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,730
you can always fix it.

78
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,460
It doesn't mean anything.

79
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,260
It means you're a phony!

80
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,970
You're not Xiang Tingdong.

81
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,980
Mr. Ba,

82
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,210
he impersonated Xiang Tingdong

83
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,730
to approach you.

84
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,970
He's up to no good.

85
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,210
Maybe the real Xiang Tingdong

86
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,530
has been killed by him!

87
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,500
Hai,

88
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,650
it's enough.

89
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,060
Did you

90
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,380
throw a big party

91
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,140
for this?

92
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,450
Mr. Ba...

93
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,850
Mr. Ba, it's not like that.

94
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,090
I meant it.

95
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,700
You know me.

96
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,820
I hate when brothers
turn against each other.

97
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,730
If you have proof, show us.

98
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,380
If he's a phony,

99
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,020
I'll kill him right here.

100
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,060
Xiang Tingdong,

101
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,610
you gave me

102
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,900
this glove.

103
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,940
You should know why I need

104
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,410
to wear it.

105
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,170
Answer me!

106
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
I don't believe you've forgotten this.

107
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Don't try to make an excuse.

108
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,090
It's because

109
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,380
his hand...

110
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,650
I'll tell you

111
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,140
the answer.

112
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,770
Hai, your hand was cut off.

113
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,770
Everybody knows it.

114
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,020
What's the point of asking about it?

115
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,650
Tingdong, don't you remember

116
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,140
you asked me to help you

117
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,900
pick a glove for Hai?

118
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,500
How can I forget?

119
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,060
By the way,

120
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,170
you know them well.

121
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,650
Then do you know

122
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,170
if Deng Dahai's left hand,

123
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,900
right here,

124
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,210
has a scar?

125
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,940
Left hand?

126
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,820
He has no left hand.

127
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,580
No left hand?

128
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,170
His left hand was cut off.

129
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,290
It's a fake hand under the glove.

130
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,060
I helped Xiang Tingdong

131
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,730
choose the gloves for him.

132
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,540
However,

133
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,730
Hai, it's your privacy.

134
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,660
I didn't want to bring that up.

135
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,780
Hai, are you still wearing

136
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,300
the gloves I sent you?

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,610
You...

138
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,610
How did you sneak in as a dancer?

139
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,940
You two...

140
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,610
must be up to no good!

141
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,250
It's our privacy.

142
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,890
Please don't laugh at me.

143
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,890
After we got married,

144
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,850
Tingdong seldom came home at night.

145
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,580
I believe no wife

146
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,940
can ignore the fact that her husband

147
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,250
always goes to clubs and bars.

148
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,580
So, I wanted to know

149
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,090
which girl is so important to him.

150
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,890
Am I wrong?

151
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,420
Cheng, we can talk about it at home.

152
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,370
Mr. Ba, I'll take her back.

153
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,570
Excuse me.

154
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,820
No!

155
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,460
You two are making a scene here.

156
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,940
What do you want?

157
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,300
Hai, then tell,

158
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,460
why would I dress up like this?

159
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,090
To embarrass myself?

160
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,660
I'm from a prestigious family.

161
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,460
I need dignity.

162
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,090
How should I know?

163
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,340
Then look what you've done to us!

164
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,940
You've given us a hard time.

165
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,730
You tried to kidnap us

166
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,580
and even kill us!

167
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,060
Cheng!

168
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,940
Even a rabbit will bite if you push it.

169
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,540
Even if I kill you,

170
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,730
I'll still be innocent!

171
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,890
Cheng, calm down.

172
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,060
Cheng Che, are you crazy?

173
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,130
Fine.

174
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,130
You want to play, don't you?

175
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,610
Then none of you can leave here today!

176
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,210
Hai.

177
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,700
Mr. Ba,

178
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,890
you saw it!

179
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,930
They...

180
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,850
Saw what?

181
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,780
I know what happened
at the charity banquet.

182
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,700
You've really

183
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,370
grown up, right?

184
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,260
Mr. Ba,

185
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,460
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,540
She's just a naive housewife.

187
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,850
She's been through a lot lately...

188
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,420
and freaked out.

189
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,580
Sorry for interrupting
the welcome party.

190
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,340
Han Shan,

191
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,420
you know I've had
high expectations of you.

192
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,780
If your family gets in the way,

193
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,970
I'm afraid I'll have to fix it for you.

194
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,300
Dorry worry, Mr. Ba.

195
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,780
You're awake.

196
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,940
Let me take you home.

197
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,250
I want to get out.

198
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,300
Cheng Che.

199
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,340
I had no choice but...

200
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,370
Why did you knock me out?

201
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,130
If I hadn't done it,

202
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,730
you might've shot...

203
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,850
So what if I shot him?

204
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,090
He killed my parents.

205
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,540
Shouldn't I kill him?

206
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,380
You do.

207
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,090
However, in such a situation,

208
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,940
if you killed him,

209
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,730
you wouldn't be able to get out alive.

210
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,820
15 years ago...

211
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,660
I hid in the closet...

212
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,540
and saw him killing my parents.

213
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,730
If I can't

214
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,210
avenge their deaths...

215
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,420
what's the point of living?

216
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,300
Cheng Che, Cheng Che!

217
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,660
Cheng Che!

218
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,210
Cheng Che,

219
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,850
you will avenge them,

220
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,890
but you can't risk your life.

221
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,700
Since we know our target,

222
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,580
why don't we make a plan?

223
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,700
Ye Ran.

224
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,540
Who do you think you are?

225
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,060
Do you have the right
to make decisions for me?

226
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,940
I am...

227
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,940
Do you really think
you're my husband?

228
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,610
Our marriage is nothing but a tool.

229
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,260
Okay.

230
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,820
I got it.

231
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,770
(Ye Ran.)

232
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,220
(I'm sorry.)

233
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,050
(I'm sorry...)

234
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,780
(But can you please)

235
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,070
(not leave me?)

236
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,220
It's been a long night.

237
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,850
Are you hungry?

238
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,610
Shall we have dinner together?
