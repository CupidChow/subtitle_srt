00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,100
Hound,

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,420
you haven't changed at all.

3
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,300
You still like to break the rules.

4
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,060
Did I break the rules?

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,780
We're not betting on a coin

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,820
but the speed of pulling out a gun.

7
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,380
Mr. Han Shan,

8
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,460
you can't even protect your stuff.

9
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,780
I can't believe you let him
burn the drugs.

10
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,180
All our ephedra is gone.

11
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,980
If you can't give us

12
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,420
a good explanation,

13
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,940
we can't ensure

14
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,660
your wife's safety.

15
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Don't worry.

16
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,820
I'll make up for

17
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,020
the burned ephedra.

18
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,020
I will report everything to Mr. Ba,

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,020
and I hope

20
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,620
you can solve this.

21
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,180
=Be Your Knight=

22
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,140
=Episode 25 I'm Deeply in Love with You=

23
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,420
Mr. He,

24
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,900
you're practicing sword skills
in Mr. Ba's office again.

25
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,420
Cheng Che, I'm warning you again.

26
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,580
I'm Manager He now.

27
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,420
Show some respect.

28
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,060
It's backwards.

29
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,580
The other side.

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,860
Tell me.

31
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,140
What do you...?

32
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,580
Here's the new sample.

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,700
The purification methods,

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,140
chemical formulas, and operation rules
are written in the previous manual.

35
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,660
Manager He, please send it to Mr. Ba.

36
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,740
Stop.

37
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,740
Manager He, anything else?

38
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,140
I heard

39
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,900
you bought a train ticket to Yunzhou.

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,340
Why are you going there?

41
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,980
Are you going to

42
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,700
run away with Ye Ran?

43
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,740
Manager He, let me remind you.

44
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,380
Mr. Ba didn't say

45
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,900
I couldn't leave Tangcheng.

46
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,420
He said I couldn't leave
until my mission was completed.

47
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,060
Don't try to play a word game with me.

48
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,780
Mr. Ba is on a trip,

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,140
so you're fearless, aren't you?

50
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,860
Whether you can

51
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,500
survive this week is still...

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Manager He, a little tip.

53
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,380
The place you put the sword

54
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,100
is a centimeter off to the left.

55
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,180
If Mr. Ba finds out that someone

56
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,460
touched his stuff,

57
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,260
how do you think

58
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,500
the sword will be used

59
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,060
to punish you?

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,100
Ms. Cheng.

61
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,700
Well...

62
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,220
We've talked for a long time.

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,220
Hurry up. Don't miss the train.

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
Goodbye.

65
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,620
(Best Wishes)

66
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,260
Ran,

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,900
it's all my fault.

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,580
I should've stayed and kept an eye on
Hound and his people.

69
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,140
- I...
- Brother,

70
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,540
it's not your fault.

71
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,780
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,700
I didn't pay attention to them

73
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,420
and let them get on board
and burn our stuff.

74
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,580
It's not a big deal.

75
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,820
You made it in time, didn't you?

76
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,820
We still have a third of the drugs.

77
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,220
The Xiang Family also has some ephedra.

78
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,660
We can solve this.

79
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,020
Good. Thank god.

80
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,180
Okay.

81
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,700
It's raining.

82
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,220
You should go back.

83
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,300
Remember to use some ointment.

84
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,820
- Okay.
- You too.

85
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,820
Okay, Ran.

86
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,780
Go.

87
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,300
- Okay.
- Thank you.

to live a peaceful life.

173
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,740

174
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,500
and become a doctor.

When I have time,

176
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,100
I can teach our children to dance.

177
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,140
You will teach them

178
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
to play the piano.

179
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,180
Okay?

180
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,140

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,180
You haven't made profits lately,

183
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,980
and you've lost

184
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,660
many clients I gave you.

185
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,580
You're putting a lot of pressure on us.

186
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,060

187
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,100
