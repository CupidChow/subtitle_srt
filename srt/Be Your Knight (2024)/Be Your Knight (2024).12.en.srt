why are you sitting here alone?

3
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,300
Why are you still awake?

4
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,060
I went out for a drink.

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,580
Did you make

6
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,700

7
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,500

the previous one was broken.

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,460
I didn't want to throw it away,

10
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,300
so I made some adjustments.

11
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,700
Did you see a doctor?

12
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,500
Are there any other injuries

13
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,060
except for those on the surface?

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,740
The doctor has checked it.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,420
I'm fine.

16
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,420

useful to you.

188
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,220
Why are you useful to me?

189
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,060
Since you found out
I wasn't Xiang Tingdong,

190
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,700
you've never asked about him.

191
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,700
It's obvious that you're not angry at me

192
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,100
for impersonating him

193
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,660
but lying to you.

194
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,900
You obviously don't love him,

195
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,780
but you were so close.

196
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
I guess

197
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,980
you want

198
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,940
something else from him.

199
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,580
Go ahead.

200
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,700
How can we

201
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,140
make peace?

202
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,700
I can give you or do anything

203
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,740
he could.

204
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
I can also do the things

205
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,660
he couldn't.

206
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,940
Whether it's Xiang Tingdong

207
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,420
or Han Shan,

208
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,980
I can be the one you want me to be.

209
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,140
Do you know how to be a gentleman?

210
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,540
You're hurting me.

211
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,140
I had no choice.

212
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,220
Sorry.

213
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,460
You were so rude

214
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,900
to a girl in public.

215
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,580
You really don't pity women at all.

216
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,780
I'm still waiting for your answer.

217
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,860
What should I call you?

218
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Ye Ran.

219
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,580
I'll take this as your deposit.

220
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,020
Meet me at New Fairy

221
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,460
tomorrow at 8 p.m.

222
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,300
Ye Ran.
