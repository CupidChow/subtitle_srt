Where did Deng Dahai hide

wait for the information
at the newsstand at Wangyue Street.

7
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,620
Well,

8
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,380
I didn't lie about the clue, right?

9
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,490
Thanks.

10
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,650
But

11
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,540
why did you come here to see me?

12
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,740
First, I thought you might

13
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,380
get in trouble.

14
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,900
Second, I wanted to ask you something.

15
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,690
Where is

16
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,930
Xiang Tingdong?

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,340
Don't you think

18
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,130
it's too late to care about him?

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,900
It's late,

20
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,770
but it doesn't mean I don't care.

21
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,770
He's staying in Haofei Private Clinic.

22
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,460
He's still in a coma,

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,050
but I assure you

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,850
he'll be fine.

25
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,380
Goodbye.

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,490

Boss,

in my opinion,

76
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,340
we should kidnap Xiang Ruolan

77
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
and torture her.

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,650

Shut up!

82
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,650
Sorry, I wasn't smart enough.

83
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,410
Xiang Ruolan

84
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,460
is the face of the Xiang Family.

85
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,530
If we kidnap her,

86
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,650
we'll be in trouble.

91
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,090
What is she

92
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,580
doing secretly at midnight?

93
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,460
Boss,

94
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,210
I'll get her right now.

95
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,770
If you catch her,

96
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,410
how can we know what she's up to?

97
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,170
Idiot.

98
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,020
Let her go?

99
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,820

100
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,970
Tingdong,

101
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,250
I visited Grandmother a few days ago,

102
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,060
and she wasn't doing well,

103
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,540
so I didn't tell her
what happened to you.

104
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,340
To look for the murderer
who killed my parents,

105
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,060
I found your twin brother Ye Ran

106
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,340
and let him impersonate you.

107
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,180
Sorry

108
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,420
to let you stay in this place.

109
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,340
Ye Ran asked me to give you this,

110
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,700
which has a photo of your mother.

111
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,490
He said...

112
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,700
Cheng Che.

113
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,700
Your mother prepared this

114
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,540
for each of you.

115
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,970
Happy birthday.

116
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,180
It's almost 9:00 p.m.

117
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,490
Why hasn't she come back?

118
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,890
So good to see you,

119
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,300
Mrs. Xiang.

120
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,300
How dare you stare at me?

121
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,210
Stop looking!

122
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,960
Hello?

123
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,940

happy birthday,

127
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,180
Ye Ran.

128
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,540
Right now,

129
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,700
I'm with

130
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,370
your wife and your twin brother

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,890
Deng Dahai, what do you want?

133
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,420
If you want to see them alive,

134
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,460
come to me now.

135
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,560
Hello?

136
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,970
I'll be waiting for you.

137
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,650
Hello?

138
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,580
Ms. Cheng...

139
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,850
Useless.

140
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,580
Did you inform Mr. Ba

141
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,780
as I told you?

142
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,890
Don't worry,

143
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,130
Mr. Ba is on his way.

144
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,660
The great show

145
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,850
is about to begin.

146
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,300
What a shabby car.

147
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,610
Piece of junk!

148
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,130
Run.

149
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,660
Keep running.

150
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,010
And here,

151
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,090
paint it carefully.

152
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,130
Okay.

153
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,610
Hold it like this.

154
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,780
Be patient.

155
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,460
Did Ye Ran knock Xiang Tingdong out

156
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,890
to replace him to be Han Shan?

157
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,370
Mrs. Xiang.

158
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,250
Is it worth it?

159
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,420
Why are you still keeping the secret

160
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,090
after what you've suffered?

161
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,970
I have nothing to say

162
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,460
to a rat like you.

163
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,010
Mrs. Xiang, right?

164
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,340
How dare you hit me?

165
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,610
Do you deserve it?

166
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,820
Mrs. Xiang,

167
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,130
how about this?

168
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,460
If you can promise

169
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,420
to help me to tell Mr. Ba
that Ye Ran is an imposter,

170
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,420
I'll not only forgive you

171
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,010
but help you find a way

172
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,730
to save Xiang Tingdong.

173
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,490
What imposter?

174
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,130
I don't understand.

175
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,970
You don't understand,

176
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,490
or you don't want to?

177
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,210
Are you having an affair with Ye Ran?

178
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,340
You're his sister-in-law!

179
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,180
Did you really

180
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,580
treat him like your husband?

181
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,130
You'd better kill me now,

182
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,060
or I'll definitely let you

183
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,060
rot in hell!

184
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,730
You want to kill me.

185
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,700
I'm so scared!

186
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,090
You're a monster!

187
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,130
My left hand

188
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,180
was cut off

189
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,820
by Mr. Ba in front of Xiang Tingdong.

190
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,130
He was a coward.

191
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,890
How dare he want to be on par with me

192
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,250
and share my fortune?

193
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,210
Is it just because
he's the heir of the Xiang Family?

194
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,010
I can't believe you find
someone worse to deal with me.

195
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,540
Mr. Ba is coming.

196
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,780
What do you think he will do

197
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,340
when he sees two identical faces?

198
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,650
Will he kill the imposter

199
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,020
or the real one?

200
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,650
Or

201
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,450
will he kill both of them?

202
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,850
Come on.

203
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,300
Don't worry.

204
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,540
You won't be alone.

205
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,930
They'll both go to hell with you.
