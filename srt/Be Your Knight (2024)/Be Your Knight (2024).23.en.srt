1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,580
Your hat is made of

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,300
island velvet

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,700
from Southeast Asia.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,020
Who sent it to you?

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,620
Do you have friends there?

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,020
I bought it from a department store.

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,060
Is that so?

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,380
Hai, you've got it for a long time.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,580
I can't believe you don't know
how special it is.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,580
The lining of this hat

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,300
has a special mark,

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,780
which is obviously customized.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,100
I don't think

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,340
anyone in Tangcheng

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,980
is selling island velvet
from Southeast Asia.

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,060
So what?

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,540
It's just a hat.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,300
I forgot.

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,660
I don't know who sent it to me.

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,620
Hai.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,300
You must be close

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,740
to Southeast Asia, right?

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,300
Mr. Ba,

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,220
they did contact me,

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,620
but I never promised them anything.

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,140
I've told them to wait.

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,620
I know.

28
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,300
You've worked for me for a long time.

29
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,980
Of course I know you.

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,500
However, you've been
a little bit reckless lately.

31
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,340
I'm quite upset

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,700
about all the things you've done.

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,340
Mr. Ba.

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,460
I just wanted

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,620
to save you some trouble.

36
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,700
Runxi.

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,220
You're always around him.

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,540
What do you think?

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,220
Mr. Ba.

40
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,220
Southeast Asia

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,900
will soon become Hai's second home.

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,140
He Runxi!

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,500
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,380
Mr. Ba,

45
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,660
I heard

46
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,380
Hai contacting your big client

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,540
in private.

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,380
Mr. Ba, here's the evidence.

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,820
Hai,

50
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,700
Yirou wrote this to you.

51
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,540
I'm so disappointed.

52
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,620
You've followed me

53
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,460
to spy on me.

54
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,300
How dare you sell me out?

55
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,220
Hai,

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,020
I'm always a dog.

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
This time, I want to know

58
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,020
what it is like to be a human.

59
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,860
Mr. Ba... Mr, Ba, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,100
Please give me another chance.

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,340
Mr. Ba.

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,300
Hai, what are you talking about?

63
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,380
Ms. Cheng,

64
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,380
do you want to try

65
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,300
this sword for me?

66
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,500
Ms. Cheng,

67
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,660
the drug was destroyed by Hai.

68
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,660
I need another one.

69
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,020
Okay.

70
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,580
I'll prepare it.

71
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,180
You've only made one so far?

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,900
I didn't have enough time.

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,980
I sent it to you

74
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,540
right after I got the sample.

75
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,700
I'm not patient.

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,500
I hate waiting!

77
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,540
Mr. Ba.

78
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,980
We won't keep you waiting.

79
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,860
Don't worry.

80
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,300
Please.

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,700
Cheng, let's go.

Ru!

86
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,540
Ru...

87
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,140
Deng Dahai,

88
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,620
you're a good father,

89
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,860
but have you ever thought

90
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,500
that other people

91
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,580
might also have a daughter?

92
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,380
That's right.

93
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,220
You've killed too many people.

94
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,740
Maybe you've forgotten

95
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,020
who my father is.

96
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,580
Didn't you ask me

97
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,500
why I chose black?

98
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,020
Because I'm going to send you to hell.

99
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,860
Ru...

100
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,260
Ru...

101
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,700
I'll take care of her.

102
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,340
As for you...

103
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,020
Go to hell.

104
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,100
(Beloved Lin Yunsheng's Tablet,

105
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,860
Ye Ran,

106
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,140
if you hadn't investigated

107
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,620
Deng Dahai's business
in Southeast Asia,

108
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,820
we wouldn't have used Mr. Ba

109
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,180
to kill Deng Dahai tonight.

110
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,260
Father,

111
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,300
mother,

112
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,660
you can finally rest in peace.

113
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,220
Cheng.

114
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,700
Deng Dahai is dead,

115
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,940
and you've avenged your parents.

116
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,580
I'll find a way to make you safe

117
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,660
and stay away from Mr. Ba.

118
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,500
Ye Ran.

119
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,460
How's your wound?

120
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,580
Does it hurt?

121
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,540
Not anymore.

122
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,420
I'm feeling much better.

123
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,940
Let's get changed

124
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,860
and have a drink.

125
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,780
Ye Ran.

126
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,140
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,540
Over the past few months,

128
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,580
if it hadn't been for you,

129
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,860
I wouldn't have accomplished anything.

130
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,180
However, I'm tired of this kind of life.

131
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,220
I'm so overwhelmed and out of breath.

132
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,020
I understand.

133
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,140
If you get used to this kind of life,

134
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,540
you'll lose your humanity

135
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,740
and only cares about interests.

136
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,820
You can't talk about yourself like that.

137
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,900
You're a human.

138
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,820
You're the only one

139
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,980
that can soothe my emotions.

00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,900
was in charge of these businesses.

192
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,540
However, after he died,

193
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,820
Mr. Ba took all of them back.

194
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,660
Mr. Ba is very suspicious

195
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,900
and cautious.

196
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,260
He never asked me to handle this.

197
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,380
You didn't kill him on that day.

198
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,100
I assume you've got a bigger plan

199
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,540
and wanted to set him up, right?

200
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,940
If you need anything,

201
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,420
just ask me.

202
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,060
Mr. Ba

203
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,020
has far too many sins.

204
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,260
His life doesn't matter anymore.

205
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,100
What really matters

206
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,780
is to find the drug production base.

207
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,260
As far as I know,

208
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,300
except for Mr. Ba

209
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,980
and his men,

210
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,180
only the production staff

211
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,220
can go there.

212
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,620
Thank you.

213
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,220
The information is very useful.

214
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,940
Don't be too polite.

215
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,180
Xiao Xiao,

216
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,780
have you ever thought about

217
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,580
closing this place

218
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,340
and having a normal life?

219
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,140
It's a chaotic world.

220
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,900
No one can live a normal life.

221
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,940
I'd rather hold my position

222
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,020
and do whatever I can.

223
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,300
By the way,

224
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,860
could you do me a favor?

225
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,060
If there's anything we can do,

226
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,740
just tell us.

227
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,460
Deng Dahai's daughter
is only six years old.

228
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,020
Can you try to find

229
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,260
a reliable person

230
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,260
to keep and raise her?

231
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,100
Don't worry.

232
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,540
We've got this.

233
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,020
Thank you.

234
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,300
Okay.

235
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,300
It's time to perform.

236
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,020
You're always

237
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,700
welcomed at New Fairy.

238
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,460
Let's go home.
