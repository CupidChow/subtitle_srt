00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,220
(Beloved Heir of the Xiang Family)

2
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,300
We cannot tell anyone

3
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,100
about Tingdong's death right now.

4
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,340
Tingdong,

5
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,620
you lay in the clinic alone

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,500
for so long because of me.

7
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,260
And now you're dead because of me.

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,700
You can't even
have a tombstone in your name.

9
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,180
Everything

10
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,500
is my fault.

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,460
How can I cleanse my sins?

12
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,140
It's not

13
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
all your fault.

14
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,380
Whether he chose to

15
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,820
or was forced to,

16
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,460
since he started to smoke weed

17
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,020
and smuggle drugs with them,

18
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,340
his fate has been sealed.

19
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,380
They are monsters.

20
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,220
It's just a matter of time.

21
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,420
What we can do now

22
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,140
is to make him rest in peace

23
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,580
and avenge

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,260
our family.

27
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,300
Aunt.

28
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,140
Did Grandmother tell you anything

29
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,460
about my parents' manuscript

30
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,860
for drug-purification technology?

31
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,340
I have no idea.

32
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,860
What's wrong?

33
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,620
I need to use it

34
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,580
to accomplish something.

35
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,940
Okay.

36
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,100
After all, it belongs to your parents.

37
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,940
When my mother wakes up,

38
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,380
I'll ask her about it.

39
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,940
Thanks, aunt.

40
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,820
I'll go to the hospital to visit Ye Ran.

41
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,820
Okay.

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,460
Mom?

43
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,820
I know

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,420
what happened to Tingdong.

45
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,540
Uncle Li.

46
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,980
Ms. Cheng,

47
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,220
follow me.

48
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,900
So, Ye Ran

49
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,540
fought with the monsters

50
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,860
and risked his life for this.

51
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,460
Whether he's in Yunzhou

52
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,900
or Tangcheng,

53
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,220
over the years,

54
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,300
he's been committed to

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,820
eradicating those monsters

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,500
who have betrayed the country

57
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,140
and the people.

58
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,820
Uncle Li,

59
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,100
this is part of the evidence

60
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,900
of Deng Dahai and Mr. Ba's crimes.

61
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,420
It isn't enough

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,180
to eradicate them for good,

63
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,620
but I can't let Ye Ran

64
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,240
suffer for nothing.

94
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,740
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,580
You brought me home and raised me,

96
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,780
but I've brought disaster

97
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,820
to our family.

98
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,620
It's all because of the drugs

99
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,420
and the monsters.

101
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,020

103
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,300
I put something

104
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,700
in your room.

105
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,060
It's the manuscript

106
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,860
of drug-purification technology
left by your parents.

107
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,740
It's time for you to have it.

108
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,500
Those bad guys

109
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,060
will be punished.

110

117
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,820
I've sent the manuscript

118
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,500
of the Lins

119
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,380

120
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,340
Okay.

121
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,980
I've

122
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,820
kept it for over a decade.

123
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,060

124
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,620
my mission is completed,

125
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,740
but I'm afraid

126
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,900
I won't have the chance
to cleanse my sins.

127
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,940
You had no choice

128
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,060
but to work with Mr. Ba.

129
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,020

won't blame you.

00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,500
to our warehouse.

194
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,960
♪In the whole wide world♪

195
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
We need more people.

196
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Don't worry, we've got this.

197
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,780
You three are not enough.

198
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,820
Let me handle this.

199
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,060
I'll gather everyone.

200
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,060
Okay.

201
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,140
Then Ms. Xiao and I

202
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,100
(Warehouse, Staff Only)
will handle the transportation.

203
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,540
I'll take care of the rest.

204
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,540
No.

205
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,220
We have so many people.

206
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,700
We can't avoid making noises.

207
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,100
It's a problem.

208
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,340
If Deng Dahai finds out,

209
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,900
our effort will be in vain.

210
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,420
We have to buy off the guards

211
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,620
and the patrol.

212
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,180
Mr. Thirteen.

Besides, I'm

a man of principle,

217
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,020
so I must

218
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,620

No need.

239
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,740
It was fun.

240
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,940
It was meaningful.

241
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Get the ephedra onto the truck

242
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,300
and get out of here.

243
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,820
We've removed everything here,

244

whether it's real or fake.

245
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,740

to the destination, just in case.

247

See you later.

248
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,620
Well...

249
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,940
Mr. Thirteen.

250
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,140
I'll leave the rest

251
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
to you.

252
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,380
No one

253
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,100
will know what happened.

254
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,660
Mr. Thirteen, what's wrong?

255
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,780
Come on.

256
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,620
Take Lan home

257
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,380
safe and sound.

258
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,260
Anyway, when I'm not around,

259
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
you'll be fully responsible

260
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,500
for her safety.

261
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,460
Don't worry, Mr. Thirteen.

262
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,780
You're reliable.

263
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,620
Okay.

264
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,540
Well, Lan,

265
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,300
I've talked to him.

266
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,980
If you need anything, just tell him.

267
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,540
Okay.

268
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,260
Ms. Ruolan, don't worry.

269
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,740
I've cleared the site.

270
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,300
No one will find out.

271
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,260
When the guards wake up,

272
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,940
they wouldn't dare to take the blame.

273
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Someone's here.

274
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,820
It's such a cold night.

275
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,020
Why would he ask me to steal
Mr. Qin's stuff alone?

276
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,020
I was the one who got beat up,

277
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,980
but the person who did it...

278
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,500
It's Mr. He.

279
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,220
I've always wanted

280
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,580
to beat him up.

281
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,860
Ms. Ruolan, what do you want?

282
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Who are you?

283
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,180
Do you know who I am? How dare you?

284
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,260
Do you know who I am?

285
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,370
Don't let me catch you!

286
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,350
Who are you?

287
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
What are you doing?

288
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,020
Let's go.

289
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,940
Come on.

290
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,340
Mr. He!

291
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,580
Who did this to you?

292
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,940
How should I know?

293
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,460
Go get them!

294
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,620
Yes!
