00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,860
(Mr. Ba)

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,820
Mr. Ba.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,060
He's our final target in Tangcheng.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,250
However,
you got Commander Liu into this.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,580
It can make Mr. Ba trust you

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,980
for a while,

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,850
but if they...

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,140
Don't worry, Uncle Li.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,980
Commander Liu was doing a favor

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,850
for Mr. Thirteen.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,660
He told me not to worry about it

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,980
but to do whatever I want.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,530
However, I haven't figured out

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,610
what kind of person

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,500
(Mr. Ba)
Mr. Ba is and what he wants.

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,850
The only clue we have

17
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,300
is that he contacted

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,540
the clients in the Southeast Asia

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,180
and planned to expand
his business there.

20
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,730
Maybe

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,730
we can take advantage of this.

22
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,640
Exactly.

23
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,940
Jimin Pharmaceuticals has

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,180
the most advanced drug-purification
technologies in Tangcheng.

25
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,980
I think that's why

26
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,260
he's kept Xiang Tingdong around.

27
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,770
If illegal drug business

28
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,540
infiltrate pharmaceutical companies,

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,300
it'll be a disaster.

30
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,090
How could he have

31
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,300
such an evil plan?

32
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,580
if it wasn't for getting the evidence
of their drug smuggling

33
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,860
and finding their factories,

34
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,010
I would've killed them a long time ago.

35
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,530
Be patient.

36
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,490
They want clients,

37
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,620
so we'll give them clients.

38
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,210
The most important thing right now
is to gain their trust,

39
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,740
find the source

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,050
of Mr. Ba's drug production chain,

41
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,290
and eliminate them for good.

42
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,540
Uncle Li, I'm afraid
you have to hold on a little longer.

43

45
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,740
Do you want to come up and talk?

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,690
It's too small.

47
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,260
Then let's have some tea.

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,780
(Authentic Tea Delights Ready Anytime)

49
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,650
Thanks.

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,540
Thanks.

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,420
Enjoy your meal.

52
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,700
Deng Dahai set you up several times,

53
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,460
but you survived them all.

54
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,740
You're talented

55
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,460
and lucky.

56
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,580
Ms. Xiao, thanks for your help.

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,050
There's not much I can do.

58
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,020
You've met Mr. Ba.

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,420
For him,

60
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,250
only the useful ones can survive.

61
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,540
Therefore,

62
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,740
don't take it for granted.

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,420
You're right.

64
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,050
Besides, with Deng Dahai around him,

65
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,620
I'm in such

66
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,140
a dangerous position.

67
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,090
Then kill him.

68
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,620
That's not what I meant.

69
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,530
I'm just wondering

70
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,740
where Deng Dahai hides the ephedras

71
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,860
of Kanghai Pharmaceuticals.

72
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,210
It's simple.

73
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,900
Tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.,

74
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,250
wait for the information
at the newsstand at Wangyue Street.

75
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
However,

76
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,250
don't forget what you promised me.

77
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,300
Don't worry,

78
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,740
Deng Dahai is our common enemy.

79
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,020
It's Tingdong's birthday.

80
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,210
I assume it's yours too.

81
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,370
I have no reason to accept this tie.

82
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,620
Besides,

83
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,740
I think my brother likes you.

84
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,860
He likes me,

85
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,580
so do I have to like him too?

86
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,770
The person you love
rarely loves you back.

87
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,050
It's not like
the love stories in fairytales.

88
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,810
I suggest you

89
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,420
look at your position now.

90
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,860
If you want to be Han Shan,

91
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,050
you'll play with guns and blood.

92
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,610
Love

93
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,290
will be your weakness.

94
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,610
Excuse me.

When doing business,

153
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,780

if this is what you want,

160
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,940
there's no need to talk.

Ms. Xiang!

162
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,540
I'll talk to the shareholders right now.

163
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,090
Ms. Xiang,

164
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,490
expensive as the wine is,

165
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,730
you don't even want to taste it.

166
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,970
It seems that you don't want
to make friends with me.

167
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,730
Wait a minute.

are all here.

172
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,370
It's time to negotiate with Xiang Ruolan

173
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,340
in a tough way.

174
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,780
I want the entire city to know

175
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,700
how the Xiangs

176
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,700
do business.

178
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,020
Ms. Ruolan,

179
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,130
let's get out of here.

180

Ms. Xiang.

181
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,060
Am I

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,730
a bad host?

183
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,970

Mr. Deng, Jimin Pharmaceuticals

186
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,370
had an emergency.

187
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,890
Ms. Ruolan has to go back

188
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,370
and deal with it.

189
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,090
Sorry

190
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,660

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,300
your staff is so rude.

193
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,180
Did I tell you to leave?

194
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,820
You should pay for this.

195
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,850
Mr. Deng, it was I who upset you.

196
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,250
I'm the one

197
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,010
who should apologize.

198
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,820
Mr. Deng, he has apologized.

199
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,970
Can we leave now?

200
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,180
Let's go.

201
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,850
Come on.

202
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,420
How, are you okay?

203
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,970
Come on, lean against the wall.

204
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,610
Take a deep breath.

205
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,060
How are you feeling?

206
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,090
Hot...

207
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,130
What are you talking about?

208
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,850
I knew something was wrong
with the wine.

209
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,180
He drugged you.

210
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,690
You...

211
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,090
Put your clothes on.

212
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,490
Come on. Let me help you.

213
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Ms. Ruolan...

214
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,060
I can help myself.

215
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,340
Why are you always

216
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,850
rejecting me?

217
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,820
Am I a monster?

218
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
Ms. Ruolan...

219
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,010
I...

220
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,850
That's not what I meant.

221
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,970
Hao,

222
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,010
do you have a crush on anyone?

223
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,250
Please...

224
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,940
Ms. Ruolan,

225
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,890
please give it back.

226
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,060
The necklace looks familiar.

227
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,540
Isn't it from my broken earring?

228
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,850
I told you to throw it away.

229
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,180
This earring keeps falling off.

230
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,490
Just throw it away.

231
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,140
I...

232
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,820
I...

233
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,730
Did you make this?

234
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,250
Did you make it for me?

235
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,010
I...

236
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,060
Yu Jiahao,

237
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,210
look at me.

238
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,700
Why didn't you give it to me
after you made it?

239
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,580
Are you

240
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,940
going to give it to someone else?

241
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,130
No.

242
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,660
No what?

243
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,490
No...

244
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,970
No other girls.

245
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,450
Stop

246
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,930
rejecting me.

247
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,650
Let's go home.
