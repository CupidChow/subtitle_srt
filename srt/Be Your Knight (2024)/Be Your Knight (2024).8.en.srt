Sir, please show me your VIP card.

3
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,580
Sir...

4
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,380
Sir!

5
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,620
Please show me your card.

6
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,980
Sir, you can't get in without it.

7
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,940
Sir, please cooperate.

8
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,380
Are you

9
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,540
breaking in?

10
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,900
Mr. Xiang.

11
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,540
Boss, this customer...

12
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,380
You're finally here.

13
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,180
I thought you forgot about New Fairy

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,780
after you got married.

15
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,780
How's that possible?

16
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,740
It's your birthday.

17
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,460
I ordered a dance dress
from a foreign tailor.

18
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,060
The waiter has sent it to your room.

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,420

When I taught him how to dance,
he always got distracted.

40
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,620
However, he seems quite into it now.

41
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,820
Tingdong,

42
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,260
you're so different today.

43
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,140
How?

44
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,300
Your voice

45
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,940
is so sexy.

46
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
Miss, should we follow them?

47
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,220
If we do,

48
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,860
we'll only distract him.

49
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,300
He seems to enjoy it.

50
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,140
We should give him some space.

51
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,380
Let's go.

54
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,420
Tingdong,

55
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,660
you're married.

56
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,100
I'm afraid
you shouldn't come into my room.

57
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,460
I didn't let you in,

58
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,660
so you just gave up?

59
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,700
You know it.

60
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,900
I have no feelings for her.

61
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,900
I was kidding.

62
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,460
Tingdong,

63
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,580
you'd always pick the right one.

64
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,260
Why did you start from the middle today?

65
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,340
You know, people often change.

66
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,460
It usually takes a long time

67
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,820
for you to finish a glass.

68
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,940
Why are you drinking so much?

69
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Were you angry at home?

70
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Yes.

71
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,140
The pictures of me smoking weed here

72
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,060
were sent to the Xiang Family.

73
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,660
How could I not get angry?

74
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,460
I was punishing you

75
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,700
for forgetting your soulmate

76
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,620
after marrying a beautiful wife.

77
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,500
Stop joking.

78
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,140
How was that?

79
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,300
Are you feeling better now?

80
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,500
Do I look sexy

81
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,060
when I hold a gun?

82
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,500
By the way,

83
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,180
do you know who sent the photos?

84
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,260
No.

85
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,820
I only know it was a reporter.

86
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,500
Only Huang Hai

87
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,820
could do it.

88
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,460
Huang Hai?

89
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,180
I went to your house last time

90
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,900
because I wanted to warn you
to be careful of him.

91
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,900
I didn't expect him to do this.

92
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,100
I'm not surprised it was him.

93
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,980
Tingdong,

94
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,940
what are you looking for?

95
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,540
I want to get a comb for you.

96
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,820
Do you need it?

97
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,020
Put it there.

98
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,980
By the way, Tingdong,

99
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,380
you bought so many lilies from abroad

100
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,380
because I said I liked them.

101
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,260
You had allergies every time you came.

102
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,380
You don't seem to have symptoms now.

103
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,380
Tingdong?

104
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,460
You can drink a lot.

105
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,570
It's been a long time.

106
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,940
Hao, have a seat.

107
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,980
Ms. Xiang.

108
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

109
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,380
(Secretary of Kanghai Pharmaceuticals)
I just got here.

110
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,340
(He Runxi)

111
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,340
Ms. Xiang,

112
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,340
you're always busy.

113
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,580
Why do you have time

114
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,220
for a humble secretary?

115
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,700
Mr. He, what are you talking about?

116
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,340
Jimin Pharmaceuticals
and Kanghai Pharmaceuticals

117
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,340
should communicate more with each other.

118
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,300
We're competitors.

119
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,500
Just tell me what you want.

120
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,580
Jimin Pharmaceuticals

121
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,780
encountered some problems lately.

122
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,660
Ephedra is urgently needed,

123
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,540
but I heard all the ephedra

124
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,700
on the market

125
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,740
was acquired by your company.

126
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,060
Isn't it a little inappropriate

127
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,100
to disturb the market?

128
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,340
We're both pharmaceutical companies,

129
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,940
but business

130
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,700
is all about making profits.

131
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,020
Please don't regard yourself as

132
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,340
the savior of the world.

133
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,700
Mr. He, that's a good point.

134
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,660
We're planning to buy

135
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,980
some ephedra from you.

136
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,220
How much

137
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,180
do you think is appropriate?

138
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,900
It's not about money.

139
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,980
What do you mean?

140
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,580
I'll give you some advice.

141
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,460
You only need to reduce

142
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,860
the proportion of the materials
in your drugs.

143
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,340
Jimin Pharmaceuticals

144
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,060
will never do such unethical things.

145
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,340
Mr. He,

146
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,740
maybe we should talk some more...

147
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,220
Ms. Xiang,

148
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,580
the Xiang Family has depended on women

149
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,980
to make a fortune for decades.

150
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,100
Do you think I don't know

151
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,860
how women do business?

152
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,540
Mr. He,

153
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,540
in business,

154
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,900
gender doesn't matter.

155
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,620
Indeed, gender doesn't matter.

156
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,260
Men need real abilities to do business.

157
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,700
However, as for women in your family,

158
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,620
what do you rely on?

159
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,180
I don't think

160
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,500
you have real abilities.

161
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,980
What are you doing?

162
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,660
Do you know who I am?
How dare you pour water on me?

163
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Mr. He,

164
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,220
you have 10 seconds to run.

165
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,220
Five minutes.

166
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,100
Five.

167
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,420
Four.

168
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,660
This isn't over.

169
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,700
Three.

170
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,380
Just wait!

171
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,500
Just wait and see!

172
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,020
I won't go easy on you!

173
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,060
You can leave.

174
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,100
Ms. Ruolan,

175
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,940
sorry,

176
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,540
I couldn't help myself.

177
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,100
I didn't blame you either.

178
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,940
If you didn't do it, I'd do it myself.

179
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,340
Hao.

180
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,340
Have a seat.

181
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,100
Have a drink with me.

182
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,500
A bottle of fine wine, please.

183
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,940
Cheers.

184
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,260
Cheers.
