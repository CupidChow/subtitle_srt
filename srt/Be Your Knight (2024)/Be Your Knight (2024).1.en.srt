(Ten years ago, I was adopted by the Xiangs)

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,600
(and then married to their grandson.)

(the umbrella in my hand)

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,290
(could shelter me from the rain)

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,610
(but not)

Excuse me.

19
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,200
How's the patient doing

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,410
in 103?

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,330
Sorry, Ms. Cheng.

22
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,810
Your grandmother

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,690
had another attack before you came.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,330
She's hanging there

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,690
but not for too long, I'm afraid.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,050
Try to spend more time with her when you can.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,810
Thank you, Doctor.

(Xiang Family's Eldest Grandson Xiang Tingdong)

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,930
He's still in Southeast Asia

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,650
for business.

36
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,250
This is

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,000
for you as your dowry.

38
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,970
Where did you get this tie clip?

39
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,250
Tell me,

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
who gave it to you?

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,810
Why are you forcing me to do this?

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
Cheng Che, we grew up together.

43
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,880
Why are you doing this?

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,000
Why?

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,880
My last wish...

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,370
Don't bring up Grandmother!

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,650
She forced me to marry you!

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,040
You two can get married...

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,980
(That man...)

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,970
Ms. Cheng, are you alright?

51
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,880
I'm fine.

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Xin Yi.

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
How's Tingdong doing?

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,250
He's been sent to

55
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,600
Dr. Shen's clinic as you asked.

56
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,000
He's alive,

57
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,000
but given his condition,

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
he might not be able to wake up.

59
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,280
Renew Grandmother's hospitalization,

60
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,250
then we'll go to Yunzhou.

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
Yes.

62
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,720
(At this point,)

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,810

Ran,

66
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,880
she wouldn't let go of our land,

67
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,490
so we brought her back.

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,970
I've checked.

69
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,210
The contract is a trap.

70
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,500
She's with the Xiang Family in Tangcheng.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
She is?

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,140
(Cheng Che)

73
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,440
I'm not surprised.

78
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,260
Who are you?

79
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,140
How come you and Xiang Tingdong

80
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,340
look identical?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,820
(Yunzhou Azure Dragon Ye Ran)
Worry about yourself first.

82
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,260
Did you come all the way

83
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,060
for that piece of land?

84
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,340
About that,

85
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,380
we've long signed the contract

86
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,820
and settled on the deposit,

87
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,060
but you people won't let it go.

88
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,300
You...

89
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,740
You're being unreasonable.

90
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,820
Fine.

91
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,900
I'll reason with you.

92
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,940
Ms. Cheng, did you sign the contract yourself?

93
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,060
Not exactly.

94
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,020
- But it...
- Let me ask you this.

95
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,940
Did you conduct negotiations yourself?

96
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,580
I didn't negotiate with them in person,

97
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,700
but those details...

98
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
So you yourself didn't negotiate with them

99
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,580
or sign the contract, right?

100
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,020
Then how can you be sure

101
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,460
the Xiang Family

102
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,260
didn't steal the land?

103
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,260
You...!

104
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,660
Ms. Cheng,

105
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,020
if you hadn't married my brother,

106
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,020
I would've taught you a bigger lesson.

107
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,220
You mean Xiang Tingdong is...

108
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,780
your brother?

109
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,700
I won't leave

110
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,260
without the land.

111
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,220
You want it so bad, huh?

112
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,220
How about a coin toss?

113
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,660
You get tails,

114
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,220
the land is yours

115
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
You get heads,

116
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,540
you'll be fish food.

117
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,100
Why would I bet with you?

118
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,020
In any case, the land is...

119
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
What are you doing?

120
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
You lost.

121
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
Ms. Cheng,

122
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,820
I don't want anyone in the Xiang Family

123
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,340
to know about me,

124
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,660
and I don't want to see you again.

125
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
Or next time,

126
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,340
you will fall

127
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,220
into the sea.

128
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,780
I swear I will make you pay.

129
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,780
(One Year Ago: Yunzhou Prison)

130
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,820
The court

131
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,580
rules as follows:

132
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,900
Ye Ran is

133
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,540
guilty of false imprisonment

134
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,100
and sentenced to six months in prison.

135
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,180
Ms. Cheng.

136
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,900
(Yunzhou Station)
Are you really going to see that man?

137
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
If all else fails,

138
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,340
why not postpone the wedding?

139
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,460
It's Grandmother's last wish.

140
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,900
The wedding must go ahead as planned.

141
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,580
Back then, he threw you into the water,

142
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,460
and you threw him in prison.

143
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,700
Now that he's a leader in Azure Dragon,

144
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,780
what if he seeks revenge?

145
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,100
That'll be too risky.

146
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,020
I have to try no matter what.

147
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,780
Have we got enough men?

148
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,980
All taken care of.

149
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,140
They aren't locals,

150
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,340
and they know the drill.

151
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,900
Pay them enough,

152
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,420
and no questions asked.

153
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,780
I'll go in first.

154
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
You can wait outside.

155
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
That's too dangerous.

156
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,660
I'll go with you.

157
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,980
Don't worry.

158
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,220
I know what to do.

163
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Will Hound get...?

164
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
Come on, Quan.

165
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,260
Since when did you become a chicken?

166
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,940
It was that piece of land

167
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,420
that got Ran jail time years back.

168
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,180
Meanwhile, Hound got to know Bishop

169
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,300
and made big deals.

170
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,260
Maybe

171
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,620
he'll even get to know

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,380
You can't be thinking

193
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,900
I'll settle for peanuts.

194
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,300
Say it.

195
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,900
What do you want to let it go?

196
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,260
Thanks to you, Ran was put in jail

197
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,660
and suffered a ton.

198
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,940
Your hair looks pretty.

199
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,420
How about I give you a haircut?

200
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,260
Qiang, Quan,

201
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
business first.

202
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,180
Got it.

203
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,540
Let's go.

204
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,540
Come on.

205
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
Just fixed it.

206
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,900
Sit.

207
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,140
What do you want?

208
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
A favor.

209
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,140
Why did you come to me despite fear?

210
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,180
Because only you

211
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,420
can help me.

212
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,260
So you need my help.

213
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,020
As long as you agree

214
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,620
to be someone else,

215
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,780
I'll give you anything you want.

216
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,260
Who is that?

217
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,540
Xiang Tingdong.

218
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,140
You two look exactly the same.

219
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,900
I know this is too much to ask,

220
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,260
but I will pay you as much as I can.

221
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,540
Say that again.

222
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,140
I'd like you to be Xiang...

223
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,300
Do you hear yourself?

224
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,140
It's absurd, I know.

225
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,900
But I'm desperate.

226
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,500
How about this?

227
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,620
We do another coin toss.

228
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,620
If you get heads,

229
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
you'll come with me.

230
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,780
If it's tails,

231
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,420
I'm at your disposal.

232
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,260
Sorry, not in the mood.

233
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,340
You should go.

234
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,260
Or I will drown you in the sea.

235
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,180
So,

236
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,860
is there no room for negotiation?

237
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,900
What else is there to say?

238
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,220
I...

239
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,020
I implore you to reconsider my offer.

240
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,500
Why bother?

241
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,020
Here you go.

242
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,580
Goodbye.

243
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,780
There he is!

244
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,780
Go get him!

245
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
You seem even bolder than before.

246
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,660
Even if you kill me,

247
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,460
I...

248
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,860
Remember how many bullets

249
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,260

250
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,380
