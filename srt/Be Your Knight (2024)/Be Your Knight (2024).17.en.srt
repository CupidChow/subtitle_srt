00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,180
Mr. Ba, I didn't mean
to give Han Shan a hard time,

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,860
but something must be wrong with him.

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,020
Besides, that woman too.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,380
We let them go today.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,780
Maybe they will be

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,940
a huge threat to us!

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,420
Mr. Ba, are you confused?

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,260
Did you forget

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,060
how you lost the hand?

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,300
Mr. Ba.

11
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,940
(Two Years Ago, Mr. Ba's Mansion)

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,340
You called me back in a hurry.

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,340
What's wrong?

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,820
Our clients said

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,460
you reduced the purity of the goods,

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,340
and they weren't happy about it.

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,380
You broke the rules.

18
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,420
Mr. Ba,

19
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,540
I only wanted to

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,540
increase our profits.

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,620
If they're not happy,

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,420
just let them be.

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,300
They still have to buy our stuff, right?

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,860
Mr...

25
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,180
Mr. Ba...

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,780
Nose, eyes,

27
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,020
or hands.

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,940
Pick one.

29
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,180
Mr. Ba!

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,020
Mr. Ba, I'm sorry!

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,140
I won't do it again!

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,340
Please give me a chance, Mr. Ba!

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,180
It won't happen again, Mr. Ba!

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,780
- Mr. Ba...
- Don't be scared.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,540
Mr. Ba, please!

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,140
Mr. Be, I'm begging you!

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,220
Mr. Ba...

38
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,580
Mr. Ba!

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,140
Hai, don't blame me.

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,060
This is the price you pay
for breaking the rules.

41
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,420
Mr. Ba.

42
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,500
I got it.

43
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,540
No.

44
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,340
You don't understand.

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,660
Do you know

46
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,380
who Han Shan's friend

47
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,260
Commander Liu is?

48
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,740
I have no idea.

49
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,420
Commander Liu controls

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,340
the entire south rail line.

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,980
Do you understand now?

52
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,260
Hai,

53
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,820
the market

54
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,020
requires high-quality goods,

55
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,100
and our old clients

56
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,620
are increasingly difficult to satisfy.

57
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,140
In terms of drug purification,

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,860
Xiang's Jimin Pharmaceuticals
is taking the lead.

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,500
I need Han Shan.

60
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,060
More importantly,
I need what he can provide.

61
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,340
But Han Shan is very suspicious.

62
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,700
Don't say it again!

63
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,980
Is it funny to show us some pictures?

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,740
Stop humiliating yourself

65
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,500
unless you have solid evidence!

(Cheng)

69
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,860
I'm not surprised

70
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,500
that you'd rather

71
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,660
drink wine here

72
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,420
than eat something delicious.

73
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,380
Food is important,

74
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
so is wine.

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,340
So, you used to

76
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,180
drink alone here, didn't you?

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,620
I did,

78
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,380
but not anymore.

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
Whether it's drinking

80
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,740
or something else,

81
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,580
you'll be with me.

82
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,100
Deal?

83
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,380
Do you know

84
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,740
why I like drinking?

85
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,980
Why?

86
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,940
Wine is not sweet

87
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,660
but bitter

88
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,820
and dry.

89
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,740
But for me,

90
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,220
it has magic.

91
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,020
It can distract me

92
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,540
from bad thoughts for a while.

93
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,500
For example...

94
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,100
the memory of watching

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,420
my parents get killed
when I was in the closet.

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,900
I forget now.

97
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,060
You hunted me
with your people in Yunzhou

98
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,180
and shot me.

99
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,060
I forget now.

100
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,780
You've held a grudge.

101
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,380
You kidnapped me

102
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,580
and made me fall into the water.

103
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,940
We're even.

104
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Back then,

105
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,780
you put me in jail.

106
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,340
I'll pretend it never happened.

107
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,820
Okay.

108
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,780
Ran, thanks

109
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,860
for your generosity,

110
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,780
Let's see

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,060
Please forget about this too.

113

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,260

as Tingdong or yourself?

157
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,780
I need to be him

158
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,100
once in a while.

159
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,900
Do you mean

160
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,220
you don't want to stop

Aunt,

163
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,780
Ye Ran didn't come back

164
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,260
to do bad things.

165
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,540
At least I'll never do

166
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,860
anything against our family.

167
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,780
If I thought you were a bad person,

168
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,620
I wouldn't have invited you to lunch.

169
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,380
Right now,

170
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,780
one of my family
is in a coma in the hospital,

171
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,900
and the other one is struggling for life
with a ventilator.

172
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,940
If anything happens to you,

173
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,780
our family will fall apart!

174
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,940
I only hope

175
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,340
you can let go

176
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,380
as much as you can

177
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,780
to avoid

178
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,940
making more mistakes.

179
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,820
We should get on with our lives

180
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,860
as a family.

181
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,260
Cheng

182
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,820
seems to be a gentle girl,

183
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,380
but in fact,

184
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,620
she's stubborn as a mule.

185
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,340
However, I didn't expect you

186
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,140
to be more stubborn than her.

187
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,180
You're just like Ruoyun.

188
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,700
Ye Ran,

189
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,020
right?

190
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,140
Ye for leaves,

191
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,100
and Ran for flames.

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,580
Tingdong and you...

193
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,380
Which one

194
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,820
is the elder brother?

195
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,220
My mother said

196
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,220
he was two minutes older than me.

197
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,820
By the way,

198
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,620
how was Ruoyun

199
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,380
before?

200
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,660
Not good.

201
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
But...

202
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,020
she tried her best
to make life easier for me

203
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,660
and make me happy.

204
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,740
She'd plant flowers in the garden,

205
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,100
fold colored papers

206
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,220
into many things new to me,

207
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,820
and teach me the piano.

208
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,700
Well,

209
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,500
and then?

210
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,380
Then...

211
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,620
when I was seven years old,

212
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,020
she passed away.

213
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,180
(So, you've given me
all the beautiful things)

214
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,660
(you've ever experienced.)

215
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,620
Let's forget about it.

216
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,140
Tingdong's birthday

217
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,780
is coming.

218
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,700
It's also your birthday.

219
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,340
I wanted

220
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,260
to send it to you on your birthday,

221
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,220
but I'm afraid I might be busy
and forget about it.

222
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,820
It's a small gift.

223
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,820
Thanks.

224
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,700
Thank you, aunt.

225
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,420
Let's eat.

226
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,900
It's getting cold.

227
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,960
(At this moment, I finally realize)

228
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
(that everyone in the Xiang Family)

229
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,820
(is miserable.)

230
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,070
(Everyone is living in their own hell.)

231
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,540
Eat more.

232
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
(Luckily,)

233
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,320
(home)

234
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,080
(is always our safe harbor.)
