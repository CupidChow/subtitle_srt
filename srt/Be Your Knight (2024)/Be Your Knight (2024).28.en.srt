00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,460
(One Week Later)

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,300
Watch this. Take off the top
and the bottom.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,020
I think I've been here before.

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,220
Why does it feel so familiar?

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,180
Mr. Thirteen,

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,300
why are you here?

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,980
Why did you bring so many things?

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,420
Can't you tell?

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,300
I'm here to formally propose to you.

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,020
I will be your man.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,780
I will be your husband.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,380
Why are you joking about this again?

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,100
I really can't stand it.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,780
Besides, take back

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,140
all these things.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm quite busy running the company.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,820
Save some trouble for me.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,780
Lan.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,980
I mean it.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,220
I've fallen in love with you.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,300
Since the first time we met,

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,300
I've felt

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,420
we must've been lovers
in the previous life.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,620
That's why I met you in this life.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,380
Besides, your family has suffered a lot.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,940
You need

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,860
a reliable

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,980
and powerful man

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,540
to help to take care of everything.

30
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,220
Please give me a chance, okay?

31
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,100
Mr. Thirteen,

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,340
thank you

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,780
for taking care of me over the years.

34
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,820
You always say

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,380
you owe me a lot,

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,740
but in fact,

37
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,100
you owe me nothing,

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,140
and you don't need to pay anything.

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,980
Lan,

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,860
I'll take care of you like an orchid.

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,180
I love you so much.

42
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,540
I appreciate your help

43
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,380
and treat you like a good friend,

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,860
but that's

45
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,500
not love.

46
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,020
The man I want to marry

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,340
is not good at expressing himself,

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,660
but he's reliable.

49
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,860
He always

50
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,940
makes me feel safe.

51
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,380
I really like him.

52
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Him?

53
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,580
Who is he?

54
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,460
Bro, as her bodyguard,

55
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,020
you're always around him.

56
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,900
Do you know who that man is?

57
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,500
That man is...

58
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,500
Hao.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,140
Go to work.

60
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,500
Okay.

61
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,220
Mr. Thirteen,

62
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,700
take back

63
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,740
your things.

64
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,340
You don't have to be polite to me

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,180
We can play mahjong

66
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,420
some day.

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,140
The Chinese New Year is coming.

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,100
You'll need a lot of things.

69
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,300
Besides, look,

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,940
it's nice to put
the flowers here, right?

71
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,500
Okay.

72
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
I'll visit you in a few days.

73
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,700
You can also come and play mahjong.

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,660
Okay.

75
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,700
See you.

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,580
Hao,

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,900
did you get hurt?

80
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,900
Don't move.

81
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,700
It's done.

82
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,460
Your foot needs to get better quickly.

83
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,940
This ointment

84
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,340
is good for sprains.

85
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,860
I only twisted my ankle.

86
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
Why do I have to

87
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,580
get better quickly?

88
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Because

89
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,780
I want you to wear pretty shoes.

90
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,780
What did you say?

91
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Ms. Ruolan,

92
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,060
I want to marry you.

93
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,660
What?

94
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,860
You're a noble heiress,

95
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,620
and we're so different,

96
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,740
so I couldn't

97
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,260
and wouldn't dare

98
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,820
get close to you.

99
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,460
So,

100
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,420
are you still going to marry me?

101
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,900
I...

102
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,820
I can only try my best to protect you.

protecting you is not only my duty

105
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,020
but my aspiration.

00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,860
I've been thinking

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,580
I know you like me,

176
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,060
but

177
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,060
you like him more.

178
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,020
You can't marry
two men at the same time.

179
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,900
I understand.

180
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,380
Lan has made the right choice.

181
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,660

00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,300

185
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,180
will you

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,180
attend our wedding?

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,100
you've worked hard for so many years

189
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,060
and finally eliminated

190
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,100
the monster Mr. Ba

191
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,420
and his drug production base.

192

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
I'll visit you

196
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,620
when I go to Yunzhou.

197
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,580
You can finally be yourself now.

198
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,020
Shouldn't you

199
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,300
have another wedding

200
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,820
so that I can attend it?

201
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,980
Uncle Li, if you have time,

202
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,820
you can attend
my aunt and Hao's wedding.

203
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,620
They're having a wedding.

204
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,300
- Really?
- Yes.

205
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,100
Hao asked me
to give you the invitation.

206
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,220
Unfortunately,

207
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,780
I don't think I can make it.

208
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
I've got a lot of work to do.

209
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,460
I will

210
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,620
visit them someday.

211
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,140
My bro,

212
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,300
goodbye.

213
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,700
Goodbye.

214
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,700
Be safe.

215
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,500
You too.

216
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,340
why are you smiling?

217
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm just think

218
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,700
why you don't want

219
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,300
to have another wedding

220
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,420
and let me marry you as Ye Ran.

221
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,740
Because we got married

222
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,980
and took the vows

223
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,340
as Ye Ran and Cheng Che.

224
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,220
Now the vows have been fulfilled.

225
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,620
We've been through the hard times

226
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,980
and trusted each other.

227
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,060
I am Ye Ran's wife

228
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,060
and don't need another wedding
to prove that.

229
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,020
Then from now on,

230
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,580
Mrs. Ye, I hope we can continue

231
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,220
to go through hardships

232
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,700
and trust each other

233
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,460
till death do us part.

234
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,100
Mrs. Ye?

235
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,860
You've already changed the word.

236
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,900
Till death do us part.

237
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,460
God will bless us.

238
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,140
How did you get here?

239
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,820
I robbed a bank

240
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,940
and got arrested.

241
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,340
How about you?

242
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,820
I stabbed someone.

243
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,300
And you?

244
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,300
I blew up a building.

245
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,860
Nice.

246
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,300
From now on, we're brothers.
