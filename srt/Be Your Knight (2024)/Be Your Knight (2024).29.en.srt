I can do it. Don't feed me.

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,100
No,

126
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,380
your hands are fine,

127
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,820
but your leg was shot.

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,220
Besides, you can't use an anesthetic.
It must hurt.

129
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,060
Isn't it too dramatic

130
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,500
to wrap my leg like this?

131
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,940
Let me do it.

132
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,420
Ye Ran, it's not a big deal.

133
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,460
As the beautiful owner of New Fairy,

134
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,860
I haven't showered
or worn any makeup for days.

135
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,700
I'm fine. I can go home.

136
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,740
No.

137
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,220
Your hand was shot.

138
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,660
You took the bullet for me.

139
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,060
You can't leave here.

140
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,860
Can I put some makeup on

141
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,900
and come back?

142
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,540
No.

143
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,820
Eat an orange.

144
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,340

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Lan,

151
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,820
I...

152
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
I'm afraid...

153
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,500
I can't live for long.

154
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,260

155
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,980

156
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,420

157
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,340

158
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,340
If there's another life,

159
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,560
I...

160
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,500
You owe me nothing!

161
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,620
Stop pretending. Get up.

162
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,580
Get up!

163
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,740
Well, bro,

164
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,620
what's going on?

165
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,220
Didn't you promise
to keep the secret for me?

166
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
I didn't tell her.

167
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,180
Then who told her?

168
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,940
By the way,

169
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,780
I have a question.

170
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,740
Legally speaking,
you're still not married, right?

171
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,180
But we've set a new date

172
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,620
for our wedding.
