1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,460
You want to be a man

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,250
instead of a dog?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,850
You don't deserve it.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,090
Boss, there's something...

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,420
Boss, boss!

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,900
I didn't know you were in a bad mood!

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,730
Don't hit me! Please!

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,050
What is it?

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,980
Speak.

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,100
Boss,

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,620
someone wants to see you.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,980
His name is Bishop.

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,090
I looked into him.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,940
He is Han Shan's man.

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,010
So, you...

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,810
Does he work for Han Shan?

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,460
Yes.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,050
Let him in.

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,090
Yes, boss.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,940
Mr. Bishop, do you mean

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,540
the Han Shan in Yunzhou now

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,900
is not the real Han Shan

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,300
but someone

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,570
who looks exactly like him?

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,690
Yes.

26
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,850
There's a person called Ye Ran,

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,860
who looks exactly

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,540
like Mr. Han Shan.

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,100
However, surprisingly,

30
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,380
he died in Yun Zhou,

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,290
and no one has ever found his body.

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,210
I was wonder

33
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,540
why he suddenly became brave.

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,540
It turns out he's been impersonating

35
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,900
the real Han Shan.

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,650
He's a phony.

37
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,210
Mr. Bishop.

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,460
You didn't come this far

39
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,770
only

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,650
(Information)
only to give me this, did you?

41
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,380
Hai, you're really straightforward.

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,020
Then I won't hide it anymore.

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,380
Over the past year,

44
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,130
I've worked for Han Shan

45
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,100
and suffered a lot.

46
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,460
Consider this

47
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,570
as

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,210
a report letter to you.

49
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,740
Hai, I wonder

50
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,260
if you like it.

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,020
Yes!

52
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,460
That's good.

53
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,770
Why wouldn't I?

54
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,970
Runxi,

55
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,850
Put Mr. Bishop's report letter

56
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,940
in the room.

57
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,180
Yes, boss.

58
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,100
Thanks, boss.

59
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,490
Well, Mr. He,

60
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,020
looking forward to our cooperation.

61
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,580
Mr. Bishop,

62
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,930
you don't have to be polite.

63
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,650
We're brothers now.

64
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,490
My boss is your boss.

65
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,420
Yes.

66
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,340
If you need anything, just ask me.

67
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,250
If I can't fix it, you can...

68
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,050
I don't hire traitors.

69
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,420
Boss.

70
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,700
I think

71
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,050
we should capture Han Shan

72
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,140
and kill him,

73
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,210
once and for all.

74
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,740
Boss, I'm loyal!

75
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,490
Why do I only have

76
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,460
an idiot working for me?

77
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,810
What's the point of killing him?

78
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,460
Mr. Ba is coming back.

79
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,860
I will expose and tear him apart

80
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,860
at Mr. Ba's

81
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,370
welcome party.

84
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
So,

85
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,460
why did you look for me

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,170
after I left last time?

87
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,210
Because...

88
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,020
the flowers were blooming.

89
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,940
Because of you,

90
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,290
I can see flowers every morning

91
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,260
when I wake up.

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,530
Every day is a fresh start.

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,970
Thank you.

Ye Ran?

104
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,580
He's good at this.

105
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,100
Ye Ran?

106
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,610
Miss, it's me.

107
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,370
Where's Ye Ran?

108
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,460
I don't know, miss.

109
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,260
I only saw you when I came in.

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,610
By the way, miss,

111
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,580
I've finally found
Deng Dahai's whereabouts.

112
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,850
Tonight, he'll hold a private banquet

113
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,380
at New Fairy.

114
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,290
(New Fairy.)

115
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,610
(Tonight.)

116
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,060
(Did Ye Ran left without a word)

117
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,290
(because he knew about this)

118
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,940
(and went to see him?)

119
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,290
(I'm running out of time.)

120
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,500
(I have to take a risk.)

121
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,380
Deng Dahai is very secretive.

122
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,460
If we miss the change tonight,

123
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,940
I don't know

124
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,820
when I can see him again.

125
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,610
I have to confirm

126
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,210
if he has a scar on his hand.

127
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,530
Are Mr. Thirteen's guards still outside?

128
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,020
Yes.

129
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,860
Xin Yi,

130
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,020
do me a favor.

131
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,540
Okay.

132
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
In the illegal drug industry
of Tangcheng,

133
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,290
someone called Mr. Ba

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,340
is more powerful than Deng Dahai
and Xiang Tingdong.

135
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,290
My information says

136
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,410
Deng Dahai

137
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,340
will hold

138
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,900
a welcome party for a big man

139
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,460
at New Fairy tonight.

140
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,850
This person

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,500
must be Mr. Ba.

142
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,900
It's very likely.

143
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,090
Mr. Ba

144
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,090
rarely shows up in public.

145
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,730
We don't know

146
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,340
his temper.

147
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,170
Is it too careless

148
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,890
to approach him now?

149
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,850
Should we wait for more information?

150
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,700
I don't need to convince him

151
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,420
that I'm Han Shan.

152
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,180
An experienced man like him
won't be fooled.

153
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,340
Maybe we should change the strategy.

154
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,730
I'll let him know my abilities.

155
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,300
Miss,

156
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,890
New Fairy is closed
to the public tonight.

157
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,890
Does this work for you?

158
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,250
Only those invited can come in.

159
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,580
Nothing else can work.

160
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,730
Please leave.

161
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,420
Thanks.

162
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,090
Ms. Xiao.

163
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,820
Ms. Cheng, why are you here

164
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,890
at this moment?

165
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,090
Can you take me in?

166
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,820
You're candid,

167
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,250
no small talks at all.

168
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,010
You're a straightforward person,

169
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,460
so I don't need

170
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,970
to hide my intentions.

171
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,490
You saw it at the charity banquet.

172
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,090
If you get into this mess,

173
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,250
your life will be at risk.

174
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,580
You got lucky last time.

175
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,700
I suggest you

176
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,090
go home.

177
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,210
Ms. Xiao, thanks for your kindness.

178
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,300
However,

179
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,890
there are certain things in life

180
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,580
that you have to do
even if you might lose your life.

181
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,850
Please.

182
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,370
You two really wouldn't stop
bothering me.

183
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,020
Long time no see.

184
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,910
It's been a while.

185
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,850
Music!

186
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,700
Let's get it started!

187
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,300
Mr. Ba!

188
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,210
I've waited for this day for too long!

189
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,250
You're finally back!

190
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,380
Mr. Ba.

191
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,490
Hai,

192
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,890
(Mr. Ba, Narco Boss in Tangcheng)
you're always so dramatic.

193
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,610
It's your welcome party.

194
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,460
It's just a basic manner.

195
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,460
Commander Liu,
New Fairy is an interesting place.

196
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,700
-Mr. Ba will be there today.
-Yes.

197
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,060
You have to see him.

198
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,730
Mr. Ba.

199
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,250
Mr. Ba,

200
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,940
this wine

201
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,850
is very rare in Tangcheng.

202
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,130
Where's Han Shan?

203
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,060
Why isn't he here?

204
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,660
Mr. Han Shan,

205
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,940
you can't come in today.

206
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,130
Since you know who I am,

207
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,540
let me in.

208
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,780
Mr. Han Shan,

209
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,970
Mr. Hai has said

210
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,460
you can't come in today.

211
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,300
Han Shan just got married,

212
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,420
so I wanted to give him some space.

213
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,140
Mr. Ba,

214
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,850
there's another bottle of fine wine.

215
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,850
Wait a minute. I'll bring it to you.

216
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,940
What if I insist?

217
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,460
Han Shan.

218
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,250
You know we have rules.

219
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,890
We don't interrupt
each other's business.

220
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,250
I'm the host of New Fairy tonight,

221
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,850
and it seems

222
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,700
you're not invited.

223
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,300
Hai,

224
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,780
indeed, you are the host.

225
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,820
You don't want to see me,

226
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,210
but it doesn't mean Mr. Ba doesn't.

227
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,460
Young man,

228
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,940
I'd also like to see Mr. Ba tonight.

229
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,730
Who are you?

230
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,090
It's not your turn to talk, okay?

231
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,060
Tingdong, let's go.

232
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,730
Didn't you hear me?

233
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:24,620
(New Fairy)

234
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,420
You don't even know Commander Liu.

235
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,660
How dare you pull out a gun?

236
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,300
Tingdong,

237
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,850
let's go.

238
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,540
He just ran away after that.

239
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,490
There are a lot of people.

240
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,660
I really envy young people like you.

241
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,820
You know how to enjoy life.

242
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,780
It's a nice place.

243
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,140
Yes.

244
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,180
Commander,

245
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,540
I need to say hello.

246
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,490
About this...

247
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,780
Please.

248
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,700
Then impress me.

249
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,090
Mr. Ba.

250
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,780
It's been a long time.

251
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,300
You're finally back.

252
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,010
I was asking Hai

253
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,970
why you didn't come.

254
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,250
He told me

255
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,730
you just got married.

256
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,780
Marriage really changes a man.

257
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,490
You look...

258
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,890
quite different.

259
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,410
Mr. Ba, please don't make fun of me.

260
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,490
By the way,

261
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,740
allow me to introduce someone.

262
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
This is...

263
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,690
Commander Liu!

264
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,170
Why are you here?

265
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,850
Tingdong talked about you a lot,

266
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,850
saying Mr. Ba is doing
something big here.

267
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,610
How could I not come?

268
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,170
If I had known it,

269
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,340
I would've welcomed you myself.

270
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,580
Yirou, take Commander Liu to his seat.

271
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,220
No need.

272
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,340
You can visit me when you have time.

273
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,370
That's great. I'd love to.

274
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,450
I'll definitely visit you soon.

275
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,930
Tingdong.

276
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,690
Take care, commander.

277
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,610
See you, commander.

278
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,180
Mr. Ba.

279
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,260
Han Shan,

280
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,410
you've really changed a lot.

281
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,890
Tell me,

282
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,850
how did you get to know Commander Liu?

283
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,540
Well, it was a coincidence.

284
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,340
When I was on a business trip,

285
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,340
I saw Commander Liu get injured,

286
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,980
and I gave him my ointment.

287
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,740
That's how I got to know him.

288
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,850
Oh, I see.

289
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,980
Waiter.

290
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,300
Why are you giving me wine?

291
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,620
Where's the stuff?

292
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,220
Hai, have a drink and calm down.

293
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,450
I've arranged everything.

294
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,300
Congratulations on your marriage.

295
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,450
Thanks, Mr. Ba.

296
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,450
Distinguished guests,

297
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,340
the masquerade begins.

298
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,820
Please have fun with your partner.

299
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,690
Mr. Ba, excuse me.
