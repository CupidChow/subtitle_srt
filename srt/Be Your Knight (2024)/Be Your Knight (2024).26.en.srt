1
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,100
Why is the house

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,860
in such a mess?

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,340
Hao!

4
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,440
Hao!

5
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,020
Hao!

6
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,380
Get off me!

7
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,420
Hao!

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,380
Ms. Xiang,

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,340
if you don't tell us

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,260
where your ephedra is,

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,260
he'll be

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,380
beaten to death.

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,980
We've been short of ephedra.

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,940
You know that.

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,460
We talked about it before.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Runxi.

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,180
Go ahead.

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,340
Don't go too far!

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,780
Ms. Xiang.

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,220
I suggest you

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,940
think about it carefully.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,940
Mr. Ba, what are you doing?

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,540
Han Shan,

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,580
Yirou came back and told me

25
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,220
the ephedra you got in Yunzhou

26
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,500
was burned.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,140
You failed.

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,540
I'm so disappointed.

29
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,380
I can only fix it in my way.

30
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,220
Mr. Ba,

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,260
I came back to solve the problem.

32
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,260
Let them go.

33
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm responsible for this.

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
I'll definitely make up
for the loss.

35
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,980
I will

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,060
let them go.

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,500
After all, they're your family.

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,500
Yan Lin,

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,220
can you make the products
without raw materials?

40
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,940
I can't do it

41
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,260
without raw materials.

42
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,220
See?

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,100
Your wife said so.

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,780
What else can I do?

45
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,380
Han Shan.

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,980
Your aunt doesn't want to tell us

47
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,780
where Jimin Pharmaceuticals's
ephedra is.

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,780
Who don't you

49
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,180
help me to make her talk?

50
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,620
Xiang Tingdong,

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,140
what the hell have you done?

52
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,220
Who are they?

53
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,260
Aunt.

54
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,620
Tell them where it is.

55
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,340
Only in this way

56
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,100
can you save him

57
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,620
from wounds and pains.

58
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,820
Xiang Tingdong, are you crazy?

59
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,100
What are you doing?

60
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,620

61
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,540

62
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,140
(Half a Month Ago)

63
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,100
Hao,

64
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,900
why did you

65
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,900
ask me out?

66
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,580
Did something happen to my aunt?

67
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,780
No.

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,100
I want to talk to you.

69
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,740
Tell me.

70
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,100
Mr. Xiang,

71
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,260
since I was a kid, my father has told me

72
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,460
my duty is to protect
the entire Xiang Family.

73
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,300
However, since you came back,

74
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,620
I've realized

75
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,020
that fights and pure strengths

76
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,580
are not enough.

77
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,420
I want to be like you.

78
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,260
I want to do

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,860
more meaningful things.

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,540
Hao.

81
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,900
Thank you for protecting us secretly

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,340
and risking your life to save us.

83
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,820
However, this path

84
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,660
is much more dangerous
than you can imagine.

85
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,660
I know.

86
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,340
Since I started to work for you,

87
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
I've realized

88
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,300
that I want to do my best

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,020
to protect more people.

90
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,660
Mr. Ba and Deng Dahai

91
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,540
betrayed the country and the people.

92
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,300
I also want to help you

93
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,540
to eliminate the monsters.

94
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,540
Hao,

95
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,780
if you choose this path,

96
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,100
there'll be no turning back.

97
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,740
I'll never turn back.

98
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,740
Xiang Tingdong, are you crazy?

99
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,140
What are you doing?

100
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,780
Hao!

101
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,100
Hao!

102
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,500
Hao!

103
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,900
Hao!

104
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,180
Don't move!

105
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,100
Mr. Xiang...

106
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,660
I was wrong about you.

107
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,180
Just kill me.

108
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,580
Sorry.

109
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,620
Stop!

110
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,140
I'll give them the stuff.

111
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,340
Let him go.

112
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,020
Kill me if you dare!

113
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,020
You nasty dog!

114
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,020
Aunt,

115
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,060
I hope you can keep your promise.

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,860
Aunt, no!

117
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,940
From now on,

118
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,940
you're not my family anymore!

119
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,140
Get the hell out of here!

120
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,980
And you.

121
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,260
If you dare to come again,

122
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,020
I swear,

123
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,420
you'll go to hell

124
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,220
with me!

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,180
Does it hurt?

126
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,220
I'm fine.

127
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,260
Ye Ran went so far.

128
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,980
It was just a show.

129
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,900
How could he beat you so hard?

130
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,500
Don't blame him.

131
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,420
I asked him to.

132
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,660
I hope

133
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,940
today's show can help him,

134
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,260
and it'll be worth it.

135
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,500
Put on your coat.

136
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,580
I can do it.

137
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,180
What do you

138
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,500
think of me?

139
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,660
Very beautiful.

140
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,500
No.

141
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,620
I mean,

142
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,140
what do you think of my performance

143
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,420
in today's show?

144
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,780
Your performance?

145
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,220
I must say

146
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,380
you almost got me fooled.

147
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,020
I've finally realized

148
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,500
what kind of man Mr. Ba is.

149
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,540
It's been so difficult

150
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,620
for Cheng and Ye Ran

151
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,140
to have come this far.

152
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,660
Success is just around the corner.

153
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,540
I hope

154
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,700
both of them can be safe.

155
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,460
They will.

156
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,900
You'll

157
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,460
be safe, too.

is completely different

186
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,340
from the sample you gave me.

187
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,460
Why?

188
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,860
It's quite different.

189
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,140
The raw materials of the Xiang Family

190
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,460
don't have any problems.

191
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,460
Why would the quality be different?

192
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,300
The manual I gave to the factory

193
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,940
has specified the purification methods

194
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,020
and chemical formulas.

195
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,300
Even the operation rules

196
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,780
are very clear.

197
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,860
It can't be different.

198
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,140
Maybe...

199
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,260
I don't need explanations.
I only care about the results!

200
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,260
Tell me how to fix it!

201
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,980
Mr. Ba, please give me some time.

202
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,700
I'll go back and analyze the product

203
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,820
to see what the problem is.

204
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,300
How much time do you need?

205
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,740
About a week.

206
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,180
The manual I gave to Mr. He

207
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,140
was slightly changed.

208
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,020
When the product is finished,

209
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,340
there will be a problem.

210
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,300
Meanwhile,

211
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,140
the clients we arranged

212
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,780
will push him to deliver the goods.

213
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,980
Mr. Ba will lose his patience.

214
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,780
He'll send you to the factory
to make the products.

215
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,500
If I can get in,

216
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,940
I'll have the chance

217
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,740
to give you the address.

218
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,420
How much time do we have?

219
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,300
We're running out of time.

220
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,860
The clients are pushing us.

221
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,940
Mr. Kai commanded us

222
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,100
to deliver the goods in half a month.

223
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,700
I'll make an exception for you.

224
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,460
Go to the factory

225
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,060
and teach them

226
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,780
the most accurate process.

227
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,580
If I still get a defective product,

228
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,500
don't blame me for having no mercy.

229
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,180
Yirou,

230
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,580
take her to the factory now.

231
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,860
Ms. Yan Lin,

232
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,180
come with me.

233
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,140
Mr. Ba.

234
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,660
If you're worried about product delays,

235
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,260
I can ask my wife

236
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,740
to speed up the development process,

237
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,180
but it's inappropriate

238
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,900
to let her go to the factory.

239
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,540
Whether it's appropriate or not

240
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,460
is up to me!
