1
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,480
Don't be nervous.

2
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,360
We've rehearsed this before.

3
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,790
Grandma, just hit me.

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,030
Leave her alone.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
(Actually, ever since I approached him,)

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,920
(he's been helping
and cooperating with me.)

7
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,830
(I'm the one who's been too demanding.)

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,040
I agreed to help you find the key,

9
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,950
but Grandma is in the hospital now,

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,150
and I'm grounded.

11
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,480
Everyone's watching us.

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,000
We need a way to get out.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Why did you suddenly

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,560
agree to help me find the key?

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,040
With your persistence,

16
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,200
you'd eventually make me agree.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,070
Might as well skip

18
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,230
the annoying details.

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
This is the last time.

20
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,140
=Be Your Knight=

21
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,060
=Episode 6 Tonight With an Umbrella=

22
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,390
Maybe the key isn't hidden somewhere

23
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,790
but with someone.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,070
What do you mean?

25
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,110
This woman in the photo

26
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,990
came to see me on the wedding day.

27
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,830
No.

28
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,640
She came to see Xiang Tingdong.

29
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,580
(Xiao Xiao, owner of New Fairy)

30
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,510
Why are you looking at me so surprised?

31
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,270
You've become even more beautiful.

32
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,920
You're not here
to crash the wedding, are you?

33
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,200
Don't worry.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,160
I don't have that intention.

35
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,360
After all,

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,390
you're about to become
someone's husband.

37
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,880
There's something
I need to remind you of.

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,950
Be careful these days.

39
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,790
They're watching you.

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,560
Go on.

41
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,070
Your wife is waiting for you.

42
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,040
They were close.

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm guessing the key

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,390
is probably with her.

45
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,550
What woman?

46
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,950
What's her name?

47
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,830
How would I know who she is?

48
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Why didn't you
figure it out at the time?

49
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,160
Miss Cheng,

50
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,320
I attended the wedding

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,070
on behalf of your fiancé.

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,320
His mistress showed up to find me

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,790
at the wedding.
Am I supposed to know who she is?

54
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,230
Does that make sense?

55
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,390
You

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,790
have a point.

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,720
I was being too hasty.

58
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,270
I think there might be a place

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
where we can find some clues.

60
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,480
Mr. Thirteen.

61
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,990
I just want to ask you.

62
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,110
Who is the woman in this photo?

63
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,080
Mrs. Tingdong.

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Instead of asking me

65
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,990
who the woman in the photo is,

66
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,870
why don't you just ask him?

67
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,190
Mr. Thirteen,

68
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,920
if he were willing to say,

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,790
would I be asking for your help?

70
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,120
Cheng,

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,400
I don't know her.

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,840
I have no idea who she is.

73
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,670
Stop overthinking, okay?

74
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,720
If I had known

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,280
you were fooling around outside,

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,750
I never should have married you.

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
Alright.

78
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,870
My beautiful lady.

79
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,960
You can always get a divorce.

80
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,550
Don't make yourself suffer.

81
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,720
How about this?

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,670
Go to New Fairy and have a look.

83
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,920
Maybe you'll find out what's going on.

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,670
You're being too formal.

85
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,670
I owe your aunt so much.

86
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm paying back a small part.

87
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,360
In the future, we'll be family.

88
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,520
No need for this.

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,040
(Mr. Thirteen seems slick and smooth.)

90
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,920
(Maybe I can get
something useful out of him.)

91
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,630
Goodbye then.

92
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,990
Come visit often.

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,430
Ertiao, grab an umbrella for the guests.

94
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,600
What bad luck.

95
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,840
The couple was all lovey-dovey.

96
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,360
Why did you hand them two umbrellas?

97
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,750
Do you even observe?

98
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,310
You're really as clueless
as your name suggests.

99
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
Thanks, Mr. Thirteen.

100
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,280
Tingdong, let's go.

101
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Bawan, note this.

102
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,920
Mr. and Mrs. Tingdong
are deeply in love.

103
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,670
Don't believe the rumors.

104
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,240
Yes.

105
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,110
Mr. Thirteen, do you know Han Shan?

106
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,870
Distant

107
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,520
yet close.

108
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,110
Just as they say:

109
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,960
The sky has its limits,

110
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,670
the sea has its shores,

111
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,790
and there's always someone better.

112
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,840
It was just a casual question.

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,480
You're Lan's real nephew.

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,720
I was just making conversation.

115
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,840
Goodbye.

116
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,990
We were supposed
to act in front of Mr. Thirteen,

117
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,920
and you actually hit me.

118
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,550
Didn't you say

119
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,670
we should act thoroughly?

120
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,790
You go back first.

121
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,790
I have things to do.

122
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,630
I'll take the tram back later.

123
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,960
Where are you going?

124
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,720
What are you doing?

125
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,520
Relax.

126
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,430
I'm not going to do anything bad.

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,920
That's not that I meant.

128
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,280
I'm worried your identity
might get exposed.

129
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,190
You're unfamiliar with this place.

130
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,670
What if something happens?

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,310
I need to stay by your side.

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,960
Cheng Che.

133
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,080
What you're really worried about is

134
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,990
whether my actions

135
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,520
will affect your plan to find the key.

136
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,200
For example,

137
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,190
will my identity be exposed?

138
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Will I regret it

139
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,550
and leave Tangcheng?

140
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,280
Do I have other motives?

141
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,920
Is that right?

142
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,870
That's not what I meant.

143
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,310
It's just...

144
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,230
Since I agreed to your way

145
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,870
and made a deal with you,

146
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,750
I will keep my promise.

147
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,680
I'll do

148
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,080
what I promised.

149
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,230
But

150
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,110
can you stop being so suspicious of me?

151
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,910
(Han Shan.)

152
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,150
(This drug dealer in Tangcheng)

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,480
(is indeed Xiang Tingdong.)

154
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,870
(He hasn't woken up yet.)

155
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,080
(I need to use this identity)

156
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,360
(to make a breakthrough)

157
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,080
(before he comes back.)

158
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,600
(This is an opportunity given by fate.)

159
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,870
(Maybe the biggest reason I was born)

160
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,630
(into the Xiang family.)

161
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,420
(Li's Tea Cafe)

162
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
Sir, your coffee.

163
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Thank you.

164
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,500
(Uncle Li, owner of Li's Tea Cafe)

165
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
Sir.

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,800
Take a look.

167
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,560
Did you drop this?

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,110
This is my hideout in Tangcheng.

169
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,600
If you need me, I'll be here.

170
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,030
Look into the background

171
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,630
of that woman who just left.

172
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,080
Would you like anything else?

173
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,870
How are Quan and Qiang doing?

174
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,630
Did Hound give them any trouble?

175
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,110
They followed your advice

176
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,800
and started a small business.

177
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,480
Everyone thought you were dead.

178
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,600
Naturally,

179
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,110
Hound stopped giving them trouble.

180
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,480
Are you getting used

181
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
to living with the Xiang family?

182
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,590
It's alright.

183
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,910
Just a small issue.

184
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,230
Is the woman I asked you to investigate

185
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,150
a singer from New Fairy?

186
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,750
Yes.

187
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,600
But she's not just a singer.

188
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,680
She's the owner of New Fairy.

189
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,440
She's also Mr. Du's
illegitimate daughter.

190
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,910
Mr. Du is the shipping tycoon.

191
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,150
But Mr. Du

192
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,230
passed away last year in an accident.

193
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,150
Xiang Tingdong

194
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,720
was very close to this woman.

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,110
I think we can find

196
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,510
more clues from her.

197
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,110
It means she knows him better.

198
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,150
This woman is no simple character.

199
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,510
You must be careful.

200
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,910
In front of her,

201
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,440
you could reveal a flaw at any time.

202
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Uncle Li,

203
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,680
we've worked hard in Yunzhou
for so many years,

204
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,440
but we still gained so little.

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,630
Now, with this face,
I've become Han Shan.

206
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,840
I have to take full advantage of this

207
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,870
to root out those
who are a threat to our country.

208

(Tram Waiting Area)

212
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,200
Why haven't you left yet?

213
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,950
Have you been

214
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,840
waiting here for me all this time?

215
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,510
It's been raining non-stop.

216
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,110
I thought you needed umbrella.

217
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,590
It's fine.

218
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,080
I have one.

219
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,630
Haven't you always wanted
to know the truth?

220
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,480
I'll tell you now.

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,510
Fifteen years ago,

222
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,910
a group of thugs broke into my parents'

223
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,200
pharmaceutical lab,

224
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,230
asking for the research manuscript
for drug purification.

225
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,320
I was hiding in a wardrobe at the time,

226
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,510
so I couldn't see the culprit's faces.

227
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,270
But I clearly remember

228
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,110
one of them had a scar on his hand,

229
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,680
and he was wearing

230
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,200
a tie clip exactly like this one.

231
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,110
But what does this tie clip

232
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,750
have to do with Xiang Tingdong?

233
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
You've wanted to know

234
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,150
what happened to your brother, right?

235
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,910
Xiang Tingdong,

236
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,870
when did you start smoking opium?

237
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,080
Stop smoking.

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Give it to me.

239
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,390
Where is this tie clip from?

240
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,360
How did you get it?

241
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,560
You tell me.

242
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,990
Who gave you this tie clip?

243
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
- Tell me!
- Stop pushing me!

244
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,990
Don't push me!

245
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,960
Did you hear me?

246
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,990
Cheng Che!

247
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,680
I was desperate to know

248
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,390
where this tie clip came from.
