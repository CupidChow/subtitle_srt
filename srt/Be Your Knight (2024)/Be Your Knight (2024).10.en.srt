1
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,620
Xiao Xiao.

2
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,940
Come in.

3
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,180
Right on time.

4
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,660
It seems you don't miss me that much.

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,220
I bought you a gift on my way here.

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,740
Check out my painting.

7
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,940
Big artist,

8
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,860
does it look good?

9
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,660
Don't worry.

10
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,660
You don't need to learn oil painting.

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,940
Your brother got interested

12
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,180
a few months ago.

13
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,580
He was a bad painter.

14
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,060
Stop making fun of me.

15
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,940
I've only learned for a few months.

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,220
How can I tell if it's a good painting?

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,460
Why did you leave in a rush last night?

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,780
Family stuff.

19
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,580
I learned a new dance recently.

20
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,060
Practice with me.

21
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,180
The room layout

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,100
has changed.

23
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,060
Tingdong,

24
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,980
you've been more interested in my room

25
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,220
than me.

26
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,780
You've changed.

27
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,500
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,260
Are you worried

29
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,140
that something is missing?

30
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,460
I just think

31
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,500
the flowers on your dresser

32
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,260
were quite chic.

33
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,460
I'm not in the mood.

34
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,000
Hush.

35
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,420
You look

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,260
so different today.

37
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,460
Miss.

38
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,820
Xin Yi,

39
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,140
is everything okay at New Fairy?

40
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,700
Nothing has happened yet,

41
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,140
but...

42
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,180
But what?

43
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,740
I think I saw some bodyguards

44
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,100
waiting outside the building.

45
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,540
No wonder Xiao Xiao

46
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,340
called him and asked him out.

47
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,660
She must've found something

48
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,100
and suspected Ye Ran's identity.

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,140
No.

50
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,380
I need to be there.

51
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,660
Miss, you can't go.

52
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,060
If Ye Ran is fine,

53
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,300
you might disrupt the plan.

54
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,300
My plan requires him

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,580
to come home by 10 p.m.

56
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,250
Miss,

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,000
you've been looking for the murderer
of your parents

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,660
for so many years.

59
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,060
Now we've finally found the evidence.

60
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,300
You can't give up.

61
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,980
I left teeth marks

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,460
on his shoulders,

63
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,460
but you don't have them.

64
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,860
Your palms feel much rougher than his.

65
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,860
Who are you?

66
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,660
Who am I?

67
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,940
Does it matter?

68
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,660
I'm not kidding this time.

69
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,620
I can't risk his life

70
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,180
for an uncertain outcome.

71
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,660
Miss!

72
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,260
Xin Yi, you don't understand.

73
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,260
I want more than just the key.

74
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
I want him alive.

75
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,380
How about this?

76
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,860
Ms. Xiao, I know you're serious.

77
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,660
This gun is loaded.

78
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm different from Xiang Tingdong.

79
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,420
Because I don't pity women.

80
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,660
What do you want?

81
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,220
Give me the key

82
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,460
I want.

83
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,100
What key?

84
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,380
I don't know.

85
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,260
You can kill me as you want.

86
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,380
Miss Xiao, you're not afraid of death,

87
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,900
but I don't think

88
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,140
you want to be ugly.

89
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,180
Sorry for this.

90
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,860
It's fine.

91
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
You can't leave New Fairy anyway.

Stop!

96
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,620
Mr. Tingdong,

97
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,740
are you okay?

98
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,700
Scared?

99
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,220
No.

100
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,770
We split up.

101
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,620
No.

102
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,020
I must protect you.

103
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,220
Distract them
so that you can protect me.

104
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,740
Okay.

105
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,300

Has Xiao Xiao

137
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
taken any action?

Not yet.

139
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,860

All this time,

144
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,500
have I been too selfish?

145
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,020
No, Miss.

146
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,060
You had no choice.

147
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,500

Cheng,

152
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,860
is Tingdong alright?

153
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,620
He's fine.

00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,380
I'm not talking about
the one lying in bed.

155
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,220

Xiang Tingdong.

158
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980
Tingdong...

159
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,340
Since you were a kid,

160
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
you've had the habit of making a fist

161
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,140
when you're nervous or lying.

162
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,620
Tell me.

163
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,220
Where is Tingdong?

164
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,780
What really happened?

165
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,900
I...

166
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,740
Everyone in Tangcheng knows

167
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,340
what happened at New Fairy tonight.

168
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,620
I know my nephew

169
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,940
very well.

170
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,180
Aunt...

171
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,380
Tell me.

172
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,660
Where's Tingdong?

173
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,750
Where did he go?

174
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,860
Did something happen to him?
