00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,780
Ms. Cheng,

2
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,740
from now on,

3
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,540
you're one of us.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,980
Your codename

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,300
is Yan Lin.
[*Yan, Lin: wild goose, woods]

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,380
When a wild goose cries,
the sound will echo in the woods.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,900
I hope you can surprise me.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,420
Mr. Ba, thank you

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,260
for making me useful.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,900
However,

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,260
I'm wondering

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,900
what you want from me.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,260
You showed up when I needed

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,620
high-quality products the most.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,980
It was such a coincidence.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,220
If you can't give me a good reason,

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,860
don't blame me

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,620
for wasting your talent.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,060
Mr. Ba, you should know

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,980
Deng Dahai murdered my parents.

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,740
My only wish

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,500
was to avenge my parents

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,860
by taking everything from him
and replacing him.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,820
Those are the raw materials
and equipment I need

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,180
for making the products.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,750
The clients in Southeast Asia want

27
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,020
a large quantity of high-quality drugs.

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,380
It's going to take some time.

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,060
Han Shan.

30
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,700
Hai is dead,

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,340
and now both of you

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,340
are my reliable partners.

33
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,940
The stolen ephedra

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,540
is still missing,

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,260
and I can't make products without it.

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,700
Did you

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,340
collude to set me up?

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,980
We had no choice

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,500
but to work together on this.

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,540
Mr. Ba,

41
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,740
none of us had a background

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,500
or anyone to rely on.

43
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,020
If we don't work together,

44
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,140
how can we make a name in Tangcheng?

45
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,660
Mr. Ba, don't worry,

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,740
I'll find a way to make up

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,500
for the stolen ephedra.

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,740
Okay.

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,700
There's some ephedra in Yunzhou,

50
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,820
and I've wanted it for a long time.

51
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,260
Go get it.

52
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,220
I must see the stuff in one week.

53
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,220
Otherwise,

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,420
I can't promise

55
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,300
that your wife

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,620
will look the same when you come back.

57
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,140
Mr. Ba, I've got this.

58
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,260
Ms. Yan Lin,

59
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,780
I want to see the sample

60
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,500
in ten days,

61
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
so that Han Shan

62
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,900
can come back safe and sound.

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,180
I understand.

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,860
Come on, take it easy.

65
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,940
Drink some tea.

66
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,700
To be honest, we're only

67
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,380
doing business for some profits.

68
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,100
The real heroes

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,700
are your parents, Yan Lin.

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,980
For others,

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,100
they're monsters,

72
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,780
the source of the evil.

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,260
However, for us,

74
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,780
they're the greatest heroes.

75
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,220
Obviously,

76
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,580
you'll become someone

77
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,580
just like them.

78
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,740
You will also make us

79
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,900
proud.

80
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,460
Mr. Ba,

81
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,180
I'm going to Yunzhou tomorrow.

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,540
I need to go home and pack my stuff.

83
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,420
Mr. Ba.

84
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,940
Do you really believe them?

85
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,140
They want to play,

86
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,020
so we'll play with them.

87
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,420
Yirou,

88
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,020
follow Han Shan

89
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,980
and keep a close eye on him.

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,540
Why did you come here alone?

93
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,060
Ye Ran,

94
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,380
my parents didn't do the research

95
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,380
for making drugs.

96
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,180
I know.

97
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,860
It may hurt.

98
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,340
When I was a kid,

99
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,140
my dream was to be a doctor.

100
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,380
My father told me

101
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,100
if I become a doctor,

102
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,180
I have to bear in mind

103
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,340
the safety of my patients.

104
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,340
Ye Ran,

105
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,180
they taught me to be a good person.

106
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,300
How could they be
the source of the evil?

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,940
Cheng,

108
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,980
their research

109
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,340
was used by bad people.

110
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,620
What you're going to do

111
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,420
is to apply

112
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,700
their research

113
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,140
into medical science

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,660
to save

115
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,220
the people in pain,

116
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,700
understand?

117
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,140
Smile.

118
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,660
I'm going to Yunzhou tomorrow.

119
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,460
Take care of yourself while I'm away.

120
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,180
Please come back safe and sound.

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,220
Wait for me.

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,620
Eyes, nose,

123
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,900
or mouth.

124
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,540
Pick one.

125
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,020
Pick.

126
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,260
Do you want me to pick one for you?

127
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,780
Mr. He,

128
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,580
why did you want to see me?

129
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,260
Ms. Cheng,

130
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,020
I'm warning you.

131
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,620
I'm not the secretary anymore.

132
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,980
I...

133
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,660
I'm Mr. Ba's man now.

134
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,180
It's none of my business.

135
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,740
You...

136
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,100
You should call me...

137
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,740
What do you want?

138
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,500
Mr. Ba asked me

139
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,980
to keep an eye on you for the samples.

140
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,980
How's it going?

141
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,940
Normal.

142
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,220
Normal?

143
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,740
That's good.

144
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,900
Did Mr. Ba
go to the drug production base?

145
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,020
It's none of your business.

146
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,220
Listen,

147
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
don't try to play tricks with me.

148
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,460
Whether your husband can come back alive

149
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,700
is up to...

150
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,020
Nice wine.

151
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,260
Goodbye.

152
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,900
Cheng Che!

153

154
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,700
Don't you know who I am now?

155
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,940
How dare you leave
before I finish my words?

156
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,580

Cheng.

199
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,940
It's me.

200
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,420
Ye Ran.

201
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,380
What took you so long to call?

202
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,380
Did anything happen to you?

203
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,420
Don't worry.

204
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Did you forget I grew up

205
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,540
in Yunzhou?

206
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,580
Besides, I've got Quan and Qiang.

207
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,820
Everything's fine.

208
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,420
It's raining

209
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,100
heavily today,

210
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,460
so I'm late.

211
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,860
You should get some rest.

212
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,100
You could've asked Quan

213
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,620
to tell me you're safe.

214
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,980
Your old wounds

215
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,820
always hurt when it rains.

216
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,900
Idiot.

217
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,700
I've recovered for a long time.

218
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,140
It doesn't hurt anymore.

219
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,020
How's that possible?

220
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,100
I remember every wound

221
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,740
on your body.

222
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,140
They always hurt when it rains.

223
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,100
You must tell me everything

224
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,620
when you're in Yunzhou.

225
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,380
You're so smart.

226
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,020
How can I hide anything from you?

227
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,900
Don't worry.

228
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,700
Everything is fine.

229
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,340
How about you?

230
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,260
Did Mr. Ba give you a hard time?

231
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm fine too.

232
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,140
Good.

233
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,140
Cheng.

234
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,540
I miss you.

235
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,300
I miss you too.

236
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,100
I miss you so much!

237
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,060
Wait for me.

238
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,900
If it still hurts,

239
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,940
open your luggage.

240
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,940
I've prepared the best painkillers

241
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,980
for you.

242
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,940
Okay.

243
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,500
If you get injured again,

244
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,740
open the brown box
next to the painkillers.

245
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,620
It can help you recover.

You should go to bed.

250
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,660
You too.

251
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,220

Ran,

268
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,500
we've moved all the stuff to the ship.

269
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,820
Ran, just go back.

270
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,340
We'll take care of

271
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,980
the rest.

272
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,500
Thank you for coming back

273
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,020
to help me.

274
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,140
Ran, we're brothers. Don't be so polite.

275
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
We need to keep an eye on the ship.

276
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,180
Okay.

277
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,310
Let's go.

278
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,660
Hound.

279
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,340
It's been a long time.

280
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,180
I thought I'd never see you again.

281
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,900
I was wondering who was capable of
making such a big scene.

282
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,260
It turns out to be my old friend

283
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,380
Ye Ran.

284
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,540
Go to the point.

285
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,820
What do you want?

286
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,220
I'm here

287
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,540
to tell you that it's time for us

288
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,780
to have a closure.

289
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,140
How do you want to end it?

290
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,500
Let's make a bet.

291
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,740
If you win,

292
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,540
you'll get the stuff,

293
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,460
and I'll forget about

294
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
the past.

295
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,780
However, if you lose,

296
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
all your stuff

297
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,980
will turn into ashes.
