Good. Still breezing.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,600
You ran over him,

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,810
and now, you're worried?

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,000
That was to save your life.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,210
You don't belong here.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,080
I'm desperate.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,640
I need you to go back with me.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,440
You still won't give up?

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,530
I know pretending to be

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
someone's body double

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,370
sounds insane,

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,640
but I have no choice.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,690
Please, I'm begging you.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,760
I'll pay you as much as I can.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,560
If you want to live,

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,010
don't do anything stupid.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,050
Could you reconsider

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,200
my offer, please?

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,010
No, never.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,730
If I step outside,

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,560
you'll be in danger, won't you?

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,530
I'd rather die

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,970
if I couldn't take you back.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,250
Who's there?

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Freeze!

26
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,280
Turn around.

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Who are you?

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,960

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
Mr. Han Shan?

31
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,930
What brings you here?

32
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,160
As long as you agree

33
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,370
to be someone else...

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,600
Mr. Han Shan...

35
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,090
Who is that?

36
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,650
Xiang Tingdong.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,880
I'm here for personal business.

38
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,930
Don't tell others.

39
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,930
I'm sorry if my men offended you.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,650
I'll leave you to it, sir.

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,650
Go.

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
Bishop,

43
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,880
the warehouse with Azure Dragon's stuff
is on fire.

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,370
What about

45
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,560
tonight's deal?

46
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,120
Everything seems strange.

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,490
With Mr. Han Sha here,

48
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,880
something must be wrong.

49
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,810

(Haircut, Perm, Dye)

You're finally awake.

89
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,360
What are you doing?

90
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,890
Doing what you said.

91
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,010
Go back with you.

92
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
So,

93
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,920
do I look like him now?

94
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,500
Yes.

95
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,500
Absolutely.

96
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
But not good enough.

97
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,500
(My eyebrow isn't the same.)

98
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,540

(Xiang Tingdong.)

101
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,780
You and Xiang Tingdong look identical.

102
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Are you really his twin brother?

103
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,060
I've been living with the Xiangs for so long.

104
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,860
How come they've never mentioned you?

105
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,860
None of them know me.

106
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,660
That's why they've never said anything.

107
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,100
You found me

108
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,700
by luck.

109
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,300
But why...?

110
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,300
That's all I can say.

111
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Take me or not,

112
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,820
it's up to you.

113
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,060
I'll take you.

114
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,940
You're his fiancée.

115
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,180
Just to be sure,

116
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
is my brother

117
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,460
dead or what?

118
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,340
What do you mean?

119
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,940
Don't be mad.

120
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,940
I'm not going to say what you did to him.

121
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,340
Tingdong went to Southeast Asia for business.

122
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,060
He'll be back in a while.

123
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,420
I see.

124
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,580
Meet me here tomorrow.

125
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,780
Anyway, thanks for agreeing to help me.

126
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060

131
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,460
If it's true,

132
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,780
check out every detail.

133
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,420
I need to be fully prepared

134
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,580
before bringing him back.

135
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,340

Come here.

141
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,700
Son,

142
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,700
did you get into scraps again?

143
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,940
They spoke ill of you.

144
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,580
What did they say?

145
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,180
They said you did something wrong.

146
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,580
Your mother threw you out of the house

147
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,420
and cut all ties with you.

148
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,940
That's why you moved here.

149
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,820
Don't believe what others say.

150
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
I don't.

151
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,580
That's why I beat them.

152
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,660
You're right.

153
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,860
I wasn't thrown out.

154
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,300
Actually,

155
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
I loved this place

156
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,420
and wanted to live with you,

157
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,460

191
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,180
What's going on?

192
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,940
Say no more. Let's go.

193
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,540
So,

194
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,820
did you make the fire?

195
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,940
I don't leave loose ends.

196
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,140
(Spark Barber's)

197
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,340
Hurry!

198
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,940
Go away!

199
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,950
What's going on?

200
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,460
Come on! Ran is still inside!

201
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,140
I'll go get him out.

202
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,050
Quan!

203
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,460
It's too late.

204
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,220
Ran made an enemy of some gang out of town.

205
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,060
They shot him in the heart

206
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,180
and burned this place

207
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,580
to leave no trace behind.

208
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,220
No wonder I heard gunshots.

209
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
How dare they!

210
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,860
Look at you, Ye Ran.

211
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,220
You should be glad

212
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,060
you're dead.

213
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,740
(Yunzhou Station)

214
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,300
You must be hungry.

215
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,620
I picked up some food.

216
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,860
I'm good. Eat without me.

217
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,500
In order to help me,

218
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,060
you abandoned everything

219
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,340
and removed all your traces.

220
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,620
Take it as a thank-you gift.

221
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,620
Do you really think I'm doing all this for you?

222
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,380
Even if

223
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,060
it's not for me,

224
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,140
you should eat.

225
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,820
You wouldn't be so nice for no reason.

226
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,300
Say it. What else do you want?

227
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,660
You're doing me a huge favor.

228
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,900
I'll pay you handsomely.

229
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,540
That said,

230
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,420
you and I

231
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,300
need to make a pact.

232
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,580
Do you think you can control me

233
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,820
with some sort of agreement?

234
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,580
No.

235
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Let's pinky-swear.

236
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,820
No agreements,

237
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,660
but a pinky swear?

238
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,900
That counts, too,

239
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,340
whether or not it works.
