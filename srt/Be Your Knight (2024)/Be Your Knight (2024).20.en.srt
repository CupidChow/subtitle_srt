00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,540
What are you waiting for?

2
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,660
Kill him?

3
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,620
If you hurt her again,

4
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,380
my bullet will go
right through your head.

5
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,860
Are you okay?

6
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,500
What's wrong?

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,300
Why can't you give me a break?

8
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,260
Mr. Ba,

9
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,740
let me reintroduce this man.

10
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,900
He's

11
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,580
Ye Ran,

12
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,220
the twin brother of Xiang Tingdong.

13
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,380
The real Xiang Tingdong

14
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,780
is lying in the clinic across the street.

15
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,820
Last time, I only had two photos

16
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,140
and couldn't prove anything,

17
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,180
so he got away with it.

18
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,580
However,

19
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,940
I can show you two identical faces!

20
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,060
It's irrefutable evidence!

21
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,940
Since everyone's here,

22
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,780
let's get in and find out.

25
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,500
Mr. Ba,

26
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,540
did you see it?

27
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,140
Xiang Tingdong is lying there,

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,300
and he's

29
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,220
Ye Ran.

30
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,980
Mr. Ba,

31
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,780
I do have a twin brother,

32
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,620
but it's Ye Ran who's lying there.

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,820
Twin brothers look exactly the same.

34
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,180
Is that a problem?

35
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,420
Why has no one

36
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,780
ever heard of

37
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,620
the twin brother

38
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,820
of Mr. Xiang in Tangcheng?

39
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,180
Mr. Ba,

40
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,420
it's our family matter.

41
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,060
I didn't want to tell anyone about it.

42
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,620
My mother Xiang Ruoyun left home

43
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,780
20 years ago and went missing.

44
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,940
No one knew she had twins.

45
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,940
This year,

46
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,900
my family found my brother Ye Ran,

47
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,180
but he had an accident

48
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,660
and ended up here.

49
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,980
Ye Ran,

50
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,740
you're such a good liar.

51
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,460
Hai, didn't you say you can prove it?

52
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,100
Don't try to play me!

53
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,380
Mr. Ba,

54
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
none of them

55
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,300
should be alive.

56
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,660
You...

57
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,420
From now on, the person
with a scar on his arm

58
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,620
is Han Shan.

59
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,820
If you don't believe it,

60
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,380
you can just cut off this arm.

61
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,180
Why would I want your arm?

62
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,540
Are you Han Shan?

63
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,500
Or do you want to become Han Shan?

64
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,860
I checked it.

65
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,860
The wound on his head

66
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,380
is new.

67
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,940
I'll take a wild guess.

68
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,460
You

69
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,500
destroyed him

70
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,660
to replace him

71
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
to be Han Shan.

72
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,420
Do you admit it?

73
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,820
Mr. Ba, bravo!

74
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,900
Ye Ran,

75
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,900
keep lying.

76
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,060
That wound was...

77
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,420
Hai,

78
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,820
when did he wake up?

79
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,660
I... I...

80
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,620
I fell over.

81
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,060
How did I come here?

82
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Ms. Cheng.

83
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,780
How long was l out?

84
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,060
Not long.

85
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,980
I'm glad you're fine.

86
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,420
No way.

87
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,940
It's impossible.

88
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,900
This must be your plan!

89
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
Plan...

90
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,020
What plan? You...

91
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,180
Who are you?

92
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,980

neither

94
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,940
are you.

95
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,940
What really matters is

96
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,980
who he is.

Not bad.

103
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,300
You're not the real Xiang Tingdong,

104
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,420
because he'd never be

105
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,300

tell me the truth,

109
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,580
you won't get out of here alive.

Stay away from her.

114
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,500
Of course I will.

115
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,580
This is muscarine,

116
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,060
an organic compound

117
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,660
extracted from an alkaloid,

118
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,500
which can block one's
parasympathetic nerves

119
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,260
to effectively paralyze and depress

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,020

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,260
will no longer be able to stay sober

123
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,260
or lie.

Cheng Che.

125
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,940

who Han Shan is!

You go first.

226
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,140
By the way,

227
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,100
after you go to hell,

228
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,700
remember to tell him

229
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,180
that I really admire him!

230

Do you know

232
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,500
why an orphan like me

233
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,580
would become Mrs. Xiang?

234
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,380
Why would I care?

235
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,580

237
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,660
the chemist couple?

238
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,700
They're my parents.
