1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,540
(Yunzhou Station)

2
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,940
(Yunzhou Station)

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
I am curious

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,910
why you decided to go with me.

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,480
I am also curious

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,870
why you want me to play my brother.

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,590
You'll know.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,360
In Tangcheng,

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,360
I'll guide you to be Xiang Tingdong.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,680
If everything goes well,

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,110
we can hold our wedding.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,520
What?

13
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,750
You're not backing out, huh?

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,390
So, you and Xiang Tingdong

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,560
aren't married yet.

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,740
=Be Your Knight=

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,700
=Episode 3 Wolf Is Back=

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,060
(Tangcheng)

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,070
I have a house.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,480
Nobody knows about it but Xin Yi.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,150
Before you return to your family,

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,280
you'll live there.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,360
Why are there petals?

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,360
It's hibiscus.

25
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,000
Normally, its blooming season is over.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
But it's still in blossom.

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,920
Kind of a miracle.

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,710
You and Tingdong look the same.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,760
But you behave differently.

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
He's allergic to pollen

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
while you know a lot about flowers.

32
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,070
You have to

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
keep all this a secret.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
I get it.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,510
Put your luggage here.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,440
Be seated.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,790
Why does it look like a bar?

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,790
This is my private house

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,390
for personal use.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,110
Before you go to the Xiang's,

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I'll give you comprehensive training.

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,480
Let's get started.

43
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,110
On the left of the second floor

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,550
is Xiang Tingdong's room.

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,110
To become him...

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,040
You need those outfits.

47
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,630
By the way...

48
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,670
Can you write?

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Yes.

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,510
Your handwriting is good.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
Thank you.

52
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,400
In the Xiang's pharmaceutical company,

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
I'm only in charge of pharmaceutical research.

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,110
Aunt Xiang Ruolan handles the main business.

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,160
But the medicinal materials

56
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,880
are in the charge of Xiang Tingdong.

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,920
Mr. Han Shan?

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,160
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,640
So...

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,360
You have to imitate his signature.

61
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,640
You can exactly have his handwriting.

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,070
Wait.

63
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,880
You look

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,510
a little bit more tanned

65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,110
and thinner than Tingdong.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,990
I thought about this.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,390
Tell them during my trip in Southeast Asia,

68
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,550
I was badly sick.

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,070
When I almost died,

70
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,390
I changed a lot for a good reason.

71
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,440
Give me your hand.

72
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,040
Everyone in the Xiang Family

73
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,630
has some medical knowledge.

74
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,360
Your pulse feels really good.

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,920
It's not a patient's pulse.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,720
What's your plan, then?

77
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,830
Cheng Che,

78
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,520
are you giving me a hard time

79
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
just because I kidnapped you?

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,600
Like you said,

81
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,360
you should play Xiang Tingdong perfectly.

82
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,670
A patient needs to look weak

83
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,480
and have a patient's pulse.

84
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,110
Five minutes to go.

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,720
Hang in there.

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,230
You'll soon have it.

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Miss.

88
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,520
Xin Yi?

89
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,360
You're back so soon.

90
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,400
Miss, this is everything

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
I can find about Ye Ran.

92
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,510
One more thing.

93
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,750
Old Lady has left the hospital today.

94
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,840
She's looking for you.

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
Grandmother is out of the hospital?

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
Yes.

97
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,070
Cheng Che,

98
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,840
is a hot bath available?

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,240
Yes.

100
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,750
Just go have it.

101
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,510
Oh,

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
I'm going back to the Xiang's tonight.

103
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Before I come back,

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
do not move around.

105
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
OK.

106
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,310
Grandmother, you haven't recovered.

107
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,990
Why did you leave the hospital?

108
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,920
Don't worry. There's special medicine.

109
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,400
I can hold up.

110
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,230
Cheng,

111
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,310
how's the dress fitting?

112
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,400
Do you want it modified?

113
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,960
Grandmother,

114
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,920
new medicine makes your heart work harder.

115
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,920
You actually need more rest.

116
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm fine

117
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Don't worry about me.

118
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,400
I feel much better now.

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
Oh,

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,600
why isn't Tingdong back yet?

121
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,750
Tingdong...

122
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,480
He's on a business trip in Southeast Asia

123
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,870
and he isn't back yet.

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,310
Come on.

125
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,840
He's getting married.

126
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,430
Sorry for this.

127
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,920
My Lady, Miss,

128
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,230
Mr. Tingdong is back.

129
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,750
Did you just say

130
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,990
Tingdong was back?

So, I look just like him.

150
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,910
Didn't I ask you not to move around?

151
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,840
What are you doing here?

152
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
Tingdong,

153
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,480
you're back at last.

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,910
Let me introduce to you

155
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,110
members of the Xiangs.

156
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,230
Xiang Ruolan

157
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,800
is Xiang Tingdong's aunt.

158
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,300
(Xiang Ruolan, the Second Daughter)

159
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,100
Grandmother had this daughter
when she wasn't young.

160
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,390
So, she didn't force her to get married.

161
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
- Uncle Yu.
- Ms. Ruolan.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,900
(Uncle Yu, the Xiang's Butler)
He's been the butler for 30 years.

163
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,990
- Put it there.
- He brought up Xiang Tingdong.

164
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,950
Cui.

165
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,990
She's the simplest guy.

166
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,960
She only cares for Aunt's work.

167
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,680
She won't focus on you.

168
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,070
Cui,

169
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,110
put it there.

170
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,750
Aunt.

171
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
Tingdong,

172
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
you weren't in Southeast Asia
for a very long time.

173
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,150
Why do you look so different?

174
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,600
It was really hot there.

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,560
Exposed to the sun, I had no appetite.

176
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,230
Unacclimatized to local weather,
I had some rare disease.

177
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,630
Even my voice has changed.

178
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,840
Weak, indeed.

179
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,160
But anyway,

180
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,840
you look like a totally different man.

181
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
Everything about you

182
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,320
doesn't feel right.

183
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,960
What are you talking about, Aunt?

184
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,230
Cui.

185
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,320
Make him some chick soup tonight.

186
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,440
Yes, Ms. Ruolan.

187
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,800
The contract from the company

188
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,080
was delivered to your room.

189
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,780
- I'm home.
- Mr. Tingdong.

190
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,600
- Why do you still remind me?
- Old Lady missed you so much.

191
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,270
Then I'll go

192
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,630
and see Grandmother with you.

193
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,640
Come on.

194
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,960
Tingdong.

195
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,750
Grandmother is just out of the hospital

196
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,390
and she isn't very well.

197
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,960
You're back home, sick.

198
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
How about

199
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,230
you go take a bath?

200
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,910
Then we'll see Grandmother together.

201
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,920
OK.

202
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Then Aunt,

203
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,630
we should go back to our room.

204
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,360
Get some rest early.

205
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,510

211

Don't worry.

212
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,110
You don't need to learn oil painting.

213
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,870
Only a couple of months ago,

214
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,030
Tingdong was somehow interested.

215
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,870
He doesn't paint very well.

♪The past is painful, you can't hide♪

217
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,030
Are you here to ask me

218
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,510
why I disobeyed you

219
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,480
and came here?

220
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,870
So why?

221
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,800
What kind of bridegroom

222
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,720
would come home one day before his wedding?

223
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,680
Between Tingdong and me,

224
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,600
everything makes sense.

225
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,270
You'd meet this family eventually.

226
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,110
Luckily, we made it through.

227
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,990
This is the wedding ring.

228
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,160
Try it on.

229
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,600
When it was customized,

230
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,680
it was a little bigger for Tingdong.

231
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,270
But it's perfect for you.

232
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,150
In your childhood, you were adopted

233
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,680
and you grew up with Tingdong

234
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,990
as childhood sweethearts.

235
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,360
Now, you're getting married.

236
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,110
You must be loving each other, huh?

237
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,390
It's none of your business.

238
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,960
No need to be concerned.

239
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,030
What I'm concerned about is...

240
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,360
We'll have a Western wedding.

241
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,750
When we exchange the rings, we have to kiss.

242
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
I have to consider

243
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,230
what attitude I should have

244
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320
when you do that.

245
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,390
Don't tell me

246
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,150
the two of you have never kissed.

247
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,150
I'll take care of this.

248
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,440
You don't bother. Just stand there.

249
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,950
OK.

250
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,110
Whatever you say.

251
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,350
Wait.

252
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,840
Anything else?

253
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Now, you look

254
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,800
just like Tingdong.

255
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,840
But the size of the suit

256
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,110
makes you look weird.

257
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,320
We have to fix it.

258
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
What are you doing?

259
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,390
Taking your measurements.

260
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,510
Take off your suit.

261
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,390
Our tailors know Tingdong's size.

262
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,800
If they do this, they'll see through you.

263
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,360
What do you stare at me for?

264
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,630
Nothing.

265
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,750
I'm just thinking.

266
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,720
You risked your life

267
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,440
to get me back from Yunzhou.

268
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,720
You must be up to something.

269
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,160
Arms up.

270
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,630
I want you to tell me

271
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,990
what on earth happened

272
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,440
between you and Xiang Tingdong

273
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,390
and the reason you do all this.

274
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,080
Maybe I can help you.

275
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
At this time, are you still worried

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,360
that I may hurt you?

277
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,720
Oh, I remember.

278
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,230
Remember what?

279
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,720
A few days ago,

280
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,270
Grandmother gave Tingdong moxibustion

281
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,150
and accidentally scalded his shoulder.

282
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,910
Since he has a scald,

283
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,390
in case I give myself away,

284
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,750
I should have it, too.

285
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,990
Scald me.

286
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,110
I can bear the pain.

287
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,280
Forget it.

288
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,150
There are barely any occasions

289
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,440
where you have to be topless.

290
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,440
If anyone asks

291
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,150
about the scald on your right shoulder,

292
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,960
just give your reaction.

293
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,230
So much for today.

294
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,470
Ginkgo trees have turned yellow.

295
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,910
This year will be over soon.

296
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,150
Ruoyun,

297
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,000
you've been away

298
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,470
from home for 25 years.

299
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,150
(Ye Ran's mother is really Xiang Ruoyun.)

300
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,710
(He's Grandmother's other grandson.)

301
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,800
Your son Tingdong

302
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,320
will get married.

303
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,150
Yu,

304
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,840
Ruoyun is a good girl.

305
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,840
At that time,

306
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
because

307
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,040
I was involved in those things,

308
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,910
she broke with me.

309
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
(Nearly no one talks about Xiang Ruoyun.)

310
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,190
(So, it's because...)

311
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,040
But I

312
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,470
expelled her from home.

313
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,910
My Lady,

314
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,390
for that,

315
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,560
you had a reason.

316
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,910
(No wonder when I mentioned Xiang Tingdong,)

317
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,360
(he gave a pretty big reaction.)

318
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
I want to sit here a little bit longer.

319
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,760
OK. I'll go get you a blanket.

320
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,470
Mr. Tingdong.

321
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,310
Uncle Yu.

322
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,320
Are you sure I only meant to help you?

323
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,600
(Did he actually come here)

324
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,630
(to...?)
