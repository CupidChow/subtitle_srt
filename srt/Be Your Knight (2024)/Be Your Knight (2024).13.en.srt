1
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,340
Boss, a lady wants to see you.

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,700
She said she was your friend.

3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,220
Mrs. Xiang, you're a prestigious lady.

4
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,100
Why did you come here?

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,180
I'm here for Tingdong.

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,740
Do you want to blame me?

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,220
Your husband's affairs

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,580
have nothing to do with me.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,420
He wouldn't stop coming here.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,820
I was also quite upset.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,740
I told him not to come,

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,260
but he wouldn't listen to me.

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,980
Ms. Xiao, you got me wrong.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,620
I couldn't stop him.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,700
It was my fault.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,180
Mrs. Xiang, you're so thoughtful

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,460
and generous.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,220
Or maybe

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,700
you don't even care

20
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,420
who he's messing around with.

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,220
He can mess around with anyone

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,500
he likes.

23
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,140
I didn't come here

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,340
for him today.

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,540
You already knew

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,420
the Xiang Tingdong you met
was a phony, didn't you?

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,020
They're twin brothers.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,460
It was I who asked him
to pretend to be Xiang Tingdong.

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,740
I should be responsible

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,260
for all your trouble.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,740
I only want you to let him go.

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,140
So, you like the fake one, don't you?

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
I just hope you can stop hunting him.

34
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,100
You can tell me
whatever compensation you want,

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,660
and I'll pay.

36
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
Don't worry,

37
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm not interested in killing people.

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,940
Well,

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,420
anything else?

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,700
Ms. Xiao, I wonder

41
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,700
if you know Mr. Deng Dahai

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,860
from Kanghai Pharmaceuticals.

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,460
Can you introduce me to him?

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,380
I'll try my best

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,420
to give you what you want.

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,260
Xiang Tingdong's lawful wife

47
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,140
is making a deal with his mistress.

48
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,140
So ridiculous.

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,700
Mrs. Xiang, I suggest you

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,340
enjoy your peaceful life

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,180
and stay away from gangster matters.

52
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,340
It does you no good.

53
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,020
You can leave.

54
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,700
Sorry to bother you.

55
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,580
Except for Xiao Xiao,

56
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,380
I'll stay around New Fairy these days

57
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,220
to see if any elites there

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,780
are working for Huang Hai.

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
(Cheng Che?)

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,540
(Why did she come here?)

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,340
Did the car break down again?

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,860
Miss, the car broke down.
You should go back first.

63
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,060
Pulling a rickshaw with no gloves

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,980
but black leather shoes.

65
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,100
Something's wrong.

00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,660
Sir,

69
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,180
I don't think

70
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,820
this is the right direction.

71
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,740
Stay away,

72
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,700
or I'll shoot you.

73
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,940
Let's go.

74
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,860
Miss. are you okay?

75
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,660
Xin Yi, did you see anyone else

76
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,740
except for those two men

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,380
when you came here?

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,660
I saw two suspicious men

79
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,980
running away,

80
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,340
and one of them was the driver,

81
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,540
so I came here.

Let's go.

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,860
Xin Yi,

99
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,860
please go back.

100
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,420
I want to take a walk alone.

101
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,220
Miss, it's too dangerous.

102
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,700
The main street is nearby.

103
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,300
I'll be safe.

104
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,820
Ms. Xiao.

105
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,860
Come in.

106
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,700
I asked you out,

107
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,140
and you barely made it.

108
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,180
Today, you just left me for a while,

109
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,140
and you can't wait to see me again?

110
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,780
It's a day ahead of the schedule.

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,980
Ms. Xiao,

112
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,660
I'll make it clear.

113
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,220
I need to know Huang Hai.

114
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,020
Can you give me his information?

115
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,780
So, you're asking for a favor.

116
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,580
What a snob.

117
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,900
Sorry.

118
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,860
Same as usual.

119
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,260
Pick one.

120
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,860
You're straight-forward,

121
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,020
but I need to hear your speech

122
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,500
before I make the decision.

123
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,180
Ms. Xiao, why don't you just tell me

124
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,300
what you want from me?

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,060
You're candid.

126
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,140
Then I won't beat around the bush.

127
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,620
I want you to do whatever it takes

128
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,820
to take Huang Hai's things.

129
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,820
I was wondering

130
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,940
why the wine tasted like

131
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,740
cooperation.

132
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
Deal.

133
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,700
Then tell me,

134
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,380
what is the fastest
and the most direct way to meet him?

135
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,340
Huang Hai isn't Han Shan.

136
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,060
He's a dangerous man.

137
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,820
Why do you want

138
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,220
to know him?

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,860
Fame?

140
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,340
Money?

141
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,100
Or is he your enemy?

142
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,940
Yes,

143
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,660
and no.

144
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,100
They'll hold a private charity banquet

145
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,100
every month.

146
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,660
Which day?

147
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,980
Whenever

148
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,500
there's an initiator.

149
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,260
If you're lucky,

150
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,620
they'll send an invitation
to Xiang Tingdong,

151
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,660
and you'll be able to see Huang Hai.

152
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,660
(We don't know who Huang Hai is.)

153
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,220
(The longer we wait,
the more dangerous Cheng Che will be)

154
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,860
(I can't wait passively)

155
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,500
(for the charity banquet.)

156
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,700
Ms. Xiao, are you suggesting

157
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,180
the initiator of the banquet

158
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,820
is not determined,

159
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,060
right?

160
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,740
Exactly.

161
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Then Han Shan will initiate the banquet

162
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,940
this month,

163
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,540
and it's tomorrow.

164
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,740
Ms. Xiao, I think you must know

165
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,100
where and how

166
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,420
it will be held.

167
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,100
Luckily,

168
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,900
I'm the director of the charity banquet.

169
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,340
What a coincidence.

170
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,020
Ms. Xiao, you always know
how to surprise me.

171
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,940
I will present you

172
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,300
everything Huang Hai has.

173
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,780
Xiang Tingdong left

174
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,340
one of his clothes here.

175
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
You'll wear it and show up
with me tomorrow.

176
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,540
Okay.

177
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,620
But I must warn you

178
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,620
dealing with them won't be

179
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,540
as easy as getting into New Fairy.

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,420
Even if you wear his clothes

181
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,740
and imitate him,

182
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,860
you're not him after all.

183
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,940
Besides,

184
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,820
he wouldn't dare to start a banquet.

185
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,500
It's up to you whether you can

186
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,780
leave there alive or not.

187
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,820
Don't worry.

188
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,060
Tomorrow, I'll be Han Shan.

189
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,540
I am

190
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,700
Xiang Tingdong.

191
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,620
It's a big bite.

192
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,340
Don't break your teeth.

193
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,500
Ru,

194
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
What kind of bowknot
do you want to wear today?

195
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,180
I want a black bowknot.

196
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,780
I didn't buy a black one.

197
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,460
How about this? I'll buy

198
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,660
a black bowknot tomorrow,

199
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,500
and you'll wear a red one today,

200
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,740
okay?

201
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Okay.

202
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,900
Boss, that idiot Xiang Tingdong...

203
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,580
Ru,

204
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,580
ask your nanny for some cupcakes, okay?

205
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,660
Okay.

206
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,980
My little pig!

207
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,420
Come on, go.

208
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,140
Be careful with the stairs.

209
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,700
I've told you a million times

210
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,740
not to curse in front of Ru.

211
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,740
Can't you be more polite

212
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,660
in front of kids?

213
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Sorry, boss.

214
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,580
Tell me.

215
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,260
What's the matter?

216
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,340
Boss,

217
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,620
our men failed.

218
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,140
They didn't catch Mrs. Xiang.

219
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Useless!

220
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,860
You can't even handle a woman.

221
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,380
Why should I hire you?

222
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,620
It was Xiang Tingdong!

223
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,460
I... I don't know

224
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,860
why he showed up all of a sudden.

225
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,860
I think it's time

226
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,740
to catch up with Mr. Han Shan.

227
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,060
The charity banquet

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,540
will be held tomorrow.

229
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,500
Boss,

230
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,780
Xiang Tingdong

231
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,100
already initiated it.

232
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,900
Here's the invitation.

233
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,420
When did the dog stop being a coward?

234
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,260
How dare he invite me

235
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,620
to attend the banquet?

236
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,260
Boss, I was also wondering.

237
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,140
Who... Who the hell is he?

238
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,260
He didn't take the things

239
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,460
in the safety deposit box himself.

240
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,500
His wife took it instead.

241
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,980
I'm afraid that woman

242
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,540
wanted something else.

243
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,940
Now, send an invitation

244
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,940
to Mrs. Xiang.

245
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,260
Miss, someone just

246
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,820
sent this to you for no reason.

247
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,340
The invitation came at this point.

248
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm afraid there's something behind it.

249
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,740
All these things

250
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,140
happened to me

251
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,020
right after I got the information.

252
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,180
The answer is so close.

253
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,420
Whether it's
a charity banquet or a trap,

254
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,820
I have to go.

255
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,860
(The Day of Charity Banquet, Misty Rain)

256
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,140
(Did you read too much
and become a nerd?)

257
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,180
(You don't want to say, right?)

258
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,260
(Then you'll stay silent forever!)

259
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,260
Come on.

260
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,500
Let's welcome Ms. Cheng Che,

261
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,740
the wife of Mr. Han Shan and the owner

262
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,060
of Jimin Pharmaceuticals.

263
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,580
Welcome to our charity banquet.

264
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,340
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

265
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Ms. Cheng,

266
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
don't be nervous.

267
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,060
We're all

268
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,660
Han Shan's friends.

269
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,900
You're also our friend.

270
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,740
Thank you for inviting me.

271
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,980
It's my first time here.

272
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,260
Sir, may I ask your name?

273
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,380
Ms. Cheng,

274
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,580
this is Deng Dahai, the owner

275
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,780
of Kanghai Pharmaceuticals.

276
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,020
How can you...

277
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,500
Ms. Cheng, I'm surprised
that you don't know us.

278
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,020
It seems Han Shan didn't tell you

279
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,380
what he's been doing

280
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,780
with his brothers.

281
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,780
By the way,

282
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,100
Han Shan is your husband

283
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,780
Xiang Tingdong.

284
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,540
Why didn't he come with you?

285
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,140
It's normal for a man
to have his own business.

286
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,580
As his wife,

287
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,340
I only need to take care of him.

288
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,060
Hai, don't just talk to Ms. Cheng.

289
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,020
Let's have dinner.

290
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,140
Ms. Cheng.

291
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,980
Come on.

292
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,980
To you.

293
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,020
Rich men should care about the people,

294
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,460
whereas the others
should take care of themselves.

295
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,580
Last month,

296
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,780
I donated a vintage vase.

297
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,860
So, allow me to start this time.

298
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,900
I'll donate an orphanage!

299
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,580
- (They're smugglers)
- Great!

300
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,220
- (and power players.)
- Mr. Qin, you're so generous.

301
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,300
(They've been using their power)

302
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,660
- (to smuggle drugs secretly.)
- Here's to you.

303
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,540
(They've betrayed the country)

304
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,140
- (and the people.)
- Good wine.

305
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,420
(How dare they pretend
to be philanthropists?)

306
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,460
Ms. Cheng, I'm wondering

307
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,580
what you're going to present to us.

308
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,500
I came in a hurry

309
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,260
and didn't prepare anything.

310
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,860
If you don't mind,

311
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,140
I'll ask them

312
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,580
to send a fine mutton fat jade here

313
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,420
in a while.

314
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,690
Mutton fat jade?

315
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,100
Mutton fat jade is not rare.

316
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,220
I heard

317
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,780
Han Shan put invaluable treasures

318
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,300
in a safety deposit box
in Fenglong Bank.

319
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,540
Ms. Cheng, why don't you

320
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,660
be generous

321
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,700
and show us what he's got?

322
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,020
(That's what he really wants.)

323
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,260
(If he knows)

324
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,580
(it's a document,)

325
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,900
(he'll catch me lying.)

326
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,300
Well,

327
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,780
is it too valuable to let us see?

328
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,580
You're making me curious.

329
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,820
What kind of secret treasure

330
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,700
is Han Shan hiding from us?

331
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,900
Mr. Deng,

332
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,860
actually, it's...

333
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,740
Hai,

334
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,260
why did you start the banquet

335
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,420
