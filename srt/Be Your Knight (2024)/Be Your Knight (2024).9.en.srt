00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,020
Miss,

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,620
Mr. Tingdong's herbal soup is ready.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,460
Why

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,380
isn't he back yet?

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,140
Miss, according to the plan,

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,220
he should spend the night with Xiao Xiao.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,420
Don't worry about him.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,220
I'm fine, Xin Yi.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,180
You can go back.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,740
I'll wait here alone.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,220
(At this moment,)

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,180
(I don't seem to be sure)

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,380
(whether I'm waiting for that key)

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,740
(or)

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,180
(I'm waiting for him to come home.)

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,820
You're finally back.

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,260
Did you get anything useful from her?

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,900
It's hard to say.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,180
Xiao Xiao is not a simple woman.

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,620
She almost caught me today.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,500
However, I still think

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,340
she has the key.

23
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,860
I'm glad you came back safe
without being caught.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,820
Well...

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,300
You stayed late at her place.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,380
What did you do?

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,180
According to the plan,

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,420
I did everything I was supposed to do.

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,980
What's wrong?

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,380
Drink the medicine on the table

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,820
while it's still hot.

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,020
What's this?

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,060
Grandmother asked Uncle Yu to make

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,020
herbal soup for you
after we got married.

35
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,500
We don't need this,

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,540
but if you're going to see Xiao Xiao,

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,260
it'll be helpful.

38
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,540
Cheng Che,

39
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,410
do you think Xiao Xiao and I...

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,420
Don't tell me.

41
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,980
I don't care.

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,740
I don't need it.

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,900
You're thinking too much.

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,820
But you said you did

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,580
everything you were supposed to do.

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,540
Did you

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,580
bring something back?

48
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,620
I saw it on my way home,

49
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,020
so I bought it.

50
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,820

are you holding flowers?

want to put them in the room.

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,660
Mr. Tingdong.

84
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,180
Mr. Tingdong,
don't you have a pollen allergy?

85
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,420
How can you plant flowers?

86
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,860
Come on. I'll hold them...

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,020
No, no need.

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,020
Uncle Yu, my pollen allergy

89
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,340
is cured.

90
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,580
Tingdong,

91
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,340
do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,140
After I had some strange disease

93
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,900
in the Southeast Asia,

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,020
my allergy seemed

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,660
to be cured somehow.

96
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,580
From now on,

97
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,940

98
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,620

99
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,860
Cheng,

100
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,460
let's get back in.

101
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,860
Do you know what you were talking about?

102
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,100
How can your pollen allergy

103
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,540
be cured easily?

104
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,100
It's not cancer.

105
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,180
It's very likely to be cured.

106
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,180
It's not about the possibility.

107
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,660
It's...

108
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,780
What?

109
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,740
You can't be Xiang Tingdong forever.

110
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,140

how are you going to patch up your lie?

I don't know when he'll return,

113
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,300
but as long as I'm here,

114
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,260
flowers will bloom.

115
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,980

118
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,940
Aren't they afraid of the rain?

119
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,460

164
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,780
throw it away for me?

No...

169
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,620
No,

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,860
Ms. Ruolan.

171
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,860

174
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,660
Mr. Tingdong said

175
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,420
that his pollen allergy

176
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,860
was magically cured.

177
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,180
We tried every means and failed.

178
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,540
Now it's suddenly cured?

179
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,540
I'll think of an excuse

180
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,500
to meet Xiao Xiao

181
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,580
and try to get some information from her

182
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,860
to see if she has

183
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,100
Xiang Tingdong's key.

184
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,260
If she doesn't,

185
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,740
we'll figure out another way.

187
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,020

188
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,900
I'm not asking what you want to do.

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,020
Don't worry.

193
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,700
Everything's fine.

194
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,740
-Aunt?
-Aunt?

195
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,180
Am I disturbing you?

196
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,900
No.

197
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,620
Aunt, can we help you?

198
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,700
I heard

199
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,660
your pollen allergy was cured.

200
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,860
Give me your hand.

201
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,180
You've gotten better

202
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,260
and stronger.

203
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,620
Aunt, don't worry.

204
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,860
Since last time,

205
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,900
Tingdong hasn't smoked weed again.

206
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,940
Mr. Tingdong, you have a call.

207
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,420
Okay.

208
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,900
Aunt, I need to take this.

209
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,980
Aunt.

210
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,940
What's wrong?

211
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,500
Nothing.

212
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,020
I've noticed that your relationship

213
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,860
has changed a lot

214
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,060
since you got married.

215
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,740
He smiles at you,

216
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,820
and it seems

217
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,740
you've opened your heart to him.

218
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,060
I guess the idea of
“getting married before falling in love”

219
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,420
is not just a fantasy in novels.

220
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,620
He's been

221
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,460
good to me.

222
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,860
That's good.

223
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,980
Okay, I'm leaving.

224
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,500
Ms. Ruolan, are you going to work?

225
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,860
Ms. Ruolan...

226
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,420
I'm sorry.

227
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,460
Why did you bump me?

228
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,900
By the way,

229
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,220
did you see Tingdong

230
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,940
at New Fairy last night?

231
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,100
I did see someone

232
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,580
who looks like Mr. Tingdong.

233
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,100
Looks like him?

234
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,740
It must be him.

235
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,220
Cheng seems quite happy

236
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,780
with the relationship.

237
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,700
What if he's seeing someone else
at New Fairy?

238
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,900
What's wrong?

239
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,940
What happened just now?

240
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,020
It's Xiao Xiao.

241
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,260
She asked me to meet her
at New Fairy tonight.

Xiang Tingdong and Xiao Xiao
were quite close,

247
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,340
so they must've known each other
for a long time.

248
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,540
However, she never called home

249
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,300
to ask Tingdong out.

250
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,460
She called you today

251
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,460
after you met her yesterday.

252
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,980
I have a bad feeling about this.

253
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,380
Maybe she called him before,

254
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,700

Besides,

if she didn't call, I'd call her anyway.
