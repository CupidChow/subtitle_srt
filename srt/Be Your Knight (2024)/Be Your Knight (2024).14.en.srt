1
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,380
Cheng?

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,620
Why are you here?

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,260
Tingdong,

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,100
why didn't you tell me

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,900
Mr. Deng is your friend?

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,540
I didn't prepare anything

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,020
for this.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,060
(Kanghai Pharmaceuticals's Deng Dahai
is Huang Hai.)

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,180
(Why would he)

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,660
(invite Cheng Che?)

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,780
Cheng.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,740
I have something important

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,940
to talk with Hai.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,580
You won't understand it.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,020
You should go home.

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,900
Han Shan.

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,580
Is your wife looking down on us?

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,380
She can come and leave

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,860
as she wants.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,460
What about the charity banquet's rules?

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,300
Well, Hai, what do you want?

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,100
Han Shan.

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,420
I thought you became a powerful man.

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,300
I was wondering why a dog
would dare to initiate the banquet.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,620
It turns out

26
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,060
you can't even control your wife.

27
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,420
Here.

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,020
Use this

29
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,180
to teach her a lesson.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,340
Xiang Tingdong.

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,500
Hai is just asking you

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,900
to teach her a lesson,

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,420
and that's all.

34
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,180
Watch your mouth!

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,340
Han Shan,

36
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
I've set

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,580
an example for you.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,780
If someone breaks the rule,

39
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,980
you should punish them.

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,620
It's your turn.

41
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,300
Cheng,

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,820
when we're in public,

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,540
we need to look at the bigger picture.

44
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,420
Han Shan,

45
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
are you crazy?

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,180
Do you know what you're doing?

47
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,620
Yes, I'm crazy.

48
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,980
I went to Southeast Asia

49
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,620
and nearly

50
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,780
got killed

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,580
only to realize

52
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,020
that I, Xiang Tingdong,

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,020
have to decide

54
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,380
whether I'll be

55
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,380
a man or a dog!

56
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,980
I'll make you a ghost!

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,740
You stupid men

58
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,180
only care about killing and fighting

59
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,100
instead of delicious food

60
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,300
and fine wine.

61
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,980
So terrifying.

62
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,500
Hai, Mr. Ba will come back soon.

63
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,020
If anything happens,

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,460
will you be responsible?

65
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,140
Ms. Xiao saved you today.

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,780
Hai, I'll apologize to you someday.

67
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,500
=Be Your Knight=

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,460
=Episode 14
Clouds Scatter, Moon Appears=

69
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,660
If that key is related to
Deng Dahai and them,

70
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,140
I want you to remain calm

71
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,500
and be careful.

72
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,220
You've arrived.

73
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,500
I'm leaving.

74
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,940
Ye Ran!

75
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,940
Do you want to know

76
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,180
why I'm still in Tangcheng?

77
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,500
You haven't told me

78
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,780
why you showed up at Misty Rain.

79
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,180
You must be freaked out.

80
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,460
Go home and get some rest.

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,740
I'll explain it to you later.

82
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,100
Mr. Xiang.

83
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,260
You're already home.

84
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,940
Where are you going?

85
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,300
Mr. Thirteen?

86
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,140
What are you doing here?

87
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,820
What do you mean?

88
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,340
Lan asked me to take care of the family.

89
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,220
Therefore, before she comes back,

90
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,460
I'm afraid I have to teach you a lesson.

91
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,260
(One Day Ago, Fengxing House)
Lan,

92
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,700
you've been busy lately, right?

93
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,820
Why do you have time to come here?

94
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,580
Stop asking the obvious.

95
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,660
You must know what happened

96
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,100
to our family.

97
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,700
I know what happened at New Fairy.

98
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,220
I've asked Facai

99
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,740
to block the news.

100
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,500
Lan, I assure you

101
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
no one will know anything about it.

102
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,420
Thank you

103
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
for this.

104
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
We're family.

105
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,500
Don't be too polite.

106
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,700
Have you seen

107
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,380
Tingdong recently?

108
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,340
Which one are you referring to?

109
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,780
Excellent.

110
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,540
So, you already knew it.

111
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,940
Well,

112
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,940
they're both your nephews, right?

113
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,140
I knew it

114
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,660
because I'm a capable man.

115
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,180
I didn't say it

116
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,300
because of courtesy.

117
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,300
I'm here

118
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,300
to ask you for a favor.

119
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,420
I'm listening.

120
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm really worried about

121
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,380
the Xiang Family.

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,820
I want to ask you

123
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,380
to take care of my family

124
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,780
while I'm on a business trip.

125
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,420
Their safety is important to me.

126
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,980
Your family

127
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,020
is my family too.

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Thanks.

129
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,220
Hao,

130
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,500
let's go home.

131
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,220
Okay.

132
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,860
Come here.

133
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,260
As a woman,

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,780
it hasn't been easy for Lan

135
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
to take care of a big family.

136
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,620
While I'm away,

137
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,580
please take care of her for me.

138
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,660
Don't let anyone hurt her.

139
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,140
It's my duty

140
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,420
to protect Ms. Ruolan.

141
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,140
You're a reliable man.

142
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,220
Maybe you can work for me someday.

143
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,660
Go.

144
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,460
Let me see your cards.

145
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,740
It... It's good.

146
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,980
Ertiao!

147
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,020
What are you doing?

148
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,100
Give me the flowers!

149
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,700
Lan!

150
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,900
The orchids...

151
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,140
I told you to get some rest,

152
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,300
you didn't listen to me.

153
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Look at us now,

154
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,660
trapped here and suffering.

155
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,180
Why didn't you fight back

156
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,740
when Mr. Thirteen kidnapped us?

157
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,500
You could've defeated

158
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,900
Facai and Ertiao.

159
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,820
I was too tired

160
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,740
to fight back.

161
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,780
It's good to stay with you

162
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,100
for a while.

163
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,380
We can't

164
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,820
get out of here tonight anyway.

165
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,820
It's time to tell me

166
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,500
why you came back.

167
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,020
If you don't answer me,

168
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,820
I'll do it for you.

169
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,460
You agreed to pretend

170
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,980
to be Xiang Tingdong

171
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,100
because of the identity of Han Shan.

172
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,060
You knew Deng Dahai's real identity.

173
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,980
You wanted to approach them.

174
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
What about you?

175
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,420
Have you found

176
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,060
the clue of the murderer

177
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,220
who killed your parents?

178
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,980
Is it Deng Dahai?

179
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,740
I'm not sure yet.

180
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,260
The evidence of his smuggling crimes

181
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,660
was kept in Xiang Tingdong's
safety deposit box,

182
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,940
and he does have the tie pin.

183
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,700
However, I still need to confirm

184
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,620
if he has a scar on his hand.

185
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,060
I think

186
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,340
they're after you

187
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,820
because you took it from the box.

188
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,180
Let me

189
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,660
help you this time.

190
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,620
No need.

191
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,460
So far,

192
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,740
you've helped me a lot.

193
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,620
I have to

194
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,340
