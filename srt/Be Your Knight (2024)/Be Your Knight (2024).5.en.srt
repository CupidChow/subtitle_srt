00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,620
(2 hours ago)
Mr. Thirteen.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,340
(Fengxing House)
I asked you for info.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,950
Can you just tell me?

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,030
Lan.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,440
You know the rules here.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,950
If you win, I'll give you the info.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,840
But if you lose,

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,640
you have to take off your clothes.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,540
(Tile)

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,960
- One Character.
- Pung.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,470
- Five of Bamboos.
- Pung.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
Why do you keep Punging?

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,240
What's going on with this game?

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
I'll take this tile too.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,200
Mr. Thirteen.

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,710
I haven't played my tile yet.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Do you know what it is?

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
I want all your tiles.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,630
Here.

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,790
Isn't that a win?

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,040
Alright.

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,230
Come on. Another round.

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,230
The outcome isn't settled yet.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,710
Since this is the last round,

25
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,360
let's make it big.

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,920
If you lose,

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,790
you'll marry me.

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,510
Fine.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
But if you lose,

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
you'll tell me

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,480
what new drug Kanghai Pharmaceuticals

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,000
is working on.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,960
Alright.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,070
Deal.

35
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,510
Come on.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Won.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Look at it. Right? Am I right?

38
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,070
Mr. Thirteen.

39
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,950
It's fine.

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,870
Losing to you isn't a loss.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,870
Next time, I'll try harder.

42
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,350
Alright.

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,950
Ertiao, bring the things

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,230
to the lady.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,360
Thanks.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,760
Mr. Thirteen.

47
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,440
We've been mahjong mates for many years.

48
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,720
You owe me 99 pieces of information.

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,160
When can you repay them all?

50
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,440
Just owe it for now.

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,560
Let me take my time.

52
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,920
What's the rush?

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
By the way,

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,950
any news about Tingdong

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
recently?

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,200
See for yourself.

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,230
This is Tingdong?

58
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,180
=Be Your Knight=

59
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,140
=Episode 5 First Night=

60
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,510
Tingdong.

61
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,480
Look closely.

62
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,550
Is the person smoking opium
in this photo you?

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,440
The person in this photo

64
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,600
isn't me.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,990
Still denying?

66
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,390
This person looks

67
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,200
almost exactly like me.

68
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,950
Tingdong.

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,790
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,640
Since you claim that person isn't you,

71
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,920
then

72
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
let me see your shoulder.

73
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,720
I remember about ten days ago,

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,510
I accidentally burned your shoulder

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,950
with moxibustion.

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
And the person in the photo

77
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,920
has the exact same burn.

78
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,910
Go ahead.

79
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,110
I can bear it.

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,360
Forget it.

81
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,880
If someone asks about the burn
on your right shoulder,

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,390
you just have to react.

83
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,230
Take off your shirt.

84
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,950
Grandma.

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,480
Isn't it inappropriate to do this

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,270
in front of so many family members?

87
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,440
Tingdong...

88
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,110
Yu.

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,270
Everyone out.

90
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,920
Xiang Tingdong.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,280
Take off your shirt.

92
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,430
Didn't you hear that?

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,190
Yu, help him undress.

94
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,990
Mr. Tingdong.

95
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,600
Apologies.

96
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,230
Take off the bandage.

97
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
Uncle Yu.

98
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,520
I'll do it myself.

99
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,550
The person in the photo

100
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,190
has the exact same burn

101
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,480
on his shoulder.

102
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,870
The person in this photo

103
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,430
isn't me.

104
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,750
Since you say it's not you,

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,310
then let me see your shoulder.

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,430
Xiang Tingdong,

107
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,960
what else do you have to say?

108
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,600
This person is you.

109
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,160
Tingdong, why on earth did you do that?

110
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,990
It might be because

111
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,600
he got seriously ill in Southeast Asia.

112
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,550
His shoulder injury never healed.

113
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,720
There's no other reason.

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,990
I made a mistake.

115
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,720
- What's your attitude?
- Fine.

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Yu.

117
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,990
Take out the whip.

118
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,040
Understood.

119
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,520
Grandma.

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,960
This is too cruel.

121
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,160
Any more and he'll suffer
serious injuries.

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,160
Yes, Mom. That's enough.

123
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm afraid Tingdong can't take it.

124
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,160
Continue.

125
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,720
Mr. Tingdong, I'm sorry.

126
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Uncle Yu.

127
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,040
Continue.

128
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Grandma.

129
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,310
Please stop.

130
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,750
He doesn't want to say,

131
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,600
so I'll tell you why.

132
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,310
Alright, Cheng.

133
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,550
Tell us.

134
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,480
What really happened?

135
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,560
A year ago,

136
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,520
we went to Yunzhou.

137
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,750
He was kidnapped by a gang
because of me,

138
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,040
threatened, tortured,

139
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,840
and almost thrown into the sea.

140
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,040
His injuries kept him awake at night.

141
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,840
- That's why he…
- Enough with the excuses.

142
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
Keep going.

143
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,190
Any reason is just an excuse.

144
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,750
I was wrong

145
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
to smoke opium.

146
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,360
Continue.

147
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,840
Continue!

148
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,960
I knew something was off with you.

149
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,990
Turns out it's because of the opium.

150
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,630
Alright.

151
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,870
Tingdong.

152
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
You've finally learned

153
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,190
to admit your mistakes.

154
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,630
Now, I'll take care

155
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,160
of the rest.

156
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,630

(I genuinely admire him)

195
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,390
(and also feel sorry for him.)

196
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,510
(Thank you.)

197
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,160
(Ye Ran.)

198
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,910
You really went all out today.

199
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,910
Your story was quite something too.

200
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,600
I merely repeated

201
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,680
what you did to me.

202
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,720
I was just reaffirming my identity.

203
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,840
Today, they all said it.

204
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,750
I am Xiang Tingdong.

205
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,360
What are you trying to achieve

206
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,750
by making yourself like this?

207
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,600
It's definitely not for you.

208
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,600
I never expected

209
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,440
you'd take the beating for me.

210
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,150
You were punished

211
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,510
for your brother because of me.

212
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,560
Don't let water touch your wound.

213
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,990
Alright.

214
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,600
Ye Ran.

215
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,510
Have some water.

216
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,870
What do you want me to do?

217
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,870
I want you to help me

218
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,680
find a key.

219
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
The agreement didn't say

220
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,600
I had to help you find any key.

221
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,360
Agreement?

222
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,910
What agreement?

223
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Oh, this.

224
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,750
Do you even believe
in this kind of thing?

225
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,720
Alright.

226
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,270
Tell me.

227
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,110
What key are you looking for?

228
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,030
Xiang Tingdong has a safe deposit box

229
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,390
at Fenglong Bank.

230
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,580
(A month ago)

231
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,440
Hello, is this Mr. Xiang Tingdong?

232
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,990
Your safe deposit box here

233
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,960
is about to expire.

234
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,800
Would you like to renew it?

235
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,440
I've searched

236
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,510
every possible place,

237
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,360
but I still can't find the key.

238
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,150
But maybe, with that face of yours,

239
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,390
you can help me find a clue to the key.

240
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
What exactly happened

241
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,630
between you and my brother?

242
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,320
Or rather,

243
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,360
what did you do to him?

244
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,750
You don't need to know that.

245
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,960
I promise you.

246
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,390
His life is not in danger.

247
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,750
What's inside that safe deposit box

248
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
might hold the truth

249
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,230
I've been seeking for fifteen years.

250
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,990
Then tell me now.

251
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,110
What truth are you looking for?

252
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,030
You also don't need to know that.

253
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,750
As I don't need to know anything,

254
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,960
why should I help you

255
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,270
find this key?

256
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
Tingdong.

257
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,680
Tingdong.

258
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
We're married now.

259
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,990
Mr. Tingdong, here's your medicine.
I'll leave it at the door.

260
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Thanks, Uncle Yu.

261
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,750
Just now,

262
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,560
I...

263
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,840
It's alright.

264
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,600
You don't need to explain.

265
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,600
I don't need to know.

266
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,840
Thanks for what you did earlier today.

267
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,750
Don't touch my stuff.

268
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,080
I didn't.
I just wanted to find a book to read.

269
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,990
I brought a blanket.

270
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Tonight,

271
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,080
you'll sleep here.

272
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,080
Where is this collar pin from?

273
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,280
How do you have this collar pin?

274
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,870
How do you know about this?

275
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,470
What else do you know?

276
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,560
Where are the manuscripts?

277
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,520
You are

278
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,080
a group of lunatics.

279
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,360
You're all going to hell.

280
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,000
Have you gone stupid from studying?

281
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,470
You won't talk, huh?

282
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,110
Then never say another word.
