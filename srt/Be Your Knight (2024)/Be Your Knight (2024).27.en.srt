Ye Ran.

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,220
Don't worry. I'll come back soon.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,820
Cheng.

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,460
I still think it's too risky.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,620
Even if you can send us the address,

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,980
Mr. Ba won't let you get away

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,260
when he reaches his goal.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,740
I'm afraid it's hard for you
to come back.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,100
Maybe we should try something else.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,460
- Let me go with you...
- Ye Ran,

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,780
you know it.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,420
Between us,

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,740
I'm the only one

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,180
who can get in.

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,420
I believe you will find me

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,740
and put an end to this.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,040
You will bring me back safe and sound.

I'm surprised to see you here.

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,300
I'm not

58
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,220
a manager anymore.

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,420
I'm the commander of the base.

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,660
You must call me Commander He.

61
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,540
Commander He.

62
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,940
Ms. Cheng,

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,100
if you don't mind,

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,860
I'll search your body

65
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,380
before you get in.

66
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,460
Then you have to be careful.

67
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,780
If I pull out a gun by accident,

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,060
you'll be in danger.

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,540
I don't think you'd dare

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,220
to make a scene here.

71
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,420
Get in.

72
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,380
Guys, hurry up!

73
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,500
Mr. Ba has set a strict deadline for us/

74
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,780
What's wrong with you?

75
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,260
Don't... Don't scare me.

76
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,780
I didn't do...

77
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,020
What have you done?

78
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,060
Nothing!

79
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,060
Mr. He...

80
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,980
She sat...

81
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,340
Why did you

82
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,980
hurt me?

83
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,060
Cheng Che, make it clear!

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,620
When did I hurt you?

85
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,660

86
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,220

The clients from Southeast Asia

91
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,940
were quite satisfied with our sample

92
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,780
and paid the deposit quickly.

96
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,420

98
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,220
get great rewards.

99
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,660
It's our pleasure

100
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,260
to help you.

101
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,620
Good.

102
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,900

Mr. Ba,

105
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,300
please come with me.

106
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,020
She passed out when she got in?

107
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,820
That idiot He Runxi.

108
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,340
What the hell did he do?

109
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,100
Mr. Ba, Mr. Ba...

110
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,300
Back off!

111
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,780
The doctor has checked her.

112
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,140
We only know she was poisoned.

113
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,540
Only the lab results can tell us

114
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,500
what it is and how to cure it.

115
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,900
No matter what kind of poison it is,

116
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,300
as long as you're still alive,

117
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,060
you must get up and work!

118
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,260
Someone broke in.

119
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,180
He,

120
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,660
lock her up.

121
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,250
- Lock her up!
- Okay.

122
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,300
Gather our forces. Let's fix them.

123
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,660
(Three Hours Ago)

124
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,060
They took the bait.

125
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
Finally.

126
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,780
Mr. Xiang,

127
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,020
we can't see their car.

128
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,540
I think we've lost them.

129
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,620
There are no wheel marks.

130
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,780
They must've gotten off somewhere.

131
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
I think

132
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,020
they're around. Keep looking.

133
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,100
But everything looks the same.

134
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,740
Where should we start?

135
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,420
If we're late, Mrs. Xiang...

136
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,540
I know.

137
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,220
Cheng Che.

138
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,420
What clues did you leave?

139
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Our plan has another problem.

140
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,700
Cheng, even if

141
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,620
you get into the drug production base,

142
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,580
it'll be hard to tell us the address.

143
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,900
If they're the only ones

144
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,460
who can get in this place
whenever they want,

145
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,460
I think I can leave a clue

146
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,820
on Yirou.

147
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,100
Yirou?

148
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
Mr. Ba, please come with me.

149
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,780
It's willow catkin.

150
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,660
We need to find a place
with willow catkins.

151
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,380
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.

152
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,740
Tell Uncle Li

153
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,340
to bring more people to help us.

154
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,260
I got it.

155
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,620
Ye Ran.

156
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,140

Okay.

161
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,580
