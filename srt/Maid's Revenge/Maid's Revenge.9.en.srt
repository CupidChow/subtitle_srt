<i>[Episode 9]</i>

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,800
You're getting more and more domineering lately.

4
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,700
I learned it from you.

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,740
You don't learn the good things.

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,680
You didn't teach me how to be good.

7
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,520
You've learned... to talk back.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,660
Tianyi, the wedding is getting closer.

9
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,360
I'm worried about you…

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,160
Tingyao, listen to me. I'll handle this.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,980
But before that, I have matters I need to complete.

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,280
I don't want you to leave me again. Give me some time.

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,720
I'll take care of everything.

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,119
Set out.

15
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,780
Governor.

16
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,480
What's the matter?

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,900
Nothing.

18
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,140
Let's finish this battle first, and then come back and talk.

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,139
It's nothing, really. Let's go.

20
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,639
Why didn't Tianyi come to dinner?

21
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,659
The doorman said that he suddenly went out, and it's been four hours already.

22
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,519
Maybe something urgent happened.

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,739
Uncle's work keeps him busy. Maybe there was a sudden order.

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,600
The situation has been tense recently, and it's chaotic outside.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,020
It really is worrying.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,899
Grandmother, the heavens bless those who are lucky.

27
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,020
You don't have to worry.

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,699
Ms. Chen, ask someone to keep things warm in the kitchen for him.

<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

30

Even if your munitions ship had been bombed, your troops in Rongcheng…

31
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,179
Fang Tianyi! He is just a spent force.

32
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:19,879
Plus he's been injured. What can he really do?

33
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,019
I told you to take action early,

34
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,560
but you disagreed!

35
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,840
General Wu! Hello? Hello?

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,160
Hello?

37
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
Connect me to Ji Manor.

38
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,700
I'm looking for Mr. Ji.

39
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,480
I see.

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,759
Fang Tianyi, you just wait!

41
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,380
<i>You think you're sure to win?</i>

42
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,439
<i>But you forgot your soft spot is still here.</i>

43
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
Everyone, get out.

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,060
Do you know

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,660
why I asked you here today?

46
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,620
Madam, you can speak freely.

47
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,800
Ms. Chen told me

48
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,600
you stayed the night in Tianyi's room a few days ago.

49
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,200
Ms. Chen really knows everything.

50
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,640
So…

51
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,440
It's true?

52
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,180
Yes.

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,800
How dare you!

54
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,479
You're so shameless!

55
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,999
I was the Governor's woman a long time ago.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,799
You've always known that, Madam.

57
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,340
You…

58
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,760
When you first sought refuge here, you had no one to rely on.

59
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,759
It was all right that you relied on Tianyi,

60
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,800
but now you're Yuze's fiancée!

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,580
You're getting married this month.

62
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
How could you do something like that?

63
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,400
Madam.

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,440
From the moment I got my identity back, you've always been hesitating.

65
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,940
You weren't willing to let Yuze marry me

66
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,760
because you knew I was the governor's woman.

67
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,680
But then, later you agreed

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,419
because you wanted the governor to give up completely so that he could marry Miss Ji.

69
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,240
The Fang family needs the money from the Ji family, right?

70
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,980
You have no right to accuse me.

71
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,800
I understand. You do all this for the Fang family.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,700
But you also ignored the feelings of the governor.

73
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,060
"Feelings?"

74
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,240
From the moment I married into the Fang family,

75
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,140
I've always placed the honor and disgrace of the Fang family above my own personal interests.

76
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,800
How could a great family like ours

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,380
ever talk about our own feelings?

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,880
Madam...

79
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,480
But Tingyao...

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,619
I didn't allow you to get close to Tianyi, not just because of the Fang family,

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,160
but for his own good as well.

82
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,000
Back then,

83
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,180
our family actually proposed marriage for Tianyi,

84
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,840
but the fortune teller said... you would be the death of him.

85
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,380
Tianyi is my only child left.

86
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,880
Fortune teller?

87
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,340
Because of a fortune teller's words...

88
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,280
I missed so many years with Tianyi.

89
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Because of a fortune teller's words,

90
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,240
I hadn't seen an outsider for twenty years.

91
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Madam, I don't believe in fate.

92
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,180
It's better to believe it than not.

93
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,560
Tingyao, you don't want anything bad to happen to Tianyi, do you?

94
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,360
What's more, you are Yuze's wife.

95
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,119
If something like this gets out, it'll bring disgrace to our family.

96
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,100
Please rest assured, Madam. I know what to do.

97
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,920
Do you agree with me?

98
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,160
I personally made your favorite snacks.

99
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,159
There's pineapple pastries, osmanthus cakes,

100
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,319
and candied chestnuts.

101
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,740
Come and eat some.

102
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,140
Yan'er, don't speak. Listen to me.

103
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,760
You're not crazy, are you?

104
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,200
I'll find a chance to go into the young master's study.

105
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,719
I have some business to attend to at the firm.

106
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,020
I have to go there first.

107
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,520
You don't have to wait for me to have lunch.

108
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,840
Go on then.

<i>She'll be useful.</i>

115
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,500
Tingyao.

116
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,620
What are you doing here?

117
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,380
When did you get back?

118
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,340
I never left.

119
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,600
Tingyao,

120
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,940
you came to my room that night, saying you wanted to marry me legally.

121
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,440
Were you being sincere or not?

122
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,420
I was sincere then.

123
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,440
What about now?

124
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,780
Why?

125
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,119
Why can Fang Tianyi do whatever he wants to you?

126
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,119
While, me, as your fiancé,

127
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,940
don't even have the right to do this much?

128
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,860
Because you aren't the same as the governor.

129
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,180
Not the same?

130
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,520
So many people have used this phrase to dismiss me.

131
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,520
They said I'm not the same as him.

132
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,740
But you aren't allowed to say that!

133
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,520
You are going to marry me!

134
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,340
How could you have feelings for him?

135
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,060
Ever since he was a child, he has taken everything from me!

136
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,099
Now he wants to take my woman too?

137
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:10,239
He never took anything!

138
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,680
I was willing.

139
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,940
Willing?

140
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,879
Do you know… do you know one thing that I hate the most is willing?

141
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,560
Tingyao.

142
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,820
Tingyao, I love you so much.

143
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,959
Why did you betray me?

144
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,839
Why?

145
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,900
Why…

146
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,820
Love me?

147
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,440
If you really loved me,

148
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,240
would you have sent someone to kill my entire family?

149
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,400
If you really cared about me, would you have used me to kill Tianyi?

150
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,440
Haven't you ever been worried that he would kill me?

151
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,880
You want to borrow a knife to kill someone.

152
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,360
Because you aren't capable of facing him head on at all.

153
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,260
You coward!

154
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Shut up!

155
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,379
I thought you were different from the others.

156
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,720
I never imagined you would be just like them.

157
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:23,900
My uncle said... if I want you, that'll depend on my ability.

158
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,600
All right then.

159
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,800
I'll show him...

160
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,140
what I'm capable of.

161
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,160
What are you doing?

162
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,780
Whatever Fang Tianyi did to you,

163
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,620
I'll double my return in.

164
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,960
Let go of me!

165
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,060
Did he teach you that?

166
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,580
That's all?

167
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,340
If you dare touch me, he'll definitely kill you.

168
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,700
Kill me?

169
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,040
Good.

170
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,719
I'd like to see...

171
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,260
- Let go of me.
- how he'll kill me!

172
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,140
Let me tell you,

173
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,220
the power of the Fang family is under my control.

174
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,099
The first one to be killed will be Fang Tianyi,

175
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:28,260
so you better behave.

176
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,840
Fang Yuze!

177
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,380
- Fang Yuze, what are you doing?
- Don't move!

178
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,300
You want me to hate you forever?

179
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,600
Let go of me!

180
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,300
Let me go!

181
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,260
Governor, this will mean a complete falling out with each other.

182
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,079
He can disregard Madam Fang,

183
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,560
but what about you? How will you explain it to her?

184
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,060
Let's wait on her for now.

185
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,180
I'll tell her when it's over.

186
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,720
Right now, both of us have put our cards on the table.

187
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,360
He will only act more carefully.

188
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,020
We can't take it lightly, either.

189
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,539
Him? What cards does he have?

190
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,239
He's like a stray dog right now.

191
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,520
It all comes down to how you'll deal with it.

192
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,680
Now that everything here is settled, in my opinion,

193
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,760
have our people at home kill him, for fear that something will happen later.

194
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,759
His finances and military support have already been cut off by me.

195
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,540
I don't think anything will happen.

196
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,500
He is my nephew, after all.

197
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't want to kill him either.

198
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,879
But he killed the Dong family.

199
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,780
I'll hand him over to Tingyao to take care of.

200
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,819
Governor, there is one thing...

201
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:51,519
I was afraid you would be affected by it, so I never told you.

202
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,980
Miss Dong seems to be suspicious of Fang Yuze already.

203
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,800
I think she might be investigating him in secret.

204
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,740
What did you say?

205
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,219
In my opinion, you don't know how to appreciate the happy life you were having.

206
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:24,998
All these years, I've never seen the young master care about a woman so much.

207
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:27,319
And yet, you treated him like that?

208
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,580
You deserve it.

209
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,080
Young Master.

210
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,559
Ms. Chen, go outside.

211
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,160
Yes.

212
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,020
Ms. Chen told me you don't want to eat.

213
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,740
That won't do.

214
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,840
If you get sick, how are you going to be my bride?

215
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,340
Come on. Take a bite.

216
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,600
Don't you want to know what I'm going to do next?

217
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,940
When did you start doubting me?

218
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,319
I asked people to keep an eye on you 24 hours a day

219
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,780
to watch your every move.

220
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,980
You're too frightening.

221
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,740
Frightening?

222
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,839
You've never experienced the feeling of being despised and ignored,

223
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,140
how would you know what frightening is?

224
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,460
When we were little, Grandfather only had Fang Tianyi in his heart.

225
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,419
He was the only one who could visit relatives and friends with Grandfather.

226
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:07,240
While I had to stay at home in the Northeast.

227
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,680
I had to wait for him to come back and tell me about you.

228
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,220
Do you know how much I want everything he has?

229
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,619
When I learned that Grandmother was going to make an offer of marriage for him,

230
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,020
I begged my mother.

231
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,520
I wanted to take his place just once.

232
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,700
Even if it was only once.

233
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,100
That being the case,

234
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,020
why did you kill my entire family?

235
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,200
Do you know your family has always had a map of munitions?

236
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,080
Map of munitions?

237
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,440
Blame it on the fact that your father lived so long.

238
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,879
I had to take action early.

239
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,680
Marrying you and inherit your family's property,

240
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:12,100
only this way could I expand my financial resources and army.

241
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,660
So that I can defeat Fang Tianyi in one fell swoop.

242
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,279
That's all?

243
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
That's all.

244
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,680
I can't wait a day, a minute, a second longer.

245
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,480
What's more, your father reserved ammunition for our family,

246
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,740
but actually, he did that for Fang Tianyi's army reserve.

247
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:49,339
How could I allow it to fall into Fang Tianyi's hands and help him expand his power?

248
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,100
So from the beginning, you were just using me.

249
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,080
It was true at the beginning,

250
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,740
but when I first met you,

251
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,720
I developed feelings for you.

252
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,540
Do you know I've never been out of control like this because of anyone before?

253
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,080
Except you.

254
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,500
But you disappointed me too much.

255
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,100
You came…

256
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,900
Did you come here today to tell me this?

257
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,560
No.

258
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:45,100
I came to tell you that you'll soon see your Fang Tianyi, whom you miss day and night.

259
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,840
<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

260
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,560
Gather people in my residence. Bring them to the manor.

261
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,499
Don't alarm anyone. I'll go find her.

262
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:57,020
Yes, Sir.

263
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,560
<i>Tingyao!</i>

264
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,200
Tingyao!

265
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,360
Uncle, you are back.

266
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,160
Where's Tingyao?

267
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,639
Uncle, you went all the way to Rongcheng,

268
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,260
blew up several of General Wu's munitions ships.

269
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,040
Driving him to a dead end, making him too scared to move.

270
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,300
It's been a long journey.

271
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,340
How about having a drink and relaxing?

272
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,300
I'm asking you... where is Tingyao?

273
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,440
Tingyao is completely my woman now.

274
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,660
You don't need to worry about her, Uncle.

275
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,820
What do you mean by that?

276
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,320
Am I not clear enough?

277
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,960
I'll ask you again!

278
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,180
Where is Dong Tingyao?

279
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,680
Do you believe...

280
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,520
that I'll kill you right now?

281
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,820
You'd better think about it before you shoot.

282
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,860
Otherwise, you'll never see Dong Tingyao in your life again.

283
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,240
Grandmother.

284
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,920
You asked these people to watch me.

285
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Why?

286
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,980
Grandmother,

287
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,520
there will soon be a fierce battle in the manor soon.

288
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,780
I'm worried about your safety, so I sent someone to protect you.

289
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,280
I don't need their protection,

290
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,940
Tianyi will be back soon.

291
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,080
He'll protect our family.

292
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,400
Fang Tianyi...

293
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,660
In your eyes, there's only Fang Tianyi.

294
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,640
So many years have passed,

295
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,920
and you still favor your son.

296
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,900
I…

297
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,080
Grandmother,

298
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,060
have you ever known that I was your grandson?

299
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,140
Have you ever trusted me before?

300
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,780
I've never been partial to anyone.

301
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:52,200
But everyone in our family have their own positions and responsibilities to bear.

302
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,840
Then who... decided the positions?

303
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,919
Since we were kids, Grandfather arranged for my uncle to inherit the army of the Fang family.

304
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,439
What about me?

305
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:09,260
Have you ever asked me what I want?

306
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,180
Fighting battles is the most dangerous thing.

307
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,959
You've been in bad health since you were a child.

308
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,559
Your grandfather didn't want you in danger,

309
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,640
so he made arrangements early, hoping you would be a businessman and live a safe life.

310
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:30,260
I never imagined... that his... was how you thought of it.

311
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,959
Excuses.

312
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,760
These are excuses you all came up with.

313
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,860
Just because my mother was a maid,

314
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,380
none of you have ever liked me.

315
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,460
What exactly do you want to do?

316
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,920
You'll know soon enough.

317
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,280
Get some rest.

318
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,440
In an hour, I'll invite you to watch a good show.

319
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,280
Behave yourself!

320
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,540
Don't move!

321
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,940
Don't move!

322
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,750
Don't move!

323
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,380
Behave!

324
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,060
Where is my mother and Tingyao?

325
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,960
What did you do to them?

326
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,920
Do not be afraid.

327
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,120
They are all family,

328
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm not going to do anything to them.

329
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,840
Family?

330
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,200
If you considered us a family,

331
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,780
then why did you kill my father back then?

332
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,020
You knew?

333
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,200
I doubted it before.

334
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,479
We grew up together.

335
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,879
We practiced martial arts together.

336
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm very clear about your strength and how you use your hands.

337
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,159
Before I found evidence, I didn't want to believe you would do something like that.

338
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,900
Until recently... I found solid evidence.

339
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,880
Fang Yuze, how could you do that?

340
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,480
That was your grandfather!

341
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,040
How could I do that?

342
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,460
Why don't you ask me about how he treated me?

343
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,960
I went to his study that day to find him.

344
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,339
He took the evidence of me smuggling firearms and trafficking opium,

345
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:49,540
asked me to go to the police station and confess.

346
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,599
I begged him.

347
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,400
None of it helped.

348
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,240
So...

349
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,100
you killed him?

350
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,440
I committed a serious crime.

351
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,399
If I went to the police station, I would be dead.

352
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,180
He didn't even think about letting me go,

353
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,020
why should I have let him go?

354
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,940
What about the dozens of people in the Dong family?

355
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,180
You killed all of them for your selfish desires.

356
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,379
I naturally did it for their property and the map of munitions.

357
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:29,820
The Dong family is fabulously wealthy.

358
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:35,760
If I got these two things, forget you,

359
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,900
even the commander in chief would compromise.

360
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,040
By then, all of Jiangcheng would be my domain.

361
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,300
Tingyao is your fiancée,

362
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,720
but you've always been using her.

00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,999
♫ <i>The tune ends, the audience disperses</i> ♫

364
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,720
♫ <i>The geese fly away and no longer return</i> ♫

365
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,940
♫ <i>Look at wisps of smoke</i> ♫

366
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,400
♫ <i>Watch the fishing boat in the evening</i> ♫

367
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,379
♫ <i>It never ends</i> ♫

368
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,600
♫ <i>People meet and part ways</i> ♫

369
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,099
♫ <i>Time goes by</i> ♫

370
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,080
♫ <i>What is unchanged</i> ♫

371
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,820
♫ <i>But a fleeting cloud</i> ♫

372
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,319
♫ <i>Grudges and grievances</i> ♫

373
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,559
♫ <i>It takes all my lifetime</i> ♫

374
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,000
♫ <i>Make vows of eternal love</i> ♫

375
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,680
♫ <i>Everything ends up with a sigh</i> ♫

376
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,920
♫ <i>Destiny is uncertain</i> ♫

377
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,160
♫ <i>Heaven and earth are boundless, but it's hard</i> ♫

378
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,559
♫ <i>To have me here</i> ♫

379
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,519
♫ <i>Sadness and joy always make me cry</i> ♫

380
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,679
♫ <i>Love and hate will inevitably be puzzled</i> ♫

381
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,839
♫ <i>Speechless or sleepless</i> ♫

382
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,200
♫ <i>Whose wish can come true</i> ♫
