<i>[Maid's Revenge]</i>

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>[Episode 6]</i>

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,039
I warned you before.

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,500
I told you not to hurt her.

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,540
Otherwise...

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,800
I would kill you.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,520
It seems that you have a bad memory.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,980
So I specifically asked you here to help you remember.

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,160
Do you think that I would hire assassins to kill Dong Tingyao

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,420
just because of the conflict at the banquet?

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,539
Even if it was true,

12
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,860
how could I make arrangements in such a short time?

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Of course, it wasn't because of that conflict.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,480
You had planned this a long time ago.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,280
Ji Mingyue, I don't know whether you're smart or stupid.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,899
You dare to kill people under my nose.

17
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,560
Do you think you can hide it from me?

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,960
All right.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,839
Since you won't admit it, then don't blame me for being rude.

21
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,780
That shot was just a warning.

22
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,560
This time,

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,720
I won't be soft again.

24
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,780
You dare kill me?

25
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,620
My father won't let you go!

26
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,600
Your father?

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,580
If I make your father's arms smuggling public,

28
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,640
just guess what will happen to your family.

29
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,020
Don't! Don't!

30
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,000
I was wrong! I was wrong!

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,360
I don't dare do it again. Never again!

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,260
Tell me. You couldn't have done this by yourself.

33
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,420
Who helped you?

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,340
Fang Yuze...

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,720
If it weren't for the anniversary of your father's death,

36
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,580
I'm afraid you'd stay in your other house and not come home.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,380
Tianyi. Since you don't want to marry Mingyue,

38
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,720
how about you allow Yuze to get married first.

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,240
Now that everyone is here, I'll get straight to the point.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,720
Mother, I want to marry Tingyao.

41
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,300
Uncle, what's the meaning of this?

42
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,940
Exactly what you heard.

43
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,920
Even if you really did marry her, you could never have her.

44
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,000
Because in her heart, there is only me.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,639
Even if she only had you in her heart, someone who doesn't take her life seriously,

46
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,379
doesn't deserve to have her!

47
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,160
What do you mean by that?

48
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,020
You want to know?

49
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,820
Silence, both of you! Uncle and nephew,

50
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,560
but over a woman you become enemies? It's absurd!

51
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,160
Grandmother, at this moment,

52
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,100
you're still going to be biased toward my uncle?

53
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,879
Today is your grandfather's anniversary.

54
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,300
Am I to let you two make a scene here?!

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,880
I shouldn't have listened to your mother back then.

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,660
That year, I was planning to engage Miss Dong to Tianyi.

57
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,740
Your mother said that their birth dates and times weren't compatible.

58
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,840
She would harm Tianyi.

59
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,780
So I convinced the Dong family to betroth Tingyao to you.

60
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,820
I've never believed in that stuff,

61
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,220
but why did I suddenly become confused?

62
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,280
If I hadn't changed my mind back then, this current situation wouldn't exist!

63
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,720
So, then it's my mother's fault, isn't it?

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,620
Yuze, you know

65
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,700
that's not what I meant.

66
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,100
Anyway, ever since I was a child, no one in this family has liked me.

67
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,260
I've always had to give everything to my Uncle.

68
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,019
But this time, I definitely won't.

69
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:47,900
I'll make sure whoever wants to take her ends up dead.

70
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,540
How did you know I was here?

71
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,560
Lieutenant Liu told me you come here every year on the anniversary.

72
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,980
My father was stern,

73
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,700
but he was always kind to me.

74
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,840
When I was a kid, he taught me to read and how to shoot.

75
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,540
I never thought he would have died so young.

76
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,420
How did he…

77
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,300
He was strangled by someone in his study.

78
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,020
The police found no clues after investigating it for such a long time.

79
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,760
All these years, I've always been looking for the killer.

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,420
Hoping I can avenge my father.

81
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,730
I often dream about my father's tragic death.

82
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,080
I don't know who exactly hated our family so deeply,

83
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,300
to where they destroyed us.

84
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,460
Tingyao,

85
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,580
you mean…

86
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,500
you believe me?

87
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,160
I don't know if I should believe you either.

88
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,960
I've always had too many doubts.

89
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,840
Governor, if you want me to believe you,

90
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,320
can you tell me the truth?

91
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,860
Right now, I can't tell you yet.

92
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,320
When the time comes, you'll naturally know the answer.

93
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,860
That being the case, I'll have to search for it myself.

94
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,960
Tingyao.

95
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,160
If you care a little bit about me, I hope

96
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,920
that you'll protect yourself for me.

97
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,720
Before I give you the answer, don't say anything

98
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,880
and don't do anything.

99
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,520
If you don't answer me,

100
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,440
then I'll take your silence as agreement.

101
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,499
Governor, are you confused?

102
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:08,079
She asked you today, but you still didn't tell her.

103
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,480
He's very secretive.

104
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,340
He bought arms from the black market.

105
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,520
The accounts in the firm are also clean and clear.

106
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,120
Even if I expose him, he can totally deny it.

107
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,300
I don't have any real evidence at all.

108
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,040
Tell her what?

109
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,700
He can't wait to shoot you right now.

110
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,820
What are you still waiting for?

111
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,039
Let's take action first.

112
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Is what she thinks that important?

113
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
It's important to me.

114
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,340
Governor, this woman betrayed you again and again.

115
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,439
Today, she said says she believes you. She may turn against you tomorrow.

116
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,800
How can you still trust her?

117
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,380
I trust her.

118
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,280
And I trust my feelings.

119
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,580
Tingyao.

120
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,840
Yuze, what are you doing here?

121
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,740
Nothing.

122
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,300
I just came to see you...

123
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,160
because you've been avoiding me lately.

124
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I just feel a little unwell.

125
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,580
There's been some progress regarding what happened to your family.

126
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,180
What do you know?

127
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,100
I'm not sure yet.

128
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,620
After I'm sure, I'll tell you.

129
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,140
What you should do now is just wait to marry me.

130
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,420
Yuze. You're not hiding anything from me, are you?

131
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,400
Don't worry. I wouldn't.

132
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,280
Young Master, long time no see.

133
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,619
Why aren't you in the west room? What are you doing outside?

134
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,680
Young Master, you really are heartless.

135
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,740
Have you forgotten your promise to me before?

136
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,780
My promise was to Dong Tingyao.

137
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,080
But you're not her.

138
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,860
Dong Tingyao?!

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,000
What if I were to tell her I was pregnant with your baby?

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
You shut up!

141
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,360
If it weren't for you, she wouldn't have been humiliated by my uncle.

142
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,379
I haven't settled that with you yet.

143
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,840
And you dare threaten me?

144
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,639
You were so affectionate to me before.

145
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,019
You couldn't wait to have me

146
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:40,739
and made me pregnant with your baby.

147
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:42,940
Wasn't it all because I was Dong Tingyao?

148
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,500
If you had me, you could get the Dong family's property.

149
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,100
What? Don't want to admit to it now?

150
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,060
How dare you threaten me?!

151
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,359
I'll tell you what.

152
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:59,100
If Dong Tingyao finds out anything about it, I'll kill you."

153
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,500
In that case, your story will soon be known to others.

154
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,060
Try it!

155
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,439
You're a smart person. It's better not to play games with me.

156
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,779
At noon tomorrow, someone will deliver medicine to your room.

157
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,480
<i>How could you be so cruel as to get rid of our baby?</i>

158
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,659
<i>Everything in the past really was all fake.</i>

159
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,539
She was just fine, how did she go crazy?

160
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,539
I don't know. Last night she was fine.

161
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:33,199
The little maid delivered food to her this morning and she was already like this.

162
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,319
The doctor came and said it was insanity.

163
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,400
Madam considered the fact you're sisters and let me tell you.

164
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,620
Yan'er.

165
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,660
Yan'er, look at me.

166
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,659
You can't marry the young master!

167
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:52,099
- You can't marry the young master.
- Yan'er.
- Go away.

168
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,839
- I'm the young mistress! I'm the young mistress!
- Let go of her!

169
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,300
- Yan'er.
- You can't marry the young master.

170
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,019
You can't marry the young master.

171
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,919
I'm the young mistress. You can't marry him.

172
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,019
Did the doctor prescribe any medicine?

173
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,199
Yes. Two prescriptions, they're decocting.

174
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,279
I'm the young mistress.

175
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,700
Take care of her. Don't let her suffer.

176
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,780
Got it.

177
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm the young mistress. I'm the young mistress!

178
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,960
Crazy?

179
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,060
Yes. I didn't have time to make my move.

180
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,280
All of a sudden, she went crazy.

181
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,340
The whole family knows it.

182
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,040
It even startled the Madam.

183
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,720
About the baby...

184
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,179
No one else knows, right?

185
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,520
You can rest assured. Ms. Chen saw her take the medicine.

186
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,660
It's definitely gone.

187
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,260
No one else knows about this except Ms. Chen.

188
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,100
Are you sure she's crazy?

189
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,019
She should be.

190
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,479
Ms. Chen pricked her with a needle to test.

191
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:45,100
But she didn't feel pain. The doctor said it may be insanity.

192
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,240
Young Master do I still have to…

193
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,710
Since she's crazy, then let it be.

194
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,379
Have someone keep a watch on her.

195
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,839
Don't complicate the problem at the moment.

196
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,599
If a corpse appeared for no reason in the manor, my uncle will notice it.

197
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,400
Yes, Sir.

198
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,540
I want to ask you for Dr. Chen.

199
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,980
Because of Dong Yan'er?

200
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,660
Yes.

201
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,479
Dr. Chen is a surgeon. He can't treat Dong Yan'er.

202
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,340
What about the other doctors then?

203
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,740
Dr. Chen works in such a big hospital.

204
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,860
Is there another doctor who can save her?

205
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,239
Dr. Chen studied abroad, too. Does he know a lot of foreign doctors?

206
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,019
She harmed you so badly before.

207
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,419
She only has herself to blame.

208
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,780
Why do you still want to help her?

209
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,179
She's my sister, after all.

210
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,020
Did you forget what I told you?

211
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,340
When facing your enemies, don't be softhearted.

212
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,360
But she's not my enemy.

213
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,480
She's my family.

214
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,940
I was really lonely when I was a child.

215
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,600
She's the only one who kept me company.

216
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,620
Do you want to help me or not?

217
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
If I help you, how will you repay me?

218
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,039
Can't you help others just for the sake of helping?

219
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,440
You want a reward every time.

220
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
I don't like to lose out.

221
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,940
How about...

222
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
you let me kiss you?

223
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,279
Governor, you're a soldier.

224
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,160
You always use the same tricks.

225
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,680
If I had any other tricks,

226
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,280
you wouldn't have been able to run away awhile ago.

227
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,980
If you promise to help me,

228
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,220
I can promise you something.

229
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,640
I'll call Dr. Chen.

230
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,080
Thank you, Governor.

231
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,700
Tingyao.

232
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,959
If one day, Yuze and I fight against each other,

233
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,340
which side would you choose to stand on?

234
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,400
Before something actually happens, no one really knows what will happen.

235
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,920
At least,

236
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,540
you didn't tell me firmly that you would choose him.

237
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,280
Dr. Chen, how is her condition?

238
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,920
It's hard to tell at the moment.

239
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,660
It's better to come to our hospital.

240
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,080
Let our psychiatrists conduct a detailed exam on her.

241
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,930
Thank you, Doctor.

242
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,659
Chunmiao, see him out.

243
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,100
Yes.

244
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,860
This way, please.

245
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,179
So it's a doctor for Yan'er?

246
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,939
Did the Governor find him?

247
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,080
He saved the Governor's life before.

248
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,859
You know that.

249
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,218
I don't know any other doctors in Jiangcheng.

250
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,739
- So I…
- Then why didn't you come to me?

251
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:33,679
When you have problems, why do you always ask him for help instead of me?

252
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,400
I… At the moment…

253
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,660
Do you not trust me?

254
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,460
No. I just didn't think too much.

255
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,760
Didn't think too much?

256
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,860
You don't care how I feel at all!

257
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,420
Yuze, how about you make peace with the Governor?

258
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,119
You have no right to criticize me. You don't understand at all!

259
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,540
Yuze, you…

260
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,720
Sorry, Tingyao. Just now…

261
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,140
Just now, I was too impulsive.

262
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,020
<i>What is wrong with me?</i>

263
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,520
No. I didn't think about your feelings.

264
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,679
- Actually, I…
- Tingyao.

265
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,200
I want to be alone.

266
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,540
Yan'er.

267
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,200
Do you think people will change?

268
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,120
I don't know who has changed,

269
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,260
is it the governor, Yuze,

270
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,580
or me?

271
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,660
Lately, I think the Governor isn't that annoying anymore.

272
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,720
But Yuze…

273
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,260
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

274
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,500
It smells good.

275
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,160
Uncle, why are you still up so late?

276
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,980
Waiting for you.

277
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,520
Waiting for me?

278
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,260
It's been a long time since we had a good talk.

279
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,600
Let's have a good talk tonight.

280
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,139
Actually, I still occasionally miss our days when we were at the military academy.

281
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,240
At that time, we were just classmates.

282
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,220
You weren't my uncle.

283
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,000
I wasn't your nephew, either.

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,860
We discussed tactics together every day.

285
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,900
Trained together.

286
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,020
I had thought...

287
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,320
you would be my lieutenant.

288
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,260
Why isn't it that you're my lieutenant?

289
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,640
Did you always know that my grandfather would recommend you?

290
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,999
I was appointed by those above.

291
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,220
It had nothing to do with my father.

292
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,260
Yuze. I know what you've done.

293
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,080
If you're willing to atone for your crimes, I can let you off.

294
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,440
"Let me off"?

295
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,239
Uncle, are you thinking too highly of yourself

296
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
or looking down on me?

297
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,880
If you really hate me and want to kill me,

298
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,340
we can compete fair and square.

299
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,060
Killing someone is the easiest thing to do.

300
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:27,160
Pushing someone to desperation is worse than death.

301
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,700
I've been there.

302
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,519
When I was little, no matter how hard I tried,

303
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,640
I couldn't get a single word of praise from my grandfather.

304
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,440
Wanting, but never getting something is the most painful thing.

305
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,420
Uncle, do you want to try it?

306
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,319
Young Master, if you do this, aren't you afraid Miss Dong will really go over to him?

307
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,420
We have to give her hope and then kill it.

308
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,320
That's how she'll come back to me completely.

309
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,110
True. I'll do as you say tomorrow.

310
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,380
Thank you.

311
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,499
No need to say that.

312
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:15,240
If it hadn't been for your mother, I would already be dead.

313
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,660
I must help you get what you want now.

314
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,100
Ms. Chen.

315
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,440
Miss Dong.

316
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,400
What are you doing?

317
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,839
The Governor likes magnolia flowers the best.

318
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,059
The flowers are in full bloom now.

319
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,939
I'm picking some for him and will make sachets that can be put in his room.

320
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,060
Then the room will be filled with the scent of magnolia flowers.

321
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,819
I like magnolia flowers, too.

322
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,160
How about I help you?

323
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,960
All right.

324
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,939
The Governor has loved magnolia flowers since he was a child.

325
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:52,520
Once the season arrived, he would always want me to make sachets.

326
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,839
Later, he just planted a tree here.

327
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,279
He said when the flowers are in full bloom,

328
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,640
he could see them every day.

329
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,960
In a blink of an eye, this tree has been here for fifteen years now.

330
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,939
That long?

331
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:10,919
Yes. At the time, if the young master couldn't be found anywhere,

332
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,440
he would certainly be here.

333
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,720
Does the young master also like magnolia flowers?

334
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,419
I was wrong.

335
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,560
The young master whom I'm talking about is the governor.

336
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,279
At that time, the master was still alive.

337
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,799
The governor was the young master.

338
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,860
Master Yuze was the little young master.

339
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,219
The governor was the young master?

340
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:36,080
Yes. The master passed away three years ago.

341
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,499
After he passed away, the governor became the head of the family.

342
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,000
Do you mean the young master at that time is the governor now?

343
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,319
That's right.

344
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,680
The governor really is young and promising.

345
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,420
Miss Dong!

346
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,340
He's the young master. He's the young master.

347
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,560
He's the young master.

348
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,919
Miss Dong? Why are you in such a hurry?

349
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,760
Chasing a soul?

350
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,680
Lieutenant Liu, please send a message to the governor for me.

351
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,260
<i>What is this?</i>

352
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,660
<i>This is the safety amulet my mother gave me.</i>

353
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,219
<i>Inside are magnolia flowers. It's always fragrant.</i>

354
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:51,120
<i>Here you are.</i>

355
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,000
Miss Dong, I have a letter for you.

356
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,600
Is that all she said?

357
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,279
Yes. Without any reason, she asked you to keep

358
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,460
an appointment from fifteen years ago.

359
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,100
What is she up to now?

360
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,780
Governor, you'd better not go.

361
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,719
It's all right. I got it. You can go.

362
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,400
All right.

363
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,180
<i>Enter the Dong's Mansion at dusk on the seventh day of June.</i>

364
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,519
<i>Except for Miss Dong, eliminate all people.</i>

365
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,640
<i>Leave no survivors to avoid further trouble.</i>

366
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,099
<i>Any disclosure is prohibited.</i>

367
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:20,359
<i>Whoever violates this will be subject to military law.</i>

368
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,220
<i>Fang Tianyi.</i>

369
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,440
<i>This pigeon blood tattoo is my seal.</i>

370
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,640
<i>Only when I'm excited will it show.</i>

371
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,840
<i>[Fang Tianyi]</i>

372
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,080
<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

373
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,600
What? Do you remember everything?

374
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,080
Yes, I remember it all.

375
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,680
Perhaps I should forget it, though.

376
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,780
What happened?

377
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,680
You asked me to come here,

378
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,380
isn't it because of an appointment from fifteen years ago?

379
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,940
So you've always remembered the appointment.

380
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,260
That being the case,

381
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,140
why did you do this to me?

382
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,360
Why did you kill my entire family?

383
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,440
Take a look yourself.

384
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,540
This is your letter to the warlord of Rongcheng.

385
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,060
It describes in detail your plan to destroy the Dong family.

386
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,260
I've been with you for so long.

387
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,420
I know your handwriting.

388
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,880
And this seal. How do you want to justify it?

389
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,320
You've always been lying to me.

390
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,740
You said before that you would always believe me.

391
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,039
Just because of an inexplicable letter,

392
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,540
you've lost all your previous trust in me, right?

393
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,360
Trust in you?

394
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,020
Let me be honest with you.

395
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,440
I never...

396
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,360
never trusted you.

397
