- Father!
- Master, are you all right?

Father!

- Father.
- Miss.

Mr. Dong was shot.

Father! Come.

Hold on.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,600
Father.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,059
Father, I'll take you away.

14
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,320
Father!

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,860
- Father!
- Take it…

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,100
Take it to the Governor's Mansion.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,560
Go find Governor Fang…

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,560
You have an arranged engagement with the Fang family.

19

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,440
- Master!
- Father!

00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,820
- Master!

Father!

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,979
Search the mansion immediately.

28
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,240
Once you find any survivors, take them away.

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,180

Nanny, why are you so stupid?

Cut the nonsense!

Or I'll cut your tongue off.

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Very good. You actually uncuffed yourself.

You have neither official documents nor letters.

Greetings, Miss Dong.

74
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,600
Here's the thing. She insisted that she was from the Dong family

75
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,640
and wanted to see the governor.

76
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,780
<i>You killed my family.</i>

77
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,720
<i>I'll kill you.</i>

You're not dead.

Great.

81
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,119
Tell them about it. Let me see the governor.

82
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,540
He is the only one who can avenge our family.

83
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,379
Who is Yan'er? Don't talk nonsense here.

84
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,600
This is the future young mistress of our mansion.

85
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,520
Leave.

86
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Young Mistress?

What do you mean?

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,460
You guys say

89
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,180
she's the young mistress?

90
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,580
Yes.

91
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,740
I am the future young mistress of the mansion.

92
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,980
Don't blame me. I came here before you.

93
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,060
Blame it on your mother for listening to the Taoist.

94
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,580
She never let you see outsiders since you were little.

95
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,560
Now the Dong family has perished.

96
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,880
Everyone who knows your look was dead.

97
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,760
Except for me, no one knows what Miss Dong looks like.

98
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,699
I suggest you get out of here now.

99
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,860
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

100
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,220
What if I don't go?

101
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,880
My Lady!

102
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,980
What are you doing?

103
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,960
What do you want? I asked you so nicely.

104
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,060
You're not just talking nonsense here but also hurting me!

105
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,180
Dong Yan'er!

106
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,540
You slander me. Why are you doing this?

107
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,240
- Why?
- Stop her!

108
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,880
- Yan'er!
- Why are you standing around by the gate instead of working?

109
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
- Greetings, Your Ladyship.
- Greetings, Your Ladyship.

110
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,800
What's happening?

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,420
Your Ladyship,

112
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,060
I'm Miss Dong, Dong Tingyao.

113
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,620
Today I came here to see the Governor.

114
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,180
But these men stopped me from entering.

115
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,960
And her. She's not Miss Dong.

116
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,520
That is my half-sister, Dong Yan'er.

117
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,740
She came here using my name.

118
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,740
I want to ask whether the Governor's Mansion can't tell right from wrong.

119
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,000
Your Ladyship, it's not that.

120
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,460
I…

121
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,400
Last night, Tingyao came to our mansion,

122
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,760
with Mr. Dong's handwritten letters and his personal seal.

123
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,980
I have personally verified them.

124
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,740
Now you say you are the real Miss Dong.

125
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,260
Do you have proof of that?

126
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,080
Of course, I do.

127
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,540
When two families determined this engagement,

128
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,000
your family gave a token to our family.

129
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,520
Before my father died, he handed it over to me.

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,400
I believe you will understand with just a glance.

131
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,520
How come? It was here...

132
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,280
Why? I… Where did the token go?

133
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,380
Without proof, you dare to say

134
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,260
that you are the young mistress of the Governor's Mansion.

135
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,580
You are so bold.

136
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,040
It's not that, Your Ladyship. I-I have proof. Believe me.

137
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,700
Why are you still standing there? Hurry and drive this girl out.

138
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,060
A nobody like you can't pretend to be from the Governor's Mansion.

139
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,640
I have proof. Your Ladyship, trust me.

140
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,119
It's not like that. Your Ladyship…

141
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,900
Miss, are you all right?

142
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,780
Young… Young Master…

143
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,040
I just got back but I see a mess at the gate.

144
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
What exactly is going on?

145
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
Grandmother.

146
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,760
We have her outnumbered and bullied by us at the gate.

147
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
It's not a good scene to be seen.

148
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,540
Besides, my uncle is still working as the governor of a province.

149
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,260
If we beat her to death at the gate and this got out,

150
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,760
my uncle will not be able to explain it to the general.

151
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,820
How could we allow her to talk nonsense here

152
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,100
and destroy the reputation of the mansion?

153
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,780
I didn't…

154
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,860
Grandmother,

155
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,540
a girl values her integrity the most.

156
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,620
She's an unmarried girl,

157
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,440
but she claimed to be my fiancée for no reason.

158
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,960
Given this, there must be some kind of secret.

159
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,000
Why don't we take her home first and ask her some questions?

160
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,320
<i>Are you okay?</i>

161
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,540
<i>It turns out he is Master Fang.</i>

162
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,520
Your Ladyship, I'll be honest with you.

163
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,200
The girl actually is my acquaintance.

164
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,380
She's a country girl. Her name is Yan'er.

165
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,540
She has been delivering duck eggs to our family before.

166
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,080
Her family lived with the Dong family.

167
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,940
Maybe because my family was in trouble, and she lost her livelihood, she thought of this method

168
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,600
to earn her living in the Fang family.

169
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,340
Now my family is gone, and I'm alone in this place.

170
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,060
No one could take care of me.

171
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,879
I think she is not bad.

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,300
And you have punished her.

173
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,020
She must have realized her fault.

174
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,079
Why don't you just leave her to me?

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,520
Let her be a maid of mine.

176
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,980
It's accumulating merits for you.

177
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,740
She slandered you, but you ask for leniency for her.

178
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,020
With such a good bearing, sure enough, you are a good daughter taught by the Dong family.

179
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,220
Now that you ask me on her behalf, I agree.

180
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,620
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

181
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,220
Mr. Dong, you don't have to walk me to my room.

182
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,860
Just call me Yuze. You and I don't have to be so formal.

183
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,680
Yes. Yuze.

184
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,820
I shouldn't mention your sadness,

185
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,120
but I read in the papers the Dong family was looted.

186
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,590
Didn't Mr. Dong have a favorite golden toad?

187
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,140
I wonder where it went.

188
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,380
Golden toad?

189
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,160
I haven't seen it before.

190
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,340
Maybe it has been robbed by thieves.

191
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,180
Let bygones be bygones.

192
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,080
After such a mess in the morning, you must be tired.

193
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,240
Go rest early.

194
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,860
I didn't expect us to meet for the first time after my family perished.

195
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,259
It doesn't matter. There will be plenty of time.

196
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,620
Look at you. So badly hurt.

197
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,520
I'm afraid you won't recover for a while.

198
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,860
It's just the two of us.

199
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,660
Don't pretend.

200
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,680
You're keeping me here. Is it because of what Mr. Fang said?

201
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,180
You're afraid you're going to reveal yourself?

202
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,100
We have known each other for many years. You know me best.

203
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,880
Why?

204
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,320
Although we are half-sisters,

205
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,280
I always treated you like my blood sister.

206
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,440
"Blood sister?"

207
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,220
My name can't even be written in the family tree.

208
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,140
Who would think of me as a daughter of the Dong family?

209
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,720
All the best is yours.

210
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,280
Right now, I'm just getting back what should've been mine.

211
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,720
"What should've been yours?"

212
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,020
But I am the one who has an arranged engagement with the Fang family.

213
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,100
Do you have any proof?

214
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,680
I am the young mistress recognized by Mrs. Fang.

215
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,020
You have no chance to fight with me.

216
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,240
Don't you forget.

217
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,200
All members of the mansion do not believe you.

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,180
In here, you're just one of my dogs.

219
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:25,620
How can dog food be put on the table?

220
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,420
Someday, I will prove who I am.

221
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,880
That depends on whether you have the ability to do that.

222
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,500
Eat.

223
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,399
Eat.

224
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,800
What a good meal!

225
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,400
If you don't eat it, it will go to waste.

226
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,540
Eat!

227
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,960
I forgot. You love to be clean.

228
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,800
But if you're so unwilling to eat, I will do as you wish.

229
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,840
Within three days, I'll let someone carry your body out of the house.

230
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,080
By then, you won't have to listen to me anymore.

231
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,640
I was supposed to thank you.

232
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,660
Mr. Fang is a gentle and thoughtful man.

233
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:40,600
Luckily, your mother proposed the engagement, otherwise, I wouldn't get such a good husband.

234
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,240
But for such a nice man, you are not worthy.

235
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,880
Mr. Fang.

236
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,980
Miss Yan'er, it's inappropriate for me to get in.

237
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,400
This medicine is very effective for treating bruises.

238
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,220
You should try it.

239
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
Thank you.

240
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,740
I heard you delivered duck eggs to the Dong family.

241
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,040
Now that everyone thinks so, it must be true.

242
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,260
I heard that Mr. Dong has a treasure.

243
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,940
You frequented his home. I wonder if you had the honor to see it.

244
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,780
It seems like a golden toad.

245
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,060
It's not a golden toad. It is a golden tortoise.

246
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,400
Few people in the Dong family knew about it.

247
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,060
How did you know?

248
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,520
I just heard it.

249
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,159
Keep the medicine well.

250
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,460
Please rest early.

251
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,160
Come to me if you need anything.

252
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,320
Don't be afraid.

253
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,280
I am here with you.

254
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,500
<i>To avenge my family, in the current situation,</i>

255
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,640
<i>I can only ask Mr. Fang for help.</i>

256
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,700
<i>Keep it in mind.</i>

257
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,200
<i>At the Governor's Mansion,</i>

258
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,700
<i>you can only walk around in the west building.</i>

259
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,140
<i>In the east building, there are bedrooms and the masters' studies.</i>

260
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,480
<i>A lowly maid like you is not qualified to go in there.</i>

261
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,160
<i>If you dare to go there, you will be beaten to death.</i>

262
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,600
<i>Remember!</i>

263
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,300
Mr. Fang, I am…

264
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,580
I'm the Young Mistress's new maid.

265
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,820
Mr. Fang, what are you doing?

266
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,380
We meet again.

267
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,959
It is you! Let me go!

268
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,240
Let me go!

269
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,420
You murderer! I'll kill you.

270
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,000
Let me go!

271
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,340
You're so impatient.

272
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes.

273
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,040
I can't wait to kill you. I was worried that I wouldn't find you.

274
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,880
But you came to me of your own volition.

275
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,560
Let me go!

276
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,680
I can say the same.

277
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
<i>Tianyi, is everything all right?</i>

278
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,960
<i>Why do I hear something in the room?</i>

279
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,680
<i>Tianyi!</i>

280
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,520
What are you doing?

281
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,300
Let me go!

282
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,180
Let me go!

283
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,920
<i>Tianyi.</i>

284
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,640
- All of you, get out.
- Yes.

285
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,220
Let me go!

286
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,900
Want to go?

287
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,700
You are the first woman who dares to hit me.

288
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,140
I won't just hit you. I'm going to kill you.

289
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,320
In Jiangcheng, countless people tried to kill me.

290
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,160
But no one has ever succeeded.

291
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,940
I want to see...

292
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,940
how you will kill me.

293
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,400
It has nothing to do with you.

294
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,660
This has something to do with you, doesn't it?

295
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,700
How dare a maid enter the east building? If I hadn't helped you dodge a bullet,

296
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,120
you would have been dragged out and killed by now.

297
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,560
Help me apply the medicine.

298
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,020
Then I'll let you out.

299
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,480
- You are dreaming!
- Stop!

300
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,360
If you don't want to die, just follow my order.

301
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,720
Put your clothes on.

302
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,520
Open the second cabinet on the left.

303
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
There's a medicine kit.

304
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,980
My gun is not patient.

305
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,200
You should know it.

306
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,560
Don't let me shoot you before you can kill me.

307
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,080
Y-You dare to kill people in the Governor's Mansion.

308
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,820
Aren't you afraid of getting into trouble?

309
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,020
I kill people in my own house. Why should I be afraid?

310
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,379
What do you mean? You are...

311
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,040
Yes.

312
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,320
I am the governor of Jiangcheng City,

313
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,760
Fang Tianyi.

314
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,420
<i>The enemy I'm looking for</i>

315
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,940
<i>is actually the governor of Jiangcheng.</i>

316
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,580
<i>Then how do I get my revenge?</i>

317
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,580
Don't want to kill me anymore?

318
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,440
I've done what you ordered. May I go now, Governor Fang?

319
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,940
If you really want to kill me... shoot me then.

320
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,880
What happened? Why are you in a rush?

321
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,920
Yuze, something happened between the governor and my maid.

322
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,940
What do you mean?

323
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,940
Anyway, I'll explain it to you when I get back.

324
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,900
Shameless!

325
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,760
What are you doing?

326
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,260
Let me go!
- You wretch!

327
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,660
I'm going to kill you today!

328
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,940
Why are you hiting me?

329
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Why? Mrs. Fang is kind enough to keep you alive.

330
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,740
Who knew you would be so contemptible?

331
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,500
You failed to pretend to be the young mistress, and now you dare to seduce the governor?

332
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,100
I didn't!

333
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,960
Such a cheap girl, sell her to the whorehouse!

334
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,840
<i>Understood!</i>

335
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,160
Get up! Drag her away.

336
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,199
Let me go! Let go!

337
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,240
Stop! Stop hitting her!

338
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,660
- Stop it.
- How dare you?

339
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,140
- You think you can still stay here?!
-Stop it!

340
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,780
Stop it!

341
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,200
- Let me go!
- I'm going to kill you.

342
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,420
Stop it. Ms. Chen, stop hitting her.

343
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,860
- Get up, Yan'er!
- Stop!

344
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,180
Yan'er, get up.

345
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,740
Yan'er!

346
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,020
- What are you doing?
- Saving her.

347
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,940
She's mine, you don't need to bother.

348
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,520
If you're idle, teach your fiancée how to behave.

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,320
♫ <i>Grudges and grievances</i> ♫

359
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,460
♫ <i>It takes all my lifetime</i> ♫

360
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,800
♫ <i>Make vows of eternal love</i> ♫

361
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,680
♫ <i>Everything ends up with a sigh</i> ♫

362
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,820
♫ <i>Destiny is uncertain</i> ♫

363
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,060
♫ <i>Heaven and earth are boundless, but it's hard</i> ♫

364
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,460
♫ <i>To have me here</i> ♫

365
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,220
♫ <i>Sadness and joy always make me cry</i> ♫

366
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,380
♫ <i>Love and hate will inevitably be puzzled</i> ♫

367
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,440
♫ <i>Speechless or sleepless</i> ♫

368
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,900
♫ <i>Whose wish can come true</i> ♫
