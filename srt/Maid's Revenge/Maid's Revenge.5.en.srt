<i>[Episode 5]</i>

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,080
Get out of my room.

4
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,460
I heard that the maid turned out to be the real Miss Dong.

5
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,100
You're very well-informed.

6
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,340
Now that she has recovered her identity,

7
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,800
she should be able to marry into your family very soon.

8
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,520
You didn't come to see me today

9
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,300
just to talk about my maid, did you?

10
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,780
I come here to solve problems for Madam Fang.

11
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,059
Your nephew is so anxious to hold the wedding, it's to the point of going crazy.

12
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:26,700
According to the Madam,

13
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,020
children should respect their elders.

14
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,200
She wants us to get married before them.

15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,220
She already spoke to my mother yesterday.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,019
I've been upset lately. I'm not in the mood to mess with you.

17
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,199
I know why you are upset. But I want to remind you,

18
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:51,620
you're the Governor. You must never covet your nephew's wife.

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,160
Your family is already an empty shell. If you lose this position,

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,780
the Fang family will really be over.

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,899
If there is nothing else, please excuse me for not keeping you company.

22
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,750
You…

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,320
It's okay. I'll do it.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,160
Tingyao,

25
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:31,880
why do you look a bit unwell?

26
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,700
I may have gotten up too early this morning.

27
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,739
What are you doing in such a hurry?

28
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,559
The Ji family is coming to visit us tonight. I have to finish my work first.

29
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,520
Then you go get back to work.

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,099
All right, I'll be going then. Get some rest.

31
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,420
I'll come find you when I get back.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,980
Yu…

<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,219
It's rare for us to be together like today. Come, let's raise our glasses.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,299
I'm not feeling well lately. Please forgive me for substituting tea for wine.

36
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,440
You're a heavy drinker. This makes it seem like you don't respect me.

37
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,039
It was a slip of the tongue. I drink one glass as punishment.

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,960
Life really is mysterious and miraculous!

39
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,079
Miss Dong not only recovered her identity,

40
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,820
but she will also get married next month. Congratulations.

41
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,900
Thank you, Miss Ji.

42
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,099
The Fang family can be regarded as a decent family in Jiangcheng.

43
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,480
The nephew is about to get married.

44
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,639
Until when will Tianyi and Mingyue's marriage be delayed?

45
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,279
The war situation is tense right now.

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,639
I'm afraid Tianyi will have to go and fight.

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,779
When the situation is more stable…

48
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:17,600
What if the situation remains unstable?

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,499
I'm the one who doesn't want this.

50
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,920
What?

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,560
Mingyue doesn't deserve you, does she?

52
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,819
No. I'm not worthy of Mingyue.

53
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,160
Nothing's been settled yet. Yuze only asked about it.

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,799
I answered him, without thinking, that the 21st day of the next month was an auspicious day.

55
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:47,540
If it was settled, how could we not send you an invitation?

56
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,819
Of course, Tianyi and Mingyue's wedding needs to come first.

57
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,140
I do feel sorry for the Dong family.

58
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,720
They all died overnight.

59
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,399
How mysterious Miss Dong was, back then!

60
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,580
No one had seen her in twenty years.

61
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,940
This Miss Dong isn't fake, is she?

62
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,659
Have you confirmed her identity?

63
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,319
Mr. Ji, please rest assured.

64
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,740
Our Fang family will not make another mistake.

65
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,700
That's good then.

66
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,719
Back then, Miss Dong's mother played tricks and replaced the engaged Miss Lu.

67
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:32,179
Then, under the eyes of Madam Dong, she became the legal wife.

68
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,660
This incident caused such a stir in Jiangcheng.

69
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,860
It seems that being an imposter is a tradition for the Dong family.

70
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,660
Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.

71
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,780
I have only one daughter.

72
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,240
I hope your family won't treat her unfairly.

73
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,420
What?

74
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,800
You can't stand it after my father said a few things?

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,699
It was too stuffy in the house,

76
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,640
I came out to get some fresh air.

77
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,900
I couldn't figure it out before,

78
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,580
but today I finally understand.

79
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,380
The Dong family is an old and well-known family.

80
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,400
Your father deceived so many people to marry your mother,

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,340
presumably, your mother wasn't a simple woman.

82
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,500
Did your mother teach you how to bewitch a man?

83
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,740
Miss Ji.

84
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,200
Please respect yourself.

85
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,619
It's improper for you to say this.

86
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,700
I'm just saying.

87
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,820
I'm not as shameless as you.

88
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,539
You clearly know that you're his nephew's fiancée but climbed into the governor's bed.

89
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,600
That's right.

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,299
You played all your cards and even threw yourself into his arms.

91
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,479
Has he ever looked at you?

92
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,740
Dong Tingyao!

93
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,600
Tianyi, let go of me! I'm the one who's your fiancée!

94
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,959
Will you watch her humiliate me like this?

95
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
Miss Ji, don't confuse right from wrong.

96
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,299
You were the one who spoke rudely first.

97
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:39,079
All right! Dong Tingyao.

98
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,540
You've got someone to support you now, is that it?

99
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,380
Enough.

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,820
Our family is entertaining guests today.

101
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,200
I don't want to argue with the guest.

102
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,560
If you dare to hurt her again,

103
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I'll kill you.

104
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,299
Dong Tingyao, don't be so pleased with yourself!

105
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,920
Who do you think you are?!

106
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,960
You…

107
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,359
I… I said all that to make her angry.

108
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,720
Don't take it seriously.

109
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,120
But you also shouldn't be threatening people all the time, saying you'll kill them.

110
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,680
She's not like me.

111
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,540
After all, she's your...

112
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,240
She's…

113
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,459
She's from the Ji family.

114
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,819
The guests have been waiting.

115
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:45,140
Let's go back.

<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

117
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,160
Madam Fang, farewell.

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
Mr. Ji, please.

119
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,300
Aren't you going to see me off?

120
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,479
Be on alert! Protect the governor!

121
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,280
Madam, hurry, let's go!

122
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,280
Hurry, get in the car.

123
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,199
Escort Madam Fang back into the house.

124
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,220
- Close the gate!
- Yes, Sir! Cover them!

125
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,420
Madam!

126
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,730
Madam, hurry, let's go!

127
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,180
- Come on.
- Madam. Let's go.

128
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,980
Tingyao, be careful!

129
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,260
Governor.

130
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
You're hurt!

131
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,419
I'm fine.

132
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,700
Governor.

133
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,150
Go… to my other residence.

134
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,700
Yes, Sir.

135
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:40,890
Governor. Governor!

136
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,390
Governor!

137
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,400
Lieutenant Liu, go get some hot water.

138
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,720
All right.

139
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
You'll be all right. You'll be all right.

140
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,560
Don't look...

141
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,910
It'll scare you...

142
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,881
Look at the situation!

143
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,521
What haven't I seen?

144
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,659
I've even killed people!

145
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,580
Hurry up, tell me what to do. I'll save you.

146
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,260
Wash the wound first or what?

147
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,980
Weren't you... always trying to kill me?

148
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,480
Even so, you can't die like this.

149
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Only I can kill you.

150
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,440
Hurry up, tell me what to do.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Fang Tianyi!

152
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,900
Fang Tianyi, wake up!

153
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,140
Tell me what to do!

154
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,420
Fang Tianyi!

155
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,039
Fang Tianyi, wake up!

156
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,520
Governor? Governor!

157
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,280
Governor! Governor!

158
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,830
A'Cheng, go see if Dr. Chen has arrived.

159
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,519
Okay.

160
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,860
Governor! Governor!

161
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,220
Governor.

162
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,660
Dr. Chen, is he all right?

163
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,580
I told him before, he mustn't touch the wound again.

164
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,539
It's close to the heart, but he...

165
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,559
I've stopped the bleeding and also gave him an injection.

166
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,960
All we can do is wait.

167
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,619
If he has a fever during the night, give him some anti-inflammatory medicine.

168
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,940
If he doesn't get better tomorrow,

169
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,420
you have to send him to the hospital.

170
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,220
All right, thank you Dr. Chen.

171
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,540
I'll have someone clean up your room.

172
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,599
Don't bother. I'll keep watch over him tonight.

173
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,680
You don't have to be hypocritical.

174
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,620
You won't seize the chance to kill him, will you?

175
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,600
If you're worried, watch over him with me.

176
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,319
You've got a fever.

177
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,040
I'll go get you some medicine.

178
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,740
Don't go.

179
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,140
Don't go.

180
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,520
Don't leave me. Don't go...

181
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,540
I'm not leaving. I'm right here with you.

Dr. Chen said

212
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,140
as soon as you wake up, you should drink this while it's hot.

213
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,320
I'm not drinking it.

214
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,840
How about this?

215
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,819
You drink the medicine, and I'll reward you. How about that?

216
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,400
You're a strong, big guy,

217
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,500
you wouldn't be as timid as a three-year-old kid, would you?

218
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,540
What is this?

219
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
You don't even know about this?

220
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,039
A pickled plum.

221
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,940
I asked A'Cheng to buy it early this morning.

222
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,260
When I was a child, every time I finished my medicine,

223
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,540
my mother would give me one.

224
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,180
How is it? Doesn't taste bitter anymore, right?

225
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,260
After such a long time,

226
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,780
you're finally doing your job as a maid.

227
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,560
Now that you're awake, I'll head back then.

228
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,460
Where's my reward?

229
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,100
Plums are the rewards, aren't they?

230
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,460
I'm your savior.

231
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,220
How can you dismiss me with just a plum?

232
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,660
Those are different matters.

233
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,499
You did indeed save me.

234
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:09,320
But we haven't settled what's between us yet.

235
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,420
You still think I killed your entire family, don't you?

236
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,620
I saw it with my own eyes!

237
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,059
What can I do to make you trust me?

238
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,580
Then tell me the truth!

239
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,960
Actually, you're worried about me, aren't you?

240
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,000
Last night you were anxious.

241
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,020
That can't be fake.

242
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,460
I don't know.

243
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,880
I don't know why this happened.

244
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,381
Yuze, what brings you here?

245
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,879
I was worried, so I came to pick you up.

246
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:09,239
In order to save me last night,

247
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,601
- he was seriously injured...
- I know.

248
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:14,119
I'm also worried about my uncle.

249
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,199
So I came to visit him.

250
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,141
Are you worried about me or are you afraid I took your fiancée back?

251
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,681
Uncle, as an elder, please watch yourself.

252
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,981
Tingyao is my legal fiancée.

253
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,920
I won't allow you to humiliate her like that.

254
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,741
That depends on whether you're qualified to say that!

255
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:44,060
Am I not qualified?

256
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,280
What? You are?!

257
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,880
- He was badly hurt!
- Don't touch me!

258
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,101
What is it? Are you afraid I'm going to hurt him?

259
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:54,239
Yuze, what makes you think that?

260
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,560
How dare you scold her in front of me?

261
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,060
I warned you.

262
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,780
If you hurt her even a little bit, even though you're my nephew,

263
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,460
I won't show you any mercy.

264
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,580
My tolerance has limits.

265
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,620
Please take care of your own affairs.

266
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,400
Tingyao is my fiancée.

267
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,320
I will protect her myself.

268
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,080
You don't need to bother.

269
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
No matter what Grandmother says,

270
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,720
Tingyao and I will have a wedding next month.

271
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,460
Uncle, please behave yourself.

272
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,140
Did you take care of him all night?

273
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,400
He was in danger last night.

274
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,920
I had to.

275
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,140
Have you forgotten what he did to you?

276
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,720
Just because he saved you,

277
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,230
can you pretend what he did before never happened?

278
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,880
I don't want to talk about this right now.

279
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,060
I've been confused lately.

280
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm just not sure…

281
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,020
"Not sure"?

282
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,860
What the hell are you not sure about?

283
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,560
Tingyao.

284
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,239
Could it be that you and my uncle...

285
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,880
No.

286
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,840
It's impossible.

287
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,980
I know he's my enemy.

288
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,260
But... he risked his life to save me.

289
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,780
Yuze.

290
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,420
He almost died last night.

291
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,980
I just wonder if there's some sort of misunderstanding.

292
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm just trying to find out the truth.

293
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,520
Tingyao.

294
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,220
I'm sorry.

295
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,060
I shouldn't doubt you.

296
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,220
I shouldn't have yelled at you either.

297
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,940
It's just because I care about you so much.

298
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,320
Let's go.

299
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,079
What a rare visitor.

300
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,400
I didn't think it would be you who would come to see me.

301
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,840
We haven't had a good chat in a long time.

302
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,540
When we were kids, we always had a lot to say.

303
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,560
In this huge Fang family, I tried to find someone to talk to.

304
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,200
The first one I thought of, was you.

305
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,860
Is that so?

306
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,780
What about Fang Yuze?

307
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,599
You tried so hard at the beginning to go back to him.

308
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,040
But you have nothing to say to him?

309
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,480
Yuze is my fiancée.

310
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,980
I used to think I could talk to him about everything, and I could be honest with him.

311
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,820
But recently,

312
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,300
I feel like he's changed.

313
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,560
He's not the person I remember.

314
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,919
Time really does reveal a person's heart.

315
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,260
The ancestor's words were true.

316
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,620
You spent so much time with Yuze.

317
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,400
Can you tell me if he is trustworthy?

318
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,440
You shouldn't ask me that.

319
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,020
If I were you, I would choose to believe the person who risked his life to save me.

320
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,520
You mean the Governor?

321
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,580
Everyone can see that he has deep affection for you.

322
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,300
He is the enemy of our family.

323
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,140
If you were so sure,

324
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,240
you wouldn't have come to talk to me today.

325
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,780
Dong Tingyao,

326
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,560
the real enemy isn't going to say he's your enemy.

327
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,880
Dong Tingyao.

328
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,779
Do you like Fang Yuze or that guy you met that year under the tree?

329
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,600
What's the difference?

330
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,040
Yuze is the young master of the Fang family.

331
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,340
That said, if Fang Yuze wasn't the young master,

332
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,520
you wouldn't like him, right?

333
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,180
I just want to remind you.

334
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,100
Vacillating between the uncle and the nephew

335
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,460
is like playing with fire.

336
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,260
There's no good in it for you at all.

337
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,600
If I were you, I would make a decision as soon as I can.

338
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,500
You finally got through it.

339
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,260
But you lost too much blood, your body is weak.

340
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,880
Let your people make some nutritious food for you.

341
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,060
- Did you see all those pictures?
- I did.

342
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,680
Those bullets that killed the Dong family

343
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,860
are consistent with those you saw in the arsenal.

344
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,040
And they are the same as the assassins at the gate of your mansion.

345
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,400
Those weapons were newly developed by the British earlier this year.

346
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,580
They should be the batch that flowed into the black market.

347
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,700
Governor, this confirms that our guess is correct.

348
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,260
The assassins at the gate that night were also arranged by Fang Yuze.

349
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,400
The black market has good and bad people mixed up in it.

350
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,420
Maybe there's something else.

351
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,520
Why are you still making excuses for him?

352
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,780
Those people we caught at the Dong mansion are trained well.

353
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,820
That means he has trained those assassins for a long time.

354
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,499
Do you really have to wait for him to point his gun at you before you'll do something?

355
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,660
That's my nephew.

356
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,540
We grew up together.

357
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,340
I really can't think of why he would do this.

358
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,520
Wait until I find real evidence.

359
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,120
- I…
- Lieutenant Liu, don't say anymore.

360
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,759
Let the Governor get some good rest.

361
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,360
He knows what to do.

362
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,740
Please.

363
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,880
Don't look for trouble these next few days.

364
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,360
If you get injured again, I'm not sure I can still save you.

365
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,080
Governor Fang, the sun has risen in the west.

366
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,760
In the past, you were dying to avoid me.

367
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,880
Why did you suddenly called me here today?

368
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,760
What?

369
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,300
Your arsenal can't make it anymore, so you came to make peace with me?

370
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,800
Miss Ji, what do you think?

371
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,740
It's not because you miss me, is it?

372
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,460
I warned you before.

373
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,080
I told you not to hurt her.

374
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,660
Otherwise...

375
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,920
I would kill you.

376
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,840
It seems that you have a bad memory.

377
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,300
So I specifically asked you here, to help you remember.

378
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,480
You think that I would hire assassins to kill Dong Tingyao

379
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,720
just because of the conflict at the banquet?

380
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,960
Even if it was true,

381
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,980
how could I make arrangements in such a short time?

382
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
Of course, it wasn't because of that conflict.

383
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,000
You had planned this a long time ago.

384
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,300
Ji Mingyue.

385
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,580
I don't know whether you're smart or stupid.

386
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,220
You dare to kill people under my nose.

387
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,580
Do you think you can hide it from me?

388
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

389
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,780
All right.

390
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,060
Since you won't admit it, then don't blame me for being rude.

391
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,060
That shot was just a warning.

392
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,880
This time,

393
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,740
I won't be soft again.

394
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,040
You dare kill me?

395
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,740
My father won't let you go!

396
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,320
Your father?

397
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,940
If I make your father's arms smuggling public,

398
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,860
just guess what will happen to your family.

399
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,300
Don't! Don't!

400
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,380
I was wrong! I was wrong!

401
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,440
I don't dare do it again. Never again!

402
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,020
Tell me.

403
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,560
You couldn't have done this by yourself.

404
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,540
Who helped you?
