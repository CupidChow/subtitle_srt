Tianyi. Tianyi!

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,560
Do you think it needs to be a little tighter here?

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,540
Oh. I think it's fine.

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,560
I'm done trying them on.

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,520
Grandmother picked quite a few dresses.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,360
Don't you want to try more of them?

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,860
No need. I'm going to get changed.

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,420
All right.

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,400
Are you okay?

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,220
I'm fine.

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,100
Thank you, Governor.

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,620
Let's go.

15
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,280
Governor.

16
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,720
How are you doing?

17
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,980
I'm good.

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,300
Governor, do you really want to marry Miss Ji?

19
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,940
What do you think?

20
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,840
Can you not marry Miss Ji?

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,160
For what reason?

22
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
I…

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,880
I don't want you to.

24
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,060
"You don't want me to"?

25
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,640
When I asked you repeatedly not to marry that guy,

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,000
how did you answer me?

27
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,120
Dong Tingyao, you are too selfish.

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,460
I'm not your plaything.

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,960
Dong Tingyao. This man is mine now.

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,380
Please stay away from him.

31
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,980
Let's go.

32
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,220
Governor! I believe you!

33
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,779
How long has she been there?

34
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,200
Almost long enough to have a cup of tea.

35
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,660
Young Master, do you want me to…

36
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,180
No need.

37
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,740
If someone wants to betray you, there's no way to stop it.

38
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,520
Please stay calm, Young Master.

39
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,700
Don't hurt yourself.

40
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
Don't worry.

41
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,100
What are you doing here?

42
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
I saw Dr. Chen came over.

43
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,060
I was worried.

44
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,520
Did the wound open again?

45
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,220
You worry too much.

46
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,020
Dr. Chen just came over for a routine check.

47
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,100
If there is nothing else, please go back.

48
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,720
I want to rest.

49
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,300
What are you doing?

50
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,280
Let go of me.

51
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,500
No, I won't.

52
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,960
- Yes or no?
- I won't!

53
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,500
Unless you promise me one thing.

54
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,000
I forbid you to marry Ji Mingyue.

55
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,800
That isn't up to you.

56
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,300
She's my fiancée.

57
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,860
You are unreasonable.

58
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,800
I was Yuze's fiancée, too.

59
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
And you unreasonably asked me not to marry him.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,820
Why can't I ask you not to marry Ji Mingyue?

61
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,340
Even if I'm being unreasonable, I learned it from you!

62
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,260
Back then, I didn't stab you.

63
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,060
I know you hate me.

64
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,880
But whatever you do, don't ignore me, okay?

65
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,860
Dong Tingyao.

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,460
Was I not clear enough, is that it?

67
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,599
If you keep pestering me? Believe it or not, I'll kill you.

68
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,720
You won't!

69
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,580
Although you and Ji Mingyue are always with each other in front of me

70
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,800
and you also asked Lieutenant Liu to tell me that

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,520
you wanted nothing to do with me,

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,960
I know you can't bear to kill me.

73
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,600
Don't flatter yourself.

74
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,740
You don't understand... just how afraid I am.

75
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,360
What are you afraid of?

76
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,980
Afraid of losing you.

77
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,040
Every time something happened to you,

78
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,200
I'll inexplicably feel afraid, and my heart will ache.

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,860
Although arms smuggling is a felony, you also know he was instigated.

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
I will do what I promised.

156
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,780

157
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,420

Miss Dong?

161
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,600
I have something to ask you.

162
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,400
What else do you want to know?

163
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,740
I told you everything I know already.

164
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,140
Does the letter that framed the governor have anything to do with Yuze?

165
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,939
You're the one who received the letter.

166
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,660
How would I know?

167
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,679
The governor was framed.

168
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,860
It's impossible not to investigate it.

169
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,660
You must know.

170
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,840
I can't tell you even if I know about this.

171
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,779
I heard Yuze and Tianyi were punished with doing transcriptions when they were little.

172
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,060
They often helped each other.

173
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,480
Yuze would certainly imitate the handwriting of Tianyi.

174
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
Don't think you can set me up.

175
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,479
I understand. Thank you.

176
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,580
Miss Dong, I beg you.

177
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,199
Just stay put and behave.

178
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,279
The governor will deal with it. Don't give him any more trouble.

179
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,460
This thing started because of me.

180
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,240
I'm the one who should end it.

181
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,380
If it weren't for my betrayal,

182
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,759
Yuze wouldn't use this method to instigate something between me and Tianyi.

183
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,759
Miss Dong, you can't solve this.

184
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,399
Moreover, the grievances between the governor and the young master aren't just because of you.

185
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,640
Is that so?

186
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,159
What else don't I know?

187
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,780
How complicated is it?

188
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,399
Even if you were to shoot me right now, I wouldn't say anything.

189
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,300
Fine, don't say then.

190
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,400
I have one more question.

191
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,199
Why do you have so many questions?

192
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,360
What does this text mean?

193
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,759
That's not text, it's clearly a password.

194
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,840
Where did you get it?

195
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,000
Even if you were to shoot me right now, I wouldn't tell you.

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,720
Dong Tingyao, listen to me, you really can't act recklessly.

197
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,820
I won't.

198
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,539
But please don't tell the governor what we talked about tonight.

199
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,940
I don't want him to worry.

200
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,579
The two of us haven't had a drink like this in a long time, have we?

201
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,580
Uncle, why won't you just admit that Tingyao is my fiancée?

202
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,780
Let me guess.

203
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,800
Because every since you were a child you were determined that she would be yours, right?

204
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,820
Why do you think so?

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,740
"Muti."

206
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,580
Don't you remember?

207
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,540
You paid visits to the Dong family when you were little.

208
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,640
After getting back, you told me about Miss Dong.

209
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:42,259
You said the Book of Songs says that a lad would like to woo a lass with nice and pretty looks.

210
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,340
That is to say, you have always known it.

211
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,560
You've always like to take what was mine.

212
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,060
I'm used to it already.

213
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,319
What's yours is yours.

214
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,759
What's not yours can't be yours.

215
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,280
No matter what, she'll come back to sooner or later.

216
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,460
You're right.

217
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,540
What's yours is yours.

218
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,560
But she was already mine a long time ago.

219
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,799
It's a fact.

220
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,599
Even if you two were to get married, you can't change that.

221
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,900
You don't have to use this to provoke me.

222
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,820
From now on, she'll only be my woman.

223
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,659
You probably never imagined

224
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:48,120
that were would be something in this world that you can't have.

225
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,060
Whether I can have it or not, isn't up to you.

226
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,020
I'm warning you,

227
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,279
don't do anything to hurt her.

228
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,420
Otherwise...

229
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,920
I won't be kind to you.

230
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,420
The one who's been hurting her has always been you.

231
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
Come in.

232
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,119
Yuze, you've been busy, so I stewed some ginseng soup for you.

233
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,360
Here, drink it while it's hot.

234
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,940
All right.

235
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,299
I was afraid that it would be too strong, so I used the ginseng seeds to make it.

236
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,920
In the future, under your care, I might start to get fatter.

237
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,080
I still remember when we first met, you were being kicked out of the Fang house.

238
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,400
At the time,

239
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,200
your eyes looked like a stubborn and sensitive fawn.

240
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,799
I was determined to enter the Governor's Mansion to avenge my family.

241
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,600
I just didn't expect to see my enemy here.

242
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,780
Do you mean my uncle?

243
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,519
Didn't you say we shouldn't talk about him?

244
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,500
You were the one who brought him up today.

245
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,159
I'm in a good mood today.

246
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,200
It doesn't matter if you mention it.

247
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,219
You told me that as long as we find the seal, we can take him down.

248
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:59,319
But no one has seen this seal.

249
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,020
That's true.

250
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,300
Have you seen it before?

251
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,320
No.

252
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,500
Why are you asking me that?

253
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,400
N-Nothing. Just curious.

254
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,139
Let's not talk about him.

255
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:20,580
Hurry, drink the ginseng soup.

256
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,360

I forgot to tell you...

267

Grandmother has agreed to move up my wedding date with Tingyao.

268
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,780
Is that right?

269
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,940
What's the date?

270
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,479
The seventh day of this month.

271
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,199
It's an auspicious day.

272
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,240
I hope you can officiate it personally.

273
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,580
Sure.

274
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,360
What is he doing lately?

275
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,439
We attacked his arsenal last time.

276
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,000
Now Mr. Ji doesn't dare help him.

277
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,960
He's been calm lately.

278
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,460
Even so, we can't take it lightly.

279
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,499
I know him.

280
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,220
With his character, it's impossible he'll be this quiet.

281
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,039
Governor. Why don't we take action first?

282
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,600
I was trying to find the right time.

283
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,580
I even thought about giving him a chance.

284
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,880
But I don't want to wait anymore.

285
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,520
The wedding is around the corner.

286
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,280
I have to settle these things before that.

287
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,960
That's probably what he's also thinking.

288
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,079
Okay. Then I'll gather our people and get ready.

289
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,780
Go ahead.

290
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,500
I told you to wait for me.

291
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,320
Why did you come over here on your own?

292
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,300
I missed you.

293
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,320
You're getting more and more domineering lately.

294
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,720
I learned it from you.

295
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,060
You don't learn the good things.

296
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,100
You didn't teach me how to be good.

297
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,740
You've learned... to talk back.

298
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,980
Tianyi, the wedding is getting closer.

299
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm worried about you…

300
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,280
Tingyao, listen to me.

301
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,480
I'll handle this.

302
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,300
But before that, I have matters I need to complete.

303
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,600
I don't want you to leave me again.

304
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,640
Give me some time.

305
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,040
I'll take care of everything.

306
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,439
Set out.

307
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,100
Governor.

308
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,800
What's the matter?

309
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,220
Nothing.

310
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,560
Let's finish this battle first, and then come back and talk.

311
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,360
It's nothing, really.

312
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,420
Let's go.

313
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,959
Why didn't Tianyi come to dinner?

314
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,079
The doorman said that he suddenly went out, and it's been four hours already.

315
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,839
Maybe something urgent happened.

316
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,159
Uncle's work keeps him busy.

317
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,200
Maybe there was a sudden order.

318
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,020
The situation has been tense recently, and it's chaotic outside.

319
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,240
It really is worrying.

320
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,219
Grandmother, the heavens bless those who are lucky.

321
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,240
You don't have to worry.

322
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,919
Ms. Chen, ask someone to keep things warm in the kitchen for him.

Plus he's been injured.

328
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,440
What can he really do?

329
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,339
I told you to take action early,

330
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,780
