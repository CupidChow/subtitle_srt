00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,060
<i>[Maid's Revenge]</i>

2
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,180
<i>[Episode 10]</i>

3
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,700
You'll know soon enough. Get some rest.

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,700
In an hour, I'll invite you to watch a good show.

5
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,640
Behave yourself!

6
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,299
Don't move! Don't move!

7
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't move!

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,640
Behave!

9
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,320
Where is my mother and Tingyao?

10
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
What did you do to them?

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,280
Do not be afraid.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,480
They are all family,

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,900
I'm not going to do anything to them.

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,300
Family? If you considered us a family,

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,140
then why did you kill my father back then?

16
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,380
You knew?

17
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,560
I doubted it before.

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,839
We grew up together.

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,440
We practiced martial arts together.

20
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm very clear about your strength and how you use your hands.

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,519
Before I found evidence, I didn't want to believe you would do something like that.

22
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,760
Until recently... I found solid evidence.

23
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,240
Fang Yuze, how could you do that?

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,940
That was your grandfather!

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,400
How could I do that?

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,920
Why don't you ask me about how he treated me?

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,320
I went to his study that day to find him.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,799
He took the evidence of me smuggling firearms and trafficking opium,

29
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,000
asked me to go to the police station and confess.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,959
I begged him.

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,760
None of it helped.

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,600
So...

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,060
you killed him?

34
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,900
I committed a serious crime.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,759
If I went to the police station, I would be dead.

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,540
He didn't even think about letting me go,

37
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,380
why should I have let him go?

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,200
What about the dozens of people in the Dong family?

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,340
You killed all of them for your selfish desires.

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,839
I naturally did it for their property and the map of munitions.

41
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:18,180
The Dong family is fabulously wealthy.

42
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,200
If I got these two things, forget you,

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,260
even the commander-in-chief would compromise.

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,400
By then, all of Jiangcheng would be my domain.

45
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,660
Tingyao is your fiancée,

46
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,980
but you've always been using her.

47
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,300
I just provoked her with a few works.

48
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,380
Ji Mingyue actually sent someone to kill Dong Tingyao.

49
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,400
It was just a little misunderstanding.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,320
Even if Dong Tingyao had feelings for you, she could have killed you.

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,479
When you helped Ji Mingyue send the assassins, did you even consider that Tianyao might have died?!

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,080
Why should I think about her?

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,640
She was restless and unhappy because of you,

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,140
and then the two of you flirted openly in front of me.

55
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,180
When you cheated on me, did you ever think about me?

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,200
But it's all right. You managed to survive danger time and again.

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,900
Now your life is useful to me.

58
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,940
Let them go.

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,620
Our grievances should be solved by us alone.

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,919
Why should I listen to you?

61
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,360
I can give you everything, including the property of the Fang family,

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,460
the army, and all you want.

63
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,260
What if I said... they're not enough?

64
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,420
What else do you want?

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,420
You'll agree to any request I make, won't you?

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,520
Yes.

67
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,500
As long as you release my mother and Tingyao.

68
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,860
Actually, ever since I was a child, I adored you.

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,860
I thought you could do anything.

70
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,200
And even thought I could never beat you,

71
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,720
in the end... I found your greatest weakness.

72
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,540
Actually, you could have killed me a long time ago.

73
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,140
but you didn't.

74
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,260
You didn't have to worry if she lived or died,

75
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,600
but you'd rather sacrifice everything you have.

76
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,360
Fang Tianyi, people can't have weaknesses.

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,760
If you weren't so emotional, I may have never beaten you.

78
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,520
But this is your Achilles' heel.

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,480
What a pity.

80
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,200
What are you doing?

81
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,660
Let go of me! I want to see the governor.

82
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,119
Take it easy.

83
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,240
We'll take you to see him right now.

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
Take her away.

85
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,920
Move.

86
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,100
From now on, Fang Yuze is appointed as the commander of the Fang's army.

87
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,000
All deployments of Fang's army should follow Fang Yuze's arrangements.

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,280
No one is to violate this order.

89
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,360
Uncle.

90
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
Take a look.

91
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,999
I imitated your handwriting.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,380
It looks pretty just like it.

93
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,660
By the way,

94
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:44,160
such an important military order needs to be witnessed.

95
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,480
Bring them here.

96
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,599
- Tianyi!
- Tianyi!

97
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,240
- Mother!
- Tianyao!

98
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,640
- Tingyi!
- Tianyi!

99
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,000
Tianyi!

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Are you two all right?

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,740
Yuze, what are you going to do with him?

102
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,360
He's your uncle!

103
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,920
Uncle?

104
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,560
I only remember

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,660
swearing that I was going to take

106
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,279
everything I lost back from him.

107
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,340
Don't!

108
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,440
Don't! Don't!

109
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,239
Don't!

110
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,020
Don't be afraid.

111
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,940
How could I let him die so easily?

112
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,259
I said before... that I would make him kneel at my feet

113
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,060
and torture him, bit by bit.

114
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,700
I invited you both here to watch this show.

115
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,560
This dagger was grandfather's favorite.

116
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,200
It's said that at that time, it was custom made by the best blacksmith in the Northeast.

117
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,160
It's extremely sharp.

118
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,140
I asked my grandfather for it three times.

119
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,200
But he couldn't bear to give it to me.

120
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,780
I didn't expect, it ended up with Fang Tianyi.

121
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,840
Dong Tingyao,

122
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,220
back then, you took this knife

123
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,860
and stabbed Fang Tianyi's chest, right?

124
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,280
Do you want to try it again?

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,820
Let go of me!

126
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm begging you...

127
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,300
Kill me.

128
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,040
Tingyao, don't beg him.

129
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,539
Actually, I have been longing for this dagger for a long time.

130
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,200
How about I practice with him today?

131
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,440
Dong Tingyao, don't you love to be tortured by Fang Tianyi?

132
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,660
Then I'll show you how I torture people.

133
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,519
No! No!

134
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,580
Compared with Fang Tianyi's skills, what do you think of mine?

135
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,380
Fang Yuze!

136
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
Tianyi!

137
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Tianyi! Don't...

138
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,940
Yuze, stop it!

139
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,399
How can you be so cold-blooded?

140
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,380
He's your uncle!

141
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,380
You'll be punished for doing such a thing!

142
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,800
Punished?

143
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,420
Tianyi!

144
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,439
Let me go!

145
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,100
I'll tell you the truth.

146
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,500
I killed both my grandfather and the Dong family.

147
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,760
If you have the ability, then have God punish me!

148
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,580
What did you say?

149
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,160
Mother…

150
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,539
You bastard!

151
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,140
How could you do such a thing?

152
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,319
How could our family have a grandson like you?

153
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,980
I'll kill you!

154
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,879
Let me go!

155
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,200
It's so noisy.

156
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,479
Let go! Let go of me!

157
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:40,480
You've seen most of the show already.

158
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,900
Just wait to collect Fang Tianyi's body then.

159
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,380
Take her away!

160
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,379
Yes, Sir!

161
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,220
Tianyi!

162
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,039
Mother!

163
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,000
- Tianyi!
- Madam!

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,640
Mother!

165
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,780
- Let go of her!
- Fang Yuze!

166
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,520
I wish I never had a grandson like you!

167
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,420
<i>I curse you!</i>

168
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,220
Now...

169
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,479
it's much quieter!

170
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,420
Tianyi!

171
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,540
Fang Yuze, I'm begging you.

172
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,840
I beg you, let him go!

173
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,380
Don't hurt him again!

174
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,020
I'm begging you.

175
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,160
Please let him go...

176
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,479
I'll do... I'll do anything you want me to do. I beg you not to hurt him.

177
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,580
Don't…

178
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,319
Dong Tingyao.

179
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,980
- Don't…
- If you knew this would happen, why did you do what you did before?

180
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:39,500
If you hadn't betrayed me and followed him, I might have let him die more easily.

181
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,700
It's a pity though.

182
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,030
If you have the nerve... just kill me!
