<i>[Episode 2]</i>

3
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,660
Don't want to kill me anymore?

4
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,620
I did what you ordered. May I go now, Governor Fang?

5
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,940
If you really want to kill me... then shoot me.

6
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,960
What happened? Why are you in a rush?

7
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Yuze, something happened between the governor and my maid.

8
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,060
What do you mean?

9
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,220
Anyway, I'll explain it to you when I get back.

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,880
You shameless!

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
What are you doing?

12
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,760
- Let me go!
- You wretch!

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,439
I will kill you today!

14
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,919
Why are you hitting me?

15
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,959
Why? Mrs. Fang is kind enough to keep you alive.

16
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,820
Who knew you would be so contemptible?

17
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,579
You failed in pretending to be the young mistress, and now you dare seduce the governor?

18
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,180
I didn't!

19
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,190
Such a cheap girl, sell her to the whorehouse!

20
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,910
<i>Understood!</i>

21
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,189
Get up! Drag her away.

22
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,429
Let me go! Let go!

23
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,790
Stop! Stop hitting her!

24
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,290
- Do you think you can still stay here?
- Stop it!

25
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,909
Stop it!

26
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:41,689
- Let me go!
- I will kill you.

27
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,330
Stop it.

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,530
Ms. Chen, stop hitting her.

29
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,229
- Get up. Yan'er .
- Stop!

30
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,410
Yan'er, get up.

31
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,970
Yan'er!

32
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,290
What are you doing?

33
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,149
Saving her.

34
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,970
She's mine. You don't need to bother.

35
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,550
If you have free time, teach your fiancée how to behave.

36
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,909
Yan'er. You're awake.

37
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,530
Here.

38
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,689
You scared me to death just now.

39
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,170
Luckily, the doctor said you were fine.

40
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,909
Who… Who are you?

41
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,569
What's wrong with you? Don't you remember anything?

42
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,570
Should I remember anything?

43
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,049
What's wrong with you? Have you lost your memory?

44
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:40,650
In front of me, you don't have to pretend to be a good mistress.

45
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,190
Isn't this exactly what you wanted?

46
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,390
Governor, what are you talking about?

47
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,869
Either way, she is my maid.

48
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,470
She's no longer your maid.

49
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,090
I want her, so she is mine now.

50
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,589
Governor, this isn't a good idea, is it?

51
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,929
- Look…
- I am the governor of Jiangcheng.

52
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:03,430
I want one of your maids.

53
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,590
Do I really need to show you respect?

54
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,669
Yes...

55
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:15,190
No. Of course not.

56
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,910
Uncle.

57
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,870
Tingyao is my fiancée.

58
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,830
I hope you'll show her some respect.

59
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,850
It's because she's your fiancée, that I'll spare her life.

60
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,070
Otherwise...

61
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,090
do you think she would have a chance to stand here and talk to me?

62
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,190
The Dong family perished overnight,

63
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,890
and suddenly, someone came saying she was your fiancée.

64
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,049
Aren't you curious if it's the truth or not?

65
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:51,290
You just left it all to your grandmother to judge, is that right?

66
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,190
Our marriage needs to be decided only by my grandmother.

67
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,509
The person whom my grandmother recognizes is my wife.

68
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:06,389
The difference between you and me is that I cherish my woman.

69
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,650
Unlike you. You have an engagement with Miss Ji.

70
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,269
But you keep her waiting, wasting her youth away.

71
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,270
Now that she's awake, she doesn't have to stay here anymore.

72
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,090
Ms. Chen.

73
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,370
Grandmother… Please don't…

74
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,549
Who are you?

75
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,331
Come over here.

76
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,310
Let me go!

77
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,509
Don't think you can stay here!

78
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:27,649
Let me go!

79
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:28,571
Stop!

80
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,510
Let me go!

81
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,270
Tianyi.

82
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,910
What are you doing?

83
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,710
Mother, her injuries haven't healed.

84
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,149
She really shouldn't move.

85
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,850
Please allow her to recuperate in my room.

86
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,550
Countries have their laws. Families have their rules.

87
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,590
Maids are not allowed to enter the east building,

88
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,050
not to mention in your bedroom.

89
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,990
Now that I've slept with her, she's my woman.

90
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,610
Of course, she should stay in my room.

91
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,170
Uncle, she's Tingyao's maid.

92
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,749
Tingyao should take her back and take care of her.

93
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:10,089
Have I not been clear enough?

94
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:13,469
All right. I'll say it again.

95
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,070
Mother, please inform everyone in the mansion.

96
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,049
She is my woman. From today onward, she'll only take orders from me.

97
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:28,470
Except for me, no one is allowed to touch her!

98
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,770
What if I don't agree with this?

99
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,570
Please forgive me for being unfilial.

100
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,370
Tianyi.

101
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,929
Ever since you were a child, you've never rebelled against me.

102
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,450
Today, you won't listen to me all because of

103
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,770
this unknown woman, is that right?

104
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,150
Mother, I've made up my mind. I hope you can fulfill my wish.

105
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:17,949
<i>As long as I stay at the Fang mansion, I'll have an opportunity to find proof of his crime.</i>

106
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,690
You'll stay here in the future. Through this door is my bedroom.

107
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,090
Now that you're mine, let's talk about the rules.

108
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,490
First, from now on, I'm your Master.

109
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,090
Respect me. Don't talk back.

110
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,690
The moment I need something, you must be on call.

111
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,869
Second, obey my orders unconditionally.

112
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,710
No resistance is allowed.

113
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,490
Third, if someone bullies you, tell me immediately.

114
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,410
Why should I tell you?

115
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,110
I'll kill them.

116
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,150
Do you understand what I just said?

117
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,650
But I don't know my name yet. Is my name Yan'er?

118
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,870
How could such a vulgar name be worthy of you?

119
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,890
Since I've acknowledged you publicly today, how about I give you a new name?

120
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,550
From today, you are called Muti.

121
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,030
A lad would like to woo a lass with nice and pretty looks.

122
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,030
"A lad would like to woo a lass with nice and pretty looks"?

123
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,149
Madam, please try this.

124
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,469
My father just brought it back from Shanghai.

125
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:29,749
I know you don't like sweets. I have tried this before.

126
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:34,329
It's not that sweet. It's perfect when paired with your tea.

127
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,300
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

128
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,190
I really don't understand what the governor is thinking.

129
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,730
He has such a wonderful fiancée, and yet, he prefers that girl.

130
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,690
Tingyao, what do you mean?

131
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,130
There's a new maid in the mansion.

132
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,050
I don't know why, but the governor insisted on acknowledging her in public.

133
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,230
This tastes really good.

134
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,590
Greetings, Governor.

135
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,649
Tianyi! You're back!

136
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,590
This is…

137
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,010
My maid.

138
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,950
I've been waiting for you all afternoon.

139
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,689
Madam was tired, so Miss Dong accompanied her back to her room.

140
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,549
It's been a long time. Do you miss me?

141
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,170
Governor, if there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

142
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,810
Go on.

143
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,370
Why... did you suddenly become upset?

144
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,790
This afternoon, I was chatting with Madam.

145
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,790
She wants us to get married next month.

146
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,570
It's a bit of a rush, but…

147
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,789
It is indeed... rushed.

148
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,310
That's not what I meant. It's indeed in a rush,

149
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,230
but we've been engaged for so long already.

150
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,310
Now that Madam has mentioned it, why don't we get married sooner?

151
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,610
It'll also reassure the two families.

152
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,590
I don't want to get married right now, especially to you.

153
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,690
My mother set the engagement, not me.

154
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,069
Fang Tianyi! How can you say that?!

155
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,109
Anyway, I'm the lady of the Ji family.

156
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:13,150
Everyone in Jiangcheng knows I'm your fiancée.

157
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,790
If you reject the marriage,

158
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,250
how am I supposed to stay in Jiangcheng?

159
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,189
It's not like I started rejecting you right now.

160
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:23,130
I told you from the beginning I didn't agree with it.

161
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,610
It was your own wishful thinking.

162
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,210
So... how you'll stay here is your own business.

163
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,790
I…

164
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,910
I'm tired. I'll have Lieutenant Liu send you home.

165
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,770
Tianyi!

166
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,569
<i>While Fang Tianyi is away, I have to find proof of his crime.</i>

167
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,670
<i>He values that key so much.</i>

168
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,690
<i>He even carries it into the bath.</i>

169
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,690
<i>That must be the key to something important.</i>

170
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,430
<i>Looks like I have to find a way to get that key first.</i>

171
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,389
<i>Governor, Madam wants to see you.</i>

172
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,910
Mother.

173
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,630
Kneel down!

174
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,930
Mingyue came crying and complaining,

175
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,950
saying you want to break off your engagement.

176
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,870
I'm not breaking it off.

177
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,150
I never agreed to it from the beginning.

178
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,010
Nonsense!

179
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,430
Have your forgotten how your father died back then?

180
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,230
Have you forgotten? You swore at your father's grave to avenge him.

181
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,850
Today, your position as the governor hasn't been secured.

182
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,429
We need to rely on the influence and financial resources of the Ji family,

183
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:41,940
only this way can we help the Fang family grow!

184
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,690
If you do this, how is our Fang family supposed to get a foothold?

185
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,250
In front of your father's memorial tablet,

186
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,890
you tell me,

187
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,950
are you worthy of the Fang family?

188
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,770
You don't have to use father's death to control me.

189
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,390
There isn't a moment I forget it.

190
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,129
But I don't think our family can only prosper through marriage and an exchange of benefits.

191
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:18,730
Mother, if you believe that I'm just a pawn to be exchanged for financial resources

192
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,130
for the Fang family, then leave the position to Yuze.

193
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,490
I can leave the Fang family immediately.

194
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,430
Look at you! You've really been fooled by that woman!

195
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,049
You don't have to involve her.

196
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:42,990
This thing has nothing to do with her.

197
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,830
Tianyi,

198
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,490
if you really like that girl, after you marry Mingyue,

199
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,190
I'll make her your concubine.

200
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,749
As for Mingyue, I'll persuade her.

201
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,610
"Concubine?"

202
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,829
Yes.

203
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,570
Mother, if I really like a girl, I will marry her legally.

204
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,090
I won't let the woman I love be wronged.

205
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,430
Please excuse me.

206
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,410
<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

207
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,210
Governor, sorry, I went into the wrong room. I'll go back.

208
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,730
Do you want to go? It's not that easy.

209
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,870
Now that you're here, it's not up to you.

210
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,730
Governor, if you do this, I'll shout.

211
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,469
Tell me, what are you doing in my room in the middle of the night?

212
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,270
If you don't tell me…

213
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,030
Come on. Shoot here.

214
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,349
Shoot. Kill me, and you'll be free.

215
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,849
How about you behave and kiss me?

216
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,230
Then I'll teach you how to shoot.

217
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,350
<i>She pretended to lose her memory?</i>

218
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,049
It's so late. Why are you still out here?

219
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,410
I went into the wrong room.

220
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,290
Did my uncle do this?

221
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,590
Come with me.

222
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,289
- Let me.
- Young Master.

223
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,189
This isn't right. At this late hour, if anyone else sees us…

224
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,050
It's already red and swollen.

225
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,589
If it's not treated in time, there might be after-effects.

226
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,290
That day, in front of Uncle and Grandmother,

227
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,729
I couldn't speak up for you. I'm sorry.

228
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,249
You're a filial person and also affectionate.

229
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:56,270
I understand.

230
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,430
I know you're my uncle's woman now.

231
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,650
My uncle has always had a bad temper.

232
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,170
My grandmother once sent maids to look after him.

233
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,210
But he drove them all away.

234
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,890
When you're interacting with him, just be careful.

235
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,470
Done.

236
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,550
Thank you, Young Master.

237
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,090
I heard that my uncle gave you a new name.

238
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,910
He calls me Muti.

239
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,850
"Muti."

240
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,610
"A lad would like to woo a lass with nice and pretty looks."

241
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,550
You've had to suffer.

242
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,049
If my uncle bullies you again, just tell me.

243
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,010
I'll protect you.

244
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,230
Did you get it?

245
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,970
Three full packets.

246
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,589
Remember what I told you?

247
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:27,490
You can rest assured, but...

248
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,870
If it's brought to light...

249
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,350
I won't expose you.

250
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,449
If it weren't for you, my gambling debts would never have been paid.

251
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:37,470
I'll never forget your kindness, never.

252
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,890
I'll reward you more after everything is done.

253
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,829
If I can get a foothold in the Fang family,

254
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,650
I definitely won't treat you poorly.

255
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,669
All right. Then I'll be going.

256
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,730
<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

257
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,410
Why are you hitting me?

258
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,890
Muti!

259
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:15,630
You offended your master, bewitched the governor, and intended to murder him!

260
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,889
Today, we must beat her to death

261
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,030
to avoid any further trouble!

262
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,890
I didn't...

263
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,730
Wait a moment.

264
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,310
Grandmother, Muti is my uncle's woman after all.

265
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,089
He isn't home today,

266
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,150
but you know his temper.

267
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,030
Right now, the marriage between our family and the Ji family is still being discussed.

268
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,129
If she is beaten to death and Uncle gets mad,

269
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:41,970
it won't be easy to deal with.

270
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,350
Young Master is right.

271
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,649
Even though she's a maid,

272
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,430
even if she's committed a crime, we can't offend her either.

273
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,689
Madam, don't end up in a conflict with the governor because of her.

274
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:58,570
She's just a little maid.

275
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,050
Am I not allowed to make a decision here?

276
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,349
Why are you all standing there?

277
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:04,950
Beat her to death and then drag her out!

278
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,570
I didn't do it...

279
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,070
I didn't!

280
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,870
<i>The governor is home!</i>

281
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,070
Mother, what's going on here?

282
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,189
Ms. Chen, you tell him.

283
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,370
This man is the new caretaker, named A'Li.

284
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,789
The servants saw him sneaking around in front of the east building.

285
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:06,589
They thought it was strange, so they grabbed and interrogated him.

286
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:10,610
They found several packets of arsenic on him!

287
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,950
Then…

288
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,970
Keep going.

289
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,370
Servants quickly arrested him.

290
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,729
According to him, it was Muti who asked him to buy the arsenic.

291
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:26,320
She planned to add it to the soup you always have at night.

292
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,380
That said, do you have proof?

293
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,120
On A'Li, we found a pair of gold earrings from Muti.

294
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
He said that's the bonus Muti gave him.

295
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,039
I didn't... Those earrings were gone the other day.

296
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,400
Did you... Did you steal them?

297
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,539
She is shrewd and a liar. Vile and despicable!

298
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,820
Such a woman like her must be killed!

299
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,400
I told you before. She's mine, I'll handle it.

300
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,240
Tianyi!

301
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,920
Mother, I know I need to listen to you,

302
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,939
but the evidence is inadequate.

303
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:12,339
How about this? Leave this man to me.

304
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,920
I'll find out the truth and give you an explanation.

305
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,640
But today, regardless of whether Muti did this or not,

306
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,960
I must take her away. No one can stop me.

307
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,439
Uncle, how can you talk to grandmother like that?

308
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,640
It looks like my words don't work anymore.

309
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,119
Don't touch me...

310
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,260
Don't move if you don't want to die.

311
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,840
Men and women aren't allowed to have physical contact...

312
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,240
It's such a simple concept...

313
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,160
You don't understand it?

314
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,919
How about you marry into my family as my wife?

315
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,520
How about it?

316
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,840
Governor, don't forget

317
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,260
you have a fiancée.

318
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,820
What? Are you jealous?

319
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,920
Governor, you're overthinking it.

320
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
Even if I wanted to marry into your family,

321
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,840
my husband would never be you.

322
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,199
It would be to marry the young master.

323
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:44,499
"The young master?" Stop dreaming!

324
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:48,299
You're my woman for the rest of your life. Now and in the future.

325
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,320
Stop thinking about escaping from me.
