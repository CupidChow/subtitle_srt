<i>[Episode 4]</i>

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,180
I like you.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,180
I want to marry you legally and be your young mistress.

5
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,920
I really never thought everything would be under your control.

6
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,100
Yan'er has been timid since childhood.

7
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,119
I know as long as I can scare her, she'll definitely run.

8
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,500
I was making a bet.

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,040
My evidence has already been destroyed.

10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,080
But even if my evidence wasn't destroyed,

11
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,800
she could also say I stole the jade pendant from her.

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,720
Actually, I wasn't certain I could prove myself.

13
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,440
It was her guilt that betrayed her.

14
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,840
Tingyao, you're really clever.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,820
Thank you for asking me for help.

16
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,260
And thank you for trying your best to come back to me.

<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,260
Grandmother.

19
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,240
I invited you and Uncle here

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,360
because there's a serious matter.

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,620
Madam, you must recognize this jade pendant.

22
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,620
It was a token of the engagement between the Fang and Dong families.

23
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,420
Although the jade pendant is broken, it was truly handed to me by my father before he died.

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,340
This jade pendant was found by me in the Governor's room.

25
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,060
Presumably, he knows best where it came from.

26
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:54,140
If you don't believe me, you can ask the Governor whether this jade pendant belongs to me.

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,020
The Governor isn't saying anything. That means he admits it.

28
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,860
Young Master, we caught her at the back door.

29
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,959
Bring her in!

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,260
Yes, Sir.

31
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,740
Let go of me! Let go of me!

32
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,480
Yan'er, where are you heading to in the middle of the night?

33
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,160
If you aren't guilty, you don't have to run, do you?

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,220
You used to be affectionate,

35
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,660
but now you're so heartless.

36
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,480
You really deserve your reputation.

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,560
Sure enough, you'll throw away a useless chess piece.

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,140
I was kind to you just because you were my fiancée.

39
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,320
But all this time, you've been deceiving the Fang family.

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,240
How am I supposed to show you mercy?

41
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,200
That's right!

42
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,520
I was pretending to be Miss Dong,

43
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,359
but I'm also a daughter of the Dong family!

44
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,599
Ever since I came here, I've kept out of trouble and have served the Madam with all due diligence.

45
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,220
What did I do wrong?

46
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,159
And her?

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,078
She knew who she was,

48
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,639
but she still seduced the Governor.

49
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,819
Who in this house doesn't know she climbed into your uncle's bed?

50
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:30,860
This kind of woman? Do you still think of her as a treasure?

51
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,360
You shut up!

52
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,839
If it weren't for you, how could I have accidentally become the Governor's maid?

53
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,800
What right do you have to say nonsense here?

54
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,760
Am I talking nonsense?

55
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,540
Madam, you saw it yourself.

56
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,160
She sleeps in the Governor's room day and night.

57
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,299
She even carried on with him again and again in front of people.

58
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,900
Isn't that true?

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,519
Your Fang Family really is great.

60
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,660
An uncle and his nephew fight over one woman…

61
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,760
Madam,

62
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,500
even if Yan'er did things in the wrong way,

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,160
she is still the only family I have left in this world.

64
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,699
Madam, please spare her life for the sake of the Dong family.

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,300
How about allowing her to live in the west room?

66
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,100
Somebody, drag her away!

67
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,620
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

68
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,000
Move.

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Grandmother, Tingyao…

70
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,319
Ms. Chen.

71
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,920
Here.

72
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:11,340
Clean up the east room where Dong Yan'er was staying,

73
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,580
so that Miss Dong can move in tonight.

74
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,120
Yes.

75
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,199
Now that Tingyao has recovered her identity,

76
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,659
I request Grandmother to pick an auspicious day and make the engagement ceremony.

77
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,020
Then we can also announce her identity to everyone.

78
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,700
It's getting late. Everybody is tired.

79
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,660
We'll talk about things later.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,399
Tingyao, don't worry.

81
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Now that you've already recovered your identity, our family will never treat you unfairly.

82
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,120
Stop drinking!

83
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,859
Give me the drink.

84
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:33,240
Is it worth tormenting yourself for such a woman?

85
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,499
You've done so much for her.

86
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:36,460
And she's going to marry that guy!

87
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,380
Give me the drink.

88
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,580
I really can't stand it.

89
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,980
That day, you got the news that the Dong family was in distress.

90
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,499
You rushed there without stopping.

91
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,999
You were almost killed by robbers on the road and lost time as a result.

92
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:52,000
You've often gotten hurt all because of her lately.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,580
And now she's treating you like this.

94
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,740
I'm going to talk to her right now!

95
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,280
I want her to know how stupid she is!

96
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,979
I can't stand that she betrayed your kindness!

97
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,520
Don't move!

98
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,360
But are you really willing?

99
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,020
Governor, please have some respect.

100
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm going to legally be your nephew's wife.

101
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,580
You don't hesitate in anything you do.

102
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,900
Which identity do you care more about,

103
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,580
Miss Dong or the Fang family's Young Mistress?

104
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,120
Both.

105
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,660
Anyway, I'm not your maid anymore.

106
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,000
I forbid you to marry him.

107
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,340
"You forbid?"

108
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,280
Why?

109
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,460
Everyone in the Fang household knows you're my woman.

110
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,120
A woman cannot marry two men.

111
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,480
Since you've given yourself to me before, your engagement naturally is over.

112
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,900
Governor,

113
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,200
other people may misunderstand us.

114
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,559
But you and I know very well nothing ever happened between us.

115
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,580
Please don't deceive yourself anymore.

116
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,380
In your opinion, there was never anything between us, right?

117
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,180
There was.

118
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,520
Only hatred.

119
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,220
This whole time, I never forgot the pain you brought me.

120
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,179
Every day I've been with you, I've wanted to kill you!

121
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:30,480
Do you really think that guy won't hurt you, is that right?

122
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
He's not like you!

123
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,720
I believe him. I like him, too.

124
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,740
This is more than just an arranged marriage.

125
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,380
A long time ago, I already had a crush on the Young Master.

126
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:50,240
Even if I die, I want to marry him rightfully and become the Fang family's Young Mistress.

127
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,400
Congrats on getting what you wanted.

128
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,440
From now on, you're no longer my maid.

129
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,240
I hope you can keep your word.

130
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,260
Hurry and eat.

131
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm sorry for all you suffered lately.

132
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,620
Taste it.

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,120
Grandmother, please help us make a decision about our wedding ceremony.

134
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,999
I didn't see you this excited about getting married before.

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,840
What's going on?

136
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,679
Didn't you just say it?

137
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,560
Tingyao has been wronged lately.

138
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,460
I also really like her.

139
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,699
And I want to marry her soon, treat her well and make her feel at ease.

140
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,960
Take it easy.

141
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,260
First, children respect their elders.

142
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,219
Your uncle is not married yet.

143
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:37,720
Second, there are a lot of rumors in the house right now.

144
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,060
We'll talk about it after they pass.

145
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,899
Grandmother, I don't care about these rumors.

146
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,799
Tingyao is my fiancée.

147
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,200
This has nothing to do with anyone.

148
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,119
What's more, I'm engaged to Tingyao.

149
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I will definitely marry her.

150
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm full. You all take your time.

151
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,980
Look at him. He won't even eat well.

152
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,960
Here, Grandmother.

153
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,040
Your Ladyship, will you agree to what the Young Master asked today?

154
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,520
This thing...

155
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,080
really is difficult to handle.

156
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,380
If they were just rumors, it would be fine.

157
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,740
But with Tianyi's character…

158
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,680
I really am afraid that they'll turn everything upside down because of this.

159
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,300
That said, Miss Dong is engaged to the Young Master.

160
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,819
The governor can't justify it no matter what.

161
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,120
If it gets out that

162
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,320
an uncle wants to steal his nephew's wife, the Fang family's reputation will be ruined.

163
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,960
Let me think about it.

164
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,999
Yes.

165
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,080
<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

166
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,580
Governor.

167
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,439
Are you sure you want to go? Get in the car.

168
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,160
Tingyao, don't worry. I'll do my best for you.

169
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,719
I'll definitely be good to you, I swear.

170
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:30,340
You don't have to swear. I just want you to be well.

171
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
Tingyao.

172
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,500
I have something to ask you.

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,520
What?

174
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,320
Do you know anything about the stuff inside your father's golden tortoise?

175
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,180
Was there something inside the golden tortoise?

176
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,660
My father never told me that before.

177
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,700
You don't know?

178
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,719
Yuze, do you know something?

179
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,160
Is that item important?

180
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
It's nothing.

181
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,119
It's just I discovered some new clues recently.

182
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,140
It might be related to your family's disaster.

183
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,819
But don't worry. I'll look into it.

184
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:26,440
Yuze, don't hide anything from me.

185
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,980
As long as I can avenge my family, I'll do anything.

186
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,340
Avenge your family?

187
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,240
Yuze, you and I are going to be married. I don't want to hide it from you.

188
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,880
I came to the Fang family because I wanted to avenge my family.

189
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,060
The day my family was destroyed, I saw your uncle break into my house with his people.

190
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,660
I suspect he's the one who destroyed my family.

191
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,200
Tingyao, are you sure about that?

192
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,939
I'm sure, but I can't kill him right now.

193
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,560
There's no evidence to bring him down, either.

194
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,660
Moreover, you said before no one could stop him.

195
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:21,080
If you could get his seal, then it'll be easy to take care of.

196
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Seal?

197
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,839
Although his position was directly appointed,

198
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,720
his army used to be my grandfather's subordinates.

199
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,279
As long as we get that seal, we can mobilize my uncle's army.

200
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,300
Where can I find this seal?

201
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,259
He has been keeping it carefully.

202
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:50,859
It is said that apart from his close men, no one else has ever seen it.

203
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,600
But Tingyao, rest assured.

204
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,380
You're my fiancée now. I'll definitely find a way to find it out.

205
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,660
What's wrong with the Governor?

206
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,800
Miss Dong. If you're sensible, say nothing about it.

207
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,240
Come here and help.

208
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,120
What are you doing here?

209
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,860
I…

210
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,480
I was hoping... to reconcile with you.

211
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,320
Reconcile with me?

212
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,380
Do you think that's necessary?

213
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,100
I'm going to marry the Young Master next month.

214
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,800
You are an elder.

215
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,200
I would rather have your acceptance and blessing.

216
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,340
Please have a good rest.

217
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,920
- Miss Dong.
- Lieutenant Liu.

218
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,460
What happened today?

219
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,599
We're soldiers. This will often happen.

220
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,199
Miss Dong, you don't need to worry.

221
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,459
We don't want the family to know, for fear that the Madam will worry.

222
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:26,320
But the Governor has a lot of subordinates, doesn't he?

223
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,479
Why would he risk his own life?

224
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,479
For something he cares about, the Governor will always personally go.

225
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,679
I heard the Governor has a seal that can control the army of the Fang family, doesn't he?

226
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,340
This is supposed to be a military secret.

227
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,979
Only the people in the mansion and several senior officers in the army know about it.

228
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,660
Where did you hear that?

229
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,620
I don't really remember.

230
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,000
It may be the Governor who let it slip.

231
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,220
After all, I've been by his side for so long.

232
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,620
I might have overheard it accidentally.

233
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,400
The governor does have such a seal.

234
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
If you want to know if he carries it…

235
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,200
You know he's a very careful person.

236
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,919
You've been eating and living with him.

237
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,020
You should know there are many secret boxes in his room.

238
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,840
Secret boxes?

239
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,300
If you don't know, then forget it.

240
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,260
I shouldn't have told you that much.

241
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,360
Miss Dong, it's getting late. Go back early and rest.

242
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,940
Governor.

243
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,460
What did she say?

244
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,600
She asked about the seal.

245
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,140
I think this was why she showed up here today.

246
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,760
What did you say?

247
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,440
I set a trap.

248
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,000
I imagine she'll be back again.

249
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,460
Governor, you risk your life for a woman like her. Is it worth it?

250
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,359
Lieutenant Liu.

251
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,439
Take the Governor away.

252
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,900
Yes, Sir.

253
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,879
Miss Dong, why are you still here so late?

254
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,960
I couldn't sleep, so I came outside to take a walk.

255
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,599
Where is the Governor going?

256
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,999
His wound was inflamed.

257
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,820
I asked them to take him to the hospital.

258
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,980
Miss Dong, about this…

259
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,280
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

260
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,939
Thank you, Miss Dong. I have to go now.

261
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:53,600
You do as you wish.

262
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,340
I don't know if you're satisfied with what you found.

263
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,959
I didn't expect you to break into a man's room in the middle of the night.

264
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,080
You always know everything.

265
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,240
You intentionally set a trap to fool me.

266
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,200
You've hated me for a long time,

267
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,619
but you came to make peace all of a sudden in the middle of the night.

268
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:14,220
You really didn't think your excuses were stupid and revealing?

269
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,340
Do you really think I'm stupid or you just don't care if I expose you?

270
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,720
If you don't believe it, I don't want to explain, either.

271
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,540
Let go!

272
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,040
These days,

273
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,539
you've always been with me just to destroy me.

274
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,440
You clearly always knew who I was, yet you forced me to be your maid.

275
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,120
Aren't you the one who kept me by your side?

276
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,340
You've always known I wanted to kill you.

277
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,740
Don't pretend that you didn't know it until now.

278
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,680
In your heart...

279
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,520
what kind of person am I exactly?

280
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,560
Capricious and disgusting.

281
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,280
No matter what you do, I will only hate you.

282
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,940
I do my best to protect you,

283
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,840
but you don't care at all.

284
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,980
That being the case,

285
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,020
I'll make you hate me more.

286
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,480
What are you doing? Let go of me!

287
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,999
You can't do this. Let go of me!

288
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,780
I'm your nephew's fiancée!

289
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,360
Didn't you want to see my seal?

290
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,220
This pigeon blood tattoo is my seal.

291
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,220
Only when I'm excited does it show.

292
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,620
What? Who told you about my seal?

293
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,480
Was it Fang Yuze?

294
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,600
He used you to steal the seal. Then I'll tell you right now.

295
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Even if you tell him about it, it's useless.

296
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,440
To mobilize the army, I have to go with the seal.

297
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,160
Even if it's like this,

298
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,580
you're still willing to be used against me, aren't you?

299
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,380
Yuze isn't like you. Despicable, shameless, and callous.

300
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm not being used by him.

301
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,380
He just told me about something that could destroy you.

302
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,599
I indeed want to take the Fang family back for Yuze, making sure you end up with nothing.

303
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,680
For him...

304
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,640
you can do anything, right?

305
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,320
Get out of my room.

306
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,100
I heard that the maid turned out to be the real Miss Dong.

307
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,240
You're very well-informed.

308
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,480
Now that she has recovered her identity,

309
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,140
she should be able to marry into your family very soon.

310
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,660
You didn't come to see me today

311
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,580
just to talk about my maid, did you?

312
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,920
I come here to solve problems for Madam Fang.

313
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,199
Your nephew is so anxious to hold the wedding, it's to the point of going crazy.

314
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,040
According to the Madam, children should respect their elders.

315
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,640
She wants us to get married before them.

316
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,260
She already talked to my mother yesterday.

317
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,159
I've been upset lately. I'm not in the mood to mess with you.

318
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,439
I know why you are upset. But I want to remind you,

319
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:42,260
you're the Governor.

320
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,700
You must never covet your nephew's wife.

321
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,400
Your family is already an empty shell.

322
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:56,820
If you lose this position, the Fang family will really be over.

323
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,039
If there is nothing else, please excuse me for not keeping you company.

324
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,500
You…

325
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,140
It's okay. I'll do it.

326
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,680
Tingyao, why do you look a bit unwell?

327
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,520
I may have gotten up too early this morning.

328
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,660
What are you doing in such a hurry?

329
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,279
The Ji family are coming to visit us tonight.

330
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,520
I have to finish my work first.

331
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,340
Then you go get back to work.

332
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,919
All right, I'll be going then.

333
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,999
Get some rest.

334
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,140
I'll come find you when I get back.

335
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,700
Yu…
