<i>[Maid's Revenge]</i>

2
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,420
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

3
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,410
That said, do you have proof?

4
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,080
On A'Li, we found a pair of gold earrings from Muti.

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,740
He said that's the bonus Muti gave him.

6
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,899
I didn't... Those earrings were gone the other day.

7
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,660
Did you... Did you steal them?

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,499
She is shrewd and a liar. Vile and despicable!

9
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:58,780
Such a woman like her must be killed!

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,360
I told you before. She's mine, I'll handle it.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
Tianyi!

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,180
Mother, I know I need to listen to you,

13
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,000
but the evidence is inadequate.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,399
How about this?

15
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,420
Leave this man to me.

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,780
I'll find out the truth and give you an explanation.

17
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,900
But today,

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,580
regardless of whether Muti did this or not,

19
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,320
I must take her away.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
No one can stop me.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,399
Uncle, how can you talk to grandmother like that?

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,700
It looks like my words don't work anymore.

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't touch me...

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,240
Don't move if you don't want to die.

25
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,759
Men and women aren't allowed to have physical contact...

26
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,140
It's such a simple concept...

27
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,939
You don't understand it?

28
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:28,319
How about you marry into my family as my wife? How about it?

29
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:34,720
Governor, don't forget... you have a fiancée.

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,899
What? Are you jealous?

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,799
Governor, you're overthinking it.

32
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,141
Even if I wanted to marry into your family,

33
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:48,741
my husband would never be you.

34
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:51,981
It would be to marry the young master.

35
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,381
"The young master?"

36
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,381
Stop dreaming!

37
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,781
You're my woman for the rest of your life.

38
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,100
Now and in the future.

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,900
Stop thinking about escaping from me.

40
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,880
I asked you to stay at home and behave. Why didn't you listen?

41
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,499
I'm not a bird in a cage.

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,999
Why can't I go out?

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,841
If you want to survive here, you have to be good and behave.

44
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,160
Then do you believe me?

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,719
We're so close.

46
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,700
We're inseparable.

47
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,161
If you wanted to kill me, you would've done it already.

48
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:48,019
Why use this roundabout and stupid method?

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,990
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,600
I was late.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,340
No need to apologize, Governor.

52
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm just a lowly maid.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,180
I can't bear it.

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,760
Unnecessary people, get out.

55
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,239
Governor, what are you doing?

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,540
The last time Muti got hurt,

57
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,500
I made it very clear to you.

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,960
Don't play tricks with me.

59
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,600
It looks like I wasn't clear enough.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,000
Today, I came to remind you again.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,860
Governor, I don't quite follow you. If I did something wrong…

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,100
Now, do you understand?

63
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,380
Governor, I'm the future young mistress of the Fang family.

64
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,239
Stop pulling that card.

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,780
Do you think I don't know

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,280
what kind of person you are?

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm warning you for the last time.

68
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,700
Muti is my woman. No one is allowed to touch her.

69
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,560
Do you understand this time?

70
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,200
I didn't hurt her. I really didn't.

71
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,420
Say it again.

72
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,920
Yes.

73
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,559
I was wrong.

74
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,760
I won't... I won't dare do it again.

75
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,400
I won't kill you. You better know where you went wrong.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,060
If Muti loses a single hair,

77
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,940
I'll cut your face.

78
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,940
We'll see how ugly you become,

79
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,840
- and if you'll still be able to marry into our family as a young mistress.
- No, no.

80
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,540
I-I understand.

81
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,019
Governor, the survivors brought back from the Dong mansion have been interrogated.

82
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,599
Their lips were sealed. They refuse to say anything.

83
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,959
Since they're useless, kill them.

84
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,400
Then do you want to tell Miss Dong?

85
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,160
The truth about the massacre of the Dongs' hasn't been found yet.

86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,540
Once she discovers I'm not her enemy,

87
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,119
she'll definitely go find the real killer.

88
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,119
The enemy is in the dark while she is in the light.

89
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,199
Some people know that she is Miss Dong.

90
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,040
She might be killed at any time.

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,079
Only if I keep her close to me,

92
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,060
can I protect her at all times.

93
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,980
So you become the enemy and suffer the grievances?

94
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,119
She'll find out sooner or later,

95
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,599
but not right now.

96
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,400
Consider it... my way of repaying Mr. Dong's kindness.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,320
Governor, your feelings for Miss Dong are more than that, isn't it?

98
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,320
I was too late to save her family that night.

99
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,820
I... don't want something like that to happen again.

100
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,160
Governor, everything is ready.

101
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,880
Take it.

102
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Why?

103
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm teaching you how to shoot.

104
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,599
I don't want to.

105
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,220
I don't want to learn how to shoot!

106
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,500
No! I don't learn how to shoot.

107
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,959
Do you know why you couldn't kill me that night?

108
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,320
Before you shoot, you have to first deactivate the safety lock.

109
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,300
Aim at the target in front of you.

110
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,360
Imagine it's the person you hate the most.

111
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,219
Let go!

112
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:58,320
Let go of me!

113
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,919
You demon!

114
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,620
Let go of me!

115
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,440
Align your muzzle in line with the target.

116
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,220
Aim.

117
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,160
Steady your breath.

118
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,420
Why?

119
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,940
Why are you doing this to me?

120
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,440
There are people everywhere who want to kill me.

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,559
You're with me. Naturally, you'll get in trouble.

122
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,840
Learn one more skill.

123
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,760
Even if I'm not around, you can still protect yourself.

124
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,660
Get up.

125
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,480
No! No!

126
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,500
No! No!

127
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,580
No!

128
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,700
Remember.

129
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,540
These people deserved to die.

130
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,240
You can never be soft when dealing with the wicked.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,059
You're the bad guy!

132
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,919
You're more evil than all of them!

133
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,580
You devil!

134
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,380
Governor!

135
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,399
- A'Cheng.
- Here.

136
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,939
- Send her home.
- Yes, Sir.

137
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,240
Governor, I was too impulsive.

138
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,819
I know. Don't be so impulsive next time.

139
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,840
Governor, why bother? At this point, you should tell her the truth.

140
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,179
These were convicted murderers set to be executed. They were the ones who killed the Dong family.

141
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:58,899
Although she doesn't know anything, she's already personally avenging her family.

142
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,900
Young Master, we found it.

143
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,820
<i>I heard that Mr. Dong has a treasure.</i>

144
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,439
<i>You always went in and out of his house. I wonder if you had the honor of seeing it.</i>

145
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,940
<i>It seems to have been a golden toad.</i>

146
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,099
<i>It's not a golden toad. It's a golden tortoise.</i>

147
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,240
It really is a tortoise.

148
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,780
<i>Where's the map inside?</i>

149
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,680
When you retreated from the Dong Mansion, you didn't find anything else useful?

150
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,620
That day the governor suddenly rushed in with a group of men.

151
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,219
Other people and I disguised as servants of the Dong family feigned death and finally escaped.

152
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:01,980
Before the police arrived, we conducted a thorough search, even Mr. Dong's body.

153
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,480
We were only concerned about the golden toad.

154
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,140
As for this golden tortoise, after you told us last time,

155
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,019
we snuck in at night and found it in Mr. Dong's study.

156
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,720
I see.

157
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,699
The Dong Mansion is being investigated now.

158
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,580
You must be careful.

159
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,320
Don't give yourself away.

160
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,760
Understood.

161
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,119
What is the Governor doing lately?

162
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,719
Lately, he only cares about that girl.

163
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,239
Nothing is really happening.

164
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,119
Those people he brought back last time have already been killed.

165
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,180
He... shouldn't have thought of us.

166
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,499
Have you looked into the thing that I told you to about last time?

167
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,300
I have asked about it.

168
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,079
Mr. Dong really does have another daughter from a concubine. She's called Yan'er.

169
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,199
But the Dong family followed strict rules. She has always been raised as a maid.

170
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:58,659
Her aunt is Miss Dong's nanny, but she died when the Dong family was destroyed.

171
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,240
You can go.

172
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,780
Yes, Young Master.

173
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,679
<i>It was hard to distinguish who was real or fake.</i>

174
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,380
<i>This tortoise helped me discern things, though.</i>

175
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,240
Miss Muti.

176
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,600
Good morning, Young Master.

177
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,660
You don't look too good.

178
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,260
It's nothing.

179
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,759
I just haven't been sleeping well lately. I always have nightmares.

180
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,520
Did my uncle bully you again?

181
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,200
I killed someone...

182
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,770
The governor forced me…

183
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:51,645
forced me to kill someone.

184
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,720
He actually forced you to do something like that.

185
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,440
I don't know why it was like that, either.

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,760
Young Master, why are your uncle and you so different in characters?

187
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,960
My uncle has always acted ruthlessly, so he has a lot of enemies.

188
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,700
He has killed so many people.

189
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,800
And no one has reported it to the government?

190
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,200
He is the governor of a city.

191
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,799
If he wants to kill someone, does he need a reason?

192
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,399
At best, the general gives him a talking to if he hears about it.

193
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,199
Unless…

194
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
He goes too far.

195
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
What's considered too far?

196
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,940
The slaughter of innocents?

197
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,000
What if he annihilated a family?

198
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,340
If it really is that, then that naturally would count.

199
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,720
But before he can be convicted, you have to have evidence.

200
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:56,560
Muti. If you're willing, I'll go talk to my grandmother and ask you to be my maid.

201
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,640
I don't want to be your maid.

202
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,640
Young Master, give me some time.

203
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,300
I'll get rid of the Governor on my own.

204
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,679
Yuze, I've been waiting for you. It turns out you're over here.

205
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,039
Miss Muti, you're the Governor's woman,

206
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,660
we can't afford to offend you.

207
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,319
You had better stay away from us.

208
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,640
Don't get us in trouble anymore.

209
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,400
- If you don't ask for it, you naturally won't find trouble.
- You…

210
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,860
All right.

211
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,760
Weren't you going to play chess?

212
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,240
Come, I'll keep you company.

213
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,120
Did you know how disrespectful you were just now/

214
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,139
I just wanted to remind you not to get entangled with the Governor's woman.

215
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,280
Remind me?

216
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,920
Do you think you're qualified?

217
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,180
What do you mean by that?

218
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,980
Did you do it?

219
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,519
I don't know what you're talking about.

220
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,280
If you don't want to talk, you don't have to.

221
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,420
But if that really was you, you had better stop.

222
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,120
Don't use such stupid and ignorant tricks.

223
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,219
I-I'm just afraid…

224
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,860
Just afraid you'll be replaced.

225
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm not a man who likes to pursue the truth.

226
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,740
Since my grandmother has acknowledged you, then you're my fiancée.

227
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,859
All you have to do is marry me and help me inherit the Dong family's property.

228
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:43,560
Don't do anything unnecessary to ruin my plans.

229
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,519
Since you acknowledge me, why do you save her over and over again?

230
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,999
It's a good thing to be confused.

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,460
But if you really were confused, then you really are stupid.

232
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,520
What if Madam doesn't acknowledge me, either?

233
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,580
That would be like this useless chess piece.

234
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,359
Put it away. That's all.

235
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,860
<i>Father… Father…</i>

236
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,940
<i>Before he can be convicted, you must have evidence.</i>

237
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,300
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

238
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,280
When facing my enemy, I cannot be soft-hearted.

239
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,820
Come in.

240
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,420
Governor.

241
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,520
What is it?

242
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,060
I have something for you.

243
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,580
This is for you.

244
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,320
What is this?

245
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,120
A safety amulet I made myself.

246
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,799
I heard you're going to fight.

247
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,240
I hope it can keep you safe.

248
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,900
You're really different today.

249
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,160
Why are you so gentle towards me?

250
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,179
You usually say I don't behave well and am often rude to you.

251
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,500
But today I'm nice and you're still not happy. If you don't want it, forget it.

252
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,420
I didn't say that.

253
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,599
You're my master. Who will protect me if you die?

254
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,500
Of course, I want you to be well.

255
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,119
Inside are magnolia flowers.

256
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,020
I want you to take it with you and always think of me.

257
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,820
Let me help you put it on.

258
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,299
Governor. You… You should go.

259
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,120
Wait for me to come back.

260
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,160
Governor.
<i>[Governor's Mansion of Jiangcheng]</i>

261
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Governor.

262
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,999
The situation has been very tense lately.

263
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,079
They might be making a move against us.

264
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,420
Has he made any movements anything lately?

265
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,459
He and his backers recently bought a batch of munitions from the black market.
<i>[File cover]</i>

266
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:10,219
They hid them in an arsenal in the eastern suburbs. I'll send someone to keep an eye on it.

267
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:12,939
Governor, you must be careful these days.

268
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,599
It looks like the Dong family was just his first step.

269
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,700
He probably can't wait anymore.

270
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,460
Don't worry.

271
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,660
I have a safety amulet.

272
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,160
<i>Take it…</i>

273
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,360
<i>Take it to the Governor's Mansion.</i>

274
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,800
<i>Go find Governor Fang…</i>

275
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,380
When did you get this?

276
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,220
When you carried me away from the Dong Mansion,

277
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,660
or when I was in your room?

278
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,660
You've always known who I was, but you didn't say anything.

279
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,020
You kept me by your side.

280
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,280
Played with me like I was a pet cat.

281
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,140
You caused me to be bullied. Are you proud of yourself?

282
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,840
It's true I don't want you to be Miss Dong.

283
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,120
Fang Tianyi!

284
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,779
What hatred do you have for me that you would do this to me?

285
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,020
I'm going to go prove my identity right now.

286
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,820
How are you going to do it now?

287
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,860
You're crazy!

288
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,279
You can't go!

289
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
You can't take back your identity as Miss Dong.

290
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,060
Someday you'll understand.

291
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,560
If you don't let me go,

292
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,420
I'll kill myself in front of you right now.

293
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,020
From now on, I'm no longer a maid at your disposal.

294
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,900
Dong Tingyao!

295
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,440
You scared me to death.

296
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,560
What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?

297
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,380
It's the middle of the night, but you're not sleeping and are in a man's room.

298
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,120
Is this the way a young lady should act?

299
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,040
What are you talking about?

300
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,760
I'm the future young mistress of the Fang family.

301
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,080
I came to see my fiancé. Is there a problem?

302
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,160
"Young Mistress?"

303
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,340
In front of me, are you qualified to say that?

304
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,440
Dong Yan'er?

305
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,260
Come with me.

306
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,140
When did you start remembering?

307
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,920
I never lost my memory.

308
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,819
Did you lie to me?

309
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:09,140
You're the same. Didn't you lie to the entire Fang family, too?

310
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,860
No one believed you back then.

311
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,260
Do you think anyone will believe you today?

312
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,980
I've been pretending for so long.

313
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,300
Since I came to you today, I must be confident.

314
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
What do you mean?

315
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,540
I've already found something that can prove who I am.

316
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,620
What's more, the Governor can also testify for me.

317
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,700
Today, I have a person's testimony and material evidence.

318
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,600
Do you think the family will believe the Governor or you?

319
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,380
Do you think I'll believe you?

320
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,219
Just because you say there's evidence, there is?

321
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,799
I'm going to see the Madam right now.

322
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,000
How dare you!

323
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,280
I advise you not to move.

324
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,200
I have been with the Governor for so long.

325
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,080
I'm not a little maid whom you can bully anymore.

326
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,960
But if I were you, I would run away immediately.

327
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,040
You've been here a long time.

328
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,680
How will the Fang family treat those who deceived them?

329
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,180
You know better than I do.

330
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,120
<i>Miss Muti.</i>

331
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,420
<i>Young Master.</i>

332
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,580
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

333
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,080
<i>I was waiting for you.</i>

334
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,979
<i>Waiting for me? Is there something wrong?</i>

335
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,940
<i>Young Master, do you really like the Young Mistress?</i>

336
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,320
<i>What if I said I like you more?</i>

337
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,500
<i>If it weren't for my uncle, I would ask my grandmother for you.</i>

338
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,000
<i>Treat you well and make sure you never suffer.</i>

339
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,160
Muti?

340
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,100
I'm not Muti.

341
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,880
Yuze, Yuze,

342
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,870
I like you.

343
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,099
I want to marry you legally and be your young mistress.

344
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,090
I really never thought everything would be under your control.

345
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,019
Yan'er has been timid since childhood.

346
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:14,999
I know as long as I can scare her, she'll definitely run.

347
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,319
I was making a bet.

348
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,000
My evidence has already been destroyed.

349
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,720
But even if my evidence wasn't destroyed, she could also say I stole the jade pendant from her.

350
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,600
Actually, I wasn't certain I could prove myself.

351
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,459
It was her guilt that betrayed her.

352
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,760
Tingyao, you're really clever.

353
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,640
Thank you for asking me for help.

354
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,180
And thank you for trying your best to come back to me.

356
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,680
Grandmother. I invited you and Uncle here because there's a serious matter.

357
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,540
Madam, you must recognize this jade pendant.

358
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,540
It was a token of the engagement between the Fang and Dong families.

359
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:28,340
Although the jade pendant is broken, it was truly handed to me by my father before he died.

360
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,260
This jade pendant was found by me in the Governor's room.

361
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,880
Presumably, he knows best where it came from.

362
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:45,060
If you don't believe me, you can ask the Governor whether this jade pendant belongs to me.

363
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:53,134
The Governor isn't saying anything. That means he admits it.
