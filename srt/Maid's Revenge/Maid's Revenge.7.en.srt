What? Do you remember everything?

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,500
Yes, I remember it all.

9
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,000
Perhaps I should forget it, though.

10
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,020
What happened?

11
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,060
You asking me here

12
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,860
isn't because of an appointment from fifteen years ago?

13
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,060
So you've always remembered the appointment.

14
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,100
That being the case,

15
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,360
why did you do this to me?

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Why did you kill my entire family?

17
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,760
Take a look yourself.

18
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,860
This is your letter to the warlord of Rongcheng.

19
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,279
It describes your plan to destroy the Dong family in detail.

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,580
I've been with you for so long.

21
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,880
I know your handwriting and this seal.

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,120
How do you want to justify it?

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,640
You've always been lying to me.

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,260
You said before that you would always believe me.

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,359
Just because of an inexplicable letter,

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,960
you've lost all your previous trust in me, right?

27
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,680
Trust in you?

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,440
Let me be honest with you.

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
I never...

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,300
never trusted you.

31
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,540
I've been using you all along.

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,580
I got close to you...

33
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,180
I took care of you...

34
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,360
I healed you...

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,560
I did all this to kill you one day.

36
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,700
You taught me

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,800
not to be soft-hearted when facing my enemy.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,460
I will say it again now.

39
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,920
I never did this.

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,220
Do you believe me?

41
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,160
Since that's the case,

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,480
then you can... choose to kill me now.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,460
Now... are you satisfied?

44
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,900
Don't be soft-hearted...

45
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
when facing your enemy.

46
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,420

50
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,500
- Don't...
- Governor! Governor!

51
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,700
Get away! Governor.

52
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,439
Dong Tingyao, I'm going to kill you!

53
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,521
L-Let her go.

54
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:45,800
You're already like this, yet you still protect her.

55
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
What a heartless woman!

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,400
How the Governor treats you? Can't you tell?

57
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,541
Why are you so ungrateful?

58
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,681
- Dong Tingyao, I…
- Stop talking.

59
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:56,040

Good morning, Madam.

93
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,719
Where is Tianyi? Not eating breakfast again?

94
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,040
I'll go find someone to ask him.

95
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,319
Madam.

96
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
The Governor asked me to tell you he needs to recuperate because of the war.

97
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
He won't be leaving his room for a while.

98
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,799
I'll bring him his meals every day.

99
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,580
His room doesn't have to be cleaned either.

100
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,320
I'll take care of it.

101
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,880
He has always recuperated in his side residence.

102
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Is he not going this time?

103
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,900
He has something to deal with here.

104
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,079
I understand.

105
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,840
Also, the Governor asked me to tell you he'll marry Miss Ji next month.

106
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,800
Please rest assured.

107
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,399
Did Tianyi... really say that?

108
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,380
Yes, he has made up his mind.

109
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,180
Good. Good.

110
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,700
Let him recuperate well.

111
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,720
He doesn't have to worry about the wedding.

112
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,060
I'll take care of it for him.

113
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,540
Okay.

114
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,300
Yan'er.

115
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,860
I've always wanted to kill him.

116
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,540
And now I have gotten revenge.

117
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,780
But when that knife entered his body,

118
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,780
it was like my heart had been stabbed, too.

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yan'er, what should I do?

120
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,140
I think I like him.

121
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,960
I don't know when it started.

122
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,300
Whenever I see something's happened to him, I get anxious.

123
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,140
Hearing he is going to marry someone else,

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,420
made me feel so bad.

125
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,460
Next month…

126
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,600
Next month, I will marry Yuze.

127
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,160
While he will marry another woman.

130
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,279
I…

131
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,399
If there is nothing else, please go back.

132
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,500
This isn't a place where you should be.

133
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,680
I want to see the Governor.

134
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,060
But he doesn't want to see you.

135
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,479
Is he... all right?

136
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,260
What?

137
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,020
Do you want to stab him again?

138
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,720
You don't have to treat me like that.

139
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,439
He killed my entire family.

140
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,000
Even if I killed him, what would be wrong with that?

141
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,860
What is wrong with that?

142
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,359
All right, let me ask you something.

143
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,359
What makes you think it was the Governor who killed your family?

144
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:31,140
Just based on that strange letter that somehow came to you?

145
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,379
You don't even know who wrote it and you believed it.

146
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,119
You undid everything that the Governor did for you.

147
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
It's not just that.

148
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,199
That day I saw him break into my manor with his people.

149
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,000
He killed my nanny in front of me.

150
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,040
Ever since I came to the Governor's Mansion,

151
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,900
I've watched him kill people as he pleases.

152
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,199
Torturing me over and over again.

153
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,059
He is domineering with me and forced me to kill again and again.

154
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,719
Are none of these true?

155
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,840
That being the case, then why did you come here and pretend to be concerned about him?

156
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,319
Or in your heart, that's not really what you think.

157
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,120
It's just that you don't want to admit your mistake.

158
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,640
I…

159
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,780
All along, I've only wanted to know the truth.

160
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,640
But none of you are willing to tell me.

161
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,979
Now someone has told me the truth.

162
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:27,420
And you are accusing me.

163
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,359
Fine.

164
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,300
It's gone this far already, I don't want to hide it anymore.

165
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,460
Do you want to know the truth?

166
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,600
All right. Follow me.

167
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,640
I'll tell you.

168
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,679
That day, the governor received a secret report, saying someone wanted to harm the Dong family.

169
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,800
He immediately dispatched troops to support.

170
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,960
As a result, he was ambushed on the way.

171
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
He finally arrived at the Dong manor

172
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,240
and found dead bodies everywhere.

173
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,959
The Governor had us search for survivors.

174
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,620
First, if any of the Dong family were still alive, we could protect them.

175
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,280
Second, we could arrest those in involved in the plan to destroy the Dong family and find the truth.

176
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,780
No.

177
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,860
I don't believe it.

178
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,460
If that was the case, why did he kill my nanny?

179
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,920
That's because your nanny tried to kill you to silence you.

180
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,399
If it weren't for the Governor, you would have been dead.

181
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,100
None of those people who were brought back was part of the Dong family.

182
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,380
Unfortunately, they were all well-trained soldiers.

183
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,000
Their lips were sealed.

184
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,159
The Governor failed to get more information from them.

185
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,500
So he let you kill them.

186
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,180
Let me...

187
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,319
Yes.

188
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,720
The Governor never kills innocent people.

189
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,280
Didn't you want to get revenge?

190
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,900
He helped you fulfill it.

191
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,120
Those people you were forced to kill are all enemies who exterminated your family.

192
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,660
If that's true, how do you explain the letter then?

193
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,599
I couldn't have mistaken his handwriting.

194
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,460
And that seal can't be fake!

195
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,600
Dong Tingyao. What exactly does the Governor like about you?

196
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,639
Use your brain, think about it!

197
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,200
What kind of person is he?

198
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,620
He's the Governor of a city.

199
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,539
If he did it, how could he allow someone to get something so confidential and deliver it to you?

200
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,700
How could this be?

201
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,180
You're lying to me.

202
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,860
You are saying that the one I swore vengeance against isn't my enemy?

203
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,980
I've told you everything already.

204
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,980
I don't care if you believe me or not.

205
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,600
But Dong Tingyao, I beg you, stop lying to yourself.

206
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,460
I want to see the Governor!

207
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,639
I want him to tell me himself.

208
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,439
What else do you want him to tell you?

209
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,939
I beg you, let him go. Don't hurt him again!

210
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,580
Please, let me see him just once.

211
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,520
Please.

212
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,959
That day, in front of Madam Fang, there was something I didn't say.

213
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,760
The Governor wanted me tell you.

214
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,099
Since each of you is going to get married, then keep to your duty.

215
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:14,600
From now on, there's nothing between you two.

216
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,300
Why?

217
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,680
Why is God so cruel?

218
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,500
Making me hurt the person I love with my own hands.

219
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,260
Why?

220
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,300
Why?

221
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,960
Miss Dong, I told you several times already.

222
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,318
The Governor won't see you.

223
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,399
It's no use standing here every day.

224
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,060
If someone else sees you, it's going to cause a hell of a mess again.

225
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,959
If Madam Fang knows you stabbed her favorite son,

226
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,839
let's see if you can still marry into this family and become the young mistress.

227
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,040
I don't care.

228
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,039
I don't want to be the young mistress right now.

229
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,519
Why do this?

230
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,359
The governor will be married in a few days.

231
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,459
Even if you don't want to be the young mistress, don't ruin his wedding.

232
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,079
Haven't you harmed him badly enough?

233
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,860
Why?

234
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,519
Why didn't he ever tell me?

235
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,920
That's because he was afraid someone would hurt you.

236
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,880
The closer you get to the truth, the more dangerous it becomes for you.

237
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,280
That's why he kept quiet.

238
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,759
Lately, the Governor has always been secretly investigating the truth about your family's destrution.

239
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,260
He even ignored his own safety to do it.

240
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:17,179
In order to confirm the secret weapons that killed the Dong family, he snuck into the arsenal and got shot.

241
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,999
You've been with him for so long.

242
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,960
You should know his temperament.

243
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,240
So, he always kept me by his side,

244
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,700
forced me to kill people and gave me a dagger,

245
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,300
all to protect me.

246
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,480
You finally know.

247
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,619
The dagger that he gave you to protect yourself with is a relic Master left him.

248
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:48,600
But he never thought you would use it to stab him in the heart.

249
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,200
He must hate me now.

250
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,300
Miss Dong, what's already happened,

251
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,540
can't be undone.

252
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,200
Please go back.

253
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,400
Please... pass this on to the Governor.

254
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,400
I will definitely find out who wrote the letter and make it clear.

255
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,660
Miss Dong, what can I do for you?

256
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,539
Ms. Chen. Who gave you the letter that you gave me the other day?

257
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,960
I don't really know either.

258
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,480
Someone put it in the gatehouse.

259
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,940
Yuze?

260
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,260
<i>[File cover]</i>

261
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,220
Tingyao?

262
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,020
What brings you here?

263
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,240
Madam asked us to come discuss the wedding.

264
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,580
I didn't mean to read it.

265
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,860
It's all right.

266
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,720
They're just some business accounts. It doesn't matter if you read it.

267
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,220
Madam, look.

268
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,600
They are made in the style of the royal family.

269
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,879
The invitations are all written, right?

270
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,820
The Governor and Young Master have both written them.

271
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,699
Two happy events have come to our family.

272
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:54,960
It'll cause a sensation in the whole city!

273
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,179
The formal attire has also been ordered.

274
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,720
We'll try them on together in a few days.

275
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,539
Tingyao. Why do you look sick lately? And you've lost a lot of weight.

276
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:11,000
It's been hot recently. I don't have much of an appetite.

277
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,219
That's not good. You're so thin.

278
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:15,960
It won't look good in a wedding dress.

279
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,839
It won't be long before you become the young mistress of the Fang family.

280
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,579
You have to nourish your body and carry on the family lineage soon.

281
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,920
Yes.

282
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,860
Madam, you can't be partial to her.

283
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,540
I'm going to carry on the family lineage for the Fang family, too.

284
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,200
Mingyue, you've come.

285
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,139
You're discussing our wedding. Of course, I have to be here.

286
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:44,239
Besides, I haven't seen Tianyi in a long time.

287
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,650
Tianyi. You have been recuperating, but why do you still look sick?

288
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,130
Has Lieutenant Liu not been taking good care of you?

289
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,860
Mother, I've had a lot of work to do, so I haven't gotten enough rest.

290
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,939
Miss Dong, we're going to be a family soon.

291
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:08,259
How about we let bygones be bygones?

292
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,479
Miss Ji, you've made it sound too serious.

293
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,139
You're my elder.

294
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,379
Tianyi, help me try this on.

295
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,159
Okay.

296
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,560
Does it look nice?

297
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,300
It does.

298
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,980
Yan'er.

299
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,100
I feel so sad.

300
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,060
Today he was right in front of me, but I felt like he was so far away from me.

301
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,600
I really want to keep him.

302
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,080
But... it's too late.

303
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,619
You can't marry the young master!

304
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:14,900
- You can't marry the young master!
- Yan'er.

305
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,959
- Don't marry him!
- Yan'er!

306
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,220
Yan'er, calm down!

307
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,159
It's all right. I won't.

308
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,460
Yan'er, calm down.

309
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,919
- Don't marry the young master.
- Yan'er, it's alright. It's alright.

310
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,900
It's alright. I won't.

311
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,220
But I can't refuse right now.

312
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,080
There's still somethings I need to figure out.

313
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,160
I'm the young mistress.

314
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,239
I'm the young mistress. I'm the young mistress!

315
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,240
You can't marry the young master. You can't marry the young master...

316
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,640
I'm the young mistress.

Why don't you go inside?

324

I don't want some people to be in our way.

Tingyao, you look gorgeous today.

326
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,320
Here.

327
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,300
Let me put it on for you.

328
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,320
I can't wait to see you at the wedding.

329

Miss Ji, are you satisfied with this wedding dress?

Tianyi. Tianyi!

331
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,080
Do you think it needs to be a little tighter here?

332
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,440
Oh. I think it's fine.

333
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm done trying them on.

334
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,319
Grandmother picked quite a few dresses.

335
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,160
Don't you want to try more of them?

336
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,660
No need. I'm going to get changed.

337
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,220
All right.

338
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,999
Are you okay?

339
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,020
I'm fine.

340
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,799
Thank you, Governor.

341
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,520

How are you doing?

344
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm good.

345
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,100
Governor, do you really want to marry Miss Ji?

346
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,740
What do you think?

347
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,540
Can you not marry Miss Ji?

"You don't want me to"?

352

When I asked you repeatedly not to marry that guy,

353
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,800
how did you answer me?

354
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,820
Dong Tingyao, you are too selfish.

355
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,160
I'm not your plaything.

00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,160
Dong Tingyao.

357
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,660
This man is mine now.

358
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,040
Please stay away from him.

359
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,880
Let's go.

360
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,999
♫ <i>The tune ends, the audience disperses</i> ♫

361
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,420
♫ <i>The geese fly away and no longer return</i> ♫

362
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,140
♫ <i>Look at wisps of smoke</i> ♫

363
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,500
♫ <i>Watch the fishing boat in the evening</i> ♫

364
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,380
♫ <i>It never ends</i> ♫

365
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,500
♫ <i>People meet and part ways</i> ♫

366
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,199
♫ <i>Time goes by</i> ♫

367
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,180
♫ <i>What is unchanged</i> ♫

368
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,919
♫ <i>But a fleeting cloud</i> ♫

369
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,420
♫ <i>Grudges and grievances</i> ♫

370
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,660
♫ <i>It takes all my lifetime</i> ♫

371
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,100
♫ <i>Make vows of eternal love</i> ♫

372
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,780
♫ <i>Everything ends up with a sigh</i> ♫

373
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,920
♫ <i>Destiny is uncertain</i> ♫

374
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,260
♫ <i>Heaven and earth are boundless, but it's hard</i> ♫

375
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,660
♫ <i>To have me here</i> ♫

376
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,420
♫ <i>Sadness and joy always make me cry</i> ♫

377
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,580
♫ <i>Love and hate will inevitably be puzzled</i> ♫

378
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,640
♫ <i>Speechless or sleepless</i> ♫

379
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,200
♫ <i>Whose wish can come true</i> ♫
