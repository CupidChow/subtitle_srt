00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,180
But a candid camera?

186
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,890
This is a witch hunt.

187
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,100
Sir.

188
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,860
I'm not doing this
over one broken arm.

189
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,240
(October 24, 8 a.m.)

190
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,120
He jumped out of nowhere.

191
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,750
I followed the speed limit.

192
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,250
And there was no crosswalk.

193
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,920
Do you know what he said

194
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,630
after what he's done?

195
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,380
You look fine.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

196
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,590
Did you just say fine?

197
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,050
Hey, this car.

198
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,510
And this porcelain.

199
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,180
So you want $100,000
in return?

200
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,060
For this porcelain?

201
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,310
It's not just a porcelain.

202
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,980
It was Moon Porcelain
by Artist Lee Eun-sang.

203
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,360
Oh, the bone.

204
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,230
The bone will heal over time,
but that's...

205
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,740
- When's the perpetrator arriving?
- He'll be here soon.

206
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,240
Mr. Joo Jung-gi.

207
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,530
Thanks for your testimony today.

208
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,280
I'll talk to the perpetrator
about it later.

209
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,080
Bye for now.

210
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,040
Prosecutor Seo.

211
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,460
Even if he appeals to pity,

212
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,750
- don't forget.
- Mr. Joo.

213
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,750
- Or I'll be dead.
- You can go now.

214
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,420
- Please.
- I heard you.

215
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,670
- Bye.
- Bye.

216
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,550
But the perpetrator wouldn't do
such thing.

217
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,260
That diner is pretty famous
in the area.

218
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,350
Lee Kyung-hak?

219
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,850
Is the food that good?

220
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,020
Sir.

221
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,400
If you don't mind,
can I take a look at the file?

222
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,400
Sure.

223
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,070
I have no money to give you.

224
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,570
Did you just hit me?

225
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,900
What's going on?

226
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,740
Hit me again in front of everyone.

227
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,620
I barely pushed him.

228
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,290
Your car and the porcelain.
They're all a scam, aren't they?

229
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,880
I think we need an insider.

230
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,590
For a free ride?

231
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,210
Are you sure he's reliable?

232
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,630
The chief prosecutor is
paying attention to this case.

233
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,930
Both you and I have to be careful.

234
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,260
You know I'm good.

235
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,060
Breaking the car and porcelain
wasn't enough, are you hitting me?

236
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,140
- Here.
- Did I break your porcelain?

237
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,640
Do you have the evidence?
Bring me the evidence.

238
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,730
What's going on?

239
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,520
It's nothing serious.
It's just a car accident.

240
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,530
It's not. Do you know
how much that porcelain's worth?

241
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,910
He always likes to cause a ruckus.

242
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,700
People will think this hallway is
where the accident occurred.

243
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,370
I'll take care of it quickly.

244
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,370
Did you receive the case?

245
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,830
Did you send it to him?

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,580
Keep up the good work.

247
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,300
Why did you have to do that to the
porcelain and cause this ruckus?

248
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,340
What did I do?
I'm the victim here.

249
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,130
- Aren't you coming?
- I am.

250
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,680
Watch your mouth.

251
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,970
Prosecutor Seo, you need to add
assault to his--

252
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,060
Damn it.

253
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,730
Disturbance and nuisance
in the public office.

254
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,140
Both of you.

255
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,280
You may begin.

256
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,550
I told you to speak.
Why are you so quiet?

257
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,260
You looked like you had
so much to say earlier.

258
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,510
I'm

259
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,140
sorry. I admit it.

260
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,430
That settles it.

261
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
But

262
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,730
how did I know he had
something so expensive in his car?

263
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,150
Even if there was nothing,
you shouldn't jump into the road.

264
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,570
It wasn't a crosswalk.

265
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,110
It's 100 percent your fault.

266
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,950
Are you telling me to pay him
$100,000?

267
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,570
You should've made an effort
to resolve it.

268
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,870
'I can't pay you.
It's your fault.'

269
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,790
That will only upset him
even more and make things worse.

270
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,950
Sir.

271
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,960
I barely make a living every day.

272
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,540
He drives a fancy car
and buys fancy stuff.

273
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,090
You should be on my side at least.

274
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,460
Look.

275
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,760
If you want anyone on your side,
get yourself an attorney.

276
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
You think it's okay to blow up 100
million if he drives a fancy car?

277
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,600
You think your money is precious,
but not for others?

278
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,850
Are you sure that porcelain is
really worth $100,000?

279
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,810
Who knows if he broke it somewhere
else and blamed it on me?

280
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,020
Who are you trying to frame here?

281
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,820
Who's at fault here?

282
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,780
The police got the appraisal
statement from the gallery

283
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,110
and confirmed it was authentic.

284
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,700
The victim purchased it
just an hour before the accident.

285
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,700
He didn't break it anywhere else.

286
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,120
Don't you

287
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,250
think about saying that
to the victim, okay?

288
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,290
- What then?
- Do you want to work it off?

289
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,920
- How?
- Go to prison.

290
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,040
Are you crazy? Why would I...

291
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,840
If you can't work it off
or pay him,

292
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,420
what do you want to do?

293
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Then

294
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,840
what about those old people?

295
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
How many old people
do you have at home?

296
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,810
My customers.

297
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,110
(Happiness Diner)

298
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,950
(Be happy with $1)

299
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,570
I charge $1 for a meal.

300
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,950
The food may look humble,

301
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,250
but I make everything myself.

302
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,790
So that I can give them more.

303
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,500
If I hire anyone,
I can never afford it.

304
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,750
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

305
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
- See you.
- Bye.

306
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,550
To keep that price,
I have no time to sleep.

307
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,420
To save every cost,

308
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,300
I've been attending
the morning market

309
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,090
every Tuesday
for how many years now.

310
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,080
- Are you okay?
- Move.

311
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,290
Shoot.

312
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,250
Damn it!

313
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,800
No!

314
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,010
Hey. How are you going to
make up for that?

315
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,470
Why did you jump out of nowhere?

316
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,050
This is crazy.

317
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,060
You got money?
How are you going to pay for it?

318
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,610
$1 for $10's worth of happiness.

319
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,780
Happiness Diner that protects
the neglected people.

320
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,360
That's what most articles said.

321
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,200
Mr. Lee Kyung-hak's...

322
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,580
I mean, the perpetrator's diner

323
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,040
almost received
the Minister's award,

324
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,830
but one article said
he refused it.

325
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,000
The Minister?

326
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,790
He refused all TV show offers.

327
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,580
Why refuse TV...

328
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,760
He's still a perpetrator.

329
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,050
And the victim is firm.

330
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,260
What are you doing?

331
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,720
Okay.

332
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,600
This could be real good.

333
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,070
But he's the perpetrator.

334
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,690
Keep up the good work.

335
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,320
Why did you have to do that to the
porcelain and cause this ruckus?

336
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,530
What did I do?
I'm the victim here.

337
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,240
'Do that?'

338
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,540
What did he do?

339
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,210
That pain in the ass.

340
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,050
I thought you were
buying me coffee.

341
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Isn't it brilliant?

342
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,720
No one gets you the vending
machine coffee aside from me.

343
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,900
About the Happiness Diner
incident.

344
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,150
Was that yours at first?

345
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,110
There's no yours or mine.

346
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,650
I'm busy dealing
with drug dealers.

347
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,910
Kiss my ass.

348
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,200
But I think it's weird.

349
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,700
Why did he take
such an expensive porcelain

350
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,580
like that?

351
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,000
Why didn't he do that?

352
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,720
Something funny in there?

353
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,390
Prosecutor Seo.

354
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,010
It's not wrong to be ignorant.

355
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,020
If I were him, I would've gotten
it delivered. It's expensive.

356
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,230
Don't be like that.

357
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,570
It's okay to ask your junior
if you're not competent.

358
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,400
I did.

359
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,780
And you answered my question.

360
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,450
If I asked you straight up,

361
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
would you have answered me?

362
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,500
Change your attitude depending
on who you're dealing with.

363
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,590
For example, our boss.

364
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,670
She hates cheap lip service.

365
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,800
Some don't know that's him.

366
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,430
- Prosecutor Seo, you're...
- Prosecutor Seo.

367
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,150
I found that expensive artworks
are normally delivered,

368
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,650
so I printed it for you.

369
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,530
That way,
the insurance is applied...

370
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,200
- Hey, Sung Si-woon.
- Yes.

371
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,200
Did you think I didn't know
about the special delivery?

372
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,330
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,750
Want a piece of advice?

374
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,330
These days, the wobbling poppy
gets cut down,

375
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,380
not the tall poppy. Got it?

376
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,670
What?

377
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,840
What are you doing?

378
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,300
Okay.

379
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,680
He should've told me earlier.

380
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,790
(Silver Theater)

381
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,230
Not sure when they'll be
moving yet?

382
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,570
We can't move without a supply.

383
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,110
If you're avoiding the answer
on purpose,

384
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,450
you'll be the first to go down.

385
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,870
If I was going to avoid it,

386
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,790
you think I would've called you
in the first place?

387
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,560
Look at this.

388
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,480
It expressed the quality of lights
in an extreme way.

389
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,780
That's right.

390
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,070
The artist said

391
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
he was inspired by impressionism.

392
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,160
Impressionism.

393
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,830
(PARK YEONG HYI,
'God bless you', $54,000)

394
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Wow.

395
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,340
This

396
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,510
calms me down.

397
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,050
It feels

398
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,100
somewhat lonely though.

399
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,770
What an insight.

400
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,600
The artist expressed
hope and happiness

401
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,770
comes from his children
despite the loss of his wife

402
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,820
by painting layers.

403
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,860
Is this still available
for purchase?

404
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,960
Here is the contract.

405
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,500
The price is 54,000 dollars.

406
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,170
That is equivalent
to 71,000,000 won.

407
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,710
Can I take the artwork
with me right away?

408
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,510
I'm sorry, but artworks are

409
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,970
affected by the environment,

410
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,760
and due to the damage risk,

411
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,760
is it okay for us to deliver it?

412
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,600
You're well aware
of the damage risk

413
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,480
while moving.

414
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,610
Even a single painting is moved
like treasure.

415
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,860
I'm sure you care more
for porcelain?

416
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,230
Of course.

417
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,280
On October 24, Joo Jung-gi
purchased

418
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,490
Moon Porcelain by Lee Eun Sang
from this gallery.

419
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,700
Why wasn't it delivered
via special logistics service?

420
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,660
Pardon me?

421
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,290
Do you want to sign the--

422
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,000
Why did you tell your regular

423
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,500
to take the artwork that was
worth $100,000 himself?

424
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,710
What if it breaks?

425
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,300
We'd never tell him
to take it himself.

426
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,470
Mr. Joo Jung-gi requested

427
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,470
to take it himself that day.

428
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,260
That day?
What about his previous purchases?

429
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,980
We delivered everything else
via special logistics service.

430
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,560
But he signed the contract
that he wouldn't blame us

431
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,020
for any damage on Moon Porcelain.

432
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,070
You can ask him yourself.

433
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,710
It's not that I refused
the special delivery.

434
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,630
It wasn't that far anyway.

435
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,300
It was a hassle.

436
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,630
If that was a hassle,

437
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,800
how did you receive all the other
ones via delivery before that?

438
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,850
You've always been thorough,
but you happened to be

439
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,220
stubborn that day
and got into an accident.

440
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,930
What a coincidence.

441
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
I'll tell you everything
since you're a prosecutor.

442
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,980
Actually

443
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,900
I'm a lawyer.

444
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,860
We're called lawyers,
but you know,

445
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,950
we're basically businessmen.

446
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,330
It's all about serving customers
and finding a good connection.

447
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,750
You don't need to worry
about it

448
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,540
because you're a public official.

449
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,630
I do this to win their favor.

450
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,510
I should give it to them
in person.

451
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,930
Who goes through a delivery?

452
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,300
Who were you trying to give it to?

453
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,390
I'm not obligated
to tell you that.

454
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,980
It's nothing against the law.

455
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I didn't get to deliver it anyway.

456
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,940
Anyway,

457
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,940
what are you doing here?

458
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,400
Do you think I got into
an accident on purpose?

459
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,700
I was here to see the arts.

460
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,490
Come on.

461
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,200
I lost faith in my customer,
lost my money,

462
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,370
and that wasn't enough,

463
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,000
my prosecutor is suspecting me?

464
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,380
If you have time for that,

465
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,670
go tell that jerk to pay me,
please.

466
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Sir.

467
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,500
About the new prosecutor
in charge.

468
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,460
Did he smell it too?

469
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,300
Not that, but he keeps
getting on my nerves.

470
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,010
His name is Seo Dong-jae
from Criminal Department 1.

471
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,050
(Ehong Construction)

472
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,760
- I know him.
- You do?

473
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,350
I'll handle him.

474
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,690
Focus on your job.

475
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,860
(Happiness Diner)

476
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,990
No food today.

477
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,370
No water.

478
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,660
But I'm hungry.

479
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,620
If you get no water, no food.

480
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,960
Why aren't you

481
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,840
open today?

482
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,510
You need to work to pay me back.

483
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,860
Are you inside?

484
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,570
He tried to kill me.

485
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,910
Don't come any closer.

486
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,870
Do you know who I am?

487
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,530
- Mr. Joo Jung-gi.
- You'll regret it.

488
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,740
You'll regret it big time.

489
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Kiss my ass.

490
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,630
What happened?

491
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,590
It's been out since this morning.

492
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,140
I'm already upset to send
old people back home.

493
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,680
Why did he have to
get on my nerves?

494
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,230
What? The water outage?

495
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,310
Is it out for the whole area?

496
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,690
I'm not sure.

497
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,400
There are only a few places left.

498
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,820
Not easy running a business, huh?

499
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,990
Especially for you.

500
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,660
Still, I owe this place.

501
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,500
Everyone else left

502
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,340
because of their landlords.

503
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,300
You see my wife.

504
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,510
She supported everyone in need
around here.

505
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,510
But she's gone now.

506
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,930
She got sick
of the smell of the rice

507
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,310
- and left me.
- Oh, no.

508
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,650
I should've quit back then.

509
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,690
But

510
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,360
people kept coming.

511
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,070
What could I do?
They were asking me for food.

512
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,240
I decided to do it
for just one more day,

513
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
and here I am.

514
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,120
Right.

515
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,290
Just one more day.

516
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,670
And that continued until today.

517
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,800
You're probably not here
for a meal.

518
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,260
I've thought about it.

519
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,510
You should settle.

520
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,180
Sir.

521
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,060
That jerk insisted
on driving a fancy car

522
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,190
while his car's getting fixed.

523
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,610
So I'm paying for the rental.

524
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,910
And you're telling me to pay him?

525
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,990
Still,

526
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,950
it's better than wasting
your precious money every day...

527
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,830
Or

528
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,910
how about going on TV?

529
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,370
As a kind diner?

530
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,750
No, just as how you look
right now.

531
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,210
If you talk on TV

532
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,380
and solve a quiz,

533
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,340
you'll get a lot of sponsors.

534
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,340
Forget it.

535
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,850
You wish.

536
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,520
Hello?

537
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,650
Oh, yes.

538
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,070
Right. My investigator called you.

539
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,940
Yes.

540
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,240
It's Happiness Diner
in Jangsung-dong.

541
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,820
The water is out.

542
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,280
He's unable to open.

543
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,330
Please hurry up.

544
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,750
Tomorrow morning?

545
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,210
Thank you.

546
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,250
Bye.

547
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,420
Who was that?

548
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,050
The Water Revenue Bureau.

549
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,720
If you called them,
it would've taken days.

550
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,140
But they're coming tomorrow.

551
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,310
They said it must be something
about the drain.

552
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,060
- Is it in the yard?
- Dra...

553
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,600
What drain?

554
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,320
It's been fine for decades.

555
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,490
This occurred
because it's decades old.

556
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,700
Anyway,

557
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,610
what do you say about going on TV?

558
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,780
I said no!

559
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,200
Going to the police station
and the prosecutor's office

560
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,620
was enough for me.

561
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,380
Sir?

562
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,050
If you're too shy to be on TV,
alone, I'll join you.

563
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
Sir?

564
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,170
Sir?

565
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,350
Should I buy a grinder?

566
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,900
I should've ground it a long ago.

567
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,530
Why is he refusing to be on TV?

568
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,120
Geez, he's not helpful at all.

569
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,330
Geez.

570
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,160
I'm going.

571
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,580
Hey.

572
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,800
What a temper.

573
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,800
Huh? 3975.

574
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,300
Hey, the porcelain accident.

575
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,260
- I have the file--
- Still working on it?

576
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,220
What was the license plate number?

577
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,020
300 D 3975.

578
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,140
300 D 3975.

579
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,860
Right.

580
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,780
He almost ran into me
at 8:02 a.m..

581
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,660
But the accident--

582
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,580
The accident occurred
at 8:10 a.m..

583
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,040
It took place in the same spot.

584
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,420
That's in front
of Happiness Diner.

585
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,210
He went around in a circle
for 8 minutes.

586
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,840
Hey, check the surveillance camera
before the accident occurred.

587
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,140
I'm on it.

588
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,600
(Happiness Diner)

589
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,980
Hold on.

590
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,860
(Conference Hall)

591
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,450
Ma'am.

592
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,500
Wait.

593
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,880
It's a new kind of ecstasy
called Purple.

594
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It began spreading fast
about a year or two ago

595
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,550
and disappeared recently.

596
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,590
Did they smell it?

597
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,760
No, it's a simple supply issue.

598
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,180
Not because they were worried
about us.

599
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,890
How are you sure?

600
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,980
Ma'am.

601
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,650
Remember Happiness Diner?
The good price diner?

602
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,940
Are you still holding onto that?

603
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,360
It's just a simple accident.
Make them settle.

604
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,070
It wasn't an accident.

605
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,990
It's a case.

606
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Something came out?

607
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,700
Oh, no. I found it.

608
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,080
- I found it.
- So what did you find?

609
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,750
I'll tell you when it's certain.

610
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,890
Did you find a free rider?

611
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,390
Is someone on a free ride?

612
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,720
Oh, yes.

613
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,350
It's not that there seems
to be a supply issue,

614
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,600
but declare that it is
a supply issue.

615
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,230
To see you certain after a while,

616
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,030
your informant must be reliable.

617
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,610
You've seen too many movies.

618
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,360
Have you ever been in charge
of a drug case before?

619
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,700
Why not?

620
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,580
Violence, gang, drug

621
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,410
are my specialty.

622
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,580
Sure.

623
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,590
'Sure.' You'll see.

624
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,340
3975.

625
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,340
Oh, 3975. Right here.

626
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,520
- Thank you.
- Yes.

627
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,190
I boasted it to everyone.

628
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,650
It's got to be there.

629
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,280
(Recent)

630
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,150
Yes.

631
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,780
(Recent Destination,
Happiness Diner)

632
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,950
What am I doing here?

633
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
Sit down.

634
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,100
- Mr. Joo Jung-gi.
- Yes?

635
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,400
Why did you leave the fine car
in the body shop?

636
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,280
What? My car?

637
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,070
What do you mean?

638
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,990
It was all dented
when I hit the guardrail,

639
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,030
and the tow truck towed it
in the scene.

640
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,740
You haven't driven that car
since the accident

641
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,410
on October 24, have you?

642
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,700
No.

643
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,580
Okay.

644
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,460
Watch this.

645
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,590
1, 2, 3.

646
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,800
Do you recognize your car?

647
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,810
What about it?

648
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,520
It's not illegal to take
the right turn and no accident.

649
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,100
No problem.

650
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,900
I know. What's the problem?

651
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,030
The same road 4 minutes later.

652
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,360
8:06 a.m..

653
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,450
Then 4 minutes later at 8:10 a.m..

654
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,330
What does that mean?

655
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,620
It means you circled the road

656
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,460
for 8 minutes.

657
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,540
Oh.

658
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,800
Because I was lost.

659
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,130
It was my first time going there.

660
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,720
You later testified to him

661
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,600
that you were on your way
to deliver a gift.

662
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,220
- He did.
- Oh, yes.

663
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,560
I was, but it was my first time
going there.

664
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,690
Was it

665
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,110
the owner of Happiness Diner

666
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,650
you were trying to deliver
the gift to?

667
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,780
The final destination in your GPS
just before the accident

668
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,280
was Happiness Diner.

669
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:18,410
(The day of the accident)

670
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,330
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

671
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,420
You knew he unloads
the ingredients he bought

672
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,790
from the morning market
at the same time every Tuesday.

673
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,340
So you waited for your chance and

674
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
boom.

675
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,010
What? I can't even stop by
at a diner

676
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,890
on my way to deliver
the porcelain?

677
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,260
Mr. Joo Jung-gi.

678
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,720
This is a fraud.

679
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,430
And an aggressive deception.

680
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,190
Fraud, my ass. I'm the victim.

681
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,320
If this is how you want it,

682
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,440
I'm taking it to court.

683
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,740
Go ahead. So I can conduct
an official investigation.

684
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,910
Prosecutor Seo.

685
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,990
Now,

686
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,120
it's up to you.

687
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,580
A smooth settlement
with the diner owner

688
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,960
or stand

689
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,000
against the prosecutors.

690
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,970
In fact, I've witnessed it myself.

691
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,510
What?

692
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,760
You almost got into an accident
while waiting for your chance.

693
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,600
The car that was going straight.

694
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,020
That was me.

695
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,730
What are you...

696
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,110
Think carefully.

697
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,330
Prosecutor Seo.

698
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,000
You're absolutely amazing.

699
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,960
The way you cornered him.

700
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,670
I really want to learn it.

701
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,000
It's been so long

702
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,300
since I've been
a temperamental senior.

703
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,590
I'd forgotten about it

704
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,010
surrounded by juniors
that showed no reactions.

705
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
(Boss)

706
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,770
Yes, boss.

707
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,730
Now?

708
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,690
Yes.

709
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,810
Sure. Yes.

710
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,040
Ma'am.

711
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,710
It's me.

712
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,980
You had a guest.

713
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,860
You seem drunk.

714
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,110
Are you okay?

715
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,780
Oh, shoot.

716
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,150
My head.

717
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,910
You look good.

718
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,120
Oh, ma'am.

719
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,740
Ma'am, you should lie down.

720
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,790
Or are you

721
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,250
paying less attention than before?

722
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh.

723
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,590
You don't have my new
business card.

724
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,090
Not your old one either.

725
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,390
I'm from Ehong Construction.

726
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,560
(Ehong Construction,
Nam Wan-seong)

727
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,680
How do you know my boss?

728
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,900
You know what happens
when you run a business.

729
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,690
Don't act like it's anything new.

730
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,650
(Ehong Construction,
Nam Wan-seong)

731
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,040
Don't waste your energy
on a mere car accident.

732
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,670
That diner will shut down anyway.

733
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,220
And we'll no longer be
some rural construction company.

734
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,890
(VIP CARD, Ehong Construction)

735
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,640
What's the limit?

736
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,190
How much do you expect?

737
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,900
When the diner soon shuts down,

738
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,980
you'll no longer be
some rural construction company?

739
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,400
I can't wait.

740
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,650
I knew you'd understand.

741
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,530
I didn't touch anything here.

742
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,580
We can talk about
the good old days with this--

743
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,160
So what if it has no limit?

744
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,700
It's expired.

745
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,750
I wouldn't give you
what's expired.

746
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,420
This is old-fashioned.

747
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,960
This is from a decade ago.

748
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,590
Is this how you still play?

749
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,550
Sorry for being old-fashioned.

750
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,930
Please let off your steam

751
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,390
and take it as delicious dinner
with your old brother.

752
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,230
I'll see you tomorrow, ma'am.

753
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,950
Shoot. It never dies away.

754
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,700
What did your wife say?
Did she like it?

755
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,920
Who is it today?

756
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,790
I don't play a round
with just anyone.

757
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,880
He's my good old friend.

758
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,500
You can't take more than 10 steps

759
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,960
without stepping on his land
in Chungcheong Province.

760
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,630
He has no issues or anything.

761
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,090
I just wanted to show off
with you next to me.

762
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,140
You're nothing without boasting.

763
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,020
Help me show off, will you?

764
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,100
I don't know if I'm any good.

765
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,190
You're here.

766
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,020
This is Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae
I've told you about.

767
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,730
Hi.

768
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,610
I've heard a lot about you.

769
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,190
My name is Nam Wan-seong.

770
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,280
Did you drop my name again?

771
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,490
You have a good friend.

772
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:03,170
So? What's the trend these days?

773
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,930
How do they serve you these days?

774
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,470
I'm darn curious.

775
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,560
Forget about serving me.

776
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,060
Why are you doing that
to Happiness Diner?

777
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,270
Do you have a grudge against him?

778
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,770
Now we're talking.

779
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,030
Were you pretending earlier
in front of your boss?

780
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,410
It's the profound secret.

781
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,780
Guess who told me the secret.

782
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,910
My boss?

783
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,750
Legislation, jurisdiction,
and administration.

784
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:39,120
For businessmen,

785
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,630
secrets bring them money,
and that money

786
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,500
comes from the legislation.

787
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,260
- The national assembly?
- Do you want to go?

788
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,420
To where?

789
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,550
To the national assembly.

790
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,180
I can send you there.

791
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,640
Whatever.

792
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,850
Because I'm going to redevelop
that area.

793
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,430
The diner site.

794
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,600
No one knows that yet.
No one should.

795
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,730
Because I'm going to buy
everything.

796
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,900
But

797
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,400
that poor old man won't sell
his house.

798
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:09,780
No matter how much I offered.

799
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,030
He refused it to death.

800
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,620
I wondered if he heard something.

801
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,460
You talk too much now.

802
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,500
You had no guts to open
your mouth in front of me before.

803
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,840
Because of that single place,

804
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,970
it's causing me a great loss.

805
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:31,840
Get off my car.

806
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:35,140
I can make billions easy
once it gets redeveloped.

807
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,810
The national assembly
isn't 'whatever.'

808
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,600
You think the jurisdiction is?

809
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:40,770
You want me to show you?

810
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,520
Ms. Jeon!

811
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,110
Why do you think
you got that case?

812
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,240
Afraid of the stubborn junior
smelling it,

813
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,570
Ms. Jeon sent it

814
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,070
to the biggest softie.

815
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,530
But

816
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,870
she got backstabbed
by the soft axe.

817
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,960
Since when did
Cheongju Prosecutors' Office

818
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,580
have so many sharp talents?

819
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:06,090
I'm about to get disappointed
in Ms. Jeon.

820
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,630
That won't do anything good
to her.

821
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,550
Go deal with her yourself.

822
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,560
How did I meet Ms. Jeon?

823
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,230
By paying her!

824
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,940
If I just run my mouth...

825
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,940
I'm not taking it for free.

826
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,030
I'll pay him a lot of sum for it.

827
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,950
Only if

828
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,580
you help me buy that house,

829
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,790
Ms. Jeon wouldn't neglect you.

830
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,290
The same goes for me.

831
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,340
Then we will all be

832
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,960
happy, right?

833
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,380
Your boss will be happy.

834
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,010
I'll be happy.

835
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,930
You'll be happy.

836
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,390
And that old man will
be happy too.

837
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,850
Good shot.

838
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,730
Dive in for a good shot, will you?

839
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,150
That lunatic.

840
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,380
Because I'm going to redevelop
that area. The diner site.

841
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,510
I can make billions easy
once it gets redeveloped.

842
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,130
I'm not taking it for free.

843
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,010
I'll pay him a lot of sum for it.

844
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,850
Only if you help me
buy that house,

845
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,350
Ms. Jeon wouldn't neglect you.

846
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,640
Are you still holding onto that?

847
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,850
It's just a simple accident.
Make them settle.

848
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,530
(Happiness Diner)

849
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,200
Did he go home?

850
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,210
I have to do what I have to do.

851
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,970
Huh?

852
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,180
Why is he fixing it when
the water bureau is coming?

853
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,310
I knew he was too nice.

854
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,990
Sorry about that.

855
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,030
But

856
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:03,070
you asked for it.

857
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,780
Why did you call
the Water Revenue Bureau?

858
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,960
No one can hear you.

859
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,750
I told you everyone moved out.

860
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,710
You don't need to pay him.
It wasn't a car accident.

861
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:54,580
It was a fraud.

862
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,340
The victim caused the accident
on purpose.

863
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,920
But who's going to resolve it
without me?

864
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,590
You can't help but fall for it.

865
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,760
Look, prosecutor.

866
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,260
Why do I need to resolve anything?
What's the purpose of this?

867
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,680
Are you taking off?

868
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,220
You think that will be
the end of it?

869
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,350
All that sneer and insult
you suffered from the victim.

870
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,180
You think you can forget that?

871
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,190
He had no idea about who you were.

872
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,350
You need to teach him a lesson.

873
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,940
- I'll kill him too.
- Why didn't you?

874
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,150
You could've, but why not?

875
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,320
Because you were stuck.

876
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,610
The whole world knows
about the ruckus Joo Jung-gi made.

877
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,610
If you kill him now,
you'll go straight to prison.

878
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,780
But there is a way
to get back at him

879
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,910
without killing him.
So why bother?

880
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,950
I have evidence.

881
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,370
Let's put him in prison for good
with fraud.

882
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,290
Aren't you curious?

883
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,330
That porcelain was really worth
$100,000.

884
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,590
What matters is why he did it.

885
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:50,260
Well...

886
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,930
Yes.

887
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,180
- Whatever.
- What?

888
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,850
No, sir.

889
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,440
Where are you going to go
with this?

890
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,900
Are you going to work
your ass off somewhere again?

891
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,650
The office knows that I'm here.

892
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,700
Are you going to wander around
with no home at that age?

893
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,490
If you worked your ass off
running a diner against your will,

894
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,990
you should be compensated.

895
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,330
I can help you hit a jackpot.

896
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,500
I'll help you make billions.

897
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,920
That's what I'm here for.

898
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,380
I'll make you a billionaire.
