(Cheongju Prosecution Service)

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,920
What did Im Yu-ri ask you to do?

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,170
It's true that Gyeo-rye
brought the bag.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,470
It was caught in the camera.
We cannot deny it.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
She asked me to check
the men's restroom.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,260
She knew where the bag was
in which men's restroom slot.

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,890
She couldn't go in,

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,310
so she asked you to bring it.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,730
Because she couldn't go in,
she asked me to get it for her.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,230
What did she ask you to get
for her?

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
The bag inside the last stall.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,280
She asked me to get that for her.

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,990
Did you do as she said?

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,580
Did you pick it up
and give it to her?

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,410
Yes.

18
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,250
- You mean this?
- Yes.

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,510
When was the next time
you saw it again?

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,380
I never saw it again.

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,720
That little...

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,220
Then was the last time you saw it
at the terminal?

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,060
That was the last time.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,850
After she took it,
I never saw it again.

25
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,770
The bag Im Yu-ri took was

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,570
found in her house
after her death.

27
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,360
To be exact, it was found
in her room.

28
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,910
That's strange.

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,990
Even if you were friends,

30
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,160
when she asked you
to pick up something

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,960
a stranger left
in the men's restroom,

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,000
didn't you think that was strange?

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,380
I knew it was strange.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,500
So I opened it in front of her
and asked what it was.

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,880
Then she got angry.

36
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,050
Your friend asked for a favor.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,640
You didn't know what it was,
yet you still did it for her.

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,680
You were shocked to see
what was inside, so you tried to

39
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,270
put it back,
but Yu-ri stopped you.

40
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,930
Did Ms. Im Yu-ri get mad at you?

41
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,480
Yes.

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
She quickly closed the bag

43
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,650
and urged you to leave.

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,110
Yet you wanted to return it...

45
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,820
I told her we shouldn't,

46
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,610
so I tried to return it.

47
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,030
Then the owner of the bag
showed up.

48
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,280
I was too scared
to give it back to him.

49
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,700
Until you opened the bag
in front of Im Yu-ri,

50
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,870
were you aware of what was inside?

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,830
You had no idea what it was.

52
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,050
No. I didn't open it until then.

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,590
When you opened it,
what was inside?

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,340
Pills.

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,890
There were a lot of small pills.

56
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,180
That is all.

57
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,820
Please take a look
at Ms. Im Yu-ri here.

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,240
While the defendant went
to the restroom,

59
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,080
she was by herself.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,410
She was looking at her phone

61
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,830
like anyone her age would.

62
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,170
Do you think
she'd stare at her phone

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,000
nonchalantly

64
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,920
after asking him to get her drugs?

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,590
Just like how the defendant is
underage,

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,930
so was the victim.

67
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,640
She must've been
nervous and scared.

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,390
Does the girl in the video look
like she's trying to steal drugs?

69
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm sorry,
but may I say something?

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,020
No, ignore him.

71
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,980
His speculation
of her staring at her phone

72
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,530
proves that she was innocent

73
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,610
is only a mere speculation.

74
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,990
Above all, if she was innocent
for looking at her phone,

75
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,660
for the same reason,

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,750
that action is closely related
to the crime.

77
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,000
No, ignore him, Si-woon.

78
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,920
- How does that work?
- Damn it. He fell for it.

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,130
What if she was looking
at her drug deals?

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,930
Because drugs would be
in her hands soon.

81
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,970
What if she was checking
the orders?

82
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,930
Isn't that also a speculation?

83
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,440
It's already been approved

84
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,940
that Im Yu-ri received orders
via online messenger

85
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,150
and sold drugs.

86
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,280
No?

87
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,740
Did Im Yu-ri sell drugs or not?

88
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,750
She did.

89
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,250
Yes.

90
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,670
I agree that this could lead

91
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,710
to various interpretations.

92
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,340
Speaking of which,

93
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,840
do you have ways to check
what she was watching on her phone

94
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,640
in that moment?

95
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,060
Was it caught
on a surveillance camera?

96
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
No.

97
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,690
The prosecutor's argument
that an underaged victim

98
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,740
wouldn't just stare at her phone

99
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,240
while trying to steal drugs

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,820
contradicts

101
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,910
involved party's testimony.

102
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,870
Your honor.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,040
To confirm that,

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,330
I request a witness who argues
to trade drugs with Im Yu-ri

105
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,250
for a long time.

106
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,380
A witness?

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
Is your witness here?

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,800
Yes.

109
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,340
We'll take 10 before
the witness attends the trial.

110
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,890
The defendant may return
to his seat.

111
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Park Chan-hyuk?

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,050
(Lee Jun-hyuk)

113
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,600
(Park Sung-woong)

114
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,160
(Dongjae, The Good or the Bad)

115
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,660
(Episode 9)

116
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,540
I told you to go easy on him.

117
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,670
Put Park Chan-hyuk on the phone.

118
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,760
It was CEO Nam's doing.

119
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,950
(Lee Dong-cheol)

120
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,370
Three including this guy are
all on the wanted list.

121
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,300
Prosecutor Jo probably told you
about the rest.

122
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,880
What I want to tell you is

123
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,420
that they're done for.

124
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,760
So you don't need to
run away from them

125
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,890
to prison.

126
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,220
What I have left now is CEO Nam.

127
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,270
And the only person who can put
an end to his life

128
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,560
is in front of me.

129
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,450
Just as you remember.

130
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,700
That Nam Wan-seong

131
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,530
kidnapped you,

132
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,790
tortured you,

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,580
- and forced you to perjure.
- Yes.

134
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,380
That's all you need to say.

135
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,920
But if I were you,

136
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,260
I wouldn't hope them
to be arrested.

137
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,760
I mean, who are you?

138
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,850
You're the head
of Cheongju gang now.

139
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,520
Right?

140
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,190
Don't you want to
teach them a lesson?

141
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,070
That's all you need to say

142
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,530
to be free.

143
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
Wait.

144
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,350
Like you said,
I don't have any skills,

145
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,520
but I'll work hard until
my hands and feet are honed.

146
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,360
Look at your palms.

147
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,530
How can you gombang
without any wrinkles?

148
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,780
Gakumok, lumber.

149
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,320
Jiltong, carrier.

150
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,820
Narasi, evenly.

151
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,450
Gonguri, concrete.

152
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,240
Gombang, moving materials.

153
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,040
I can move materials no problem.

154
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,120
It'll get me bread for my family.

155
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,290
I'm begging you. Please.

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,380
Follow me.

157
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,300
No Kim or Lee.
Call everyone captains.

158
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,590
No drinking before work.
No hands in your pockets.

159
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,050
No phone at work.

160
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
Be here by 7 a.m..
Leave at 5 p.m..

161
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,310
15-minute break every 3 hours.
Lunch is at 1 p.m..

162
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,560
What's your name?

163
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,390
Hwang Si-mok.

164
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,650
- Okay. Hwang. See that?
- Yes.

165
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,780
- Move them over there, okay?
- Yes.

166
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,150
Captain, wait.

167
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,990
Do people work here at night too?

168
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,450
You mean overtime
or graveyard shift?

169
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,780
There's a graveyard shift?

170
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,450
Of course.
We work 24 hours nonstop.

171
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,120
What are you doing over there?
Hurry up.

172
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,960
If it runs 24 hours, when
will I get to ransack the place?

173
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,340
Hello. Excuse me.

174
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,180
Wait.

175
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,680
Shoot.

176
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,690
Captain.

177
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,490
It looks like the construction
has been on for a while,

178
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,070
but how come only this much
has been done so far?

179
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,530
Are you saying we're slacking off?

180
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,990
No, that's not what I'm saying.

181
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,790
Geez, I wish your hands were
as busy as your mouth.

182
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,290
What are you doing?
Keep shoveling already.

183
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,920
Yes.

184
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,290
Sure.

185
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,090
Oh, right.

186
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,930
I heard the construction
was stopped before.

187
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,890
- Right?
- Yes.

188
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,930
Is that why the ground is bumpy?

189
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,020
The ground is always bumpy.

190
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,400
- No.
- What?

191
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,110
- That's not what I meant.
- Okay.

192
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,780
It feels bumpy

193
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,240
as if you just poured the cement.

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,990
If you poured the cement,

195
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,370
that's not a ground.

196
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,120
If you poured the cement,
that's not a ground anymore.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,790
If it's not a ground, what is it?

198
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,920
(DANGER! DO NOT APPROACH)

199
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,990
What are you doing in there?

200
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,910
Captain, did you say
the restroom was this--

201
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,080
Hwang, don't you see this?

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,410
'Danger. Do not approach.'

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,670
I see it. I do.

204
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,350
The weather isn't
getting any warmer.

205
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,560
Don't feel like
talking about the weather? Then

206
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,980
should I ask about
how you've been doing?

207
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,440
You start with a small talk

208
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,780
and slowly get to the point, no?

209
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,740
Because you're all busy.

210
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,870
Speak for yourself.

211
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,870
That's why you gathered all of us
here without manners.

212
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,660
What are you pulling here?

213
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,710
I have no manners,

214
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,040
and you have no loyalty.

215
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,460
What?

216
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,380
Honorable Congressman
Kim Sang-hoe.

217
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,630
The congressman is displeased

218
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,880
that a prosecutor in the district
mentioned the congress.

219
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,800
I'll explain it to him in person--

220
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,300
The congressman is busy.

221
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,470
Mayor Lee Jong-myeong.

222
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,180
I keep hearing rumors about you.

223
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,730
That will leave me no choice
but to think twice.

224
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,440
Ms. Jeon Mi-ran.

225
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,900
I can't just ask the office

226
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,780
to give me the case.

227
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,160
Why bother all of you one by one

228
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,780
when I know you're busy?

229
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,830
So,

230
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,330
the strong tie between
Congressman Kim and me,

231
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,960
the fun time Mayor Lee and I had,

232
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,420
and strong friendship
between Ms. Jeon and me.

233
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,130
Let's share it like we're one.

234
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,430
Oh, Mayor Lee.

235
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,600
I heard the baseball stadium
you built on my land is

236
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,850
worth 80 million dollars?

237
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,890
But it looks no more

238
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,770
than 5 million dollars worth.

239
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,230
CEO Nam.

240
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,940
What about the fact that the city
purchased that land from you?

241
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,400
Oh, then

242
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,650
do you want to start with that?
Since you brought it up.

243
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,410
What was it that you mentioned,
Ms. Jeon?

244
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,450
Your brother is nothing
but a pain in the neck?

245
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,000
Was your brother the only thing
I have on my plate?

246
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't cross the line.

247
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,840
Don't make me cross the line.

248
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,470
I mean, you should be aware of it,

249
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,430
so you won't be shocked
when it's on the news.

250
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,890
CEO Nam.

251
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,390
Blackmailing to disclose it

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,100
isn't like you.

253
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,480
If I'm blackmailing,
you'll be relieved.

254
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,020
It should end with blackmailing.
If it becomes real...

255
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,570
Gosh.

256
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,900
How entertaining.

257
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,030
I know you're all wise.

258
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,580
If I say anymore,

259
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,540
it'll become an earful, right?

260
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,640
Your employees

261
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,900
appeared at my construction site.

262
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,940
Why?

263
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,950
Because they think the body's
buried there.

264
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
From the last time.

265
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,500
Shoot.

266
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,040
Still going on about that?

267
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,750
I shouldn't be worried then.

268
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,400
Moving it could be
shooting myself in the foot.

269
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,610
Give a plausible excuse

270
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,950
to stop the construction.

271
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,110
Remember the boys we used

272
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,280
before the redevelopment began?

273
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,740
The illegal immigrants.

274
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,870
Yes.

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Should I call them?

276
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,210
Grind it on the spot.

277
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,220
Hello.

278
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,140
Mr. Seo?

279
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,310
Prosecutor Kim.

280
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,980
Are you drunk?

281
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,820
Yes.

282
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,280
5 servings of pork belly.

283
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,490
By yourself?

284
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,210
I feel like dying,

285
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,210
but I can't stop craving meat.

286
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,340
Did you really decide to
work at the construction site?

287
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,760
Did they hire someone like you?

288
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,510
Bluetooth camcorder. Transmitter.

289
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,430
Oh.

290
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,600
A metal detector just in case.

291
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,730
Shoot.

292
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,980
This could really kill you.

293
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,690
I better have it out
with the judge in charge.

294
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,570
You see,

295
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,030
when I went to the construction...

296
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,580
When I checked it out,

297
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,700
you don't have to bury it
in the ground.

298
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,790
You could put the body
in the wall

299
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,670
cement it.

300
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
The wall?

301
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,380
But there are dozens of buildings.

302
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,890
If we assume it's buried
between two walls in one house,

303
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,800
there are 7 or 8 houses
on one floor.

304
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,140
14.

305
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,970
16.

306
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,480
If we assume there is
one building per complex...

307
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,980
So unless we can specify
the location,

308
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,200
I must get a warrant...

309
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,370
A warrant to tear down
the whole construction site.

310
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,240
That's what we need.

311
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,990
- Mr. Seo.
- Yes?

312
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,750
When will you ever get
to experience this again?

313
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,920
Are you saying...

314
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,880
Do you want more meat?

315
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,800
Yes.

316
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,970
Shoot.

317
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,220
Shoot.

318
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,350
Damn it.

319
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,300
Nam Wan-seong, you son of a gun!

320
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,820
Gosh, so tired.

321
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,240
Among the redevelopment
company's charges,

322
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,740
corrupted bidding,

323
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,450
violation of increment contract,

324
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,790
and the inspection
companies' collusion.

325
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,290
Those three are assigned to us.

326
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,920
You mean
Ehong Construction's case?

327
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,000
Those three are the core charges.

328
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,210
What is the 9th floor doing?

329
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,130
I thought they were going to
take care of it.

330
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,090
They said it was too much
and asked me to share it.

331
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Prosecutor Choi?

332
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,020
Me? But the 9th floor never...

333
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,150
Okay.

334
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,540
Shoot. It's damn solid.

335
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,830
So? Is this working?

336
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,250
Yes, it's working fine.

337
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,420
We can see you,
so show us the walls.

338
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,890
Can you show me
inside the balcony?

339
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,720
Mr. Seo,
can you go to the balcony?

340
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,140
The balcony. Got it.

341
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,530
Did you say it was done
by people who don't build?

342
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,450
Yes.

343
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,700
They're all thugs. Ex-cons.

344
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,580
Then they wouldn't build the wall.

345
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,580
It's easier to dig a hole
and bury it there.

346
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,120
Is it harder to bury it
in the wall?

347
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,000
Not just hard.

348
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,460
If you put something
inside the wall,

349
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,300
you have to even the edge
and the surface.

350
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,670
So you can't see what's inside.

351
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,890
Mr. Seo, can you go out
and show me the ground?

352
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,310
Okay. The ground.

353
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,940
If it's buried in the ground,

354
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,730
can you tell from the screen?

355
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,820
It's easy for builders like me.

356
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,820
Hwang.

357
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,690
Are you slacking off again?

358
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,570
You think you're out here
for a walk?

359
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,530
Hwang?

360
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,240
Your phone!

361
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,990
You never return
when I give you work, geez.

362
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,040
If I catch you slacking off again,
you're fired. Got it?

363
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,290
Get back to work.

364
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Hwang.

365
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,460
Don't forget to take that
with you.

366
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,460
No Hwang. It's Captain.

367
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,060
May I have your attention please.

368
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,810
Due to the safety check,

369
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,650
we're closed for tomorrow.

370
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,110
We advise you to put
your machines and tools away

371
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,990
before you leave.

372
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,410
Please prevent
the insufficient arrangement

373
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,160
from interrupting
the safety check.

374
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,710
Thank you for your cooperation.

375
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,750
I repeat.

376
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,750
Due to the safety check...

377
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,590
This has never happened before.

378
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,220
Even if there's a safety check,

379
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,140
we can work here
while they check there.

380
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,180
My goodness.

381
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,810
I know.
How big is this safety check

382
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,810
that they shut down
the whole construction?

383
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,690
If it's done without notice,
does it mean there's a problem?

384
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,440
- A problem?
- Yes.

385
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,400
Oh, whatever.

386
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,860
Just do as they say.

387
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,870
This is the one

388
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,780
and only chance.

389
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,790
If Nam Wan-seong is taking action,

390
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,410
he'll lead us
to where the body is

391
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,080
even before we find it.

392
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,960
If we miss it,

393
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,130
our only physical evidence
disappears for good.

394
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,130
The winner will be Nam Wan-seong.

395
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,710
I'm on my way.

396
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,300
Prosecutor Kim,
cover Nam Wan-seong.

397
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,970
You must arrest him
as soon as the body's found.

398
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,010
He wouldn't come here himself
to dig the ground.

399
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,060
And I can't arrest him.

400
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,310
What are you going to do
by yourself?

401
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,600
I'm not alone.
I'm going to make a report.

402
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,690
Once we check that I wasn't wrong,

403
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,020
call the police immediately.

404
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,730
- Prosecutor Sung.
- No.

405
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,020
- What?
- Leave him alone.

406
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,940
He already has enough
on his plate as it is now.

407
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,000
What are you doing?

408
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,920
Mr. Seo is alone.

409
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,210
We never know who he has to
deal with and when.

410
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,130
I will go. I should,

411
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,260
but what if the body's really
found there tonight?

412
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,970
Then who found it?

413
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,890
The person who worked
at the construction site.

414
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,350
But

415
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,890
Seo Dong-jae and Nam Wan-seong had
the disclosure battle.

416
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,480
So the moment his name
is involved in this case,

417
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,480
the prosecutor held grudges

418
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,230
and pretended to be
a construction worker

419
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,280
to go after the man who revealed
his flaws from the past.

420
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,360
Don't you think people would
say that, Prosecutor Kim Ji-hee?

421
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,620
Why are you questioning that now?

422
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,030
No.

423
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,830
I'm not questioning.
I'm just concerned.

424
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,750
Now, are you ready to set off?

425
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,670
Aren't you in a rush? Let's go.

426
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:23,020
(Ehong Construction Cheongju
District 5 Redevelopment)

427
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,940
Do you see it?

428
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,990
Yes. You.

429
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,870
We're only going to watch.

430
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,290
Yes.

431
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,870
Even if they move the body
before the police arrive,

432
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,120
we're only tailing them.

433
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,670
Can you fight?

434
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,920
I've never tried. You?

435
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,340
Just tail them then.

436
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,760
Kim Ji-hee can probably fight
better than us.

437
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,100
Maybe I should've told her
to come here instead.

438
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,390
So she gets hurt again?

439
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,140
What are you saying?

440
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,610
No way. Are you

441
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,610
trying to look chivalrous?

442
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,980
Hey.

443
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,740
So you sent her to a less
dangerous place, isn't it?

444
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,250
Do you really think
that's less dangerous?

445
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,440
It's freezing.

446
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,570
We haven't seen anything
for two hours.

447
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,280
Why did you have to bring me
to this place? Geez.

448
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,540
What's this?

449
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,620
A hot pack?

450
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,880
Gosh, you have so many.

451
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,750
Give me one more.

452
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,340
Give me one more.

453
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,300
- I'm freezing here, seriously.
- Shush.

454
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,350
Hey, turn the power on.

455
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,480
Remove everything here.

456
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,440
The power.

457
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,170
I knew it was there.

458
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,510
It's certainly not a safety check.

459
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,810
Take it out and show me.

460
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,480
What's that?

461
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,560
What?

462
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,360
- A grinder?
- Are they grinding it?

463
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,360
Over here.

464
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,990
Here.

465
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,750
Move this.

466
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,250
Stop.

467
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,890
Take it out.

468
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,940
- A body.
- It's a body.

469
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,940
That's not all.

470
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,940
Don't leave any piece behind.

471
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,240
Find them all.

472
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,950
They're not just moving the body.

473
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,530
In there.

474
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,960
If they grind it

475
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,210
and scatter it in the woods or
the river, we can never trace it.

476
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,590
Stay here.

477
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,590
What are you going to do?

478
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,670
Call the police.
And call Prosecutor Kim too.

479
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,930
You're not the boss of me.
Where are you going?

480
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,760
What's he going to do?

481
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,160
Shoot.

482
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,910
Do that first and pick it up.

483
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,220
Shoot. What the hell?

484
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,310
What now?

485
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,850
What the hell?

486
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,190
What's wrong with this?

487
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,700
Is the power unstable
because it's not completed yet?

488
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,820
You. Go check the power.

489
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,620
Hey, you.

490
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,750
There's a generator behind
the container. Bring it.

491
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,100
Hey.

492
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,100
It's back on. Get to work.

493
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,700
Mr. Seo, they...

494
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,460

495
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,050
Where's the other one?

496
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,800
The other one?

497
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,260
He was waiting for his partner.

(Prosecution Service,
Jo Byung-gun)

499
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,610

Do you know them?

503
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,700
You don't realize
what's going on, do you?

504
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,120
I'm sorry.

505
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,040
Partner?

506
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,170
Come out.

507
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,540

510
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,810
He won't come out. Forget it.

511
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,680
Grab him.

512
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,440
Wait.

I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.

Follow me.

- Take this, you son of a gun.
- Captain Im?

- I almost
- Yes, yes.

got ground to death in there.

00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,500
(Arrest Warrant)

548
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,010
You're under arrest for abetting
a murder and hiding a body.

549
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,090
You have the right to talk to
a lawyer. You have the right--

550
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,140
Dad.

551
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,520
You have the right
to remain silent.

552
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,070
(Do not cross,
investigation in progress)

553
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,100
Thank you for plucking up
your courage.

554
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,400
Courage?

555
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,610
It's not that I'm courageous.

556
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,280
I'm not educated.

557
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,450
So I spent my whole life
in construction sites.

558
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,780
That's how I fed my children,
got them dressed,

559
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,700
and sent them to school.

560
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,460
This isn't how constructions
should be done.

561
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,420
I hope it doesn't get any worse.

562
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,420
That's why.

563
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,870
Gosh.

564
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,630
(Autopsy Result)

565
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,770
I know nothing about it.

566
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,060
CEO Nam--

567
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,770
Yes, he was my secretary.

568
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,570
And those who ran away
worked for me.

569
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,780
I didn't deny that.

570
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,660
But how can you say I ordered them

571
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,870
to kill a man and bury the body?

572
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,160
It doesn't make any sense.

573
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,540
If your employees cause
trouble outside,

574
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,620
is it considered your order?

575
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,540
Do you have a proof
that I ordered them?

576
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,250
If you do, show me.

577
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,760
I wonder how you can blame me

578
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,930
for killing a man

579
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,140
I've never met before.

580
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,560
Nam Wan-seong.

581
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,020
What did you do
on May 2 this year?

582
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,360
May 2? When was that?

583
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,570
I'm not sure.

584
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,940
I don't know. How am I supposed
to remember that?

585
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,900
That's more than half a year ago.

586
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,530
On May 3, you suddenly
closed the construction site.

587
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,950
Why did you do that?

588
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,740
I'm not boasting here,

589
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,290
but I was accused

590
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,960
of faulty construction.
How was I supposed to keep going?

591
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,880
Besides,

592
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,550
if I were to kill someone
and bury him,

593
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,010
you think I'd bury him
in my construction site?

594
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,890
Then I'd be the first
to be suspected.

595
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,510
It's all mountains
behind that construction site.

596
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I'd bury him there
unless I was an idiot.

597
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,400
Why didn't you?

598
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,570
Because I didn't kill him.

599
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,740
Moving a body was harder
than you thought, no?

600
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,240
I don't know.
I've never tried it before.

601
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:13,290
You never know what might happen
until you reach the mountain,

602
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,580
and because it's out
of your reach,

603
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,500
you're worried about
when it might be found.

604
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,460
You had acres of land
in your control.

605
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,960
Why bother climbing the mountain?

606
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,170
Wait.

607
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,590
Do you call this an investigation?

608
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,050
You're putting words in his mouth.

609
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,230
Imagine how much he struggled
in there.

610
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,730
He tried to yell for help although
he couldn't make any sound.

611
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,610
The cement dough got in his throat

612
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,190
and hardened in his eyes.

613
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,360
What jerks.

614
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,330
How could one do that to a man?

615
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,790
So go catch them.

616
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,910
You've seen those three.

617
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,210
They're the perpetrators.

618
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,460
Why are you wasting your time
on me?

619
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,960
I'm the victim here.

620
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,630
Have me sit here for 365 days

621
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,220
and see if I say anything.

622
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,510
I know nothing.

623
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,600
Seriously.

624
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,060
This is frustrating to death.

625
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,060
The whistleblower who reported
that the CEO of Ehong Construction

626
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,770
gave orders to make
double blueprints

627
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,320
and conspired
with the inspection company

628
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,360
to siphon 11 million dollars

629
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
was found buried alive

630
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,080
in Ehong's construction site.

631
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,160
But you know nothing about it?

632
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,290
Correct.

633
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,470
He needs to be transferred.
Send me the guards.

634
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,220
Where is he being transferred to?

635
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,890
I bet you didn't feel comfortable
in our detention center

636
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,390
because it was only temporary.

637
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,020
I'll send you to your friends.

638
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,600
What do you mean friends?

639
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,360
Jail in Cheongju Police Station.

640
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,240
The detectives are
dying to see you.

641
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,320
You won't be bored.

642
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,160
Oh, see you again.

643
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,250
(Cheongju Police Station)

644
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,450
How many years do you think
I'll be in here for?

645
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,160
Ten days.

646
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,240
It's a maximum of 10 days in jail.

647
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,120
You know how many years
you'll rot in there.

648
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,830
As many as your sins.

649
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,920
That all depends on
how much evidence you have.

650
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,550
How much you gathered.

651
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,090
Was there anything to gather?

652
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,930
I'll tell you in court.

653
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,650
I hope there is something
you can tell me.
