(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,830
(and events in this drama
are fictitious)

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,670
Sir, can you take a look at this?

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,340
What's this doing here?

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,590
Can you turn the light off?

6
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,720
Why is this here?

7
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,850
I was right.

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,520
A partial fingerprint was found
in the gun trigger,

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,730
and it belonged to him.

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,610
He shot a gun before he died?

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,450
We have to sample every DNA.

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,290
So, Kang Soo-min shot
the gun first,

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,040
and if that hurt the culprit,

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,040
the culprit took the gun
with his wounded body

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,460
and did this?

16
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,050
Do you think that's possible?

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,340
We'll have to see

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,220
if any DNA got mixed.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,100
But what we need is
the culprit's fingerprints.

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,770
It seems the culprit shot the gun
with gloves on.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,190
There's only a trace of
a smudged fingerprint.

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,870
If he got shot,

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,910
there must be a trace of blood.

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,800
Even if the bullet
only brushed past him,

25
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,010
he must've dripped
at least one drop of blood.

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,230
He wouldn't just wipe his blood
and leave

27
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,360
after killing a man.

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,240
(Gunsam Sauna)

29
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,080
No surveillance cameras.

30
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,540
No trace of blood.

31
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,040
No cars.

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,680
Yes, I'll go now.

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,140
Have you located
the victim's car yet?

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,600
It's not outside.

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,480
We got the license plate number.
We're looking for it.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,140
But he's from Seoul.

37
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,400
He probably drove here.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,770
It's not in the area. Maybe
that junkie took a train here.

39
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,160
CSI will check here.

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,660
When's that going to be?

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,830
We're short of hands.

42
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,250
We had to bust that drug deal too.

43
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,040
It's the thirsty one
that digs the well.

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,880
Thirsty, my ass. I have to
go back to the station.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,340
Wait.

46
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,500
The victim Kang Soo-min's car.

47
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,010
Check if that car passed
the toll gate to Cheongju.

48
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,090
If there's a record of entering,
but the car isn't here,

49
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,390
it means someone moved the car,

50
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,140
and it must be the culprit.

51
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,390
- Okay.
- Oh, and Park Chan-hyuk.

52
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,020
Can you bring him here?
I need to check something.

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,440
Check what?

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
To check if the man inside is the
distributor and who the maker is.

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,610
But he took off.

56
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,450
You missed him?

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,280
He dashed even before I knew.

58
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,450
In a split second.

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,160
And I also got a report
about this place.

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,990
You told me not to worry
about missing him.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,040
But if the gun was found here,

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,580
it means Park Chan-hyuk didn't
kill Yu-ri.

63
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,750
That's not the only case.
What about this case?

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,670
I thought you asked someone else
to watch him.

65
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,670
I did.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,090
We're currently checking if
cameras caught him taking off.

67
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,090
Bye now.

68
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,720
Shoot.

69
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,930
Whatever.

70
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,890
You think I can't catch who did it
without someone else's snitch?

71
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,280
Is this my hair?

72
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,530
He didn't even leave
a single strand of hair?

73
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,960
He wouldn't have worn gloves
for ramyeon, right?

74
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,260
Is it too much?

75
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,730
Shoot. He even cleaned
the stove knob.

76
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,860
Unless he had no fingers...

77
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,540
How can there be
no fingerprints at all?

78
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,370
Maybe it's an old man.

79
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,710
Now the technology has improved,

80
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,670
but if one made drugs
since the old days,

81
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,670
sometimes they have
no fingerprints.

82
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,390
After staying here
just for a few hours,

83
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,390
no matter how many times I shower,
the smell won't come off.

84
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,060
Imagine how that'd affect
your fragile skin.

85
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,850
Wait.

86
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,190
I'll be fine.

87
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,320
If it's strong enough
to erase the fingerprints,

88
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,830
the one who made it
wouldn't be so healthy, right?

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,040
Perhaps he doesn't stop coughing?

90
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,880
If he made it for his whole life,
it won't stop with coughing.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,590
It'd completely ruin his lungs.

92
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,590
- He...
- What?

93
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,220
Never mind.

94
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,140
One thing I know for sure is

95
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,350
that he has no fingerprints.

96
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,400
Shoot. I should've taken
a closer look.

101
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,960
He's ready.

The phone is ringing,
but why won't he pick it up?

105
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,930
Who are you?

106
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,140
How can a junkie lose his drugs

107
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,560
like an idiot?

108
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,480
Did you kill the girl too?

109
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,150
No. I really don't know
who took it.

110
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,860
You damn son of a gun.

111
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,570
Listen.
That hostess bar isn't mine.

112
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,940
Is it just me
who's bothered by that?

113
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,370
What are you doing?

114
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,540
- Who is it?
- It's Dong-pal.

115
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,340
Where the hell are you?

116
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,670
Why didn't you freaking show up?

117
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,260
Seriously, is this
how you want to play?

118
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,630
- Cat got your tongue? Hey.
- Speak.

119
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,060
Cat, my ass. I've been
with the police the whole time.

120
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,010
The police?

121
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,600
They were questioning me
where I was last night.

122
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,060
I was at work.

123
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,730
You should've told them
you had to call the prosecutor.

124
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,690
What were the police doing there?

125
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,980
Whatever. Where's Choi Geum-ho?

126
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,320
Did you miss him?

127
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,900
How can you miss him? Damn it!

128
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,490

right now?

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,290
Hey, can't you teach
your snitch better?

133
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,040
Ma'am, Seo Dong-jae is
taking revenge on me

134
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,710
for excluding him.

135
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,750
Turn the wheels.

136

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,640
Hey, is Choi Geum-ho your brother?

138
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
How can you snitch
on your brother?

139
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,350
Not my brother. Brother-in-law.

140
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,060
Did you tell him you saw
who sold the drugs?

141
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,270
Yes.

142
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,030
Yes. I did. Yes.

143
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,320
Who else?

144
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,570
Only my brother-in-law.

145
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,660
But I'm not sure

146
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,910
who he might have said it to.

147
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,830
I'll ask him in person...

148
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,420
No, don't bother.

149
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,580
You know how to make a call.

150
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,590
For something this important,
I should be asking in person...

151
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,460
It's my fingerprint.

The person you've reached is
not available...

Your brother must've found out
that you betrayed him.

155

I won't have to bury you myself.

156

be stabbed in a matter of time.

157

158
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,810
So?

159
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,350
He can't be more messed up.

160
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,900
He won't last long in prison.

161
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,150
- So you should--
- I should

162
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,860
kill him?

163
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,070

for your brother-in-law?

Yes! Shoot!

169
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,420
I was a damn prosecutor's snitch.

170
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,590
So what?

171
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,640
Turn me in. What does that mean?

172
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,600
That means
I can tell them on your behalf.

173
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,060
That it was all that girl's doing.

and sold them.

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,310
- and request a search warrant.
- What?

182
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,060
He's the victim
in Soogok-dong sauna.

183
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,190
Oh, and you know
Spare Bowling Center?

184
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,860
See whose name

185
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,070
it's registered in.

186
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,820
Name, address, any information
you can find.

187
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,200
But the boss just asked me
about where you were.

188
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,820
Me?

189
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,660
Where's she now?

190
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,580
She was heading to the police
station with Prosecutor Jo.

191
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,080
Prosecutor Jo too?

192
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,250
Hey.

193
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,670
Meet me there.

194
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,380
This is great.

195
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,510
(Soogok-dong Murder
Investigation Team)

196
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,630
It was closed during COVID-19,

197
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,800
and about 2 years ago,

198
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,350
the victim Kang Soo-min rented it.

199
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,180
The prosecution thinks
he's the distributor...

200
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
What the hell?

201
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,070
Kim Hyung-woo, raise your hand.

202
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,730
Who's Kim Hyung-woo?

203
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,780
What?

204
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,860
Bring Park Chan-hyuk.

205
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,870
What are you staring at? Why do
you think we missed Choi Geum-ho?

206
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,950
Did you miss him? Oh, no.

207
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,410
Hello, ma'am.

208
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,540
Come in.

209
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Why are you venting on them?

210
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,670
Didn't you see
what it says outside?

211
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,090
This is the Soogok-dong murder
investigation team.

212
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,970
Screw Soogok-dong.
That's none of my business.

213
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,050
I didn't ask for this.

214
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,600
Bring me Park Chan-hyuk.

215
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,970
Why are you looking for him here?

216
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,930
Did you investigate him here?

217
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,390
No, we went to the hostess bar.

218
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,350
And?

219
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,520
We split after the investigation.

220
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,480
He had to go to
the cement factory.

221
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,190
You don't know where he is?

222
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,940
No, it's not that they don't know,

223
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,570
but it sounds like
they just let him go.

224
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,990
He wouldn't dare to show up
for the deal

225
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,660
when the police were ransacking.

226
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,280
Only if he showed up,
we would've caught Choi already.

227
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,410
You're the blame
for your own snitch.

228
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,660
Come here.

229
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,750
Take a look at that.
Do you know who that is?

230
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,130
(Kang Soo-min)

231
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,380
No.

232
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,890
You don't know Mr. Kang?

233
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,560
Did you kill him?

234
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,600
- What?
- Kill him?

235
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,850
Did Choi Geum-ho order you
to kill Mr. Kang?

236
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,310
So you killed him
with these hands?

237
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,690
No, I didn't even know
he was dead.

238
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,780
That's all I needed. Take him.

239
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,620
Shoot.

240
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,750
If Mr. Kang's dead,
you should've told me.

241
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,750
- Why would I?
- Because it's my case.

242
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,710
Since when Im Yu-ri's death
was your case?

243
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,380
What does this have to do
with Im Yu-ri?

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,630
Mr. Kang is dead.

245
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,670
Ma'am.

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,630
The weapon that killed Im Yu-ri

247
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,670
was found next to Mr. Kang's body.

248
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,470
- The shotgun?
- Yes.

249
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,220
The murder scene is presumably
used as the Purple Factory.

250
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,850
Factory, my ass.
What's your evidence?

251
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,360
Methylamine, acetone,
dichloromethane,

252
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
excipient.

253
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,650
Ecstasy ingredients found
on the scene.

254
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,570
(Pictures from the scene)

255
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,070
It's in purple color, no?

256
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,570
Who made it? The maker.

257
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,280
Why are you asking him?

258
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,080
I'm still searching.

259
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,660
Speaking of which,
I can't waste any minute.

260
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,460
I'll get going first. Bye.

261
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,000
But...

262
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,720
Sorry about the ruckus.
My apologies.

263
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,020
What?

264
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,640
You knew the police went to
see Park Chan-hyuk, didn't you?

265
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,360
Ma'am.

266
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,690
I went to the terminal
in the afternoon.

267
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,860
It's not like I knew
he was making a deal.

268
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,740
You think the police shouldn't
even have investigated Park?

269
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,870
If they didn't take any action
after watching the video,

270
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,830
that's a dereliction of duty.

271
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,040
Ma'am, if I hadn't
come here today,

272
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,250
he would've hidden
Mr. Kang was dead.

273
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,790
What we have left now is
Choi and the maker.

274
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Whoever catches them first
takes it.

275
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,420
What?

276
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,130
I'm currently tracing the maker.

277
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,760
It's highly likely that he took
off with Mr. Kang's car.

278
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,100
I've requested a search warrant
on Mr. Kang's house.

279
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,730
- Get him.
- Yes, ma'am.

280
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,690
No.

281
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,070
Is this what's called synergy?

282
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,450
(Cheongju Police Station)

283
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,840
The bowling center belongs
to Han Sang-sik.

284
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,590
- I got the address.
- Enter it in the GPS.

285
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Yes.

286
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,350
- I think he's a detective.
- What?

287
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,860
They're staking out already.

288
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,400
Don't stop. Keep going.

289
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,530
Shush.

290
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,780
Park Chan-hyuk.

291
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,240
Who are you?

292
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,040
Park Chan-hyuk!

293
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,120
- Where is this prick?
- I'm sorry.

294
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,250
Park Chan-hyuk!

295
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,290
Stop it, please.

296
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,290
Park Chan-hyuk.

297
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,300
- Shoot.
- Sorry.

298
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,220
Will you please stop?

299
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,970
Where does Park Chan-hyuk live?

300
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,180
Tell me. Where the hell is he?

301
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,440
Hurry up.

302
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,990
Hurry.

303
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,370
Hurry.

304
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,370
Sir, we got him.

305
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,420
But his wound is severe.
We should take him to...

306
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,250
Sir, wait.

307
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,220
Choi Geum-ho?

308
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,180
Hey, Choi Geum-ho. Choi...

309
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Sir, he's dead.

310
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,860
Shoot. That's bad luck.

311
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,530
What should I do?

312
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,860
Ditch him.

313
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,620
The police will think he died
on the way. It actually works.

314
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,620
And

315
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,830
change the boys.

316
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,250
We still have a prick who dared
to make a deal with me.

317
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,850
Please don't kill me. Please.

318
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,230
Too bad.

319
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,820
We'll say you killed her.

320
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,740
Think carefully in there.

321
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,910
I'll go...

322
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,160
No, it's okay. Stay here.

323
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:04,960
But...

324
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,420
You'll only alert the suspect.

325
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,290
I'll call you if I need you.
Wait here.

326
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,340
Okay.

327
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,230
Who is it?

328
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,730
I'm looking for Han Sang-sik.

329
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,650
I'm from the bowling center.

330
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,280
- The bowling center?
- Yes.

331
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,490
What do you want?

332
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,370
What the hell do you want?

333
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,410
Actually

334
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,250
I'm from the prosecution service.

335
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,420
Voice phishing?

336
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,210
No.

337
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,800
Then I would've called you. I'm...

338
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,730
Are you Mr. Han Sang-sik?

339
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,020
Yes.

340
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,440
Never mind. Excuse me.

341
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,980
Wait.

342
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,980
Did you just say a bowling center?

343
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,110
I actually got a letter
about a bowling center

344
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,030
and tax issues.

345
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,860
- Can you take a look at it?
- No, it's too late.

346
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,280
I don't mind. Come in.

347
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,700
Honey, we have a prosecutor here.

348
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,540
Give me the notice we received
the other day.

349
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,470
Help me.

350
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,440
Come in.
Are you the fellow prosecutor?

351
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,560
- Yes.
- Come in.

352
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Prosecutor Seo.

353
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,030
Hey.

354
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,440
Say hi to Sang-sik.

355
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,530
He's a prosecutor,
and he's an expert in this.

356
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,530
I see.

357
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,830
- Nice to meet you.
- What?

358
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,540
Sang-sik here was involved
in cramming.

359
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,580
You're good at this.

360
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,330
You can count on him.

361
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,290
Sorry for causing you a ruckus
when we just met.

362
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,250
No, no. I understand.

363
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,670
Thanks to you,
I got a lot of protein.

364
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,090
Thank you for the food.

365
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,140
- Prosecutor.
- Yes?

366
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,810
So I received this...

367
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,850
Okay.

368
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,360
Scamming someone else's name

369
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,860
proves that he's no ordinary man.

370
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,650
It's been proved,
but because it was a fraud,

371
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,530
I have no way to find him.

372
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,780
It's not like I can post him
as wanted for coughing.

373
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,670
Hello?

374
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,790
Yes.

375
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,710
Now?

376
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,630
Okay. I'll be right there.

377
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,100
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,850
It's an autopsy.

379
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,870
Park Chan-hyuk.

380
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,030
Chan-hyuk.

381
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,240
Come out when I'm being nice.

382
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,540
Park Chan-hyuk! Damn it.

383
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,830
Park Chan-hyuk.

384
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,960
Park Chan-hyuk. Shoot.

385
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,840
Chan-hyuk. Park Chan-hyuk.

386
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,090
Park Chan-hyuk!

387
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,340
Let me sleep.

388
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,890
Sorry.

389
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,270
Hey, it's me, Byung-gun.

390
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,230
I won't get mad at you.
Come out.

391
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,650
Why was there nothing
in the autopsy?

392
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,110
He should've fought back at least.

393
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,030
Gosh, so tired.

394
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,420
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

395
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,960
I doubt they'd approve it.

396
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,220
(Place to search,
Spare Bowling Center)

397
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,970
There's nothing to write.

398
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
The call history.

399
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,740
(Call History)

400
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,700
Find the number of the part-timer
who worked

401
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,330
in the bowling center with Yu-ri
in her call history.

402
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,300
So? Do you want me to lie down
in your office?

403
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,630
No.

404
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,640
Humiliation isn't enough.

405
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,720
What if I say you took it
from me by force?

406
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,310
What if...

407
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,980
Seo Dong-jae, come out!

408
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,070
The corrupted prosecutor
stole my land!

409
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,480
Seo Dong-jae!

410
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,440
Seo Dong-jae!

411
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,990
Everything Seo Dong-jae says is
bullcrap!

412
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,410
No, he wouldn't do that.

413
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,830
Gosh, he'd totally do that.

414
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,500
How did I meet Ms. Jeon?

415
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,170
By paying her!

416
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,170
He's more than capable
of doing that.

417
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,210
Please. Release him.

418
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,470
I swear I won't bother you again
with the land issue.

419
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,890
Then...

420
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,860
Sir, Gyeo-rye isn't
in the station.

421
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,450
What do you mean he's not here?
He's supposed to be out today.

422
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,120
Yes, so I'm here to pick him up.

423
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,580
But

424
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
he's not here.

425
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,310
If I neglect him, I'm worried
he'll get in trouble again.

426
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,770
You went out of your way
to deliver him.

427
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,320
How nice of you.

428
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,380
Are you reselling it to me?

429
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,500
For you to rebuy it.

430
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,010
The land you worked your ass off
to steal

431
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,300
by breaking
a 100,000 dollar porcelain.

432
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,220
This land is right in front of it.

433
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,010
Before I change my mind
and hold out,

434
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,470
rebuy it when you can.

435
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,980
The police were arguing your son's
imprisonment should be extended,

436
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,190
and I barely shook them off. So?
Do you want me to take him back?

437
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,950
You're desperate big time.

438
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,540
You're talking so much.

439
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,960
Okay.

440
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,790
Here.

441
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,340
Hurry.

442
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,140
Where? Here?

443
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,220
Yes.

444
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,270
Okay.

445
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,440
Here. Yes.

446
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,060
Freedom.

447
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,780
Don't you need to seal
the contract?

448
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,860
Oh.

449
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,280
We should seal it.

450
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,290
The ink.

451
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,090
Well...

452
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,010
Make sure to transfer
the registration.

453
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,100
The end.

454
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,190
Oh, the drug investigation
will continue.

455
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
He's only free
from the murder charges.

456
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,410
I'll take care of that.

457
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,450
You wish.

458
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,130
That arrogant son of a gun.

459
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,630
Nam Gyeo-rye!

460
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Take care, you wish.

461
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,430
It's clear that he sold drugs.

462
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,600
Please cancel the redevelopment.

463
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,070
Now, if I catch the drug maker,

464
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,740
I'm off to the supreme office.

465
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,290
We must first clear
Gyeo-rye's drug charges.

466
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,580
I'll give the general briefing,
so you don't...

467
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,620
Oh.

468
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,170
There.

469
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,470
We don't have much time.
Let's deal with it immediately.

470
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,470
Yes, sir.

471
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,890
I'll begin now.

472
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,190
Is he the one who said
he'd buy the rest?

473
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,190
I don't know. I wasn't there.

474
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,070
He said he wasn't at the scene.

475
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,950
Yu-ri went to sell it alone.

476
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,450
I swear I saw nothing.

477
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,450
She sold it alone.

478
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,120
That's all that matters, isn't it?

479
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,170
You talked to the detectives
without me before, right?

480
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,540
What did you tell them exactly?

481
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,210
There must be a reason
they mentioned the drugs, no?

482
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,050
I told them about the terminal.

483
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,140
I've checked the surveillance
cameras from the terminal.

484
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,350
All right. Listen carefully.

485
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,350
It's true that Gyeo-rye
brought the bag.

486
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,400
It was caught in the camera.
We cannot deny it.

487
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
I wanted to return it--

488
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,190
No, Im Yu-ri asked you.

489
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,860
She knew where the bag was
in which men's restroom slot.

490
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,280
She couldn't go in there,

491
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,910
so she asked you to bring it.

492
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,450
You had no idea what it was.

493
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,040
(Funeral)

494
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,420
Im Yu-ri knew the drug supplier

495
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,550
had left the bag in there.

496
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,470
That's the reason she went to
the terminal in the first place.

497
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,390
But I already told the police.

498
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,100
The police investigation doesn't
count as evidence in trial.

499
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,100
We'll say it was
a coercive investigation.

500
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,150
And it was
a coercive investigation.

501
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,320
Because someone's dead.
And who's that?

502
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,690
An officer's daughter.

503
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,400
They cornered you ruthlessly.

504
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,660
The public is taking
a negative stance toward it.

505
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,370
It's a matter
of how to change that.

506
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,160
Nam Gyeo-rye's information
is all over the internet.

507
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,910
There are also pictures
of his face too.

508
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,000
His face is revealed.

509
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,590
His face is revealed.

510
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,430
His face is revealed.

511
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,430
His face is

512
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,310
revealed.

513
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,150
Then we should take
advantage of it.

514
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,280
Nam Gyeo-rye.

515
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,780
Keep it together

516
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
and listen to
what I'm about to say.

517
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,530
Hello.

518
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,500
Do you work
at Spare Bowling Center?

519
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,250
Sorry about that.

520
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,920
- Good morning.
- Hello.

521
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,840
Prosecutor Seo, I'm working
on what you asked to find.

522
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,170
Keep up the good work.

523
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,130
Did you get home safe last night?

524
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,760
- Hello. Do you
- Yes.

525
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,930
work at Spare Bowling Center?

526
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,100
Sorry about that.

527
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,720
Maybe kids these days preferred
texting over calling?

528
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,520
I wish I could just intrude

529
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,980
illegally.

530
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,190
Hello. Do you work
at Spare Bowling Center?

531
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,480
You do?

532
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,280
I'm calling from
Cheongju Prosecution Service.

533
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,570
Hello? Hello?

534
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,030
She hung up.

535
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,160
Hello?

536
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,370
Did you work with Im Yu-ri?

537
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,130
This isn't voice phishing.
It's the prosecution service.

538
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,290
Do you know where your boss is?

539
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,170
Prosecutor Seo.

540
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,340
Can you come to
the bowling center now?

541
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,510
Now. Yes. Thank you.

542
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,430
Prosecutor Seo, the search warrant
on the victim's home in Seoul

543
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,140
you requested last night.

544
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,390
- Has it been approved?
- Yes, but

545
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,930
Prosecutor Jo took it.

546
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,100
Why did he?

547
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,520
He already headed to Seoul
with it.

548
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,940
People in that room told me.

549
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,650
Hey, you go.

550
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,110
- Me?
- What are you doing?

551
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,030
Oh.

552
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,070
Go.

553
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,370
The bowling center.

554
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

555
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,870
He even intercepts
other's warrants now?

556
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,630
Sir.

557
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,800
Can you talk?

558
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,720
I'm sorry, but I'm in a rush
to go somewhere.

559
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,640
Really?

560
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,100
I'll call you back.

561
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,930
No, it's nothing urgent.

562
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,980
I just wanted to check when you
were joining my company. Bye.

563
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,190
Sir.

564
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,820
Yes?

565
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,820
I promise to give you
good news soon.

566
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,360
Whether it's your work
or anywhere you go,

567
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,410
I'll be the junior

568
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,200
you're proud to introduce.

569
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,410
I can be one.

570
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,120
Please wait.

571
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,580
Sure. Good luck.

572
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,710
Be careful.

573
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,670
Yes!

574
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,720
Why do I have a bad feeling
about it?

575
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,430
Did you get a hold of your boss?

576
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,270
He doesn't pick up.

577
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,350
Do you have the key?

578
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,360
Sir?

579
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,200
Do you know where your boss lives?

580
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,240
No.

581
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,050
What are you doing?
I have to clean that up.

582
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,090
Check if the surveillance camera
caught your boss' face.

583
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,180
Okay.

584
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,350
The person you've reached is
unavailable. Please leave...

585
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,080
Yes, I know the bowling center.

586
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,660
What?

587
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,210
No need for CSI.
We have the device too.

588
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,250
I'm outside the city
at the moment.

589
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,790
I'll send someone else.

590
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,090
- What for?
- One second.

591
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,410
I am the father of the student
who was the suspect

592
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,200
of the recent Cheongju
gun death incident.

593
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,250
For being the first one
to find the dead friend,

594
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,830
he was arrested on the spot.

595
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,330
After being confined
with no evidence,

596
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,590
my son finally returned
to my arms today.

597
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,090
And he was cleared
from his murder suspicion.

598
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,050
As you know, the victim was

599
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,010
the family of a Cheongju officer.

600
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,720
A detective captain's daughter.

601
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,640
As a father myself,

602
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,270
I understand his grief.

603
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,770
However,

604
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,610
the murder suspicion wasn't
enough, the police framed my son

605
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,570
for selling drugs.

606
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,980
- Why?
- Drugs?

607
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,530
Because the victim faced
a tragic death

608
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,610
for selling drugs.

609
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,580
A detective captain's daughter
sold drugs.

610
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,950
That's what the police were
trying to hide.

611
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,370
I didn't believe it at first.

612
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,710
Until I heard it
from my son's own mouth.

613
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,340
Your one and only mistake was

614
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,430
falling for a girl
you shouldn't have.

615
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,270
Nam Gyeo-rye, listen carefully.

616
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,560
You had no idea.

617
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,110
Im Yu-ri said she threw away
the drugs, and you took it.

618
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,030
You never have imagined
she'd sold them.

619
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,240
'I should've stopped her
more actively.'

620
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,530
'I regret it.'

621
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,820
'But Yu-ri told me
not to be tacky.'

622
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,040
'Yu-ri often asked me
to lend her money.'

623
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,230
It was me who failed
to protect Yu-ri.

624
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,230
I never expected her
to sell the drugs alone.

625
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,610
Yu-ri

626
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,730
knew my family had a gun

627
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,450
all along.

628
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,240
So she asked for the gun.

629
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,620
If I hadn't given that to her,

630
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,540
she...

631
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,460
She said she'd trade them
for money,

632
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,590
but I never expected her
to sell them.

633
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,220
Do you know what the detective
in charge told him?

634
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,140
'When you go to prison,'

635
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,560
'stinky old men will adore you.'

636
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,310
How can the police say that?

637
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,900
You never let me down,
Nam Wan-seong.

638
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,610
The coercive investigation
and human right violation

639
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,990
during his confinement.
I will keep fighting

640
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,950
to reveal that.

641
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,990
Whether it's the police

642
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,750
or the prosecutors.

643
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,920
In the name of father.

644
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,630
He didn't only take
the memory card

645
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,390
but smashed it.

646
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,810
Do you have a picture
with your boss?

647
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,890
Who takes a picture
with their boss?

648
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,390
Have you taken pictures before
at work?

649
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,940
- Yes.
- Can you look for it?

650
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,900
Okay.

651
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,650
Hi.
I'm from Cheongju Police Station.

652
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,070
- Did you bring it?
- Yes, here.

653
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,610
(CAS : MDMA)

654
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,780
MDMA.

655
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,070
- Ecstasy.
- Yes.

656
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,540
This is where it began.

657
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,140
Starting with Im Yu-ri's death

658
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,600
and the drug cartel.

659
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,480
Prosecutor Seo.

660
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,540
Wait till I make it in
the supreme office after this.

661
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,500
You're no longer my senior.

662
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,210
Investigator, what is it?

663
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,300
Prosecutor Jo, Mr. Kang's car
the prof took off with.

664
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,470
Did you find it? Where is it?

665
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,510
Pyeongtaek.
I'll send you the location.

666
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,850
Okay.

667
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,220
Pyeongtaek.

668
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,480
Guiding to a new destination.

669
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,560
(West Cheongju)

670
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,990
Omitted from promotion.

671
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,950
Excluded from contribution.

672
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,580
You don't have to come
if you don't feel like it.

673
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,490
Yes.

674
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,500
I'd always been excluded.

675
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,330
But...

676
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,670
MDMA.

677
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,790
Ecstasy.

678
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,510
Now, I'm the only one
who knows it.

679
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,060
It was all for this day.

680
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,770
For me to greet a day like this.

681
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,310
Let's go. Let's go.

682
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,810
I'm going

683
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,690
to the supreme office.
