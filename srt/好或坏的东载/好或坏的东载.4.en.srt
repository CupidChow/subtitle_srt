(All child actors were shot
under supervision)

3
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,100
Im Yu-ri, are you sleeping?

4
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,690
Seriously. Look at the time.

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,030
She has no idea
how wild this world is.

6
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,050
Please.

7
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,690

(Dongjae, The Good or the Bad)

11
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,540
Ugh.

12
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,790
Hello?

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,880
Hello? Yu-ri?

14
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,300
Im Yu-ri.

15
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,430
(Episode 4)

16
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,060
Yes, we just reached the scene.

17
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,310
We'll take a look around.

18
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,700
Where are we? In the USA?

19
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,780
How can there be a gunshot report?

20
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,950
What's wrong?

21
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,510
A man...

22
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,190
Stop right there.

23
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,070
Freeze.

24
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,570
Stop! Don't move.

25
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,820
- Stop, you prick.
- Stop right there.

26
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,200
Hey!

27
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,830
Damn it.

28
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,920
Stay still.

29
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
Freeze.

30
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,050
Damn it.

31
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,840
It's my son.

32
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,010
(Son)

33
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,800
What's up?

34
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,100
Is this Nam Gyeo-rye's guardian?

35
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,850
(Son)

36
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,150
Who's this?

37
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,360
(Exit)

38
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,990
He's arrested for killing someone?

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,490
He didn't kill anyone.

40
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,950
- So hurry up.
- For what?

41
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,830
How am I supposed to get involved?

42
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,790
Should I say a senior prosecutor
ran there after your call?

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,300
Then send Seo Dong-jae at least.

44
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,920
- CEO Nam.
- Just send him as I say, damn it!

45
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,390
No.

46
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,270
I'm sorry. My apologies, ma'am.

47
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,810
Pass this to Seo Dong-jae.

48
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,060
I'll write a testimony

49
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,400
that your brother

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,610
caused no harm to my company

51
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,150
and that he covered
all the damage.

52
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,110
I'm

53
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,370
begging you, ma'am.

54
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,420
(Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae)

55
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,840
(Boss)

56
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,970
Yes, boss.

57
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,260
Can you talk? Where are you?

58
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm on my way to the dorm...

59
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,720
That's great.

60
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,980
We got a gun death report
near your location.

61
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,480
What? Gun death?

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,690
It's a restricted
development site.

63
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,520
You're the closest.
You should go check.

64
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,110
Me?

65
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,990
Okay.

66
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,740
I'm on my way. Yes.

67
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,820
Bye.

68
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,830
Is this Texas or what? Gun death?

69
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,710
Why would she give me that case?

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,390
Huh?

71
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,400
He's...

72
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,030
CEO Nam's son.

73
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,410
Thank you for your work.

74
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,400
Isn't he handsome?

75
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,290
I heard the suspect was arrested.

76
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,290
Yes.

77
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,120
How?

78
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,130
When we found the body,

79
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,250
the suspect took off,
so we captured him right away.

80
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,550
Here? Next to the body?

81
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,720
- Yes.
- Okay.

82
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,720
- What's the weapon?
- A shotgun.

83
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,800
A shotgun?

84
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,010
- You mean a gun?
- Yes.

85
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,100
But we haven't found
the weapon yet.

86
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,560
The suspect was here.
The weapon must be in the area.

87
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,520
Have you identified
the victim yet?

88
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,940
Captain, let me handle it, please?
Can somebody...

89
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,110
Hey, don't let him in.

90
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,030
Cap, wait.

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,240
- Captain.
- What's wrong?

92
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,950
Well,

93
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,320
it's his daughter.

94
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,740
Captain.

95
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,290
Captain.

96
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,130
Captain.

97
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,690
She died on the spot
after getting shot in her back.

98
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,850
A shotgun.

99
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,440
A shotgun?

100
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,910
Then was it...

101
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,290
Yes, boss. Gun Death?

102
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,540
Geez.

103
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,210
It was CEO Nam's influence.

104
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,040
(Nam Wan-seong)

105
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,800
He was desperate to reach me.

106
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,220
What did he say?

107
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,430
Then I should ask Prosecutor Seo.

108
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,600
Thank you, ma'am.

109
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,100
Thank you. Bye.

110
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,270
Hey. Wait.

111
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,230
Prosecutor Seo.

112
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,230
We need to talk.

113
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,940
Damn it.

114
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,980
Look. I just want to talk.

115
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,940
Wait. What happened?

116
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,610
Why did they arrest my son?

117
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,030
Telling me to leak
the ongoing investigation process?

118
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,990
To the guardian of the suspect who
got arrested without a warrant?

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,200
No.

120
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,160
Here's what we'll do.

121
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,710
So...

122
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,970
The land and everything.
I'll call them all off, yeah?

123
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,180
Goddamn it.

124
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,810
Do you know whom your son killed?

125
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,270
I can tell you that much.

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
She was

127
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,740
the captain's daughter
in this police station.

128
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,410
Wait. That's...

129
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,160
The investigation team will tell
you the rest against your will.

130
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,210
And about the weapon as well.

131
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,080
Wait. I can save my son,

132
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,840
and you can solve your issue...

133
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Mr. Nam Wan-seong.

134
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,380
I didn't expect to see you here.

135
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,090
And you as well, Prosecutor Seo.

136
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,260
Where's my son?

137
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,010
Why are you tormenting
an innocent boy?

138
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,180
As officers?

139
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,350
Cut the crap.
You're coming with us.

140
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,310
- To where?
- To your house.

141
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,390
(Cheongju Police Station)

142
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,560
What's this?

143
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,810
A warrant.

144
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,480
That was quick.
Thank you for your work.

145
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,110
What does that warrant
have to do with it?

146
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,820
Why are you going to my house?
What for?

147
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,910
Hey, you have a firearm at home,
don't you?

148
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,570
A hunting rifle.

149
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,160
- Why didn't you return it?
- Let's go.

150
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,370
Come with me.

151
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,330
He said something about
solving a problem.

152
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,420
What was that?

153
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,000
- Can you go with him?
- What? Why?

154
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,850
Hey, open your mouth.

155
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,810
Hey. Raise your head.

156
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,770
Open.

157
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,410
What the hell are you glaring at?
We haven't even started yet.

158
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,870
Hey.

159
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,250
No matter how much
your attorney costs

160
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,960
or pretend to be mental,

161
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,550
we're going to send you to prison

162
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,260
and make you
pay for your crime.

163
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,630
You're 18.

164
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
You're not juvenile anymore,
are you?

165
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,800
Your good old days are now over.

166
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,140
When a kid like you
ends up in prison,

167
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,180
stinky old men will adore you,
you know that?

168
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,230
It wasn't

169
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
me.

170
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,320
I didn't do it.

171
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
You didn't do it?

172
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,160
Hey, what the hell was that?

173
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,030
You didn't do it?

174
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Sir.

175
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,960
Hey, get up.

176
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,210
Get up, idiot.

177
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,250
Follow me.

178
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,640
Why did you kill her?

179
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,600
Why did you kill her
all the way there?

180
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
No surveillance cameras
or witnesses.

181
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,310
Did you think it was perfect
for your crime?

182
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,310
Wait.

183
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,940
How can the first thing you ask
be why he killed her?

184
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,520
Not what happened?

185
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,400
You're implying that he did it.

186
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,650
Who's the one
that got caught running away

187
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,740
on site covered
in the victim's blood?

188
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,780
Do you have any idea how
frightened he was to see the body?

189
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,160
He's only in high school.

190
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,580
If someone chases you
in that situation,

191
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,290
anyone will run away for sure.

192
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,250
He was shocked to find
a dead body by chance,

193
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,330
then the police appeared.

194
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,000
Then you'd ask for help.

195
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,750
Why run away
when he didn't do anything wrong?

196
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,550
Hey, why did you kill her? Say it.

197
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,840
You called Im Yu-ri

198
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,050
eight times in a row.

199
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,850
You called her eight times
when she wasn't picking up--

200
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,350
He kept calling because
she didn't pick up.

201
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,930
What's wrong about calling her
eight times?

202
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,730
How did he know the victim was
there when she didn't pick up?

203
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,650
Oh, is that why you tracked
her location?

204
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,440
It was all on your phone.

205
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,860
You tracked Im Yu-ri's location,
didn't you?

206
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,900
Because...

207
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,030
Were you upset? Because she
ignored your calls eight times?

208
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,660
One doesn't just kill
for knowing the location.

209
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,080
You're grilling him
with speculations.

210
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,210
If you continue--

211
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,170
Did your father
put the gun in your hand?

212
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,290
For you to use it
when killing people?

213
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,750
What are you talking about?

214
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,380
No matter whose daughter it is,
don't cross the line.

215
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,170
Have you found the weapon yet?

216
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,680
We're still looking for it.

217
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
If he hadn't given it to you,
did you sneak it out?

218
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,760
Did you know Nam Wan-seong had
a gun license?

219
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,180
The hunting rifle.

220
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,520
Check if it's safe in his house.

221
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,530
I've lost it.

222
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,830
It's gone.

223
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,710
Damn it.

224
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,420
It looks like the father needs
an attorney too.

225
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,550
If you still haven't found it yet,

226
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,180
do you think he abandoned it
somewhere far away?

227
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,350
Why did he come back to the scene?

228
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,720
I'm not sure.

229
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,100
Why check it?

230
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,770
If you've found the gun,

231
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,230
compare the number on it
to the license.

232
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,990
Oh. I know.

233
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,740
You couldn't find the weapon.

234
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,760
Wait. One second.

235
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,520
I'll come back early tomorrow.

236
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,060
Don't say a word.

237
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,940
Not when you're alone, okay?

238
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,440
You can talk to him later.
You're dismissed.

239
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,400
Mr. Nam Gyeo-rye.

240
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,610
Let's talk.

241
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,200
Look at me, will you?

242
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,210
Was that you?

243
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,960
What happened to your face?

244
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,670
Did that guy do that to you?

245
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,670
Is that why Yu-ri was bruised
and wounded?

246
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,260
And you chased her
all the way to the hospital?

247
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,840
I fell while I was in a rush.

248
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,260
What are you going to do now?

249
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,760
You said they saw your face.

250
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,600
Yet that wasn't enough,

251
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,810
you brought a gun to kill her?

252
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,770
You were carrying a gun
in front of your house, no?

253
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,110
I saw you carrying it,
so spill it out.

254
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,690
Where's the gun?

255
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,990
Where did you hide it?

256
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,160
Huh?

257
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,040
Detective Jung.

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,960
Take him to jail, please.

259
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,340
Come with me.

260
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Wait.

261
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,560
What gun?
What do you know about this?

262
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,060
Oh.

263
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,690
It looked like
a tennis racket bag.

264
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,730
It was about this big.
It was green.

265
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,730
Around 8:30 p.m.,

266
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,150
the suspect was carrying it
in front of his house and

267
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,150
I happened to see it.

268
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,700
I see.

269
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,200
Your next question is
why I went to his house?

270
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,910
Why I went to the suspect's house

271
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,670
even before the incident occurred?

272
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,710
You know it.

273
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,540
- Can I have your business card?
- My business card?

274
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,380
I'll ask you to check it
if we find the bag.

275
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,510
Okay.

276
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,760
What's your name, detective?

277
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,930
Detective Kim Hyung-woo.

278
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,770
I'm Seo Dong-jae.

279
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,310
Are you on Captain Im's team?

280
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,150
Were you close to the victim?

281
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,610
No.

282
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,440
She was my captain's daughter.
That's about it.

283
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,070
Right.

284
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,280
Okay.

285
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,330
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

286
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,280
That lunatic took it for real.

287
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,410
- Yes, CEO Nam.
- Where are you?

288
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,710
I just left the police station.

289
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,920
Sir, the police said the gun--

290
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,750
Go back and find out
where he put it.

291
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,750
Tell him to confess
where he hid the gun

292
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,420
and I'll handle it!

293
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,890
Last night in Cheongju,

294
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,770
a high school student died
in a horrible gun accident.

295
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,940
The police went to check

296
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,610
after receiving a gunshot report,

297
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,070
but the victim was
already found dead.

298
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,900
You're back. Have you had lunch?

299
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,740
- Don't mind me.
- Died from excessive bleeding.

300
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,490
The place you see behind me is

301
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,790
where an 18-year-old Ms. Im died

302
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,290
by a gunshot last night.

303
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,080
When the police went to check
after a gunshot was reported,

304
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,300
they arrested a male suspect

305
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,670
about 50m away from the scene.

306
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,970
However, the suspect is
remaining silent

307
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,800
about his criminal intent.

308
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,680
On the other hand,
the suspect's father

309
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,270
did not return the hunting rifle,

310
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,860
yet the police station in charge
was not aware of it.

311
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Some say the negligence
of the gun management

312
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,860
by the police may have caused it.

313
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,990
In response...

314
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,450
I heard you received a chunk.

315
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,290
Yes.

316
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,660
Did someone else receive it?

317
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,460
I had no idea it'd arrived.

318
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,330
I met Mr. Kang.

319
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,170
You went all the way to Seoul
to pick it up?

320
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
In person?

321
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,890
He was here.

322
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,350
Has he ever visited himself
before to deliver the goods?

323
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,980
What?

324
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,360
The food is getting cold.

325
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,210
Then we can start selling again.

326
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,090
When are you meeting Mr. Won
for a deal?

327
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,800
When he begs me.

328
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,300
I knew kids these days were scary,

329
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,390
but I never expected to see a gun.

330
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,600
They're way ahead of our time.

331
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,270
The daughter of a man who visited
our building just the other day

332
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,640
died like that.

333
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,690
We should show our condolences.

334
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,690
We may not know the victim,
but we should still go.

335
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,230
It's the daughter of a detective
in our district.

336
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,690
We know her already.

337
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,150
You've all seen her before
at least once.

338
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,450
We've seen Captain Im's
daughter before?

339
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,910
You know the part-timer
at the bowling alley?

340
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,030
Did you know she was his daughter?

341
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,910
No, I was surprised
to see her portrait too.

342
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,750
Did you visit her funeral already?

343
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,830
Yes.

344
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,840
Who wants to be in charge
when we get this case?

345
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,230
It's never easy just because
the suspect is obvious.

346
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,350
The police have emotions too.

347
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,350
Check the sentence.

348
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,730
We can't even give him a long
sentence because he's a student.

349
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,650
He killed a captain's daughter.
You can't be loose either.

350
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,150
I don't think
the suspect is obvious.

351
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,030
Why not?

352
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,660
The suspect who was arrested
on site didn't have the weapon.

353
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,740
Maybe he threw it out.

354
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,000
If it was abandoned too far
to find it,

355
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,790
why did he come back
to the scene?

356
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,210
Do I have to remind you
that the suspect always

357
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,880
- returns to the site?
- But--

358
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,670
But, my ass. You're just a newbie.

359
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,720
The suspect was covered
in the victim's blood.

360
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,260
What?

361
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,430
If he came back like that, he was
basically asking to be arrested.

362
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,310
Maybe he dropped
something important?

363
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,480
No.

364
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,100
Nothing important was found yet.

365
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,530
How do you know everything
so well?

366
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,320
Did CEO Nam tell you?

367
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,740
Hey, Jo Byung-gun.

368
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh, I was just joking.

369
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,120
Boss.

370
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,830
When you told me to go check it,

371
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,170
did you know
it was Captain Im's daughter?

372
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,130
No.

373
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,760
I knew you called me

374
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,590
because it was a gun death, right?

375
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,890
Yes.

376
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,180
It's her and CEO Nam's
collaboration for sure.

377
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,730
Get him out.
Then I'll call it off.

378
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,650
The land and everything.
I'll call them all off, yeah?

379
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,270
They thought I'd be helpless
because of the land.

380
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,940
It's true that it's a picky case.

381
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,570
If we assign it to a newbie,

382
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,990
the police would think
we're not taking it seriously

383
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,910
when a detective's
daughter's dead.

384
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,280
It can't be someone who keeps
picking a fight with the police.

385
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,500
So a veteran

386
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,340
who gets along in the world
should be assigned.

387
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,090
Oh.

388
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,890
That will be me.

389
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,430
I'll take the case, boss.

390
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,480
Did you all know Prosecutor Seo
became the model prosecutor?

391
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,070
Because we haven't had the awards
due to COVID-19,

392
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,860
this time, it'll be held
in the supreme office.

393
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,700
You're dismissed.

394
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,930
Prosecutor Seo.

395
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,230
Yes.

396
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,730
(Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae)

397
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,150
Prosecutor Seo, did you check
the photo? Is that the one?

398
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,030
Yes, that's the bag,
but why did the victim have it?

399
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,950
That's my question.

400
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,280
Yu-ri used to work here.

401
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,290
- The bowling alley?
- You know it already?

402
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,080
That means the suspect grabbed
the gun from his house

403
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,750
and gave it to Yu-ri.

404
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,090
But he

405
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,510
took the gun back
and shot her with it.

406
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,800
Yu-ri first received it
without a clue

407
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,220
then she realized it was a gun.

408
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,470
So what if the boy took it back

409
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,930
from her by force?

410
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,640
Kill her because she found out
that it was a gun?

411
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,600
Because the victim accused him
of having a gun?

412
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,650
That doesn't make any sense.

413
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,230
We've proved that the suspect

414
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,980
took the gun bag
to the bowling alley.

415
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,650
He paid the cab with his card
when he went there.

416
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,990
Just a few hours
before the incident.

417
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,450
Other evidence says

418
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,490
the suspect gave it to Yu-ri.

419
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,660
What other evidence?

420
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,830
Was Gyeo-rye close to Yu-ri?

421
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,330
I'm not sure about that,

422
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,090
but Yu-ri was close to Ji-hyun.

423
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,210
I wasn't close to her. I just
sat next to her a few times.

424
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,970
You should ask Kim Ye-jin.

425
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,590
Gyeo-rye used to wait for Yu-ri
after school.

426
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,180
How did Gyeo-rye and Yu-ri look
together?

427
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,850
I think he liked her.

428
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,980
But Yu-ri...

429
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,520
Maybe he became angry

430
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,360
because Yu-ri wouldn't accept
his heart.

431
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,820
Yet, that still doesn't explain

432
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,650
why the gun bag was moved

433
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,410
from Im Yu-ri to Nam Gyeo-rye.

434
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,030
Enough with the bag.
What about the weapon?

435
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,030
Not yet.

436
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,790
Even though you searched
all night long?

437
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,410
Yes, even though we searched
all night long.

438
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,540
We're expanding the area.

439
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,040
Anything new with Nam Gyeo-rye?

440
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,380
He won't say a word.
His mouth is shut tight.

441
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,340
Okay.

442
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Perhaps they traded it
in the bowling alley?

443
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,260
They wouldn't have done that
in front of everyone.

444
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,020
Damn it. I'll have to go check.

445
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,240
(Spare Bowling Center)

446
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,580
(Temporarily closed)

447
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,120
Shoot.

448
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,930
Huh?

449
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,510
Excuse me.

450
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,180
Hello?

451
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,730
Excuse me.

452
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,940
Wait.
I'm from the prosecution service.

453
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,990
Can I talk to you for a second?

454
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,210
You remind me of a grocery store
owner from my old town.

455
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,250
You can have all you want.

456
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,260
Oh, I'm good.

457
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,150
Oh, yes. Thank you.

458
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,530
We've been here many times before.

459
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,120
This is the first time
to see it closed.

460
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,580
How can I open it

461
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,880
after what happened
to that young girl?

462
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,300
What a world.

463
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,340
Thank you for this.

464
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,480
Are you okay? Sir...

465
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,510
You shouldn't drink with...

466
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,480
You shouldn't smoke either.

467
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,150
The police came by

468
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,610
and took the surveillance camera
and all.

469
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,200
And they asked me

470
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,120
about Yu-ri's friend.
The yellow hair.

471
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,910
Did that yellow hair

472
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,670
come here to meet Yu-ri yesterday?

473
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,170
I happened to leave
early yesterday.

474
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,220
You wouldn't know if the blond
gave her the gun.

475
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,520
- The gun?
- Yes.

476
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,060
The police found that
he brought a gun here in a bag

477
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,690
from a surveillance camera.

478
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,070
No, it's okay.

479
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,860
I called the cab.

480
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,710
Excuse me?

481
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,800
Sir?

482
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,920
Sir?

483
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,850
I need to get some sleep.

484
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,930
What?

485
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,180
No.

486
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,770
Sir?

487
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,020
Finish your sentence first.

488
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,400
Sir?

489
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,900
Sir, can you...

490
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,200
There he is.

491
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,620
Hello.

492
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,710
Where's Mr. Seo?

493
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,340
He's working outside.

494
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,800
He's always so busy.

495
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,590
After you, ma'am.

496
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,640
Go ahead. Something came up.

497
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,070
When did you get it?
Why didn't you tell me?

498
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
I had no idea.

499
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,530
Geum-ho picked it up by himself.

500
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,530
When are you resuming the deals?
And where?

501
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,990
I don't know yet.
The address changes every day.

502
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,830
I'll let you know
when it's decided.

503
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,870
Yes.

504
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,500
Just wait until I wipe your ass,
you jerks.

505
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,350
(Sunkookkwan)

506
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,810
What the hell?

507
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
CEO Nam, a word, please.

508
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,070
Isn't the murder suspect your son?

509
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,660
Why did you not return the gun?

510
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,080
Did you know the gun was gone?

511
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,950
Any word to the victim's family?

512
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,470
It won't be recorded
while I'm here.

513
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,180
Feel free to talk to him.

514
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,700
Son.

515
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,620
Where's the gun?

516
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,870
I need to know where it is,
so I can get rid of it.

517
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,040
Where did you hide it?

518
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,750
I didn't hide it.

519
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,550
I didn't do it.

520
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,720
Are you not going to
tell me either?

521
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,220
I'm not mad at you,
so tell me already.

522
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
I didn't do it.

523
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,100
Nam Gyeo-rye.

524
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,810
Look at me.

525
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,270
Look at me, Nam Gyeo-rye.

526
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,860
Nam Gyeo-rye, look...

527
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,610
Look at your dad, you prick.

528
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,790
Keep that attitude.

529
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,790
No matter what they say,
just say no.

530
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,540
Even if you threaten you,
say you didn't do it.

531
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,130
I'll take care of the rest.

532
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,840
Okay.

533
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,920
I also chose your prosecutor.

534
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,260
A guy named Seo Dong-jae
will be here.

535
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,180
He's coming here to set you free,

536
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,050
so endure it
for just one more day, okay?

537
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,760
Look.

538
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,890
You're in Cheongju.

539
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,150
Even prosecutors move

540
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,770
like pawns upon my order
in Cheongju.

541
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,320
So no need to be scared.
Whatever they say,

542
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,150
keep your mouth shut.

543
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,780
The prosecutor will dismiss
everything, okay?

544
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,530
Okay.

545
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,540
So

546
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,460
where's the gun?

547
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,630
I told you. I didn't do it.

548
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,300
You really didn't?

549
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,100
I... I didn't kill her.

550
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,110
That's all that matters.

551
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,990
You didn't do it.

552
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,830
Yes. It's going to be all right.

553
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,330
Mr. Nam Wan-seong?

554
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,670
- Take him.
- Follow me.

555
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,670
Will you come with me?

556
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,010
To where? Why?

557
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,800
For violating the firearm
safety management.

558
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,930
You haven't written a report yet.

559
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,100
It won't take long, sir.

560
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,060
Well,
we'll have to see about that.

561
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,350
Wait.

562
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,770
I'll tell you what to write
in the report.

563
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,030
Oh, hello.

564
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,030
You're finally here.

565
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,200
Are you here to meet my son?

566
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,910
Yes, of course.

567
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,790
Now I'm finally relieved.

568
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,000
Have you talked to your boss too?

569
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,590
Yes, of course.

570
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,630
He happens to be in there.
You should go talk to him.

571
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,510
Gyeo-rye is waiting for you too.

572
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,680
You told him about me?

573
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,720
Of course.
You're the prosecutor in charge.

574
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,770
The case hasn't been
forwarded yet,

575
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,060
and the prosecutor in charge has
been determined already?

576
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,360
As you know,

577
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,030
it's a special case.

578
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,410
What's so special about it?

579
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,910
The victim was
the captain's family.

580
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
It sure is special.

581
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,830
Very special

582
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,340
and very important, yeah?

583
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,470
If the suspect knows me,

584
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,260
it shouldn't take long.

585
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,010
Bye now.

586
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,760
Please do your best.

587
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,220
Thank you.

588
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,390
- Come with me.
- Watch out.

589
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,900
This way.

590
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,670
A guy named Seo Dong-jae
will be here.

591
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,550
He's coming here to set you free,

592
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,340
so endure it
for just one more day, okay?

593
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,880
(Seo Dong-jae)

594
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,720
Are you keeping your mouth shut
without saying a word?

595
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,730
For what?

596
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,690
Thinking your dad got your back?

597
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,730
You think his petty power
can save your ass?

598
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,940
If that's why you're keeping
your mouth shut,

599
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,360
stay that way.

600
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,910
What can I do?
You're asking to doom your life.

601
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,450
Even prosecutors move

602
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,580
like pawns upon my order
in Cheongju.

603
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,080
You're in the center
of everything.

604
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,210
All evidence is pointing at you.

605
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,250
So no need to be scared.
Whatever they say,

606
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,210
keep your mouth shut.

607
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,670
You're the murderer.

608
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,590
The prosecutor will dismiss
everything, okay?

609
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,260
Both evidence and suspicion
prove this case better.

610
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,010
Yet you say no excuse

611
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,760
or deny your crime?

612
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,430
That works for me. I already have
enough on my plate as it is now.

613
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,390
In fact, I've seen you

614
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,190
stalking her.

615
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,570
She even sneaked
into my hospital room

616
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,110
when I was a complete stranger
just to avoid you.

617
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,610
I'm going to prosecute you

618
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
and reveal every detail in court.

619
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,740
How much you disgusted her.

620
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,580
How you battered that small girl.

621
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,620
I didn't do it.

622
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,830
What do you mean no?
Stop getting on my nerves.

623
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,210
Do you want me to do this
the old way?

624
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,790
I'm going to prolong it. Why?

625
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,840
Because you're graduating soon.

626
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,050
I'll wait
until you become an adult

627
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,800
and give you life.

628
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,130
I didn't kill...

629
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,180
The murderer who killed
a high school girl in 2010.

630
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,430
He received life
after becoming an adult.

631
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,930
The murderer who assaulted and
killed a middle schooler in 2016.

632
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,890
He received life
on top of aggravated assault.

633
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,730
I'll do the same for you.

634
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,190
When a kid like you
ends up in prison,

635
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,440
stinky old men will adore you,
you know that?

636
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,910
Yu-ri...

637
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,490
She said she'd sell everything
at once.

638
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,170
We picked it up at the terminal.

639
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,840
We weren't planning to do that.

640
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
We were too scared to return it.

641
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,970
Then Yu-ri...

642
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,560
She wanted to sell it
for the last time.

643
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,640
I tried to stop her.

644
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,310
Sell what?

645
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,860
The drug.

646
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,860
The drug? The drug drug?

647
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,240
Where did you get the drug?
And how?

648
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,660
We picked it up.

649
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,910
From where?

650
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,910
The terminal.

651
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,250
We tried to return the bag...

652
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,460
The drug was in the bag.

653
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,040
And Yu-ri was next to you.

654
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,960
You don't know
who the bag belonged to?

655
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,170
If you found that,
you should've reported it

656
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
or thrown it out.
How could you sell it?

657
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,350
How can you be so thoughtless?

658
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,680
How did you sell it?

659
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,930
I received orders via app
and left it in designated places.

660
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,850
Yu-ri.

661
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,350
(Want to buy 3 doses)

662
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,700
So she went to sell it
for the last time

663
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,990
and got killed?

664
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,120
In the place she meant to meet the
one who offered to buy everything?

665
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,540
Who was it?

666
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,290
What do you mean you don't know?
You were there too.

667
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,500
You were with her.

668
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,790
If you are...

669
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,380
If what you just said is true,

670
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,630
you ran for your life alone
when Yu-ri was dying.

671
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,720
No, I told her not to do it.

672
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,470
We should drop it
because it was too dangerous.

673
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,520
But she went alone in secret,
so I followed her.

674
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,770
That's why I gave her the gun
in case she might get hurt.

675
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,280
In case Yu-ri might get hurt.

676
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,430
Look at me. Look.

677
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,510
How much did you have left?

678
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,220
The amount Yu-ri took
for the last deal.

679
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,110
- Did you find it with the body?
- No.

680
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,190
Did you receive orders through
the messenger on your phone?

681
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,400
So did you delete everything?

682
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,570
I set it to disappear
after some time.

683
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,610
What's the chance of the bag owner

684
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,370
being the last person
who offered to buy everything?

685
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,330
He doesn't

686
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,620
know about us.

687
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,160
Hey, you stupid idiot.

688
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,000
With that amount,
the owner of the bag

689
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,750
must've been from some clique.

690
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,590
He's not selling it by himself.

691
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,460
When he lost it,
he couldn't sell anymore.

692
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,800
He'd be suspected
and was desperate to find his stuff.

693
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,130
You think a drug clique
couldn't find you?

694
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,760
In this small town?

695
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,810
The date and time.

696
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,230
When did you find the bag?

697
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,020
September 7.

698
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,150
Around 2 p.m..

699
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,150
- Where are you going?
- To the terminal.

700
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,780
Captain,
this prick opened his mouth.

701
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Yu-ri was...

702
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,970
Let's go. Hurry up, please.

703
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:41,810
Damn it.

704
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,940
Shoot.

705
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,070
That lunatic...

706
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,370
Shoot.

707
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,700
What about the drugs?

708
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,580
Freaking scumbag.

709
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,180
Making things up.

710
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,300
How dare he try to frame her?

711
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,300
The owner of the bag
must've been from some clique.

712
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,170
When he lost it,
he couldn't sell anymore.

713
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,220
He'd be suspected.

714
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,970
It began spreading fast
about a year or two ago

715
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,560
and disappeared recently.

716
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,600
The new kind of ecstasy
that suddenly disappeared.

717
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,980
No, it's a simple supply issue.

718
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,980
Not because they were worried
about us.

719
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,060
Were they the reason
for the shortage of supplies?

720
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,280
The new kind of ecstasy.
What was its name again?

721
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,190
It began spreading fast
about a year or two ago...

722
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,450
Purple.

723
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
Oh, hello.

724
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,380
Can you take me
to the security room?

725
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,050
This way.

726
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,170
Thank you.

727
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,560
Hello?

728
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,560
- Nam Gyeo-rye wasn't lying.
- Did you find the drug?

729
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,850
Not the drug, but money.
In the victim's room.

730
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,270
Okay.

731
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,650
I called you
because it might be true

732
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,070
that they found it
at the terminal.

733
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,690
Okay.
I'm at the terminal right now.

734
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,110
I'm on my way. See you soon.

735
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,780
Wait.

736
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,660
Do you know by any chance
if they were selling Purple?

737
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,160
What? What does this
have to do with Purple?

738
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,160
What? It can't be Purple
or something?

739
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,250
I'll meet you there soon.

740
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,500
What the hell?
How far is this going?

741
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,810
I can't wait until the bus leaves.

742
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,350
Let's just take the cab.

743
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,520
To Daejeon? Are you crazy?

744
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,270
You think it's not crazy to go
all the way to Daejeon for bread?

745
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,690
If we just take the cab...

746
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,980
Goddamn it.

747
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,070
What?
