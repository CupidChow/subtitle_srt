- Don't touch me.
- You little...

11
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,320
Unhand me.

12
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,820
Be quiet. Come with us in peace.

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,950
Hey, stop.

14
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,840
Shoot.

15
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,170
Stay still.

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Stop moving.

17
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,180
Is the person who ordered you
to kill and bury Park Jung-woo

18
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,100
in this court right now?

19
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Yes.

20
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,770
Was he at the scene
of the murder as well?

21
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,940
Yes.

22
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,690
Can you point at him?

23
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,870
Can you tell me the name
of the man you're pointing at?

24
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,710
Nam Wan-seong.

25
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,080
He ordered us to kill him.

26
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,720
Mr. Nam, this is what you said
during the investigation.

27
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,680
Yes, he was my secretary.

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,890
And those who ran away
worked for me.

29
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,600
I didn't deny that.

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,350
But how can you blame me

31
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,930
when they killed a man
and buried the body themselves?

32
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,230
It doesn't make any sense.

33
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,900
Why did you kill him
if he didn't order you?

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,150
I didn't do it.

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,190
I only went to
the construction site

36
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,990
because of my boss' order.

37
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,870
I didn't know what was there.

38
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,290
You didn't know what was buried

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,200
in the construction site?

40
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,420
I swear, sir.

41
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,670
In May, you knew

42
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,250
Park Jung-woo was buried in
the construction site, didn't you?

43
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,590
No.

44
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,880
Make sure he's not found.

45
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,220
Help.

46
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,010
It's not like I was there

47
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,220
or witnessed anything.

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,770
How am I supposed to know?

49
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,100
Moving it

50
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,480
could be shooting myself
in the foot.

51
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,320
Grind it on the spot.

52
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,900
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,240
You think that makes sense?

54
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,160
Here.

55
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,330
These men.

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
Did you take them
to the construction site?

57
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,710
Yes.

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
And

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,300
these machines.

60
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,300
Did you use them
on the construction site?

61
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,020
Did you?

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,860
Yes.

63
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,700
You didn't know
what was buried there,

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,240
yet you took the cement breaker.

65
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,450
Because I was told
to break the cement.

66
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,080
- CEO Nam--
- What about the grinder?

67
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
That was...

68
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,290
I'm ashamed to say this,

69
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,500
but I thought I succeeded.

70
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,920
Is this the only way?

71
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,680
Tell him that
if he drops the charges,

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,260
he won't have to labor
for the rest of his life.

73
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,390
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,110
What made you think you succeeded?

75
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,940
Because Park Jung-woo
accepted the money

76
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,110
and promised to leave Cheongju.

77
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,280
Well done.

78
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,410
Thank you.

79
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,410
After that,

80
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,160
I never saw Park Jung-woo again.

81
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,790
So I thought it was over.

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,000
Until all these years,
I solved all issues with money,

83
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,920
and I thought this was the same.

84
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,300
When the rumor spread later,

85
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,340
I thought people were

86
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,680
just gossiping.

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,890
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,390
What rumor?

89
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,140
That I harmed Park Jung-woo.

90
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,060
You were investigated
multiple times until now.

91
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,980
But how come you never mentioned
about the money?

92
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,230
Your honor.

93
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,110
May I explain that?

94
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,490
Sure.

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,830
The defendant

96
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,080
tried to confess whether
to the prosecutors or the police

97
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,210
that he paid late Park.

98
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,670
And it was me who stopped him.

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,750
I told him not to confess.

100
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,760
Because it was obvious
his intention would be misused.

101
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,930
Why would it be misused?

102
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,800
I request a witness

103
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,050
to show how it'd been misused.

104
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,690
Nam Wan-seong requested
Park Chan-hyuk as a witness.

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,480
What? Does Park Chan-hyuk
have something to do with that?

106
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,400
- No.
- Then why?

107
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,650
He took back his testimony.
Nothing's in their favor.

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,950
I thought it was strange,

109
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,860
but I can see what he's thinking.

110
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,580
So everything you said
during the drug trial

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,790
was perjury?

112
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,370
Because Nam Wan-seong
threatened you,

113
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,420
you testified that
you didn't know Nam Gyeo-rye?

114
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,460
Is that what you mean?

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,130
Yes.

116
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,800
That man over there.

117
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,890
He threatened to kill me

118
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,980
just because I saw his son

119
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,400
selling drugs.

120
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,560
What else could I do?

121
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,320
How did you witness him
selling drugs?

122
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,530
Because you are the supplier.

123
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,530
Am I right?

124
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,120
You were arrested and detained
for selling drugs, weren't you?

125
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,500
You were in the detention center
until recently, weren't you?

126
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,500
What about now?

127
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,090
Did you come from
the detention center?

128
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,010
No.

129
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,380
He's the biggest problem.

130
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,720
I can pretend to be someone

131
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,050
who can't even kill a bug.

132
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,260
A letter of apology?

133
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,810
I can write hundreds of them.

134
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,640
But once Park Chan-hyuk blabbers

135
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,230
about how I threatened him
to death,

136
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,020
everything goes to waste.

137
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,520
But

138
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,650
it's not like I could retrieve
what he said.

139
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,160
If you received two apartment
units, you should.

140
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,870
You must refute any testimony

141
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,490
to make yourself worthwhile
as an attorney.

142
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,250
There's nothing I can do
when he's already set free.

143
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,920
Free? Park Chan-hyuk?

144
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,010
Yes.

145
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,060
So he's set free?

146
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,850
Cheongju prosecutors set
the drug offender Park free

147
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,690
without a trial who spread
a new type of drug

148
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,900
and even got students addicted

149
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,530
when that wasn't even
his first offense.

150
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,070
When was that?

151
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,490
When do you think that happened?

152
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,080
It was the very day
the witness testified

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,040
that Nam Wan-seong threatened him.

154
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,830
The prosecutors charged
the defendant of proxy murder,

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,920
but they knew there was
no direct evidence.

156
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,260
Then they changed their direction.

157
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,100
If the witness was threatened
to death...

158
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,310
Only if they could frame

159
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,020
the defendant

160
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,810
a man who habitually
threatens others' lives

161
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,350
when there was
no evidence or no witness

162
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,360
to prove the defendant's crime.

163
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,610
Mr. Park.

164
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,490
Did the prosecutors offer
to set you free

165
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,820
if you change your testimony?

166
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,620
That was--

167
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,580
That you've never met
Nam Wan-seong before.

168
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,790
The drug seller was Im Yu-ri.

169
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,090
Cheongju detective captain's
daughter Im Yu-ri

170
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,720
sold drugs.

171
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,260
That was his first testimony;

172
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,680
however, as soon as he testified
against the defendant,

173
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,100
he was set free.

174
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,510
Is that a coincidence?

175
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,350
No, right?

176
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,230
Did the prosecutors order you?

177
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,450
Witness, stop dragging on
and answer him.

178
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,120
They did, but--

179
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,710
The prosecutor who offered
to set you free.

180
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,250
Kidnapped you,

181
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,710
tortured you.

182
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,670
His name.

183
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,920
That's all you need to say.

184
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,460
Was it Seo Dong-jae?

185
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,720
He requested one more witness
along with Park Chan-hyuk.

186
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
You.

187
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,390
Nam Wan-seong requested you
as a witness.

188
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,270
Currently in Cheongju,
his biggest anti-fans are

189
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,310
Park Chan-hyuk and you.

190
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,020
And you two happen to be
the defendants' witnesses.

191
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,070
What we have in common is

192
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,400
that he clearly has something
on us.

193
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,120
The difference is...

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,750
You'd make Park Chan-hyuk
stand in the trial

195
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,380
even if Nam Wan-seong
doesn't bother.

196
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,420
But they know I wouldn't make you
stand in the trial.

197
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,920
Yet if they're dragging me
into this,

198
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,470
they think it'd favor him.

199
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
They're not making things worse,

200
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,800
but I have a lot to offer to them.

201
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,310
I can see what I have for them,

202
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,610
But no one knows whether
that will be

203
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,200
a game-changer for them or us.

204
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,160
What do you do for a living?

205
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,250
I'm a prosecutor
from Cheongju District Office.

206
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,370
Your name?

207
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,710
Seo Dong-jae.

208
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,880
No.

209
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
Don't you know your name
and what you do for a living?

210
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,460
You're a construction site laborer

211
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,090
Hwang Si-mok.

212
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,510
A man named Hwang Si-mok was

213
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,760
hired
as a construction site laborer.

214
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,520
He hovered around
a prohibited area

215
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,850
and kept questioning
about the construction site.

216
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,690
He acted strange.

217
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,150
It's the testimony the labor
team manager made

218
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,650
after confirming
Seo Dong-jae's face.

219
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,570
Mr. Seo.

220
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,610
The laborer Hwang Si-mok
that's mentioned in the testimony.

221
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,870
Is that you?

222
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,200
Yes.

223
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,410
Concealing yourself
with a fake name

224
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,410
and ransacking the construction
site as if you were a laborer

225
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,750
is all true?

226
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,040
Yes.

227
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
You're all aware

228
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,590
of what happened between
Prosecutor Seo

229
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,380
from Cheongju District
and the defendant.

230
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,510
I don't need to explain that.

231
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,590
Because it's already so famous.

232
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,180
He manipulated evidence

233
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,470
and framed a young man
as a culprit.

234
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,230
A prosecutor
who committed a great sin

235
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,230
tried to get back
at the defendant

236
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,650
for revealing the truth

237
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,030
by sneaking into his work
pretending to be a laborer.

238
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,400
Your honor.

239
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,950
I asked Prosecutor Seo

240
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,160
to work at the construction site.

241
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,250
I was in charge of the case
since Park Jung-woo

242
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,170
reported Ehong Construction's
construction corruption.

243
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,290
With a belief that him going
missing shouldn't be neglected,

244
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,130
I discussed how to prove it
with my fellow prosecutor Seo.

245
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,010
Here is the point.

246
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,390
The defendant did not
fall for a trap.

247
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,350
Because the person who buried
the body in the construction site

248
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,220
isn't anyone
but the defendant himself.

249
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,310
Yes. That is my point.

250
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,730
Someone buried a body
in the construction site.

251
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,110
I am not denying the body
wasn't found there.

252
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,450
You're insisting that
it was the defendant's doing.

253
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,950
Without single evidence,
you assumed it was a proxy murder

254
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,580
and were arrogant enough
to conclude it.

255
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,830
Where did that great evil

256
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,290
come from?

257
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,130
Why did prosecutors
conspire, join hands,

258
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,960
and lie?

259
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,090
And why did it happen to be
Prosecutor Seo of all people?

260
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,640
Why is that? Huh?

261
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,430
They're trying to show no one
should mess with prosecutors.

262
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,100
If you neglect this,

263
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,400
we civilians cannot say a word

264
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,020
despite what prosecutors do.

265
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,940
Your honor.

266
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,070
I dare to say

267
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,820
among all his testimony
he made in this trial,

268
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,410
nothing was true.

269
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,840
How should I prove it?

270
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,430
If you cannot trust my testimony,

271
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,640
who knows the concrete truth?

272
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,390
And even if the truth is said,

273
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,560
can anyone be free

274
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,270
from objection

275
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,690
regardless of the side they take?

276
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,700
I kept asking myself
for the answer.

277
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,210
Geez, it's already
been overwritten.

278
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,540
What's been overwritten?

279
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,500
Nam Wan-seong's dashcam.

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,340
There's nothing since May.

281
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,630
So much for May.

282
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,010
It starts from September
this year.

283
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,850
If it's been deleted on purpose,
we can retrieve it,

284
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,850
but if it's been overwritten,
we have no chance.

285
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,140
Was it December 5
when Nam Wan-seong got arrested?

286
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,810
Yes, that's when we went to
the construction site.

287
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Then someone occurred to me.

288
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,900
Nam Wan-seong's biggest traitor.

289
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,870
Dad?

290
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,710
Is this Nam Wan-seong's
corporation car dashcam?

291
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,290
I took it from his car
in his garage.

292
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,130
It stops after December 6.

293
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Because he was arrested
on the 5th.

294
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,100
Even if he didn't drive it,

295
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,260
it would've kept recording.

296
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,270
Unless someone turned it off
on purpose.

297
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,440
Then was it turned off on purpose?

298
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,650
Who would do that? There's no one
but his kid at home.

299
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,650
Even if there was, they couldn't
have afforded to think about it.

300
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,860
Someone was worried
about the battery dying

301
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,320
when his family was arrested.

302
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,950
Yet he meddled with the dashcam.

303
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,410
Why?

304
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,950
It wouldn't disfavor him,

305
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,580
but why did he still delete it?

306
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,380
Did someone get in the car?

307
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,710
Whose hand is that?

308
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,970
Nam Gyeo-rye?

309
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,100
Why did he meddle
with his dad's car?

310
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,560
He ordered his son
to delete the dashcam footage?

311
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,640
Listen carefully.

312
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,230
You'll see my car key on my desk.

313
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,030
See if the dashcam footage
from May is still there.

314
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,530
May?

315
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,780
It's probably been deleted,

316
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,280
but check again.

317
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,530
They'll soon come back
with a search warrant.

318
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,540
I found the car key. What now?

319
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,080
Next to the power button on the
side, you'll see the memory card.

320
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,170
If the footage from May is still
there, delete it.

321
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,550
If not, put it back in.

322
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,340
Don't tell anyone about it.

323
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,880
Not even the attorney.

324
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,010
Check it yourself.

325
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,260
Your honor.

326
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,720
That was the call he had
with his son in jail.

327
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,600
Why do you think he emphasized
to delete the footage from May?

328
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,730
Because in May when the victim
was buried alive,

329
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,610
the defendant was at the scene
of murder.

330
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,940
That is basically a confession.

331
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,030
Jail also counts
as a correctional facility.

332
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,320
Were you not aware
that all calls in the facility

333
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,580
were recorded?

334
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,130
I wasn't, goddamn it.

335
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,590
What did you just say?

336
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,680
Defendant,
with an attitude like that...

337
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,100
I'm not a kid.

338
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,980
What's wrong with my attitude?

339
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,190
Why do I have to be polite? Why?

340
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,230
Because you committed a crime
and stood in trial!

341
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,910
You.

342
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,790
Among the judges and prosecutors,

343
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,000
I already know several

344
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,500
who deserve to sit here.

345
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,090
Stop acting up.

346
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,920
Our titles may be different,

347
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,470
but you and I...

348
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,430
Close your mouth and sit down.

349
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,430
Charging people unfairly
however you like wasn't enough,

350
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,220
you only favor people
from the same field.

351
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,560
And yet you say you can punish me?

352
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,480
Says who?

353
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,560
Don't touch me. I said let go!

354
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,070
I will announce the date
for the next trial later.

355
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,190
The court has been dismissed.

356
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,050
Enough with your bullcrap.

357
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,340
I had to do something.

358
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,850
If Nam Gyeo-rye is the one
who took the dashcam memory,

359
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,020
there's only one person
who'd order him.

360
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,520
The day after his arrest,

361
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,770
he was in jail.

362
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,520
Nam Wan-seong, that prick.

363
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,910
You think he felt refreshed after
raising his voice in the court?

364
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,160
Or did he regret
about not holding it back?

365
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,620
He probably regretted it

366
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,790
when he returned to
the detention center.

367
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,710
Right?

368
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,340
Hey.

369
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,430
I'm sorry I'm late.

370
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,100
What the? Why are you here alone?

371
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,060
Prosecutor Seo won't make it.

372
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,350
Why not?

373
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,190
His disciplinary action's
been decided.

374
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,270
What is it?

375
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,730
He won't know until he attends it.

376
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,610
Was he notified to attend it?

377
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,610
What?

378
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,330
It won't end with a reprimand.

379
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,250
Still, he made a lot
of contribution this time.

380
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,620
The disciplinary committee
doesn't know that.

381
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,000
He also received
the model prosecutor award.

382
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,340
He didn't. It got canceled.

383
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
The serial murders.

384
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,260
That was so long ago.

385
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,680
- Purple.
- Purple is mine!

386
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,680
You don't deserve to drink.

387
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,770
It's true that he made
a lot of contributions.

388
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,560
Just because he saved a man this
year after killing one last year,

389
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,480
it doesn't make what he did
last year go away.

390
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,820
And we must not apply that rule

391
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,030
in our job.

392
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,830
Still, if they told him
to appear in person,

393
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,870
it might not be something
so uneasy.

394
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,830
You think so?
Then perhaps a wage cut?

395
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,010
Maybe they want to teach him
a lesson in person.

396
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,850
(Ministry of Justice)

397
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,740
I received various opinions
on you.

398
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,120
I cannot give the names
of people who gave their opinions,

399
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,580
but you played an integral role

400
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,290
in arresting a violent criminal
recently.

401
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,790
However, during the special
inspection in 2017...

402
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,880
2017?

403
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,210
No action was taken on you

404
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,470
because you were needed
to resolve the case.

405
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,220
The government retrieved the
bribes you received at the time.

406
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,890
Your role was needed
to resolve the case later.

407
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,900
However, pretending
that a specific suspect hid

408
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,530
the victim's article

409
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,240
to frame the suspect as a culprit

410
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,110
is all true.

411
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,000
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

412
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,580
Yes.

413
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,840
You didn't

414
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,420
neglect your duty.

415
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,220
However, you damaged prosecutors'
reputation and dignity.

416
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,930
Dismissal. Removal?

417
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,600
A heavy disciplinary action...

418
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,560
However, you were appointed
a model prosecutor

419
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,730
by clearing a drug cartel

420
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,110
and resolving a cold case.

421
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,360
A wage cut.
A light disciplinary action...

422
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,780
However,

423
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,360
there is no valid reason

424
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,860
to deny that you received

425
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
bribery.

426
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,660
Therefore, a majority
of the Ministry of Justice

427
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,830
disciplinary committee agrees

428
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,330
to dismiss

429
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,720
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

430
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,340

But...

434
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,770
Wait.

435
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,070

Move. Make a room.

441
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,570
Boss, have you heard

442
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,200
whether I'll be transferred
to Seoul District?

443
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,930
CEO Nam might lose his mind

444
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,470
and confess everything.

445
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,140
His crime of proxy murder has
pretty much been fixed.

446
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,680
I can't change that.

447
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,270
That is not what I mean.

448
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,480
I know a thing or two
about his slush fund.

449
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,280
Say that you got it from
someone else, not me

450
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,700
and disclosed it first.

about Ehong Construction.

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,020
Probably.
That's why I sent it to you.

459

460

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,200
You said it contained
a lot of information.

463

It's up to you to turn that
into evidence.

464

Hey, get a blanket.

- Take pictures of everything.
- That's so much.

467

Over 20 million dollars of cash
was found in CEO Nam Wan-seong

a warrant on CEO Nam

for embezzlement.

471
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,580
They will investigate
the source of the cash

472

and his means of concealment.

account fraud and embezzlement.

It's Nam Wan-seong who's busy.

Wouldn't it be faster
to fix him in the defendant's seat

Notifying the inspection subject
of the inspection.

546
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,800
That is part of the procedure,

547
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,050
and that is what I'm doing
right now.

548
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,260
What's the next procedure?

549
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,720
Punish me?

550
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,850
We don't punish anyone.

551
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,760
We only report.

552
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,060
To whom?

553
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,730
Who sent you here?

554
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,020
You.

555
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,240
It was you who called me here.

556
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,780
Because I'm a pot,

557
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,700
I know which kettle to call black.

558
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,540
Have you identified
each other yet?

559
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,550
Do you recognize each other?

560
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,130
Dismissal, removal, suspension.

561
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,300
A wage cut is never enough
to join you.

562
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:37,970
Nice watch there.

563
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,640
Corrupted prosecutors.

564
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Unlawful colleagues.

565
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,530
Yet your superiors thrive.

566
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,320
You know when, where, and how
they move

567
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,450
the best.

568
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Despite the region and rank,

569
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,660
you'll move before they move.

570
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,830
Do you mean we are

571
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,670
the TF Team investigating
prosecutors' corruption?

572
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,000
You got it.

573
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,040
A thief knows a thief.

574
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,210
Those who received bribery catch
those who will receive bribery.

575
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,180
But the supreme office already has
the anti-corruption team.

576
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,050
If you think this team isn't
necessary, you may leave now.

577
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,680
In a couple of years,

578
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,520
you can all work as lawyers.

579
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,810
Do we have no job because
of the anti-corruption team?

580
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,150
Is there no corruption?

581
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,150
You all have someone in your mind,
don't you?

582
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,450
However,

583
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,740
since you've all been dismissed
from your positions,

584
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,580
you are not

585
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,250
official government officials.

586
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,250
That means,

587
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,500
no bonus or overtime pay.
Only the basic salary.

588
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,550
I'll still get you business cards

589
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,670
since it's necessary
for the mind game.

590
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,840
I'm not ashamed after a while.

591
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,760
Because it's a proud job.

592
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,890
A job that should be done.

593
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,030
(Ministry of Justice
Prosecution Investigation TF Team)

594
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,400
(Seo Dong-jae)

595
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,090
My goodness.

596
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,310
What a nice world we live in.

597
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,310
Hello, Ms. Kim.

598
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,520
Ms. Kim,

599
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,020
is it common to get suspended?

600
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,320
Even Ms. Jeon got suspended.

601
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,900
Too much for the first year, huh?

602
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,070
Is it about the day

603
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,530
Prosecutor Seo visited her?

604
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,540
Did you know?

605
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,370
What happened between
Prosecutor Seo and Ms. Jeon?

606
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,830
Ask Prosecutor Seo yourself.

607
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,420
I don't feel comfortable
about calling him.

608
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,670
You shouldn't.

609
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,300
You have to hint him that Mr. Jo
will be going after him soon.

610
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,140
You mean Mr. Jo Byung-gun?
Why would he?

611
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,230
He's waiting to get back at him.

612
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,100
A prosecution inspection team?

613
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,400
Prosecutor Seo?

614
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,070
Jo Byung-gun.

615
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,490
You really were nothing.

616
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,950
Did he mean
that he dug dirt on me?

617
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,830
I'll kill that Seo Dong-jae prick.

618
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,970
Let's start with the trial result
from last week.

619
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,350
You mean Nam Gyeo-rye?

620
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,520
He's on probation.
He decided not to appeal.

621
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,400
It was his first offense,
and he admitted to his charges.

622
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,440
Good job.

623
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,650
Thank you.

624
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,170
(Late Im Yu-ri)

625
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,750
I didn't know you liked this.

626
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
CEO Nam.

627
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
I heard you went bankrupt.

628
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,160
Shoot.

629
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,330
I'm seeing good performance.

630
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,630
You had an eye for whom to hire.

631
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,630
Thanks to your list of candidates.

632
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,720
A disciplinary committee isn't so
bad if you consider that.

633
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,380
My goodness.

634
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,800
Can you call them talents?

635
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,720
So? Now that you created
an unprecedented team with them,

636
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,600
do you feel relieved?

637
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,060
It's no team.

638
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,400
There are only six.

639
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,900
That sounds like you want to
make it bigger.

640
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,150
Well, why not?

641
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,080
I had no idea about your ambition

642
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,540
when I approved it.

643
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,870
You'll be backstabbing high-ups.

644
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,130
Don't be like this, chief.

645
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,090
You were the oldest to approve it.

646
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,590
Shut up.

647
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,550
People think I'm in my early 40s.

648
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,100
When I talk informally to you,
people think I'm rude.

649
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,560
If you say so,

650
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,310
I'll drop the honorifics.

651
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,980
Is that okay?

652
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,780
I shouldn't have brought you back.

653
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,860
Sir.

654
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,570
In your 50s
but still looking like early 40s.

655
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,330
- Stop it.
- See you for lunch.

656
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,620
He argued he never received

657
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,040
any free golf round or wine,

658
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,830
but the rumor says he received

659
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,210
support that wasn't evident.

660
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,920
Support that wasn't evident?
Like what?

661
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,380
Like his children's
learning center costs.

662
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,590
It's a lot when it saves up.

663
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,640
Okay.

664
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,260
Yes?

665
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
About the chief prosecutor
I mentioned before.

666
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,350
Insult, verbal abuse, and cursing.

667
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,560
There was so much. So I

668
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,440
- just sent it to you.
- Okay.

669
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,400
Nice.

670
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,070
Keep up with your work.

671
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,030
Yes.

672
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,530
- I'll see you later.
- Get back to work.

673
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,450
How is it?

674
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,290
What do you mean?

675
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,420
You know.

676
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,630
Not bad.

677
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,630
In what way?

678
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,630
Better than doing nothing.

679
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,260
I'm guessing you don't like it?

680
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,470
It's not that I don't like it.

681
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,810
It's more like I'm still useful.

682
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,020
Got it.

683
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,900
Keep up the good work.

684
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,150
The law firm.

685
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,440
Why did I quit?

686
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,030
Not sure.

687
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,490
'I'm stopping justice
from catching the bad guys'

688
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,620
'I would've caught in the past.'

689
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,500
'That's what law firms are doing.'

690
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,960
That's why.

691
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,260
Because I was a prosecutor
after all.

692
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,550
I worked as one for over 20 years.

693
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,880
You'd never agree,
would you?

694
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,390
I think I liked
being a prosecutor.

695
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,350
Sure.

696
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,310
It makes no sense, huh?

697
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,020
How come?

698
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,900
Because I screwed it up.

699
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,660
Perhaps you can make it
work again.

700
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,870
Then it really makes no sense.

701
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'll see you later.

702
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,430
Is it my imagination?

703
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,140
It feels like he's talking less.

704
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,560
Whatever. It's Seo Dong-jae.

705
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,880
I'll bust all your asses,
you sons of guns.

706
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,810
Dongjae, The Good or the Bad.

707
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:22,810
The end.
