- One here.
- Okay.

- Hurry up, please.
- Okay.

One sausage, please.

00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:31,653
Okay. Thank you.

10
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:33,530
Oh, gosh.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,159
- I told you to sit down and wait.
- What?

12
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:39,912
Don't wait standing up. Sit down.

13
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:41,330
Is it going to take long?

14
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,249
- Sit down and wait.
- Is it going to take a lot?

18
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:52,203
Honey.

19
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:17,231
I had no idea.

20
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:19,400
I never thought it'd be a fraud.

21
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:22,279
Who'd spend 100,000 dollars
to do that?

22
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:23,530
Did he have a problem with you?

23
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:25,157
Was he trying to make you
shut down?

24
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:26,909
No. Not at all.

25
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,120
Do you know who told me
about this?

26
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:31,122
Joo Jung-gi was nothing.

27
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:33,416
Someone bigger is behind him.

28
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:34,793
That guy ordered Joo Jung-gi

29
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:37,212
to run into you.

30
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:40,800
How do you think I felt
when I heard that?

31
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,009
Mr. Lee.

32
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:46,890
Oh, Mr. Lee.

33
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,603
What if you fall for it
without any idea?

34
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:54,607
That's why I'm here
in the middle of the night.

35
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,071
So you were worried about me?

36
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,614
Yes.

37
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,747
I can handle two,

38
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,417
but what should I do with you?

39
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:14,338
It's not like I can bury you.

40
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:17,800
I can't burrow a grinder
at this hour.

41
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,888
I said that to survive.

42
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,849
Mr. Lee.

43
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:27,228
Will you help me get up?

44
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:28,896
I have something to tell you.

45
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:30,231
You were talking fine
on the ground.

46
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:32,359
I know a way for both of us
to survive.

47
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:35,195
I can't dare to tell you that
on the ground.

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,364
- We can't both survive.
- We can.

49
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,366
Mr. Lee, I'm a prosecutor.

50
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:40,826
We can both survive.

51
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:42,870
So? Do you want to hear it?

52
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:59,056
I'll say these bodies are unnamed.

53
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:07,232
This is the reason
you had to live like this.

54
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,484
For a decade,

55
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,278
you cooked for strangers

56
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,197
and couldn't escape
from this deserted place.

57
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,200
Mr. Lee.

58
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,786
10 years mean

59
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:20,914
you basically served your time.

60
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:25,169
So, since you're a prosecutor,

61
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:27,463
you'll say I'm acquitted

62
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,590
and say these bodies are unnamed?

63
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:30,800
Oh, gosh.

64
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,387
How generous of you
on the verge of death.

65
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:36,306
Forget it.

66
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:39,518
I'll get rid of those bodies

67
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:40,686
legally.

68
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,610
You've never been caught
or chased before, right?

69
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,987
You've never been doubted
or suspected, right?

70
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:50,030
But here's the thing.

71
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,241
A crucial piece of evidence
will tie you down.

72
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:53,367
Even if there are tons
of evidence for murder,

73
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,827
people are set free
if no body is found.

74
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:58,081
But for you, the crucial evidence
is right here.

75
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,542
I'll say these bodies are unnamed.

76
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,253
Unidentified bodies,
unidentified reason of death.

77
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:04,213
So cremate it and enshrine.

78
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,053
Then finally, it's over.

79
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,471
It's that simple.

80
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:14,183
Only if I say it's unnamed.

81
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,769
That document is

82
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:18,646
in my office.

83
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:24,528
What do you mean

84
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:27,072
it's in your office?

85
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,077
I'll head to the office...

86
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:33,288
Go where?

87
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:34,498
To your office?

88
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:37,334
Just tell me to go
to the police station.

89
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,961
- That works too.
- You prick.

90
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,212
I have to.

91
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,382
I have to go there
or there's no other way.

92
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:43,550
Court, prosecution,
police, prison.

93
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:45,302
I can only get an access
to it in those four organizations.

94
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:47,346
Even if I want a warrant, I have
to do it within the building

95
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,847
because no outside access is
allowed.

96
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,558
To get rid of the bodies,
I have to go

97
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,184
whether it's the police station
or prosecution service.

98
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,859
You think I don't realize

99
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,238
how absurd this sounds?

100
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,990
But it's the truth.

101
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,826
I have to go there
if I want to handle it.

102
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,122
I have to download the form.

103
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:11,874
But

104
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,627
once I download it,

105
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,128
it won't take less than a minute.

106
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:17,755
Then

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,300
you'll be free.

108
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,177
Free. Understood?

109
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:29,310
How can I trust you?

110
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,897
Do you want to come with me?

111
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:35,567
I won't let you go alone.
We have to go together.

112
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:37,987
What do you think my brain is for?

113
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:39,113
Did you think

114
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:41,449
I'd let you go alone
for rambling on?

115
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:45,203
How would I ever know

116
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:46,872
what you might do there?

117
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:48,373
And how am I supposed to
trust you?

118
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,377
What if you kill me
after I set you free?

119
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,671
I'm a prosecutor
who executes the law.

120
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:55,924
Yet I'm trying to find you a way.

121
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,551
Why would I go through that hassle

122
00:06:57,676 --> 00:06:59,428
when you got caught
with two murdered bodies?

123
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:03,641
Because I must survive.

124
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,437
I can't let my kids live
without their dad like me.

125
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:11,650
My life depends on this.

126
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:13,652
It's your turn to tell me.

127
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:15,488
How are you going to
let me walk out of this?

128
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:30,588
This is getting complicated.

129
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,444
Get up.

130
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:52,738
Get up.

131
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:58,286
Hold it.

132
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:11,802
Come here.

133
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:31,074
Why don't you

134
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,577
tell someone to bring the form?

135
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:38,165
There's no one.

136
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,126
Everyone went home.

137
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,095
If you're fooling me,

138
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,641
we're both dead.

139
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,642
Got it?

140
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:06,197
Well...

141
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:11,620

at school.

146
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,260

00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,327
- How...
- Just press the button.

187
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:21,723
(Unnamed Death Notice)

188
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,604
Oh, that was so easy.

189
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:47,419
I'll kill you.

190
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:53,634
A murderer!

191
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:20,290
What was that?

192
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:21,917
Prosecutor Jo.

193
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:30,510
Prosecutor Jo.

194
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:42,273
Call the police. Now.

195
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:46,695
Hey.

196
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,989
Hey.

197
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:11,765
Hey.

198
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:15,603
Hey.

199
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,275
Prosecutor Seo.

200
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,362
- Mr. Lee?
- Sung Si-woon.

201
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,576
Don't follow me.

202
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,878
Press the elevator.

203
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:41,674
Don't follow me.

204
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:44,427
First floor.
Press the first floor.

205
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,764
Don't follow me.
If you follow me, he dies.

206
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,266
- Get your hand off.
- Off.

207
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,893
Don't kill him. He's still young.

208
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:52,478
Get your hand off the elevator.

209
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,063
I swear

210
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:55,815
I will kill you.

211
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,444
Guard.

212
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:02,198
Hey.

213
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:03,616
Damn it.

214
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,243
Where did he go?

215
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:07,579
How can you miss him?

216
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,372
I called the police already.

217
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:11,250
Where is he? Take the lead.

218
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:23,055
What the hell?

219
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:24,932
Is it broken?

220
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:26,809
Mr. Lee.

221
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:29,604
- What?
- The emergency bell.

222
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,151
(Emergency Call)

223
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:35,527
Hello?

224
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,614
It's okay. I'll do the talking.

225
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,783
I'll talk.

226
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:43,536
Is everything okay? Hello?

227
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,083
Hello.

228
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,503
This is the number three elevator.

229
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,602
Why is this broken?

230
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:08,106
- Sung Si-woon.
- Prosecutor Sung.

231
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:09,483
- Who are you?
- Are you okay?

232
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:10,817
- Sung Si-woon.
- Prosecutor Sung.

233
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:13,112
- 911.
- Prosecutor Sung.

234
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:14,280
Are you up?

235
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,034
The paramedics are here.
Arrest the suspect.

236
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,035
Yes.

237
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,161
Hey.

238
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:24,792
- The blood.
- What?

239
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,670
He's bleeding. Hello? Anyone?

240
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:29,923
Over here.

241
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:32,092
- Take the suspect first.
- Can you get up?

242
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,593
He's going down.

243
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:35,554
Hurry.

244
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,682
Police. Get your hand off.

245
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,228
Hurry.

246
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:43,897
Get on the bed.

247
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:48,861
This way.

248
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,205
Hey.

249
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,331
Over there.

250
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,126
Damn it.

251
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,213
What was the way

252
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,257
when you said you'd let me
hit the jackpot?

253
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:14,890
Watch the news

254
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:18,019
in prison.

255
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:20,355
Hey!

256
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,034
Yes, sir.

257
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:33,912
Two bodies were found.

258
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,081
One of them belonged to
the original owner

259
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,541
of the diner who was
known to have fled.

260
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,045
Is that why that old man
refused to sell it?

261
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,006
I knew it.

262
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:45,050
There's always a reason
when one refuses money.

263
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:46,969
That's not all.

264
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:50,264
Now that I think about it,
I could've been killed.

265
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,517
Hey, no...

266
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:54,018
I could've been found dead

267
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:56,897
when this place was getting
redeveloped.

268
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:00,234
Okay. I'll pay you for your work.

269
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,820
That wasn't what I meant,

270
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,073
but thank you.

271
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:06,032
Good job.

272
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:12,164
Seo Dong-jae.

273
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,503
What a strange way to help me.

274
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:22,092
1, 2, 3.

275
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,472
Let's turn him around.

276
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:32,145
Honey.

277
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,690
- Yes.
- Sir, stay down.

278
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:37,234
Clear the way.

279
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,158
Last night around 11 p.m.,

280
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,618
Criminal Department 1 prosecutors
of Cheongju District

281
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,122
who were working late
worked together

282
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,790
to arrest the suspect.

283
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,959
As it was a powerful suspect,

284
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,419
he fought against us violently,

285
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,755
and one of the prosecutors was

286
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,549
injured while arresting him.

287
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,970
However, we, prosecutors, who
lured the suspect

288
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:04,182
to the prosecution office
that was off the grid for 10 years

289
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:07,394
gathered together
with a strong will to catch him

290
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,396
and succeeded in arresting him
in the end.

291
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:10,439
Prosecutor Jo.

292
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:13,067
Reporter Shin,
what are you doing here?

293
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:15,069
Are you here for the briefing?

294
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:16,070
What happened?

295
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,323
How did you bring the murderer
to the prosecutors' office?

296
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:21,159
Oh, no. The murderer happened
to be stupid.

297
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:24,204
How did he dare to come here?

298
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:27,166
In fact, he must've only worked
out his body, not his brain.

299
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,544
He was way too strong.

300
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:32,881
You know I'm not weak enough
to be pushed.

301
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:35,425
But when I faced the murderer...

302
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,387
Gosh, I almost got killed.

303
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:40,431
Were you the first to find him?

304
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:41,516
Was it me?

305
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,895
Well, I was the first
to jump into the scene.

306
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:53,821
He was swinging the sickle
before my face.

307
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:55,740
The sickle was rusted.

308
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,909
Even a graze would cause tetanus.

309
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,120
I guess you didn't hear that
in the briefing?

310
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,289
All your eyes are
shining brightly.

311
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,417
Good job.

312
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,169
If we mention Seo Dong-jae's name,

313
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:09,047
someone will bring out
what happened in the past.

314
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:10,632
I think

315
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,636
we can compensate Prosecutor Seo

316
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:14,887
internally.

317
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:16,472
Yes, sir.

318
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,308
Bring back the diner lady,
murderer.

319
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,810
Were you cooking with those filthy
hands of yours all these years?

320
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,312
Bring back the diner.

321
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:25,065
How do you feel right now?

322
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,609
Don't you feel bad
for the victims?

323
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:27,526
Did you know you were too stupid

324
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:29,362
to enter the prosecutors' office
on your own?

325
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:32,073
You've become the dumbest murderer
in history, you know.

326
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:34,493
- What?
- Stop him.

327
00:22:37,913 --> 00:22:38,831
What?

328
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:40,875
Seo Dong-jae.

329
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,377
Didn't he just say Seo Dong-jae?

330
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:44,045
Isn't he that prosecutor?

331
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,592
(Pretending to be a kind
diner owner after the murder)

332
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:49,677
(Cheongju Police Station)

333
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,804
Lee Kyung-hak, you have a visitor.

334
00:22:54,682 --> 00:22:56,184
My apologies, Mr. Lee.

335
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:02,316
Oh, what?

336
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:05,737
I acted up without any idea.

337
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:06,905
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:09,324
I'll kill you today.

339
00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:10,784
Let's all die together.

340
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:13,954
Calm down. Sit down first.

341
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,374
Why die? You must live.

342
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:17,667
Who the hell is this prick?

343
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:19,836
Sit down first.

344
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:24,174
Thank you for your service.

345
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,969
We're good here. You may leave.

346
00:23:27,762 --> 00:23:28,846
Okay.

347
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,727
Here.

348
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,647
I'm Joo Jung-gi, attorney at law.

349
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:37,940
(Attorney at law, Joo Jung-gi)

350
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:40,777
- A lawyer?
- Yes.

351
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,195
You're lucky.

352
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,239
If you hire me,

353
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:46,199
I'll defend you with my best.

354
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:47,367
Ha!

355
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:50,079
You're the reason
I ended up in here,

356
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:51,789
and you want to defend me?

357
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:53,207
Yes.

358
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,503
Jail, detention center, prison.

359
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:58,630
No other place upsets you more

360
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,466
with food and clothes
than those places.

361
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:01,842
But if you have money,

362
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:04,554
people will clean up your dishes

363
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,431
and even your restroom

364
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:08,016
like a hotel.

365
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:08,975
How much do you want?

366
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,727
Who the hell is this prick?

367
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,105
Happiness Diner.

368
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:15,441
It belonged to your wife,

369
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:17,944
but because you killed her,
you don't have the right anymore.

370
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:19,070
So what's the conclusion?

371
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:22,074
You have no right
to that property now.

372
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,116
Understood?

373
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:25,786
You wish.

374
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,173
Sell it to me.

375
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:38,134
Sign the paper.

376
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:39,510
What the hell?

377
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:42,013
Didn't you just say I had no right
to it with your own mouth?

378
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:44,516
I'll take care of it.
Just sign the paper.

379
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:46,435
The lawyer
and your life in prison.

380
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,770
I'll cover it all.

381
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:51,190
I can help you hit the jackpot.

382
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,067
I'll help you make billions.

383
00:24:54,277 --> 00:24:56,363
I get it now.

384
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:00,784
It was the land, huh?

385
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,912
When he said
I could hit the jackpot.

386
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:04,831
Joo Jung-gi was nothing.

387
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:07,083
Someone bigger is behind him.

388
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,919
And you're behind him?

389
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,879
You told him to scam me?

390
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:13,007
Huh? What's he saying?

391
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,885
I get it.

392
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,307
So that prosecutor wasn't
all about lies.

393
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,657
It's not so hard to sign it.

394
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,202
Seo Dong-jae.

395
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:39,704
Only if you kill him.

396
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,756
Kill a prosecutor?

397
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,841
I'm not a lunatic like you.

398
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,427
How much is it worth

399
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,554
that you had to chase me here?

400
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,641
And you even suggest
supporting a stranger in prison.

401
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,227
You're desperate.

402
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:05,108
Spend that effort
to kill a prosecutor.

403
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,192
Then...

404
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:09,988
I know you're a lunatic,

405
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:12,700
but don't cross the line.

406
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,702
Jerk.

407
00:26:17,413 --> 00:26:18,540
We'll come back tomorrow.

408
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:24,338
Seo Dong-jae.

(Cheongju General Hospital)

411
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,898
Every corner of my body aches.

412
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,321
Huh? The bowling alley...

413
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,910
Shoot.

414
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,558
- Boyfriend?
- No.

415
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:17,190
Wait. This is my room.

416
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:27,869
Wait. What happened to your face?

417
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:30,038
Did that guy do that to you?

418
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:30,914
No.

419
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:31,915
No?

420
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,962
Gosh.

421
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:38,923
How did you get hurt?

422
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:39,924
Are you sure it wasn't him?

423
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,177
No. Can I stay here for a sec?

424
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,014
No. I'm going to rest.

425
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:47,850
I got hurt from riding a scooter.

426
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:55,734
I think he left.

427
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:00,739
You can't sleep here.
You're a girl.

428
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,533
You're a prosecutor.

429
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:09,708
Did you study all night long?

430
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,920
I made money.

431
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:27,562
Here.

432
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,877
It's nice to eat sweets
all you want.

433
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:51,714
Are you on a diet?

434
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:53,800
You'll know what I mean
when you get old.

(Cheongju General Hospital)

436
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,645
Did you get some sleep?

437
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:41,938
Yes.

438
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:44,608
Is it quiet there?

439
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:45,567
What?

440
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:50,614
It never happens to anyone,
but why do you...

441
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,701
Did your office put guards on you?

442
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:57,622
I'm finally taking a break in
the hospital. No needs for guards.

443
00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:00,125
That's not good.
I'll go there tomorrow.

444
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,421
No, it's the midterm period.

445
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:05,423
I'm fine.
I'm leaving the hospital soon.

446
00:30:05,548 --> 00:30:07,634
A serial killer shouted
your name out loud.

447
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,720
Who knows what might happen?

448
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:12,014
Don't leave your room.

449
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:14,392
Don't let anyone in, okay?

450
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:16,477
Okay. Bye.

451

when he was being dragged)

452
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:26,405

453
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:29,325
You must've heard the name

454
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,077
Seo Dong-jae the murderer said.

455
00:30:31,202 --> 00:30:32,954
That's right.

456
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,582
Remember how a prosecutor
was kidnapped and abandoned

457
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,460
in 2019?

458
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,253
It's Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae

459
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:40,671
who noticed the murder
that almost got buried

460
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,758
and resolved it.

461
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,596
However, he received
media's attention

462
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,808
for receiving bribery.

463
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,518
The 2017 special appointment

464
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,354
that started with Park the briber.

465
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,149
That brought multiple prosecutors'
corruption to the surface.

466
00:30:57,274 --> 00:31:00,361
And Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae was

467
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:02,363
on the list.

468
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:12,124
Hey.

469
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:13,167
Huh?

470
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:15,586
Get out of my way.

471
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:17,672
What's he doing? Move your car.

472
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:19,174
Hey.

(Cheongju General Hospital)

474
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:25,055
Come in.

475
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:29,644
- Good to go?
- Yes.

476
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,106
You can leave now.

477
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:37,152
Why did you waste your money?
I know this is expensive.

478
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:39,405
Someone gave it to me
just outside the door.

479
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:41,741
Who?

480
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:44,494
It's from Ehong Construction.

481
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:46,788
Ehong...

482
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:50,543
Throw it out. You eat it.

483
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:51,961
Why did you take it?

484
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:54,464
I thought you should decide
after checking the envelope.

485
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:56,216
Check what? It's obvious.

486
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,968
It might be a letter of gratitude.

487
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,930
Open it.

488
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:03,391
If it's a letter,
you're my senior.

489
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,059
Excuse me.

490
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:16,531
Those pricks.

491
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:17,699
I'll return it.

492
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,506
Where are you?
Send me your address.

493
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:32,716
Wait right there.

494
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,305
I thought it might mean
something to you.

495
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,891
Perhaps you helped them

496
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,143
or worked off their grudge.

497
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:44,437
If that's the case,
I shouldn't send it back.

498
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,397
But

499
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:48,776
it has 200 dollars. I'm sorry.

500
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,321
- You...
- Yes?

501
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:55,033
Never mind. Call the cab.

502
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:56,952
I brought my car.

503
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:58,328
You had a car?

504
00:32:58,453 --> 00:32:59,496
I got it yesterday.

505
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:01,207
Call the cab.

506
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,128
So he wants to see
who I used to be?

507
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:07,756
Fine. The most expensive suit.

(Club Pitch)

509
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,382
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae
just arrived.

510
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:47,092
Okay.

511
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:50,388
Stay outside for a second.

512
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:11,036
Hi.

513
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:23,675
It's for your business.

514
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:26,804
A construction worker outside
the city worked his ass off

515
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,264
inhaling rock dust
to make this money.

516
00:34:29,182 --> 00:34:30,433
How can I spend
that precious money?

517
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:33,645
- How dare you play a trick on me?
- No wonder.

518
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,858
You're about to get billions.

519
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:39,986
This is nothing compared to that.

520
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,410
Do you really not remember?

521
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,373
Right. It was almost a decade ago.

522
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:53,751
Still, how can you forget
my gratitude completely?

523
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:55,754
I gave you an obvious hint,
but you just don't get it.

524
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,005
Geez.

525
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:03,304
Cheongju.

526
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:06,391

527
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:10,771
When it was only 150 dollars
per 3.3 square meter 10 years ago,

528
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:12,773
I, Nam Wan-seong, the Cheongju
construction worker presented it

529
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:16,527
to you, Prosecutor Seo
from West Proescutors' Office.

530
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:22,868
Look, prosecutor.

531
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,162
That land is

532
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:27,582
getting redeveloped.

533
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:31,378
It's right next to
that damn diner.

534
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,010
Were you disregarding it
because it's in the countryside?

535
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:39,720
Or

536
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,432
did you take so many

537
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,017
that you don't even remember
the small ones?

538
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,728
Too bad now.

539
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:51,234
It increased by hundreds of times
just overnight.

540
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,735
Wow.

541
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:59,243
It became a huge bribe. Damn!

542
00:36:06,376 --> 00:36:07,711
I'd forgotten.

543
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,630
That's how pointless it was to me.

544
00:36:09,755 --> 00:36:12,591
And I didn't get you anything
in return.

545
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:13,801
It doesn't meet the condition

546
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:16,137
of bribery.

547
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:17,513
Even if it's not a crime,

548
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:20,267
you think I have no alternative?

549
00:36:23,437 --> 00:36:26,565
So? Do you want me to lie down
in your office?

550
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:28,276
No.

551
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:31,237
Humiliation isn't enough.

552
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:35,826
What if I say you took it
from me by force?

553
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:37,203
Not that I gave it to you
voluntarily.

554
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,455
I mean, it's nothing impossible

555
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,332
considering how you've been.

556
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,877
Mr. Corrupted Prosecutor.

557
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,796
- You piece of...
- Calm down.

558
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,256
Calm down.

559
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:50,426
The land

560
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,723
is yours. I know nothing about it.

561
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:58,101
Whether you sell it or keep it,
it's up to you.

562
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:01,313
But

563
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:04,859
make sure I get

564
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:07,863
the old man's diner site.

565
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,369
Hey.

566
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:18,082
Did you think a mere prosecutor
was that amazing?

567
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,960
Did you seriously think

568
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:21,378
I could swap and steal everything?

569
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:23,589
Seo Dong-jae.

570
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:25,841
Seo Dong-jae!

571
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:28,344
That damn old man

572
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:31,222
went wild and shouted
your name on TV with grudges.

573
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:33,183
Seo Dong-jae.

574
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,230
Tell him

575
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,733
that I sent you.

576
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,069
Beg him with your all.

577
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,490
Whether you go on your knees
or cry your heart out.

578
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:48,617
It costs you nothing,
and it's not illegal.

579
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:50,536
Then

580
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:53,456
you'll never have to see me again.

581
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:01,632
Kiss my ass.

582
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,722
Gosh, I had no clue 10 years ago.

583
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:09,933
I never expected it
to turn out like this!

584
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:14,939
Hooray.

585
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:17,734
Yes!

586
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:31,958
Hey! West Prosecutors' Office.

587
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,002
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

588
00:38:57,362 --> 00:38:58,739
Kill them all.

589
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:01,701
- Get your tools.
- Let's kill them all.

590
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,662
Have a good time. I'm off now.

591
00:39:06,498 --> 00:39:07,832
How tiring.

592
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:11,754
What the hell?

593
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,634
You prick.

594
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:17,760
Get your ass over here.

595
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:21,014
Hey, Park Chan-hyuk.

596
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,814
- You can't pass through.
- I have to go.

597
00:39:27,939 --> 00:39:29,899
What's up? What brings you here?

598
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,401
Oh, no.

599
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,781
Don't be scared. You expected us

600
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,949
when you backstabbed us.

601
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,826
No.

602
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:41,079
- Come here, punk.
- No.

603
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:49,004
Believe me.

604
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,050
I didn't siphon it. It got stolen.

605
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:54,386
Right? Who dares to mess
with Choi Geum-ho's item

606
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:56,680
in Cheongju?

607
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:57,723
The thieves spread

608
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:59,641
what's out in the market, huh?

609
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,893
Yes.

610
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:02,853
Trust me. It wasn't me.

611
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:04,772
You little...

612
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:05,940
Please.

613
00:40:14,575 --> 00:40:16,327
- Hurry up.
- Get in there.

614
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:18,413
Two here. Two there.
To your right.

615
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:20,373
Sir, the police are here.

616
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:21,291
Damn it.

617
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,585
Tell Choi Geum-ho it's him next.

618
00:40:24,253 --> 00:40:25,379
Let's go.

619
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,259
Shoot.

620
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:33,388
(Mr. Won's boys were here.
And the police too)

621
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,351
Over there.

622
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,521
Get him.

623
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,569
He took off again.

624
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,237
- What the hell?
- They all took off.

625
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,490
Tell me your name. What?

626
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,409
What's your name?

627
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:52,952
Park Chan-hyuk.

628
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,621
He's the puppet boss
Choi Geum-ho hired.

629
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,373
He's Choi Geum-ho's
brother-in-law.

630
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,835
The paper says the bar belongs
to Park Chan-hyuk,

631
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,463
but it's where Choi launders
the money he made with drugs.

632
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,590
It's impossible for the police
not to know.

633
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:06,676
The police were probably after
the Cheongju head drug dealer.

634
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:08,261
I think they'll summon Choi
to investigate--

635
00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:09,388
Why did they raid it?

636
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:11,014
I'll have to find out. So--

637
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,058
You have a snitch there.

638
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:14,518
- What did he say?
- I can't get ahold of him.

639
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:17,564
We should've declined
the warrant request.

640
00:41:17,689 --> 00:41:18,815
If the police get their hands
on it,

641
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,525
Choi will take off at that moment.

642
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,319
Don't let the police
approach Choi.

643
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:23,487
Thank you, ma'am.

644
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:25,865
- Captain.
- Spill it out.

645
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,866
One second.

646
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,706
The bar search warrant
was declined.

647
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:34,291
Gosh.

648
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,542
Is it the one in charge of drugs?

649
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:37,169
Yes, Jo Byung-gun.

650
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,547
Why not? Request it again.

651
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:41,966
Request it until we get it.

652
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:44,094
Yes, sir.

653
00:41:59,403 --> 00:42:01,572
- Geum-ho.
- Don't get up.

654
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:02,990
Okay.

655
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:08,079
They were mistaken big time.

656
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:10,499
They think we stopped selling it
to them

657
00:42:10,624 --> 00:42:13,002
because we joined hands
with a new dealer.

658
00:42:18,174 --> 00:42:19,217
Geum-ho.

659
00:42:19,342 --> 00:42:20,510
(Dong-pal)

660
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:21,553
Only if

661
00:42:22,846 --> 00:42:24,807
I hadn't passed out...

662
00:42:24,932 --> 00:42:27,560
The number you have dialed is...

663
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:29,145
Look at this prick.

664
00:42:31,189 --> 00:42:32,107
Take care.

665
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:34,943
No, Geum-ho.

666
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:36,278
You should...

667
00:42:36,904 --> 00:42:39,157
They said you're next.

668
00:42:42,953 --> 00:42:44,371
Keep your eye on him.

669
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:55,884
What if that jerk is mistaken?

670
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:57,469
Because he bribed so many.

671
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:30,465
Prosecutor Seo, let me get you
a glass of water.

672
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:32,134
Prosecutor?

673
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,845
Drinking from early morning...

674
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:44,981
Here.

675
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:49,028
- I don't take this.
- It's okay.

676
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:59,456
Cheongju. 9-3 lot in Gokjung-ri.

677
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:03,044
When it was only 150 dollars
per 3.3 square meter 10 years ago,

678
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:05,213
I, Nam Wan-seong, the Cheongju
construction worker presented it

679
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:08,800
to you, Prosecutor Seo
from West Prosecutors' Office.

680
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,849
(Gokjung-ri, Jangam-dong,
Cheongju-si, Chungcheong Province)

681
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:18,687
(Seller Nam Wan-seong,
Buyer Seo Dong-jae)

682
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:21,356
Buy this land no matter what.

683
00:44:22,065 --> 00:44:23,943
He happened to take the best part.

684
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:25,236
But

685
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:27,697
drag it out as much as we can.

686
00:44:27,822 --> 00:44:29,324
Make sure to keep solicitors out.

687
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:30,283
Yes, sir.

688
00:44:30,825 --> 00:44:33,537
What if the prosecutor decides
to sell it for a high price?

689
00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:35,414
If he wants to charge you
for how much it went up,

690
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,291
there's no point in retrieving.

691
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:40,294
Buy it.

692
00:44:44,674 --> 00:44:46,593
If Prosecutor Seo insists

693
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,263
on making a profit,

694
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:54,060
our relationship will
continue to prolong.

695
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:58,482
Gosh, I had no clue 10 years ago.

696
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:00,609
I never expected it
to turn out like this!

697
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:04,238
I was the clueless one.

698
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:07,158
Because I continued
to live like that.

699
00:45:13,165 --> 00:45:14,667
(Wife)

700
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:20,966
Hey.

701
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:23,677
Yes, I'm driving.

702
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,138
I'll be home soon.

703
00:45:26,597 --> 00:45:28,057
Okay. Bye.

704
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,453
It increased by hundreds of times

705
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,330
just overnight.

706
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:49,832
Wow.

707
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,462
It became a huge bribe. Damn!

708
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:57,132
I never asked for it.

709
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,220
I didn't take it
because I wanted to.

710
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:04,557
He forced me!
