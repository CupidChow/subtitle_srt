00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,490
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,830
(and events in this drama
are fictitious)

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,950
(Episode 8)

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,050
I could beg him for forgiveness
a hundred times.

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,720
But what if it's too late?

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,300
I should've done that immediately
when it happened.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,770
Your guest is here.

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,700
This will never happen again.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,200
I'm well aware
of what I did wrong.

10
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,910
But if you forgive me,

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,790
I will never upset you again.

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,460
Honey.

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,210
Honey?

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,880
Lee Yu-an?

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,890
Is this why you wanted me
to bring our kids along?

16
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,310
To show this side of you?

17
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,600
Why didn't you bring the kids?

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,930
Did they not want to see you?

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,190
No.

20
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,480
- They went to a learning center.
- I see.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,940
I needed to talk to you too.

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,860
Don't.

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,900
What now? Can you keep working?

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,450
Oh, I thought...

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,700
Why is Nam Wan-seong so desperate

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,330
to bring you down?

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,120
Because his son got arrested
for selling drugs.

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,210
I mean,

29
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,080
why is he blaming you
for his son's fault?

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,840
To stop his son
from ending up in prison.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,050
He threatened the witness

32
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,090
and attempted to frame
the dead girl.

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,720
So I prosecuted his son
to serve him right.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,050
What a lunatic.

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,680
What are you doing here?
Go out there and arrest him.

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,810
So you can at least
explain yourself.

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,520
I will get him.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,890
I swear I'll take him down,

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,230
but to do that,

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,570
the land...

41
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,990
The land...

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,490
The land? What land?

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,700
I'm sorry, honey.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,210
Seo Dong-jae, you dumbass!

45
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,920
Shoot.

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,300
Is that the only way?

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,220
Yes.

48
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,010
Nam Wan-seong's probably waiting
for his moment to disclose it.

49
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,180
I guess that leaves us no choice.

50
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,980
The first truth out of your mouth

51
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,650
is that?

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,650
Thank you.

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,940
Can't you not thank me
for something like this?

54
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,360
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,530
But

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,320
only if you understand it,

57
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,410
I'll be able to go for it
without looking back.

58
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,830
I'll be able to bust
Nam Wan-seong's ass.

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,340
- Write it down.
- Oh.

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,550
I, Seo Dong-jae...

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,100
No, Lee Yu-an's husband
Seo Dong-jae...

62
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,520
Honey.

63
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,890
Like I always say,
an oath has no effect...

64
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,230
Go ahead.

65
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,650
If I fail to do the following,

66
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,030
I will give up on all my fortune
and custody of my children

67
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,860
and agree

68
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,990
to divorce.

69
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,240
One.

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,700
- I will
- I will...

71
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,330
arrest Nam Wan-seong
with my hands

72
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,830
to redeem myself.

73
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,260
Two.

74
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,760
I must not get involved
in any scandals

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,060
related to money or sexual escort.

76
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,610
(Lee Jun-hyuk)

77
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,160
(Park Sung-woong)

78
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,760
(Dongjae, The Good or the Bad)

79
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,190
Do you play golf?

80
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,270
When it gets warmer, we should
go for a round in my club.

81
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,490
I didn't get myself involved
in any way.

82
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,320
It was
all that prosecutor's doing.

83
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,570
Yet he prosecuted my son.

84
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,870
Isn't that revenge?

85
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,910
My son wasn't the first victim

86
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,710
he framed.

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,250
It's habitual.

88
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,750
I cannot believe
that a man like him

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
is still working as a prosecutor.

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,260
Please calm down.
You brought something?

91
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,340
Yes.

92
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,850
Now that he's a law firm owner?
So what?

93
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,560
He thinks he's so big now.

94
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,520
I saw him next to his dad
since he was this little.

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,230
First of all,
you're ahead of this game.

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,070
I wonder
how Seo Dong-jae will react

97
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,820
if Kang Won-cheol becomes
Gyeo-rye's attorney.

98
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,660
You'll meet him soon.
You'll be working together.

99
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,700
Me?

100
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,200
With Kang Won-cheol?

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,000
If he doesn't prepare
the trial thoroughly

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,330
just because Seo Dong-jae's
his junior,

103
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,750
report it to me right away.

104
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,460
I'll sue him for malpractice.

105
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,800
Yes, sir.

106
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,010
I wonder if he'd still adore
a problematic junior

107
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,970
like Seo Dong-jae.

108
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,890
No, he shouldn't.

109
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,730
Oh, the director asked me when you
are available for the next shoot.

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,190
You announced a second
disclosure on Prosecutor Seo.

111
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,270
The first one was a hit.

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,770
It was pretty influential.

113
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,570
The whole nation is against
Prosecutor Seo now.

114
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,490
Right.

115
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,820
If you also reveal the land issue,

116
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,740
Seo Dong-jae will be...

117
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,120
Fired.

118
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,710
And my sweet dirt on him
will become trash.

119
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,040
Don't you think Kang Won-cheol has
an attitude problem?

120
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,840
Why do you think I went out
of my way to meet a jerk like him?

121
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,050
Right.

122
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,100
Kang Won-cheol worked
as a chief prosecutor.

123
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,970
No matter who takes the case
after Prosecutor Seo gets fired,

124
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,430
he'll still be influential.

125
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,060
If it's about anything else,

126
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,110
you won't have to worry.

127
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,270
Anything else?

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,780
Even if the land becomes an issue.

129
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,440
You have nothing to worry about.

130
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,650
Because the statute of limitations
for bribery is--

131
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,030
10 years.

132
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,080
You think I didn't check that?
What do you take me for?

133
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,040
You knew that's passed already?

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,290
Of course.

135
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,620
Whoever took it may forget about
it, but I can even give the date.

136
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,290
Oh.

137
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,300
Seo Dong-jae's not worth a penny
unless he's a prosecutor.

138
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,220
I can't let him become a civilian
that easily.

139
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,510
I'll squeeze him

140
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,890
to every last drop.

141
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,180
Right.

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,640
Are you making a lot
from the channel?

143
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,060
This isn't about money.

144
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,030
It's for you and to keep my word
with my subscribers.

145
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,610
Hello?

146
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,370
A girl who looks like a reporter?

147
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,160
The construction site?

148
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,790
- Get out.
- Bye.

149
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,870
When?

150
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,710
How did the reporter find out
about the junkie in the storage?

151
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,800
If any traces are left,
get rid of them all.

152
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,550
And find out if she was
really a reporter. Got it?

153
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,010
As you know as a tax accountant,

154
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,600
all businessmen do it, right?

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,390
I heard Ehong Construction has
many issues.

156
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Any dirt on them?

157
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,390
Like tax evasion.

158
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,230
What?

159
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,900
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

160
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,280
Can I borrow a smoke?

161
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,450
Sure.

162
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,410
I guess they let you smoke?

163
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,620
It doesn't take
that long to smoke.

164
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,910
If they won't let me,
I'd rather quit.

165
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,380
I see. Is this place...

166
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,710
(Ehong Construction Cheongju
District 5 Redevelopment)

167
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,050
Oh, Ehong Construction?

168
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,760
- Do you know?
- I've heard about it.

169
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,680
That they're thriving in Cheongju.

170
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,140
By the way,

171
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,930
do they make sure to keep you safe
and pay you for overtime?

172
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,020
The construction site.

173
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,190
They have a day off once a month.

174
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,440
Every third Saturday.

175
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,610
For the rest, they take turns,

176
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,030
so there will be people
at night too.

177
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,320
Third Saturday. That's tomorrow.

178
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,410
Tomorrow.

179
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,830
- 3 p.m.?
- 3 p.m.?

180
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,870
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

181
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,000
It sounds like

182
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,670
your son's case is
about bribery as well?

183
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,220
I'll tell you everything
next time.

184
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,680
Next time, my ass.

185
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,280
Who is it?

186
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,740
(Prosecutor Yang Jong-in)

187
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,200
Hello?

188
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,990
What?

189
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,330
Have a good day.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, Reporter Shin.

191
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,040
I don't know anything about it.

192
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,050
What's on e-pros?

193
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,390
Nice.

194
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,930
Hello?

195
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,730
What?

196
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,980
Does that mean
we've lost our item?

197
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,280
Shoot, it was a chance
to raise the views.

198
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,490
That's discouraging.

199
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,660
No, wait.

200
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,580
Hang on.

201
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,870
One second.

202
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,800
What did he spill?

203
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,010
Everything.

204
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,810
You know the intranet
for prosecutors?

205
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,020
The prosecutors post this and that
there every day.

206
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,600
And Seo Dong-jae...

207
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,350
Last night,
when I left the office,

208
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,730
I saw the banner to fire

209
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,400
manipulative, violent, and
corrupted Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

210
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,530
I'm sure a lot of people
who passed the office saw it.

211
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,860
I'm ashamed.

212
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,410
I'm well aware

213
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,910
that my past wrongdoing is
tying me down

214
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,290
like the scarlet letter.

215
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,870
That he met you
when he was a rascal,

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,330
and you gave him the land.

217
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,840
That's what he posted.

218
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,420
Then you threatened him with it

219
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,300
and forced him to find
your son innocent.

220
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,390
What the hell is
that guy thinking?

221
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,430
He has no shame.

222
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,140
I hope one day the truth

223
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,310
about Nam Gyeo-rye's
crime is revealed.

224
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,020
Oh, right. Sir.

225
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,110
Did you tell Seo Dong-jae
about that too?

226
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,320
What?

227
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,900
About the redevelopment.

228
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,070
That you knew about it
through a congressman.

229
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,360
You bribed a congressman

230
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,370
to sneak out
the redevelopment plan.

231
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,540
Then you kicked out the innocent
residents for a dirt cheap price

232
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,750
and took all that vast land.

233
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,410
That lunatic.

234
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,750
That's not all.

235
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,960
Because the disciplinary committee
is in progress, he can't quit.

236
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,760
He'll follow the result,
so give him some more time.

237
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
He pretended to be

238
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,260
all conscientious and dignified.

239
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,260
All his fellows are aware
of the disciplinary committee.

240
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,890
But why did he bother asking them

241
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,720
to give him some time
on the intranet?

242
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,560
He was asking reporters
to spread it.

243
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,770
And the reporters bought it
like a blabbermouth.

244
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,520
What the hell was
that dumbass thinking?

245
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,780
Sir, are you going to just sit
on your hands and watch this?

246
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,780
You need to refute.
We need to upload

247
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,410
our argument.

248
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,280
Prepare it now.

249
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,330
Yes.

250
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,460
Yes!

251
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,420
Let's go for a million.

252
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,800
Go to your room, you idiot.

253
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,390
You're in Grade 12, but I've never
seen you sitting on your desk.

254
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,390
Are you a student or a bum?

255
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,980
Pretend to be sorry at least if
you have any sense of conscience.

256
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,770
Go live with your mom,
you piece of crap.

257
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,780
(Congressman Kim Sang-hoe)

258
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,620
Yes, congressman.

259
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,040
Oh, hi, Mr. Secretary.

260
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,130
('Find my son innocent')

261
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,000
(CEO Nam Wan-seong threatened me)

262
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,550
What the...

263
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,260
(Nam Gyeo-rye is currently
prosecuted)

264
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,170
(for violation of drug control)

265
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,430
(Boss)

266
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,720
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,890
Prosecutor Jo,
check Prosecutor Seo's dorm now.

268
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,480
Now? Me?

269
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Seo Dong-jae's posting on e-pros.

270
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,940
I got a bad feeling about it.

271
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,480
I doubt he'd do that.

272
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,320
He turned his phone off.

273
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,450
What makes you think
he'd blow the whistle?

274
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,530
He posted that
as if he'd given up on his life

275
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,990
and turned off his phone.

276
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,910
If he thinks about anything
stupid, we'll be in big trouble.

277
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,830
Okay.

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,340
I heard you. Bye.

279
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,460
But it's barely...

280
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,130
If anything happened to him,
I'll eat my hat.

281
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,260
Why's she going overboard
for nothing? What a hassle.

282
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,110
Is this strong enough to hold?

283
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,490
Hold what?

284
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,700
What...

285
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,710
(WEST&EAST Law Firm)

286
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,300
Even if no law firm accepts me,

287
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,970
I'll never make my family starve.

288
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,850
Crime stories
told by a former prosecutor.

289
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,970
West And East.

290
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,640
Thanks to all your support,

291
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,310
the number of subscribers already
went over 900,000.

292
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,400
But I'm still thirsty.

293
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,940
Don't forget to subscribe and like

294
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,400
until it reaches a million, okay?
We can do it.

295
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,240
What's so wrong about that?

296
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,280
People are doing well,
and so will I.

297
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,450
I won't die
even if I quit the prosecution.

298
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,790
It's not the end of the world.

299
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,770
But that's not the problem here.

300
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,480
I can't do this alone.

301
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,110
Did Sung Si-woon
go to his parents' house?

302
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,700
I'll help you.

303
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
No. Prosecutor Seo.

304
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Oh, no. Prosecutor Seo.

305
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,130
Prosecutor Jo is perfect for this.

306
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,420
Hey, Byung-gun.

307
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,590
Will you help me
for the last time?

308
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,720
No way.

309
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,270
What if he's attempting suicide?

310
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,350
This is crazy.

311
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,570
Are you trying to tease me?

312
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,490
How can you turn your phone off
after what you've done?

313
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,200
Why are you raising your voice?

314
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,160
How can I not?

315
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,490
I almost punched you in the face.

316
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,200
I thought I had to
prepare a funeral.

317
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,950
Sorry.

318
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,080
If you surprised everyone,
you should've at least...

319
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,830
What?

320
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,630
I'm sorry,
Prosecutor Jo Byung-gun.

321
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,930
You're suspended from work.

322
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,770
Transfer your work
and wait in the dorm.

323
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,150
Jo Byung-gun.

324
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,870
What's that?

325
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,580
My goodness.

326
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,920
There's something to dig out.

327
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,840
Dig out?

328
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,090
His name is Park Jung-woo.

329
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,050
Ehong Construction's
subcontract worker.

330
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,570
The main rebars should be
15cm apart,

331
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,400
but it was over 30cm.

332
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,320
The mushroom slab columns are

333
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,490
missing one of three rebars.

334
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,910
The worker who reported it,
and the testimony.

335
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,710
He was the one who reported
that it was the construction CEO

336
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,370
who ordered
the insufficient construction.

337
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,420
That's how he reported
Nam Wan-seong.

338
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,590
But after he reported it...

339
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,250
His phone was last used
at the construction site.

340
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,500
There's no chance
of getting a warrant.

341
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,010
The suspect is clear.

342
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,880
But no one knows
if his body is there.

343
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,340
But if it's there,

344
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,970
it's a game changer.

345
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,470
What's the point?

346
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Are you taking advantage of Nam
to turn the tables?

347
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,270
The man who talked bullcrap
about Seo Dong-jae

348
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,860
turned out to be a murderer.

349
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm sure people won't buy
what Nam Wan-seong says.

350
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,490
Hey, who's worse?

351
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,990
Me or Nam Wan-seong?

352
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,990
There's barely any difference.

353
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,370
Nam Wan-seong is slightly worse.

354
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,290
Definitely worse.

355
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,830
Yes.

356
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,840
I know I'm a mess,

357
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,710
but he's worse than me,
so I must arrest him.

358
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,930
The boss will be worried.

359
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,470
No, don't tell her.

360
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,520
She was worried
that you would've been dead.

361
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,600
Remember the 100,000-dollar
porcelain incident?

362
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,230
That was supposed to be yours.
How do you think I got it?

363
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,560
Because it was
a petty car accident?

364
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,440
Did Nam Wan-seong...

365
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,700
Prosecutor Kim already knew.

366
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,530
That's why she didn't report it.

367
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,540
Is there anything
she doesn't know about?

368
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,630
Hey.

369
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,970
You're that wench
from last time, aren't you?

370
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,220
Come out.

371
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,430
Find her first.

372
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,760
Who are they?

373
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,730
Shoot. He said
no one would be here.

374
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,480
- The number you have dialed...
- There she is!

375
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,410
Who are you? A reporter?

376
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,580
Is she dead?

377
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,290
Why bother going down? Just
put cement like the last time.

378
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,340
- With what?
- Do we have any prepared?

379
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,500
No.

380
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,960
Then

381
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,670
let's just bury her.

382
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,340
Yes.

383
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,140
Hey, she opened her eyes.

384
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,940
What a joke.

385
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,820
Who the hell are you?

386
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,450
What the hell are you doing
in our construction site?

387
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,540
Hey.

388
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,960
Are you deaf?

389
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,470
- Hey, over there.
- What?

390
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,850
Isn't that Prosecutor Kim's car?

391
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,520
It is.

392
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,730
303... That's the one, right?

393
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,320
Yes, but why is it empty?

394
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,480
She should've waited.
She must've gone in first.

395
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,490
- Hey.
- Yes?

396
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,950
I had my phone off.

397
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,160
Who are you to blame? Geez.

398
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,370
Perhaps she called me.

399
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,750
What...

400
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,670
What? You think we're boasting?

401
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,510
Spill it out
before I count to three.

402
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,470
If you piss me off even more,
I'll pour the cement for real.

403
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,890
- Why isn't she picking up?
- Is she not picking up?

404
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,810
Where is she?

405
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,230
One,

406
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,940
two...

407
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,730
Hello...

408
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,400
Kim Ji-hee!

409
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,450
Prosecutor Kim!

410
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,740
What the hell?
What's wrong with her?

411
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,030
What the hell are you doing?
We haven't even poured it yet.

412
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,330
Go.

413
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,760
Take this.

414
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,800
- Prosecutor?
- Is this real?

415
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,350
- What's that?
- Prosecutor Kim.

416
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,980
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Prosecutor Seo? Another one?

417
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,730
- Over here.
- Shoot.

418
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,940
Over there.

419
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,440
Here.

420
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,610
Prosecutor Kim.

421
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,780
- Are you okay?
- Get them.

422
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,030
- Hey, go.
- Me?

423
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,240
- Go.
- Alone?

424
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,160
Hurry.

425
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,200
Let me see. Are you okay?

426
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,200
- You'll miss him.
- No, don't move.

427
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,210
You're bleeding from your head.

428
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,210
Shoot, where did they go?

429
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,920
Stop right there. Hey.

430
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,840
Geez.

431
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,680
Gosh.

432
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,470
I saw your faces!

433
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,970
Do we have anything to press it?

434
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,690
How do you feel? Dizzy?

435
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,520
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

436
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,770
Did you miss them?

437
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,320
Shoot.

438
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,150
Fast like runners...

439
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,700
Damn it.

440
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,770
(Cheongju General Hospital)

441
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,070
One civic group reported
an alleged fraud

442
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,740
regarding Ehong Construction's
redevelopment.

443
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,410
They filed a report
urging an investigation

444
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,080
on Ehong Construction CEO's
suspicion based on

445
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,340
the posting written by Prosecutor
Seo from Cheongju District.

446
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,880
Do you think
the redevelopment corruption

447
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,430
will be sent to the 9th floor

448
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,800
or consider it a property issue
and send it to us?

449
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,220
9th floor.

450
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,520
Why? She might give it to us.

451
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,270
You may be a concerned party,
but you're suspended from work.

452
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,480
It has to go to the 9th floor.

453
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,270
Are they the same people

454
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,740
who kidnapped Park Chan-hyuk?
That CEO.

455
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,200
What happened to him?

456
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,200
Nothing new. Still searching.

457
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,780
- Oh.
- Prosecutor Kim.

458
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,490
Are you okay? Where's she going?

459
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,910
She's getting a head CT scan.

460
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,580
What were you thinking
to go in there by yourself?

461
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,330
No wonder your head got smashed.

462
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,880
Can you tell him
to keep his mouth shut?

463
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,920
What's that attitude? Do you know
what Mr. Seo went through today?

464
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,960
Stop it.

465
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,220
- One second.
- Yes.

466
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
That was...

467
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,470
That was the grave.

468
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Did you see anything?

469
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,890
It seems they've buried people in
the construction site with cement.

470
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,650
Why bother going down? Just
put cement like the last time.

471
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,820
Those jerks...

472
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,570
This isn't our first time.

473
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,150
They said it wasn't
their first time burying people.

474
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,860
The only difference is whether
they did it with cement or soil.

475
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,990
We just need to find the hole.

476
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,240
Okay. Get some rest first.

477
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,740
- She's going in.
- Okay.

478
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,590
Does that mean Park Chan-hyuk is
in one of those holes?

479
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,510
But the thing is, we can't keep it
a secret from our boss.

480
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,180
Why there?

481
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,470
I'm not sure
if it was a coincidence.

482
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,810
The thing is, the prosecutor who
got hurt saw the boys' faces.

483
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,310
I can't get ahold of them.

484
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,730
If the prosecutor got hurt,

485
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,770
they must've taken off
because it was out of control.

486
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,030
Find them now!

487
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,400
Get rid of them
as soon as you find them.

488
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,320
And what's her face?

489
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,030
The prosecutor who came after me
with the construction worker.

490
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,280
You mean Kim Ji-hee?

491
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,370
I'm not sure if that was her.

492
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,540
What do you mean?
She showed up there.

493
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,830
How can this be a coincidence?

494
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,580
How!

495
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,120
Sir, then

496
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,170
should I move it?

497
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,230
Do you have to leave
the hospital now?

498
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,020
Just get some rest for a few days.

499
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,030
I need to show this
to get the warrant at least.

500
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,280
What warrant?

501
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,650
Search warrant for violence.

502
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,820
- Hey...
- Here you are.

503
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,820
Thank you.

504
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,740
Hey, how can you get a warrant

505
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,120
when you went in there
on your own?

506
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,700
So why did you miss them
right under your nose?

507
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,450
I even bought time for you.

508
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,540
Hey, I didn't miss them.

509
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,540
You should've tried.
They were already far gone.

510
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,170
We should've made plans.

511
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,170
There is no planning in running.

512
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,170
Who measures it before running?

513
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,420
To find the body like that
in such a vast place.

514
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,680
We only alerted Nam Wan-seong.

515
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,350
There was no alternative.

516
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,430
I'm not blaming you.
I was there too.

517
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,190
Still, it wasn't all for nothing.

518
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,600
There must've been a body.

519
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,230
Exactly.
How are we going to find it?

520
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,530
Oh.

521
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,740
- The metal detector.
- What?

522
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,870
A body was found
with a metal detector before.

523
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,460
Because the weapon was buried too.

524
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,920
Oh.

525
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,090
The workers might know.

526
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,680
The chief construction worker
or the captain.

527
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,140
Something must've changed
compared to what they've done.

528
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,560
Like soil being turned over.

529
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,640
Right.

530
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,400
Ask them if it's not strange

531
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,940
for a man who reported
their boss to disappear

532
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,110
without a trace overnight.

533
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,940
Exactly.

534
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,740
The workers there aren't the same.

535
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,070
- What?
- What do you mean?

536
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,610
Ehong blamed the construction cost
to its subcontractor

537
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,200
and replaced it.

538
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,580
What about that? The pyramid.

539
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,580
- The pyramid?
- Yes, the X-ray

540
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,710
that lets you scan the pyramid
and find the mummy.

541
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,790
How big does it have to be
to scan the pyramid?

542
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,340
Will that even get inside
the construction site?

543
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,420
But you can still find the mummy

544
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,720
without drilling
the wall or a pipe.

545
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,550
What was that again
in mummies or bodies?

546
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,010
Muon detector.

547
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,970
What?

548
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,810
It doesn't detect a mummy

549
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,430
but a space inside the pyramid.

550
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,600
But if they poured cement
or soil...

551
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,610
It's unlikely that there's
any empty space around the body.

552
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,610
Our only hope now is

553
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,370
our boss.

554
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Come on.

555
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Did you make sure to bury the
broken porcelain, Attorney Joo?

556
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,280
Not yet. The land is still frozen.

557
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,540
You should've made the guys
from yesterday do it.

558
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,290
What do you mean
by the guys from yesterday?

559
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,040
The ones that took Park Chan-hyuk.

560
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,790
Who's Park Chan-hyuk?

561
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,550
I don't believe

562
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,390
you went out of your way
to suggest it first.

563
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,970
I've been investigating.

564
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,520
You already know, right?

565
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,850
One of my co-workers was attacked
by Nam's henchmen yesterday.

566
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,480
That made it clear.

567
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,690
That's how you and I got to

568
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,860
talk for this long.

569
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,320
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

570
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,780
Where's Park Chan-hyuk?

571
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,910
Who on earth is that?

572
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,000
Nam Wan-seong is worse
than you think.

573
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,750
Don't get yourself burned
by staying next to him.

574
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,670
Jump out before the boat sinks.

575
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,220
Prosecutor Jo.

576
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,640
Who's Park Chan-hyuk?

577
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,970
You need to get something to eat.

578
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,860
What?

579
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,980
My bad.

580
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,990
The materials kept disappearing
in the site,

581
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,780
so I told them to stand guard.

582
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,490
I didn't expect this to happen.

583
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,830
They must've panicked
and gone off the grid.

584
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,660
I swear I'll find them
and send them here.

585
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,460
Captain Im, summon Nam Wan-seong.

586
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,420
The thugs' fingerprints from
the construction site are on this.

587
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,340
(Criminal Record, Lee Dong-cheol)

588
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,850
Oh, no. He was an ex-convict.
He won't show up then.

589
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,310
You'll have to get him.

590
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,270
Why did you have your bodyguards
watch the construction site

591
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,820
instead of construction workers?

592
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,570
He's not my bodyguard.

593
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,700
Your henchman?

594
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,450
Stop smiling and answer me.

595
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,550
Nam Wan-seong,
you hurt a prosecutor.

596
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,720
You won't be able to
escape from this.

597
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,100
I'm here to turn myself in.

598
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,390
I'm Park Chan-hyuk.

599
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,230
I'm the one who spread Purple
in Cheongju.

600
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,980
I received it and gave it
to the sellers.

601
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,400
To Im Yu-ri.

602
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,030
Hey! Stop your bullcrap.

603
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,160
You seem busy.
I'll leave you alone now.

604
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,290
Sit down.

605
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,620
Im Yu-ri

606
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,960
stole it.

607
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,790
I'm sorry.

608
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,710
Hey.

609
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,380
This isn't your only charge.

610
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,800
You're also guilty of bribery.

611
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,840
Oh, that?

612
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,720
I'll send my attorney. One second.

613
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,580
What? Wait, wait.
What was that again?

614
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,670
Yes.

615
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,720
Okay. Got it.

616
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,880
Have a good day.

617
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,650
You thought I came here
unprepared?

618
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,780
Sir, are you out?

619
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,740
- Schedule for a visit.
- A visit? What visit?

620
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,990
The dollar diner.

621
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,910
Get him to sign it
before the ribbon cutting.

622
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,580
Tell him I, CEO Nam Wan-seong,

623
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,840
ruined Seo Dong-jae's life
big time

624
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,880
nothing like
how his life is ruined.

625
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,840
What's left for Seo is going down,

626
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,970
so he better sign the real estate
purchase agreement.

627
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,890
It's his last chance.

628
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,810
Yes, sir.

629
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,810
Shoot.

630
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,900
Using the boss doesn't feel right.

631
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,700
She won't be taken advantage

632
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,490
as long as she doesn't spill it
to CEO Nam.

633
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,160
Although I prefer she does.

634
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,160
Tell her that the body is there
for sure,

635
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,370
and we know it.

636
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,790
And the boss spills that
to CEO Nam.

637
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,580
CEO Nam moves the body.

638
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,290
It's the fastest way
to make him dig it himself.

639
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,090
Did you apply for the construction
site search warrant?

640
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,090
Yes.

641
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,340
So?

642
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,470
It was rejected.

643
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,220
What achievement have you made
for summoning the lawyer?

644
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,480
Well, Park Chan-hyuk suddenly
appeared out of nowhere

645
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,230
and said Im Yu-ri sold it
and Nam Gyeo-rye knows nothing.

646
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,070
If he was going to turn himself
in, he should've come to me.

647
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,900
Why do you think he went there?

648
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,780
Now you change the order?

649
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,030
You didn't summon the lawyer
because Park Chan-hyuk showed up,

650
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,280
but because you summoned him,
Park Chan-hyuk showed up.

651
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,080
So you let him go
without any gain?

652
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,950
That's true...

653
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,870
I'm sorry.

654
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,170
No need to apologize.

655
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,250
I won't accept your apology.

656
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,630
Empty your room for Sung Si-woon.

657
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,430
If you've taught him well,
he should be able to take over.

658
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,560
I don't know if he learned
anything from there.

659
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,350
Yes.

660
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Get out, all of you.

661
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,410
I don't know
what she's going to do.

662
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,620
Judging by what she said,
I can't tell.

663
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,100
Do you have something to say?

664
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,480
Come in.

665
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,240
I heard Park Chan-hyuk
turned himself in.

666
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,580
About the suspension
of prosecution.

667
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,450
Because the witness disappeared.

668
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,420
Yes, you wrote the report, right?

669
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,170
Yes.

670
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,500
Is that why you went to
the construction site yesterday?

671
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,720
Yes.

672
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,140
Park Chan-hyuk suddenly
turned himself in

673
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,640
because he was scared.

674
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,140
Seeing what happened
to his brother-in-law and...

675
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,600
And my daughter
who worked with him.

676
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,150
That's bullcrap.

677
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
What could possibly happen to him
when the perpetrator is caught?

678
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,240
Couldn't he put more effort
into his excuse?

679
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,450
Do you think
it's in the construction site?

680
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,290
Is it Nam Wan-seong's doing?

681
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,750
To wish the safety

682
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,420
of Seowon-gu industrial
complex redevelopment,

683
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,960
we will now shovel the first spade
to announce its beginning.

684
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,800
Cheongju industrial area
redevelopment plan

685
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,220
that was full of rumors

686
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,550
is on the rise
after selecting the contractor

687
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,890
and finally shoveled
its first spade today.

688
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,190
However, recently, many issues
arose regarding Ehong Construction

689
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,900
that became a contractor...

690
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,610
Sector A written in the brochure

691
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,480
is over there.

692
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,700
An apartment complex same as
the most expensive one in Seoul

693
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,200
will be built there.
It'll draw a floating population

694
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,620
to Cheongju like never before.

695
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,250
Section B is that way.

696
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,870
What we're focusing on
is Section A.

697
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,630
This way.

698
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,230
He didn't hear any sound,

699
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,400
but when he returned
after cleaning, the door was open.

700
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,630
Considering the time they were
caught in the surveillance camera,

701
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,340
they must've come here

702
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,380
after hurting the prosecutor
in the construction site.

703
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,710
Did you report it?

704
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,340
No, neither did the manager.

705
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,180
How dare they prepare
the escape fund with my money?

706
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,230
Find them
and bring just one to me.

707
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,560
Who--

708
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,150
Anyone!

709
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,640
I've read your testimony.

710
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,520
You recited it nicely.

711
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,890
Did CEO Nam order you?

712
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,320
What the hell is that?

713
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,620
Were you tortured?

714
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,870
Say it.

715
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,580
Hey, I got your back.

716
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,210
If you stay like this,

717
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,250
now that Choi Geum-ho's dead,

718
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,460
you'll have to take
all the blame, you know?

719
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,680
What the hell did they do to you?

720
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,350
What's gotten into you?
Hey, Park Chan-hyuk.

721
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Chan-hyuk.

722
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,420
Do you think
it's in the construction site too?

723
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,090
To be honest,

724
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,180
there are no other options.

725
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,720
I feel bad for the witness,

726
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,930
but unless he's alive somewhere,

727
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,730
we won't have hope unless it was
done in the construction site.

728
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,570
This was a rent fraud.

729
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,400
So it was first sent to
the 9th floor.

730
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,070
Then it was transferred to us

731
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,660
after the victim assaulted
the perpetrator.

732
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,240
Do you know Prosecutor Park
on the 9th floor?

733
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,830
You mean Prosecutor
Park Woon-jung? Yes.

734
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,660
If you have questions,
ask Prosecutor Park.

735
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,620
And whether to extenuate
the situation.

736
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,460
I know it's chaotic to take over
my cases all of a sudden.

737
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,220
The assignments you had
because you were a newbie

738
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,430
like giving tours, talk to
the boss about distributing them.

739
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,260
And...

740
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,060
You can always rely
on the investigators for the rest.

741
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,270
- Thank you in advance.
- Oh, no.

742
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,440
We'll do our best to help you.

743
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,070
Good luck, Prosecutor Sung.

744
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,490
You got this because I...

745
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,180
Let me get some rest now.

746
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,230
Thank you for all your work.

747
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,150
Thank you for everything.

748
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,650
You never know.

749
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,440
If it turns out well,
you can always come back.

750
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,070
Well, I'll leave it
to Prosecutor Sung now.

751
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,240
Good luck, okay?

752
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,030
I'm not sure what your first
assignment is going to be yet.

753
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,740
Oh, that is...

754
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,080
It's begun.

755
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,620
What?

756
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,940
Wait. Won-cheol.

757
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,280
- Prosecutor Sung Si-woon?
- Yes.

758
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,950
Are you Nam Gyeo-rye's attorney?

759
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,780
I'm Kang Won-cheol.

760
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,870
I'm Joo Jung-gi.

761
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,120
Uh...

762
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,540
Who do I talk to?

763
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,460
Him.

764
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,880
Shall we start?

765
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,880
Yes.

766
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,460
This way.

767
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,980
Sung Si-woon's first
assignment is...
