Even the one who makes
strong drugs

100
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,160

101
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,080
And I remembered
who smelled like one.

102
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,750
The bowling center he ran
was under a stolen name.

103
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,370
So were his phone
and his bank account.

104
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,920
When I thought I had no chance
to find him,

105
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,880
I found crucial evidence.

106
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,220
The medical record.

107
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,010
You can get a phone or open
a bank account with a stolen name,

108
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,260
but you can't do that
with a medical treatment.

109
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,720
He has to go there in person.

110
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,310
I went all the way to the Ministry
of Food and Drug Safety.

111
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,980
I looked up all the records

112
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,940
of opioids prescription

113
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,560
near Cheongju.

114
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,360
Can you briefly tell us
about the case?

115
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,530
Why did you kill him?

116
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,200
Hong Tae-ik wanted to pull out,

117
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,950
but Kang Soo-min didn't want that.

118
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,000
Hello?

119
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,830
I told you today was
the last batch.

120
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,000
Let me live in peace.

121
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,960
Now that this happened,
it's either do or die.

122
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,880
Unless you want to die,
keep making it.

123
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,720
Then the drugs were found
in a wrong place.

124
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,470
Im Yu-ri.

125
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,720
Kang Soo-min thought
someone who wanted to quit

126
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,350
joined hands with someone else.

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,690
The feeling of betrayal

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,650
made him angry.

129
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,310
After Im Yu-ri was murdered,

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,230
he attempted to kill
Hong Tae-ik too.

131
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,650
But he was murdered
by Hong Tae-ik instead.

132
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,160
Why did he shoot the man
who was already dead

133
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,780
due to drugs?

134
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,580
Were you taking revenge
for Yu-ri? You of all people?

135
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,670
You son of a gun.

136
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,960
How dare you...

137
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,760
Sign it.

138
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,140
When everyone went to
Pyeongtaek Harbor

139
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,430
after the victim's car was found,

140
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,140
you were the only one
who chose to go to the hospital?

141
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,930
The drug makers suffer

142
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,560
from COPD

143
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,560
which means chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.

144
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,110
I read that they rely
on immediate-release morphine

145
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,780
from the interview done by

146
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,650
head of the drug team
Kim Ki-sool in the supreme office.

147
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,450
I found the hospital from the
Ministry of Food and Drug Safety,

148
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,490
and I was able to arrest him.

149
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,750
I look forward to meeting him
to thanking him in person soon.

150
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,660
Thank you so much,
Mr. Kim Ki-sool.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,960
How was it?

152
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,500
Do you want to see it?

153
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,510
Just like all other
fellow prosecutors...

154
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,470
It's kind of cringey.

155
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,930
Then...

156
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,680
No, don't turn it off.

157
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,770
How did you arrest the drug dealer
this time?

158
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,940
What did he say?

159
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,860
What else?

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,740
If I told Nam Gyeo-rye
that he'd be adored

161
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,410
in prison.

162
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,700
Did you tell the human rights
commission that you did?

163
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,790
I said I did because I did.

164
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,040
So what?

165
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,330
What about the cap?

166
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,130
Yu-ri is torn into pieces online.

167
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,970
Congratulations.

168
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,680
Oh, no.

169
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,760
Sit down.

170
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,430
Congratulations.

171
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,470

172

- It's all thanks to you.

Oh, not at all.

- Well done, Prosecutor Jo.
- Thank you.

180
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,830
I know how much you went through.

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,500
I heard you wasted your time
traveling to Seoul and Pyeongtaek.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,760
And you even went on
the guard ship in that weather?

183
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,130
I should've gone to the harbor.
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,640
Prosecutor Sung helped me
big time.

185
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,470
What are you doing? Tell her.

186
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,680
You said it was strange
that the victim washed

187
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,060
the shoes and clothes together

188
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,390
and requested an analysis.

189
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,310
Yes.

190
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,060
And people in my office.

191
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,530
Because I often worked outside
the office, they had a hard time.

192
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,320
- Thank you for your work.
- Thank you.

193
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,610
Thank you.

194
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,820
You're barely eating. Want me
to order you something else?

195
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,830
- Chief Prosecutor.
- Hi.

196
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,050
You should've gone to someplace
nice. Why always here?

197
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,130
Good job.

198
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,300
Thank you.

199
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,840
- Sit down.
- Yes.

200
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,390
Sit down. I don't want to
make you feel uncomfortable.

201
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,970
- This way.
- Should I?

202
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,390
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,730
Oh.

204
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,440
Thanks.

205
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,190
It's an honor.

206
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,020
Chill out. It's okay.

207
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,110
Thank you.

208
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,030
Right. Is your model prosecutor
award ceremony tomorrow?

209
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,900
Yes, sir.

210
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,820
- Who's taking you?
- Me.

211
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,910
Really?

212
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,240
It was me who recommended you.

213
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,290
Oh, yes. Thank you.

214
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,750
I'll make you proud tomorrow.

215
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,460
I'm sure you will.

216
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,250
- How about a toast?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,250
Here.

218
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,460
Congratulations to Team 1.

219
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,340
Thank you.

220
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,220
I can't believe this happened
to our office.

221
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,260
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

222
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,970
Can you replace all the grills

223
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,730
and get us 20 servings
of Korean beef tenderloin?

224
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,980
Have something nice.

225
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,900
Sir, this place costs
over 1,000 dollars.

226
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,990
What's nice about having a chief?
Right?

227
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,240
Thank you.

228
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,280
Wow.

229
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,130
So this is how it feels.

230
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,460
To be in the center
of celebration.

231
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,840
Be in the highlight.

232
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,560
What an eyesore.

233
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,350
You don't know? No?

234
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,060
Okay. Good job.

235
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,230
You know, right?

236
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,690
Chief Prosecutor.

237
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,530
I spent months on this case
to seize the chance...

238
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,400
- Oh, hot.
- Hey.

239
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,450
It was my case, you know?

240
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,450
- Mr. Jo.
- Are you listening?

241
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,200
Let's get up.

242
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,910
It was me who raided the scene.

243
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,170
That's enough.

244
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,670
- If it weren't for seizure--
- Stop it.

245
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,340
My apologies. Why don't we get up?

246
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,260
Yes? Let's go then.

247
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,230
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

248
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,980
Goodnight.

249
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,820
Let's go.

250
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,650
Goodnight.

251
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,200
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Thank you for coming.

252
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,570
Goodnight.

253
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,410
Where's your car key?

254
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,210
Come on.

255
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,170
Gosh, you're so heavy.

256
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,420
- Bye.
- Watch your head.

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,300
Bye.

258
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,840
- Cover him.
- Make sure to cover him.

259
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,720
Bye, Mr. Jo.

260
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,550
Geez, I didn't even get to
say bye to the chief.

261
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,520
Gosh, it's freezing.

262
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,940
(A prosecutor whose specialty
is making manipulated culprits?)

263
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,860
(A shocking past of Prosecutor X)

264
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,110
Pinpoint legal advice for you.

265
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,200
By Jung-gi, for Jung-gi.
Jung-gi TV.

266
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,990
I received a lot of stories
again today.

267
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,580
We'll take a look at that later.

268
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,620
Can you introduce yourself first?

269
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,170
It's Nam Wan-seong.

270
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,800
Are you the father of Nam
who became the suspect

271
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,010
of a recent gunshot death?

272
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,430
Yes.

273
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,390
How's your son doing?

274
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,220
He can't even go to school.

275
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,100
Not to blame his teachers
and friends.

276
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,690
When the prosecutor used
violence against him.

277
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,730
What?

278
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,990
The prosecutor hit him? Why?

279
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,150
To make him the culprit.

280
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,620
People don't do that anymore.

281
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,080
Seriously, you're getting
on my nerves.

282
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,290
What?

283
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,380
I'm going to prolong it.

284
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,920
I'm going to prolong it. Why?

285
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,630
Because you're graduating soon.

286
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,760
I'll wait
until you become an adult...

287
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,260
I'll wait
until you become an adult

288
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,180
and give you life.

289
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,260
I didn't say that.

290
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,770
Those are the exact words
the prosecutor in charge said.

291
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,270
Verbal violence by the prosecutor

292
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,690
in the name of interrogation.

293
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,650
Oh.

294
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,400
You need to be careful.

295
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,440
Well...

296
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,990
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae is

297
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,360
apparently an expert

298
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,570
in this.

299
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,740
Was the name
of the prosecutor in charge

300
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,910
Seo Dong-jae?

301
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,960
Yes, it turns out

302
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,710
my son wasn't the first victim

303
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,710
he framed

304
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,670
an innocent person.

305
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,130
It's habitual.

306
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,470
I cannot believe
that a man like him

307
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,470
is still working as a prosecutor.

308
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,800
Please calm down.

309
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,930
You brought something?

310
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,720
- Yes.
- Let's listen to it.

311
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,480
The police beat me
accusing me of killing my father.

312
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,810
And the prosecutor too.

313
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,320
So I had a crush
on a girl from school.

314
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,530
And my dad got our way,

315
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,700
so I stabbed him.

316
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,320
They said I was a murderer.

317
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,330
I had an evident alibi,

318
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,160
but the prosecutor ignored it.

319
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,460
I'm not making this up.
I later found out

320
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,580
that he tried to plant

321
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,460
fake evidence in my room.

322
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,050
Yes, it was
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

323
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,420
Wait. What?

324
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,800
This isn't the 80s.

325
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,600
It took place in 2017.

326
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,390
So

327
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,640
a prosecutor with over
20 years of experience

328
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,400
gaslighted young kids
that they were murderers.

329
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,730
Just like how he did again
to my son!

330
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,070
I see.

331
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,610
One could say that the prosecutor

332
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,950
is somewhat coercive,

333
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,120
but nothing explains
fake evidence.

334
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,500
He didn't even get fired?

335
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,170
What I'm worried about the most is

336
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,380
that more innocent victims
are expected

337
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,420
to be framed for doing nothing

338
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,220
like my son or this voice.

339
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,630
If he's done that twice before,

340
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,930
what would stop him
from doing it for the third time?

341
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,100
(Wife)

342
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,430
Honey, which suit should I wear...

343
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,680
But why would the prosecutor
do that?

344
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,350
To manipulate the case

345
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,270
by planting fake evidence?

346
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,070
In 2017,

347
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,610
Prosecutor Seo received a bribe

348
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
from a dead man.

349
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,030
What?

350
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,330
He tried to cover it up

351
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,200
before something that leads to him
would appear.

352
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,750
What's shocking is that

353
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,290
- this is exactly the same.
- Prosecutor Seo.

354
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,340
Congratulations.

355
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,420
By 'this,'

356
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,760
it sounds like

357
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,010
your son's case is

358
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,340
about bribery as well?

359
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,930
I need time to think
before I can talk about this.

360
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,690
Oh.

361
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,150
Can you join my show again later?

362
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,230
If it's too much for you
to share everything with us today.

363
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,780
How can the weather be so nice?

364
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,700
I'll tell you everything
next time.

365
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,870
You see,

366
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,540
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Yes.

367
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,540
Here...

368
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,670
Yes?

369
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,550
What? Is there an article
about me or something?

370
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,510
No.

371
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,520
I'll tell you everything
next time.

372
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,690
Oh, my god.

373
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,860
What are we going to do?

374
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,320
(Model Employee Awards
for Second Half of 2023)

375
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,240
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae is
apparently an expert...

376
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,560
One

377
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,230
by one.

378
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,520
How many years did it take me
to walk here?

379
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,480
Prosecutor Seo.

380
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,940
I'm finally here.

381
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,450
I'll live to the fullest.

382
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,990
Please don't let me go down again.

383
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,620
I don't want to go back down.

384
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,930
Is she not here yet?

385
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,560
Isn't that him?

386
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,100
- That's Seo Dong-jae, right?
- No way. It's him.

387
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,560
How brazen. I wouldn't have come
if I were him.

388
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,400
That's crazy.
How can a prosecutor...

389
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,270
He's insane.

390
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,780
(Investigator)

391
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,740
Excuse me.

392
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,490
- Are you Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae?
- Yes.

393
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,290
I'm from the PR team.
We talked on the phone.

394
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,620
Oh, yes.

395
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,790
I didn't expect to meet you here.

396
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,790
Yes.

397
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,080
Thank you
for the interview questions.

398
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,090
Right. But...

399
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,130
Yes?

400
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,470
Sit down, sit down.

401
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,600
- I'm sorry, but will you leave?
- What?

402
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,560
The decision was just made.
You need to leave.

403
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,850
- Decision for what?
- Come with me.

404
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
- Wait.
- Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

405
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,190
The model employee awards
for the second half of 2023...

406
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,030
Didn't we talk on the phone?

407
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,780
- Wait.
- No pictures.

408
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,330
- Honey.
- You need to leave.

409
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,660
Get out.

410
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
First, we will award
the model prosecutor.

411
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,090
The Chief Prosecutor from the
supreme office will present it.

412
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,090
Please give a big round
of applause.

413
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,890
Even though he arrested
a major drug cartel,

414
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,640
we cannot compliment him big time.

415
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,860
Despite what he's done,

416
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,520
he should be glad
if he's not stoned.

417
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,820
I feel bad.

418
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,610
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,110
Don't be.

420
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,410
Because you recommended
someone like him,

421
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,950
the supreme office was humiliated.

422
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,910
That's not your fault.

423
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,620
I think

424
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,620
we can compensate Prosecutor Seo

425
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,130
internally.

426
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,460
- It was me who recommended you.
- Oh, yes.

427
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,420
It's not like that happened
in Cheongju.

428
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,800
It happened a long ago.

429
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,840
No boss would have known, right?

430
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,020
However, if any trouble is
expected to happen,

431
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
but it's not stopped in advance?

432
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,390
That's a matter of leadership.

433
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,610
The same goes for other teams.

434
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,400
You must not stop verifying.

435
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,870
Why aren't you eating?

436
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,450
Eat up.

437
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,700
Eat.

438
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,620
Why do we have to be
on eggshells too?

439
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,170
I told you
we should've eaten outside.

440
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,710
How can we go without our boss?

441
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,050
Is it refreshing?

442
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,340
The soup.

443
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,390
I knew he was always arrogant.

444
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,350
Prosecutor Seo wasn't arrogant.

445
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,770
He made a big mistake.

446
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,020
How dare he try to climb up?

447
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,070
You can't say that.

448
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,650
Considering his age
and years of experience.

449
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,620
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

450
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,210
Will you slow down?

451
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
I'm sorry.

452
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,850
Sorry, I...

453
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,060
Today, I should

454
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,190
just go.

455
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,110
Is it true?

456
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,270
Did you really do that?

457
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,780
Everything they claimed,
is it true?

458
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,410
I don't know. I didn't watch it.

459
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,160
Seriously.

460
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,460
A model prosecutor?

461
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,000
A model prosecutor, my ass.

462
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,210
What are you going to do now?
You idiot.

463
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,960
What a dimwit.

464
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,510
If I die in anger,
I'm going to sue you.

465
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,770
You better ask him
for his forgiveness.

466
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,940
Go on your knees
and beg him, got it?

467
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,610
Don't you dare mention
forgiveness.

468
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,730
Who...

469
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,960
It's the file on Soogok-dong.
About Mr. Kang.

470
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,750
Get the file on the professor
from Prosecutor Seo

471
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,630
- and wrap it up.
- Okay.

472
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,340
The national drug cartel
investigation organization meeting

473
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,800
is taking place
on 15th next month.

474
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,970
You can present it.

475
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,010
Say you arrested the drug maker.

476
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,270
Get every detail
so you can ask every question.

477
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,390
And how he specified the hospital

478
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,480
where the drug maker received
opioids prescription.

479
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,900
Yes.

480
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,780
No news from your snitch yet?

481
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,280
I think he's hiding somewhere

482
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,030
in case he gets attacked
in revenge.

483
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,610
He'll appear soon.

484
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
He's not afraid of anything now
that his brother-in-law's dead.

485
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,040
(Ehong Construction)

486
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,130
Who's here?

487
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,180
Thank you for coming.

488
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,680
What brings you all the way here?

489
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,310
Because of what you've done,

490
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,400
if people see us together outside,

491
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,150
they might think a prosecutor is
trying to make a deal.

492
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,900
You are here to make a deal.

493
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,700
No? Then do you want some coffee?

494
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,910
We can't undo
what's already been done.

495
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,250
Let's stop here.

496
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,590
You got two things wrong.

497
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,220
One. That's not something
for you to say.

498
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,270
Two. You cannot demand it from me

499
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,190
as if you're the boss of me.

500
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,150
You know better than that.

501
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,570
Let's go down together, shall we?

502
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,280
What do you want?

503
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,920
Don't forget.

504
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,420
It's about my brother,

505
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,880
but for you, it's about your son.

506
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,920
Nam Gyeo-rye.

507
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,880
He's already selling drugs
that age.

508
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,550
When his father goes down,

509
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,720
can't you see the kind of life
he's expected to live?

510
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,680
If you mess with my son,

511
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,640
we're all going down.

512
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,940
While I'm asking you
what you want nicely,

513
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,730
get what you want.

514
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,860
Oh, why are you worried
about that?

515
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,030
Huh?

516
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,870
I thought you came
all the way here yourself

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,910
for your subordinates.

518
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,250
But you're here for yourself?

519
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,800
'Seeing what Nam Wan-seong did'

520
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,720
'to Seo Dong-jae,
I can't sit on my hands.'

521
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,630
'I'll end up like him too
one day.'

522
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,260
'I'll take the lead before that.
I'll double down.'

523
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,220
Is that what you had on your mind?

524
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,560
What happened to me?

525
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,480
Come on. I'm not an idiot.

526
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,110
I'm saying I wouldn't tackle you.

527
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,780
And I have nothing on you.

528
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,650
Between you and me, it's

529
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,910
always... You know?

530
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,490
Always.

531
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,740
You know?

532
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,700
All clear.

533
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,870
Yes? All clear.

534
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,330
Yes?

535
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,510
Excuse me.

536
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,270
Should I just jump off
with that Nam jerk?

537
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,490
Why did he have to appear now
after all these years?

538
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,780
What they say is right.

539
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,370
It is better to suffer
an injustice than to inflict one.

540
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,080
Park Kyung-wan.

541
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,000
This is wrong.

542
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,290
This isn't the 19th century.

543
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,880
You can't threaten me
and put me in prison by force.

544
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,340
I even forgot about his name.

545
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,320
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

546
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,400
Prosecutor Seo?

547
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,570
(Disciplinary Committee)

548
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,660
Aware of the disciplinary
suspect's right?

549
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,700
Yes.

550
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,490
You may appoint a special attorney

551
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,000
and submit a supplementary
testimony or evidence.

552
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,160
Are you going to get a lawyer?

553
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,170
No.

554
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,630
In 2017,

555
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,630
after quitting your job,
you moved to the Blue House.

556
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,430
What?

557
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,350
You knew prosecutors were banned
from working in the Blue House.

558
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,970
- Why--
- After leaving the Blue House,

559
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,560
you returned to the prosecution
service as if you were new.

560
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,600
That's an expedient.

561
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,320
I thought I was here

562
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,990
to give my explanation
on the recent disclosure.

563
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,040
Sure. Explain.

564
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,370
Okay.

565
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,500
Nam Wan-seong's claim

566
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,010
resulted from his ill intention

567
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,180
to remove his son's drug charges.

568
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,180
Among the claims he made
in the video,

569
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,350
the biggest problem is

570
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,440
that you manipulated evidence
in 2017.

571
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,070
Is that false?

572
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,990
You cannot say it was manipulated.

573
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,320
You were stopped
by a police officer.

574
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,370
What about his claim
of your verbal violence

575
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,160
that you'd delay it on purpose

576
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,040
to give the minor suspect life?

577
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Is that false?

578
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,330
Well,

579
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,370
it depends on how you put it.

580
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,960
So?
Have you ever said that before?

581
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,670
So it depends on how you put it.

582
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,250
It was the former prosecutor
Lee Chang-joon

583
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,090
who took you to
the Blue House, wasn't it?

584
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,380
What was the reason?

585
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,760
What does that have to do
with this?

586
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,100
Why do you keep bringing up
what happened in the past?

587
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,350
Why else?

588
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,100
It's not so common for someone to
cause issues everywhere he goes.

589
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,980
You were interrogated, and
signs of unlawful act were found,

590
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,650
but no action was taken.

591
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,320
And this is the consequence
of no action being taken.

592
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,570
The committee holds the authority

593
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,370
to interrogate a witness related
to the disciplinary suspect.

594
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,580
Are you aware of that?

595
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,580
A witness related to me?

596
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,910
Who's that?

597
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,710
Prosecutor Hwang Si-mok was
the one who interrogated you.

598
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,500
And the chief prosecutor
at the time was

599
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,460
Prosecutor Kang Won-cheol, right?

600
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,300
Are you saying

601
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,180
you'll interrogate
Prosecutor Hwang because of me?

602
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,770
Although Prosecutor Kang
has retired,

603
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,770
we can still verify the facts
with him.

604
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,310
- Prosecutor Hwang...
- Sir.

605
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,570
I promise to give you
good news soon.

606
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,740
I'll be the junior
you're proud to introduce.

607
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,400
I can be one. Please wait.

608
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,660
Please anything but that.

609
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,660
You can't do that.

610
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,950
- Sit down.
- Please.

611
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,120
Sit down.

612
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,250
Okay.

613
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,540
To Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae,

614
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,540
no more happy choices.

615
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,670
The best this district can
offer you is

616
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,710

617

However, before CEO Nam
makes a second disclosure.

618
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,220
Before he discloses anything new,

619
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,100
clean it up

620
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640

621
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,640

Yes.

for the next video.

625
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,880
Oh, about Park Chan-hyuk.

626
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,840
Yes, I actually had something
to say about him.

No.

Now that the girl's murderer
has been arrested,

630
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,390
you should wrap it up.

631
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,350
You think he'd listen to me now?

632
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,890
He's become obedient.

633
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,610
Obedient enough
to go to the police on his own?

634
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,570

635
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,190

and the CEO
of the construction company...

684
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,180
By that, I mean Nam Wan-seong.

685
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,850
I was about to summon him,
but the worker disappeared.

686

the construction site.

687

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,460
Sir.

729
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,130
If he's prosecuted,
it means there will be a trial.

730
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,300
Who doesn't know that?

731
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,380
Exactly.

732
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,180
Sir.

733
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,600
Prosecutor Seo is showing
he has balls.

734
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,520
That your disclosure
doesn't work on him.

735
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,850
Then let's get someone
he'll listen to.

736
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,570
- Someone he'll listen to?
- Yes.

737
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,440
Prosecutor Seo is a member
of an organization in the end.

738
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,780
Cheongju is close to Seoul.

739
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,370
We have a lot of connections there

740
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,200
and also get a lot of cases.

741
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,870
Yes, I'm sure.

742
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,500
I received recommendations
from various routes.

743
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,250
It was a great recommendation.

744
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,460
It's been a few years
since he retired,

745
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,300
but he worked
as a chief prosecutor.

746
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,510
He's here.

747
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,420
I'm Kang Won-cheol.

748
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,470
I'm Nam Wan-seong.

749
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,720
Nice to meet you.
