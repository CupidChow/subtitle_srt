1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,530
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,870
(and events in this drama
are fictitious)

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,580
(Episode 5)

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,830
Gosh.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,630
The restroom.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,340
Oh, geez.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,840
Goddamn it.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,720
What?

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,760
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,060
But he...

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,890
The restroom.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,690
Chan-hyuk, you can do it.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,860
You'll be fine.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,280
Calm down.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,900
Keep calm. You can do it.

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,060
Okay. All set.

17
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,910
Who's this?

18
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,370
Hello?

19
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,250
Who?

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,840
Tow my car?
But I parked it in the line.

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,420
Fine. I'll be right there.

22
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,970
I'm on my way now.

23
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,840
Give me a second.

24
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,140
If you touch my car,
I'll kill you.

25
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,420
Yu-ri.

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,180
Someone left it in the restroom.

27
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,720
No sticky fingers.

28
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,930
Put that back in there.

29
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,350
It's not just medicine, is it?

30
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,280
Put it back in there now.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,530
Okay, okay. I was going to.

32
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,780
Who the hell is it?

33
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,790
What?

34
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,670
Shoot, where the hell is my bag?

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
What are you doing?

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,430
Where is it?

37
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,050
Who took it?

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,650
Is that him?

39
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,690
Yes, that is him. I should've
arrested him back then.

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,200
- Do you recognize him?
- You know him. Park Chan-hyuk.

41
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,950
You said hi to him
in the hostess bar.

42
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,240
He may be a puppet boss,

43
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,330
but he'd still come out
to greet for a prosecutor.

44
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,380
We picked it up at the terminal.

45
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,430
Wait.

46
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,550
You don't know
who the bag belonged to?

47
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,970
He was lying
about who the bag belonged to.

48
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,610
I never said hi to
the hostess bar puppet boss.

49
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,570
- Who owns it?
- Choi Geum-ho.

50
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,400
The Purple supplier in Cheongju.

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,150
You knew who was in the lead?

52
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Then why haven't you caught him?

53
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,070
I was dumb for that reason.

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,870
I won't waste my time in vain
anymore.

55
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,000
Even if it means going against
prosecutors, we're busting Park.

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,330
Regardless of the warrant.

57
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,750
Can you play it from the start?

58
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,960
Did anyone else request
that video aside from us?

59
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,050
No.

60
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,640
Sir, please locate
Park Chan-hyuk immediately.

61
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,220
What kids were selling is
indeed Purple.

62
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,390
It belonged to Choi Geum-ho.

63
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,500
(Lee Jun-hyuk)

64
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,050
(Park Sung-woong)

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,570
(Dongjae, The Good or the Bad)

66
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,290
Who took it?

67
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,550
So the hostess bar was the hideout
for Cheongju junkies?

68
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,920
Serious enough for Jo Byung-gun
to reject the warrant.

69
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,510
Yet, they lost the drug,

70
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,600
and the kids took it.

71
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,600
That's why...

72
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,350
It disappeared completely.

73
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,810
I'm telling you.
It's a simple supply issue.

74
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,070
If it disappeared completely,

75
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,150
the puppet boss was lucky
that he didn't get killed.

76
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,450
The real boss must've made
so much fuss

77
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,870
when his seed money was gone.

78
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,250
Then the puppet boss found out

79
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,000
who took it

80
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,210
and who sold it.

81
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,970
Did you say you wanted to
buy it all?

82
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,270
That makes more sense
than kids fighting.

83
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,570
Wait.

84
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,820
Because it was a lot of money,

85
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,610
the kids might have had
a conflict.

86
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,450
Then

87
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,040
he didn't retrieve the gun
from Yu-ri,

88
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,370
but he kept it from the start
and shot her.

89
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,540
Only that explains it.

90
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,630
Unless for one exception.

91
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,550
When you shoot the gun,

92
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,430
you need to keep it tight
in your armpit.

93
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,090
And load it.

94
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,720
Down here is the trigger,

95
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,560
and this is the safety.

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,430
From the other side...

97
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Why doesn't it work?

98
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
An accidental shooting.

99
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,900
No, was it accidental?

100
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,110
But then

101
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,120
it could've been the big buyer.

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,710
That makes most people suspects.

103
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,140
Geez, I'm stuck.

104
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,190
Right. One thing is clear.

105
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,780
Whoever the murderer is,
the murderer is a drug dealer.

106
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,650
Have you ever been in charge
of a drug case before?

107
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,200
Sure.

108
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,200
That means Jo Byung-gun isn't
the only person taking the case.

109
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,530
If I catch the murderer

110
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,540
that happens to be a member
of a drug cartel?

111
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,920
Oh, perhaps the drugs might
come out of nowhere

112
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,790
and change the direction
of the wind.

113
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,180
You must be tired.

114
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,270
Traveling here and there
several times a day.

115
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,060
This will be over tomorrow, right?

116
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,730
No new evidence.
The detention period is up.

117
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,070
No additional charges.
He's good to go.

118
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,160
Thank you.

119
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,830
- Sell what?
- Received orders via app...

120
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,080
- The drug?
- At the terminal...

121
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,330
Did you receive orders through
the messenger on your phone?

122
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,210
You sold drugs?

123
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,290
We weren't planning to do that.

124
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,380
That's why I gave her the gun
in case she might get hurt.

125
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,220
Eat.

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,430
You only had gukbap in there. Eat.

127
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,020
Sir.

128
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,310
Your father came out of his way

129
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,770
to get you snacks.

130
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,860
Here.

131
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,340
What did Seo Dong-jae say?
The prosecutor who visited you.

132
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,050
Did he say you'll be fine?

133
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,520
Speak of the devil.

134
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,560
Hey.

135
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,190
You said you didn't know
who the bag belonged to.

136
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,150
The terminal guy.
He found you, didn't he?

137
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Is he the one who said
he'd buy the rest?

138
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,450
Buy what?

139
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,500
I don't know.

140
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,870
I wasn't there.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,290
Come on. All you say is a lie.

142
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,670
Found the bag,
but don't know the owner.

143
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,840
The surveillance camera
caught everything.

144
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,670
You stealing the bag

145
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,970
and taking off
when you knew who it belonged to.

146
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,930
I didn't steal it.

147
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,020
What did you steal?

148
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,400
If I'd told you I knew
who it belonged to,

149
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,020
it'd be considered stealing. But

150
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,570
Yu-ri went to sell it alone.
I swear I saw nothing.

151
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,320
Wait.

152
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,200
Steal what and sell what?

153
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,460
Your father is asking. Tell him.

154
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,260
Nam Gyeo-rye, did you

155
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,300
do anything?

156
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,270
Drugs.

157
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,640
Yes.

158
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,480
I'll let you meet him.

159
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,570
I'll bring the owner
of the bag in front of you

160
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,860
and tell him that you were the one
who stole his bag.

161
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,900
Wait here.

162
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,780
I'm adding the suspect's charges.

163
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,660
Suspicion of murder plus an
embezzlement of a lost property,

164
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,200
and illegal drug trades.

165
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,660
Hey. You can't do this to me.

166
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,420
Don't touch me.

167
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,750
That was a cliche.

168
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,170
Seo...

169
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,140
Sir.

170
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,440
Is he doomed?

171
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,070
Well...

172
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,940
He's a first-timer and juvenile,

173
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,740
but this isn't good timing.

174
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
For drug distribution, even
a first-timer is imprisoned...

175
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,370
But...

176
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,200
Well...

177
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,460
Yu-ri went to sell it alone,
right?

178
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,250
You never said you sold it, right?

179
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,880
Yes.

180
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,460
No one saw it, right?
No one caught you, huh?

181
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,130
Yes.

182
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,840
Okay.

183
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,970
What now?

184
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,550
In terms of the drug,

185
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,100
conditional suspension
of prosecution is the best,

186
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,310
but now that more charges are
added, the prosecutor--

187
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,940
Did I not give you enough money

188
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,770
or refuse to get you anything
you wanted?

189
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,440
What more did you need?
What did you lack?

190
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,450
Hey. I'll get you out of here.

191
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,700
- Can you do it? Can you?
- Yes. Of course.

192
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,200
When you get out of here,

193
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,120
I'll kill your ass first. Got it?

194
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,910
You idiot...

195
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,850
My goodness.
What were you thinking?

196
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,320
What happens

197
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,530
if anyone saw it?

198
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,660
What? What do you mean?

199
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,410
Selling drugs.

200
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,370
What do I do?

201
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,540
Did you get caught doing it?

202
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,380
Please don't tell Dad.

203
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,670
Who caught you?

204
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,660
- Not the prosecution. To my home.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,830
Trust me, will you?

206
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,500
Hello, boss.

207
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,250
Hye-soo. Hyun-joo.
They're our VIPs, okay?

208
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,330
- I'm counting on you.
- Okay.

209
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,840
Tonight at 10:30 p.m..

210
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,970
The second factory.

211
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,680
Nice location.

212
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,260
My brother will get some fresh air

213
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,770
for the last time.

214
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,350
(Cheongju Prosecution Service)

215
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,350
Hello?

216
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,790
Ma'am, about Im Yu-ri's case.

217
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Have you found anything?

218
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,210
Nam Gyeo-rye

219
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,340
might not be the murderer.

220
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,800
But...

221
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,970
But?

222
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,680
It's the drugs.

223
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,970
Since when did Korea become
a drug country? A juvenile of all?

224
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,140
What drug?

225
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,350
Purple.

226
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,440
I even found how Purple was
distributed until now.

227
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,190
Express bus delivery.

228
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,570
For bus delivery, the recipient
and sender can be written falsely,

229
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,150
and no content check.

230
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,160
So it caused no issues

231
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,740
until Park Chan-hyuk

232
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,200
left the drugs he received
in the restroom.

233
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,330
Park Chan-hyuk...

234
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,170
The paper says the bar belongs
to Park Chan-hyuk...

235
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,380
What an idiot.
Why did he leave it there?

236
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,960
If he was just an idiot,
it wouldn't be a problem,

237
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,710
but Nam Gyeo-rye happened
to find it,

238
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,970
and he sold it with Im Yu-ri.

239
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,590
Im Yu-ri's involved in this?

240
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,060
Yes, so I filled out
Park Chan-hyuk's warrant.

241
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,600
Did you request it?

242
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,770
No, I had to tell you first.

243
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,310
Ma'am, Nam Gyeo-rye argues

244
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,690
Im Yu-ri went to
make her last deal alone.

245
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,400
So far, the circumstances say
the last buyer is the culprit.

246
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,860
What says that's Park Chan-hyuk?

247
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,900
The possibility of finding out

248
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,660
who resold his drugs

249
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,330
and pretending to buy drugs
in order to approach the kids.

250
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,620
You think there's none?

251
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,870
The evidence?

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,540
I'll need the warrant
to find the evidence.

253
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,710
The Purple is involved,
but it's your case.

254
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,050
Because he's a murder suspect.

255
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,800
Yes.

256
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,010
Did you come to see me first
asking for my support?

257
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,060
You must not leave out
your colleague.

258
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,190
Prosecutor Jo isn't available
at the moment.

259
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,650
Where did he go?

260
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,490
Okay.

261
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,240
Ma'am, once I begin
searching him--

262
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,620
Consider yourself lucky.
Request the warrant.

263
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,660
Thank you.

264
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,750
Thank you.

265
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,330
Ma'am, they're finally trading
Purple tonight.

266
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,130
Hey, get him.

267
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,630
- Get him?
- Get him.

268
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
What?

269
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,010
I wouldn't know. Why?

270
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,970
Okay.

271
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,020
(I'm heading now, Geum-ho.
I'll go check the place first)

272
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,060
(What's the point? Let them do it)

273
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,060
(Everything?)

274
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,520
(We can't let
Mr. Won outnumber us)

275
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,650
(No way. Got it)

276
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,150
(Officer Park Geun-jung)

277
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,700
Park Chan-hyuk is my snitch.

278
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,620
They're making a deal
at 10 p.m. tonight.

279
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,410
We can catch them all
in just two hours.

280
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,660
Do you want to make
the same mistake twice?

281
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,040
See what happened when you let
the gangs go around with lumbers.

282
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,040
So what?
They're about to make a deal.

283
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,380
If we'd caught them back then,
they couldn't make a deal

284
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,630
with no supplies.
We wouldn't have found any drugs.

285
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,710
Choi Geum-ho would've
gone off the grid for good.

286
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,970
And you keep implying

287
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,260
that the girl died because
I didn't approve the warrant.

288
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,930
This has no connection
to the hostess bar.

289
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,850
Look.

290
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,770
He told me where and when
the deal will take place.

291
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,440
You think he'd shoot the girl
for stealing his stuff?

292
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,350
He has no reason to do that
before such an important deal.

293
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,360
Unless he's an idiot.

294
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,690
Unless he's an idiot,
you think he backed out quietly?

295
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,490
When he caught the thieves,
they pointed a gun at him.

296
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,110
You think he still decided
to let them slide?

297
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,070
'The deal is coming up.
I shouldn't cause any trouble.'

298
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,320
'They saw my face, but I'll still
let them walk away alive.'

299
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,990
- Is that what you're saying?
- Im Yu-ri is dead already.

300
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,990
Hey, how can you say that
right now?

301
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,000
If we ransack them now,
Choi will never make a deal again.

302
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,870
There is no second chance.

303
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,830
Didn't I tell you?

304
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
A Purple supplier named Mr. Kang
lives in Seoul.

305
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,670
I'll catch Choi to catch Mr. Kang

306
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,300
and everyone above him.

307
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,340
Including the one who made
the drugs and the producer.

308
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,090
That's the only way to prevent
victims like Yu-ri.

309
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,050
Purple is very serious.

310
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,100
This is our last chance
before it spreads in the country.

311
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,100
We might not be able to
save the world,

312
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,560
but we can get rid of this drug.

313
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,060
Mr. Seo, put yourself in my shoes.

314
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,610
Forget about how much effort
I put into this and all

315
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,240
because that's my issue.

316
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,820
We only have two hours left.

317
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,360
If you were me, would you let me
search him

318
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,120
regardless of the deal?

319
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,780
What would you have said
if I interfered with your case?

320
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Ma'am,

321
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,170
when you approved
the warrant earlier,

322
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,880
you saw its connection
to the murder.

323
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,460
Is Park the murderer? Then we must
arrest him. Let's go arrest him.

324
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,050
But he must be the murderer
at all cost.

325
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,090
If not,

326
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,090
if you're ruining my case
based on your speculations,

327
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,760
I won't let it slide.
I'm filing a complaint officially.

328
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,100
Mr. Seo, are you sure
Park Chan-hyuk did it?

329
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,100
Where is it?

330
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,600
Seowon. A cement factory.

331
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,480
To come up with a strategy
and sneak in there before them,

332
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,770
we don't have much time left.

333
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,780
Prosecutor Seo.

334
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,940
Request the warrant.

335
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,820
Ma'am.

336
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,320
Including Choi Geum-ho.

337
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,120
Upon raiding them,
raid their houses, businesses,

338
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,200
and everything they have.

339
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,830
The drug and Im Yu-ri's murder.

340
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,620
- We're investing them together.
- Yes, ma'am.

341
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,040
- No, we're not investing--
- They go together.

342
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,960
Don't miss any one of them.

343
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,250
- Get all prosecutors ready.
- Yes, ma'am.

344
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,400
Shoot.

345
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,520
I'm just a hostess bar owner.

346
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,690
From 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.
is the peak hours.

347
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,410
What else would I do in that time?
Work, obviously.

348
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,410
Are you saying you were at work
the whole time?

349
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,950
From 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.?

350
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,290
What on earth had happened
that you have to do this to me?

351
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,340
(Summoning all VCU members.
Crime tip-off received)

352
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,920
Shoot.

353
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,930
That's none of your business.
Give me your hand.

354
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,770
Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

355
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,930
Why?

356
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,310
Right-handed, aren't you?

357
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,360
Yes, I am.

358
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,770
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

359
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,280
- Tell me what you're doing.
- Stay still.

360
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,900
Shoot.

361
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,870
Damn it.

362
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,080
The summon announcement
is about them.

363
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,080
- Choi Geum-ho's drug deal.
- What?

364
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,080
This is messed up.

365
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,500
What the hell are you doing?

366
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,720
(Detective Team 1
to the captain's office now)

367
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,810
- Hey, Sung Si-woon.
- Yes?

368
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,730
Don't come forward.
Just stand behind me.

369
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,900
- You won't have to--
- You'll break something.

370
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,320
Oh.

371
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,990
What's the youngest doing?

372
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,820
You should prepare
for the meeting.

373
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,450
Yes.

374
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Prosecutor Jo said

375
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,170
you don't have to come
if you don't feel like it.

376
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,590
Oh.

377
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,840
I'm only delivering the message.
Bye.

378
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,180
Wait.

379
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,060
Take care of Sung Si-woon.
Make sure he doesn't come forward.

380
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,190
You should be careful too.

381
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,280
It's a matter of going to the
supreme office to Prosecutor Jo.

382
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,740
The supreme office?

383
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,870
Mr. Jo is aiming at DEA
in the supreme office.

384
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,290
That will only hurt him.

385
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,500
There are drugs everywhere.

386
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,080
Solving a single case outside
the city won't get him there.

387
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,340
Because there are drugs
everywhere, they're always hiring.

388
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,340
Some people make it at once
by smashing a drug cartel

389
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,960
outside the city
at times like this.

390
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,090
And some people become bystanders.

391
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,900
Some are bound to be successful.

392
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,860
The deal happens
to take place now.

393
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,740
Does that mean I'm not bound
to be successful?

394
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,410
Sir, locate Park Chan-hyuk
immediately.

395
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,700
Yes, detective.

396
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,830
Do you have Park Chan-hyuk
with you right now?

397
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
If we set him free now,
he'll take off for sure.

398
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,210
We've been questioning him
until now.

399
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,840
Even if we set him free,
he wouldn't go make a deal.

400
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,470
So, if you let him go,
he'd try to get rid of evidence.

401
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,720
If he is the murderer.

402
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,510
- You said something came up.
- No, nothing.

403
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,020
How many times
do I have to tell you?

404
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,430
Tail him?
As if we're letting him go?

405
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,890
Yes, but make sure
not to miss him.

406
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Don't worry about that.

407
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,480
Oh, what about the kids' phones?

408
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,860
Come in.

409
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,530
Yes, the last buyer.

410
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,280
We're analyzing it,
but it's not easy.

411
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,820
Okay.

412
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,620
Bye.

413
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,790
That dead girl talked my boy
into it. That sly girl.

414
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,260
I mean, it's not his fault
that he met a wrong friend.

415
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,010
My son's so timid

416
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,180
that I'm always worried about

417
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,890
how to make him a man.

418
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,470
And are you saying he sold drugs?

419
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,180
Why is she the only one dead
if they did it together?

420
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,980
That's just who she was.

421
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,600
Will you keep it down?

422
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,310
What a lowlife every time.

423
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,480
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

424
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,450
Please.

425
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,830
Release him.

426
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,590
He's timid.
He's different from me.

427
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,010
Please help him,
so he won't ruin his life.

428
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,550
Please.

429
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,430
Here.

430
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,520
I swear I won't bother you again
with the land issue.

431
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,600
Rip that up
and let my son go, please?

432
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,780
Your son Nam Gyeo-rye

433
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,900
had a wrong father,
not a wrong friend.

434
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,780
You can make it a conditional
suspension of prosecution.

435
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,780
- Release him.
- The murderer hasn't been caught.

436
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,200
He's not the murderer!

437
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,170
The murderer hasn't been
caught yet.

438
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,500
Who'd be the next target?

439
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,380
Your son sold
a drug cartel's drugs.

440
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,640
Consider he's in the safest place
right now.

441
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,640
If you release him, I'll make sure
he doesn't set a foot outside.

442
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,640
You should've guarded the gun.

443
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,560
You didn't even know he took it.

444
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,480
What was it that you said?

445
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,980
'You can't do this to me?'

446
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,360
That's what I want to say.

447
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,530
What are you doing?

448
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,450
Leave.

452
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,940
Geez, nothing ever works out.

453
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,570
Fine.

454
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,280
Hide behind that door.

455
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,830
Once you're out,

456
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,170
you're dead.

457
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,180
Sir, there was a witness.

458
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,890
Gyeo-rye thinks it was
the owner of the bag.

459
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,260
The witness of him
selling the drug.

460
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,560
He found Gyeo-rye in the end

461
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,890
and the girl too.

462
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,020
He never said Yu-ri got caught.

463
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,150
It doesn't matter.

464
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,150
It's time for us to find him.

465
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360

so called Purple.

468
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,960
The buyer is Kim Ki-won
also known as Mr. Won.

469
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,670
The only entrance to the location

470
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,880
is West North IC entrance
and Gyodong-ri route.

471
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,960
0.8km from the factory
to the entrance is off-road.

472
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,630
They may speed
as much as they want.

473
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,260
Please block
all the possible escape routes.

474
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,840
Choi Geum-ho's clique is
the distribution channel,

475
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,600
and Mr. Won's clique is
supplier channel.

476
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,850
They'll all be there.

477
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,470
Please capture them all alive.

478
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,100

Are you Ms. Im Yu-ri's father?

482
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,050
I'm Nam Gyeo-rye's father.

483
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,340
I'm ashamed to meet you.

484
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,930
I should've visited you earlier,
but my son

485
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,430
was framed.

486
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,560
I had no courage to visit you.

487
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,730
Fortunately, the
misunderstanding's been resolved.

488
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,600
So I'm here belatedly.

489
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,690
Framed, did you say?

490
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,530
Now that you know

491
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,120
how my daughter ended up
like that,

492
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,200
are you saying your son
has nothing to do with this?

493
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,250
The misunderstanding's
been resolved?

494
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,380
I mean,
the murderer's been arrested.

495
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,290
What do you mean?

496
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,340
Says who?

497
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,630
The police.

498
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,430
He's a member
of Cheongju drug cartel.

499
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,800
The kids should've known better

500
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,430
than getting their hands
on a gang's drugs.

501
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,270
What?

502
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,890
It sounds like he was looking
for our kids.

503
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,390
Even the prosecutor said

504
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,230
my son was the next target.

505
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,070

506
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,150
Yes.

507
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,320
I thought you'd know
since you're an officer.

508
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,750
Hey, is it true?
Do we have the suspect?

509
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,460

511
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,300
Why didn't you tell me?

512
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,310
Why did you keep it to yourselves?

513
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,020
If you'd known,
you'd go after him with a knife.

514
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,190
We're just as grieved as you are.

515
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,650
We want to screw the investigation
and get that Park...

517
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,700

Trust us and please wait.

519
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,320
I'm sorry.

520
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,330
Did you tell the captain
about Park Chan-hyuk?

521
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,410
No.

522
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,750

to pick up the phone?

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,660
Sorry. I'm almost there, sir.

527
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,080
Are you still on the way?

528
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,330
No, something came up in the bar.

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,540
Okay.

530
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,840
We'll be there in 20 minutes,
boss.

531
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,470
Okay.

532
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm almost there, sir.

533
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,510

534
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,560
I beg your pardon?

535
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,310
Shoot.

536
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,830
Damn it.

537
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,670
Shoot.

538
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,430
Yes.

539
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,090
Detective Choi, I just...

540
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,010
You found what?

541
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,810
(Detective Kim Hyung-woo)

542
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
Hello?

543
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,660
Yes.

544
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,620
You were being too outright.

545
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,160
Do you want to exclude
Seo Dong-jae that badly?

546
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,210
It was him who tried to
exclude me first.

547
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,710
Team A is here.

548
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,860
Hello.

549
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,690
Call the vice president.

550
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,770
Yes, boss.

551
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,860
Why is he there alone?

552
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,820
- There's a bunch.
- No, my snitch.

553
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,540
He has to be here.

554
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,000
He has to stop Choi Geum-ho
from running away.

555
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Shoot.

556
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,080
Team B is here.

557
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,620
Huh?

558
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,750
Why isn't the puppet here?

559
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,340
Hey.

560
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,780
Okay.

561
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
- Let's go.
- Yes, boss.

562
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,750
Let's go.

563
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,800
Now.

564
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
What the hell?

565
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,140
Cover him.

566
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,530
Go, boss.

567
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,170
Jae-beom.

568
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,420
Freeze.

569
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,870
No. Don't step on it.

570
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,230
Let me go.

571
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,940
I'll kill them all.

572
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,030
Choi Geum-ho!

573
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,610
Choi Geum-ho! You son of a gun!

574
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,370
Drop your weapons.

575
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,050
No.

576
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,720
Shoot.

577
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,530
Is he in there?

578
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Sir.

579
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
It's blood.

580
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,930
A car theft 300m
from Gyodong-ri route.

581
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,850
A man appeared out of nowhere
and stole the car.

582
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,470
It is assumed to be Choi Geum-ho.

583
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,770
The license plate number is
371S 1170.

584
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,430
(Gunsam Sauna)

585
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,640
- Hello?
- Kim Ki-won's arrested.

586
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,730
Choi Geum-ho took off.

587
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,520
The roads are blocked
for investigation,

588
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,310
so we're returning to the office.

589
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,940
So? Did Park Chan-hyuk show up?

590
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,400
No, I didn't see him.

591
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,240
Really?

592
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,820
Where are you, sir?

593
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,580
At first, I never thought
it'd be a gunshot.

594
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,620
I thought something exploded.

595
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,580
My house is right in the back.

596
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,420
So I came to check
to prevent any fire,

597
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,340
and the door was open.

598
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,800
Where is it?

599
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,890
- It's toxic.
- What's toxic?

600
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
We've found so many ingredients
for ecstasy.

601
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,610
They were enough to make

602
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,900
a dose for 20,000 people.

603
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,450
How can they do this
in a residential area?

604
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,120
Prosecutor Seo.

605
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,680
It matches the serial number
on Nam Wan-seong's gun.

606
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,390
Look at this.

607
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,940
It's purple.

608
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,320
It is in purple color.
That means...

609
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,190
It was inside the victim's mouth.

610
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,740
He probably didn't take the drug
like that. How did he...

611
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,120
His name is Kang Soo-min.
His address is in Seoul.

612
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,370
He has no criminal record.

613
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,830
Why is it Purple everywhere I go?

614
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,960
This seems to be the Purple plant.

615
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,050
Is he the plant owner?

616
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,630
A Purple supplier named Mr. Kang
lives in Seoul.

617
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,050
Mr. Kang? Kang Soo-min?

618
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,140
- No.
- What?

619
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,720
The plant operator is
different from the producer.

620
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,310
Wait.

621
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,810
Did the reporter leave?

622
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,690
I'll catch Choi to catch Mr. Kang

623
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,270
and everyone above him.

624
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,860
Mr. Kang.

625
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,250
Kang Soo-min. The supplier.

626
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,800
We've missed Choi Geum-ho,

627
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,760
and Mr. Kang is here.

628
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,930
It's not Purple everywhere I go.

629
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,900
We've found so many ingredients
for ecstasy.

630
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,320
A dose for 20,000 people.

631
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,780
It's my case.

632
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,650
If my case busts Purple plant,
distributor channel,

633
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,950
and the producer,

634
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,620
who smashed the drug cartel
outside the city?

635
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,080
Who can plan to move
to the supreme office now?

636
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,080
The model prosecutor.

637
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,960
Seo Dong-jae.

638
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,590
That's not all.

639
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,680
Get him out.

640
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,890
The land and everything.

641
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,510
I'll call them all off, yeah?

642
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,770
What if it's serial murders?

643
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,310
If Nam Gyeo-rye isn't
the murderer,

644
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,310
I will release him.

645
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,020
Not because of outside pressure,

646
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,900
but because I solved the case
by myself.

647
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,700
This will not only change
the direction of the wind,

648
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,790
but my life.
