ALL TROOPS RETREAT

3
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,230
Finish all preparations
to retreat within 48 hours.

4
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,030
Take all the documents
and research records back to Japan,

5
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,330
and incinerate everything
that cannot be taken.

6
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,950
Yes, sir!

7
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,090
Are we to burn

8
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,250
everything, sir?

9
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,800
Burn everything.

10
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,380
Do not leave a single trace

11
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,800
of what we did here.

12
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,720
That'll be all.

13
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,100
Quickly!

14
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,060
Destroy everything. There's no time!

15
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,110
Hurry up!

16
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,990
- On your feet!
- Yes, sir!

17
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,410
- Leave no evidence. Take this.
- No time!

18
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,740
All planted, sir.

19
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,870
- Over there!
- Okay!

20
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,260
- The serums?
- We have secured 12, sir.

21
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
- And the Najin?
- We have eight of them.

22
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,220
What about the other two?

23
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,550
We didn't have enough time
to retrieve them.

24
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,190
Lieutenant Colonel Kato!

25
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,750
There is not enough time. Please hurry!

26
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Ready!

27
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
Fire!

28
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,220
Fire!

29
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,350
Fire!

30
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,020
Faster!

31
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,320
Hurry.

32
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,490
What are you doing? Hurry up!

33
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,320
Come on! There's no time!

34
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,200
Are we flying?

35
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,780
Traveling by land
seems to be the safest path right now.

36
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,580
We'll take the train at Harbin
and go to Gyeongseong first.

37
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,790
- Drive.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,640
Get your papers!

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,810
Shoeshine!

44
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,060

- Kid!

46
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,070
Thank you.

47
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,530
Boy, I'll take one.

48
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,950
One jeon.

49
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,460
Get yourself some bread with the change.

50
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,210
Thank you, sir!

51
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,630
May you be blessed.

52
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,010
Tell you what,

So the rumors were true.

57
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,650
<i>After the Bombing of Tokyo on March 9,</i>

58
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,610
<i>the shadow of defeat loomed over Japan.</i>

59
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,450
<i>In the hopes that Japan may fall,
Joseon was quivering in silence.</i>

60
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,530
<i>However...</i>

61
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,370
Insurgents! Arrest them all!

62
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,750
Get them!

63
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,340
Don't move!

64
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,840
Arrest them all!

65
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,840
Let's go.

67
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,190
- Run!
- What is it?

68
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,270
Who is it?

69
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,210
People of the peninsula, rise!

70
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,720
It's your chance
to give your life for His Majesty!

71
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,260
Join the unbeatable Imperial Army
and enter the shrine of Yasukuni!

72
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,980
Either die in a torture chamber...

73
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,650
or become an honorable soldier.

74
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,360
Make your choice.

75
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,740
Damn it, what do I do?

76
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,750
CONSCRIPTION FORM

77
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,500
<i>You know what they say.</i>

78
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,380
<i>It's always darkest before the dawn.</i>

79
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,940
Admit it.

80
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,520
It... wasn't me.

81
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,860
So, you're going to keep denying it?

82
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,610
I swear...

83
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,030
I don't know anything.

84
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,580
<i>Is he part of the independence army?</i>

85
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,290
You don't know who he is?

86
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,550
That's Jang Tae-sang.

87
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,010
Jang Tae-sang? Who's that?

88
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,220
The master
of the House of Golden Treasure.

89
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,430
Golden Treasure?

90
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,100
<i>That's right.
The House of Golden Treasure.</i>

91
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,310
<i>Located in the corner
that is the prime spot of Bonjeong,</i>

92
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,560
<i>it is, without a doubt,</i>

93
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,570
<i>Gyeongseong's largest
and finest establishment.</i>

94
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,450
<i>Yes, it's that pawnshop
that everyone is talking about.</i>

95
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,990
It's <i>the</i> famous Waltham watches.

96
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Four won, 50 jeon.

97
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,290
Hey!

98
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,460
This Waltham watch came
all the way from America!

99
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,790
Four won, 50 jeon.

100
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,300
Look.

101
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,720
I've lost my factory to the Japanese.

102
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,630
- I might lose my house too.
- Oh dear.

103
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,050
I have an elderly mother
and four little ones to provide for.

104
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,470
And we're about to end up on the streets...

105
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,390
Here.

106
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,770
That's one more won for you.
Take the money or take the watch back.

107
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,070
Next!

108
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
These are my dowries.
Please take good care of them.

109
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,820
I will come back for them, no matter what.

110
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,580
Fifteen won for the batch.

111
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,370
For the record, this one's a fake.

112
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,000
An Italian suit.

113
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,870
I had it custom-made at a shop...

114
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,500
Two won for used clothes.

115
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,840
I paid quite a lot for this <i>baekja</i>
three years ago.

116
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,970
Oh, is that so?

117
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,340
Take it back.

118
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,930
It's a chamber pot.

119
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,760
Stupid man.

120
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,340
- What do you mean?
- Kid.

121
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,810
Try stealing from the shop one more time,

122
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,940
I'll cut off all ten of your fingers.

123
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,770
It was just a little prank.
Don't be so harsh!

124
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,410
We don't get Walthams often.

125
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,040
Four won would have been enough,
but he gave five won and 50 jeon for it.

126
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,750
Manager Gu is being too generous
with money that isn't his.

127
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,500
This is good leather.

128
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,420
It's worth the price.

129
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,260
Beom-o, that kid, is also hopeless.

130
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,380
The little brat tries to swipe things
every chance he gets.

131
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,720
Have you prepared the tea set and tray
for Lady Maeda?

132
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,770
They say that one should avoid bad company
for their own good.

133
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,860
Her husband is Ishikawa,
and her father is General Maeda.

134
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,820
Her family has this city
in the palm of their hands.

135
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,490
Of course I should keep them close, dear.

136
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,820
Still, you should be careful.

137
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,790
Not to worry.

138
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,450
I'm

139
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,540
Jang Tae-sang.

140
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,290
<i>That's right. I'm Jang Tae-sang.</i>

141
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,090
<i>A man of means in Bukchon
and an icon of a self-made man.</i>

142
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,890
Oh my goodness!

143
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,310
- Greetings, everyone.
- Master Jang!

144
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,560
Calm yourselves.

145
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,480
One, two!

146
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,690
- Good! One more!
- A different pose?

147
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,620
Mr. Jang!

148
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,780
Hey!

149
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,240
<i>Nothing scares me. Nothing can stop me.</i>

150
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,080
<i>I'm the master of Golden Treasure,
and I can get anything I want.</i>

151
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,670
Everyone. Cheers!

152
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,500
Cheers!

153
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,260
<i>The one and only Jang Tae-sang.</i>

154
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,010
<i>So...</i>

155
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,730
<i>how did I end up in this sorry mess?</i>

156
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,150
<i>He must have secretly funded
the independence movement.</i>

157
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,400
<i>Wrong.</i>

158
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,320
Then was he a spy?

159
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,780
Nope.

160
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,120
It was an affair.

161
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
An affair?

162
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,880
Why did you meet her at a teahouse
about a month ago?

163
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,760
Lady Maeda was looking for <i>baekja</i> teacups
and a lacquered tray inlaid with nacre.

164
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
What about at the museum six days ago?

165
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,970
To tell her that it's not easy to acquire
<i>baekja</i> teacups and lacquered trays.

166
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,140
You sent her a message three days ago.

167
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,230
Because I had a stroke of luck
and was able to find

168
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,440
the teacups and the tray.

169
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,690
You even came to my house yesterday.

170
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,860
I had gone through a lot to get them, so...

171
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,280
I delivered them in person.

172
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,490
Don't mess with me!

173
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,750
You pathetic, inferior Josenjing bastard!

174
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,210
How dare you covet my wife?

175
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,010
It seems to me, Commissioner,
that there is a misunderstanding.

176
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,140
Cut the bullshit and spit it out.

177
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,100
What the hell did you do with my wife?
Tell me now!

178
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,150
You must be crazy...

179
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,950
crazily in love, Commissioner Ishikawa!

180
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,410
Don't tell me you're seriously
suspecting your own wife.

181
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,460
How could you doubt an honorable
and noble woman like Lady Maeda?

182
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,710
I must definitely say

183
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,460
that this is a great affront
and insult to her.

184
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,800
What are you saying?

185
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,010
Would it be okay with you
if Lady Maeda found out

186
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,430
that you were doubting her faithfulness?

187
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,010
That's what.

188
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,430
Now, why don't we move on
to the actual matter at hand?

189
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,640
What do you actually want from me?

190
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,270
This girl has gone missing.

191
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,320
It's been about a week now.

192
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,330
A missing persons case?

193
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
Sounds like a job for the police.

194
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,000
They say you're Mr. Omniscient.

195
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,130
You flatter me.

196
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,210
"You must go through Jang Tae-sang
if you want anything in Bonjeong,

197
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,300
whether it be money,
property, or a person."

198
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,380
Is that not true?

199
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,140
I catch those who don't pay me back,

200
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,970
not courtesans.

201
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,520
Find the girl.

202
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,490
Find out why she's vanished, where she is,
and if she found a lover to elope with.

203
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,490
If she did, then find him as well.

204
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,790
If you fail to find her...

205
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,580
Will I die?

206
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,210
You will lose everything you own.

207
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,420
From the house that you own,

208
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,260
to real estate, cash, cars, and even
the House of Golden Treasure in Bonjeong!

209
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,970
You'll lose them all.

210
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,230
And as for you?

211
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,310
You will be sent to war.

212
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,250
How much time do I have?

213
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,380
Until the cherry blossoms fall.

214
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,890
I see.

215
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,900
Okay, sir.

216
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,000
Sir!

217
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,230
What is the matter?

218
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,980
Who beat the crap out of you?

219
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,860
Mrs. Nawol.

220
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,110
How much cash
do we have on hand right now?

221
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,410
Cash?

222
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,290
If I put my buildings in Bukchon,

223
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,160
my house, and this shop
up for urgent sale,

224
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,170
how long would it take for them to sell?

225
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,760
Maybe a month?

226
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,300
What's going on this time?

227
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,010
Tell me, will you?

228
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
You know what?

229
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,650
It seems...

230
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,320
I'm screwed.

231
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,370
What is all this?

232
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,660
Look at the <i>yeot!</i>

233
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,580
It looks so good.

234
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,000
He's making that sound
with the scissors so well!

235
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,880
Wait here.

236
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,730
Excuse me.

237
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,020
We haven't opened yet.

238
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,740
I'm looking for someone.

239
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,500
Do you know a Japanese man named Sachimoto
who frequents this shop?

240
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,080
I heard that he was a painter.

241
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,840
I've known two Sachimotos in my life,

242
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,380
but they were both soldiers, not painters.

243
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,800
I heard he was a regular here.

244
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,550
I'm not sure.

245
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,810
I've been working here
for almost six months now,

246
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,730
but I haven't met such a man.

247
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,900
I see.

248
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,150
Why don't you try
the House of Golden Treasure?

249
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,320
Master Jang Tae-sang runs the place.

250
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,990
They say you must go through him
if you want anything in Bonjeong,

251
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,500
whether it be money,
property, or a person.

252
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,790
He's Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong.

253
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,750
What was that?

254
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,800
I asked if that thing outside
was for sale.

255
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,050
Oh, that?

256
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,890
It's broken. The engine's busted.

257
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,720
I'll buy it. How much do you want?

258
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Judging by your appearance,
you must be from Manchuria, right?

259
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,310
- Say, 200 won?
- Hey!

260
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,480
It has a sidecar and everything.

261
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,570
Make it 300 won!

262
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,780
You said it was broken.

263
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,820
It's worthless junk
if you leave it like that.

264
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,780
A diamond on a dunghill
is still a diamond,

265
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,450
just as a broken motorcycle
is still a motorcycle!

266
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,210
Fine.

267
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,210
Make it 280 won, then.

268
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,930
- 280?
- Yes.

269
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,160
I will buy all of these and the bike

270
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,530
for 250 won.

271
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,450
I don't accept Chinese bills.

272
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,950
Did that kid strike gold or something?

273
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,530
My goodness!
I said it was broken, didn't I?

274
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,500
It's been there for over three years,
weathering the hail, snow, and rain.

275
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,580
There's no way you can get it to...

276
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,760
Forget it! There's no need to worry.

277
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,060
Hey. Don't look so serious.

278
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,770
I mean, who are you?
You're Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong.

279
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,860
We'll contact all your sources
and look for the girl.

280
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,440
Where else would Myeong-ja
of Spring Moon Hall be?

281
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,860
She probably eloped with a guy or--

282
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,740
What man in Gyeongseong
would be stupid enough

283
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,620
to run off with Ishikawa's girl?

284
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,170
Wait, could this be another case
of the recent disappearances of women?

285
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,210
It's causing quite a stir
all over Bukchon and Namchon.

286
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,170
They keep on disappearing, you know.

287
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,680
I've heard some horrible rumors.
What if Myeong-ja is a victim?

288
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,850
Gosh, this is bad. Real bad.

289
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,520
What do we do now?

290
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,770
Master Jang,

291
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,730
why don't we take this chance
to just sell everything and leave Joseon?

292
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,360
I have a close friend in Osaka--

293
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,320
Stop with the nonsense, Mr. Gu!

294
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,820
Let me talk for once, please!

295
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,330
Why do you shoot me down
every time I try to say something?

296
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,330
Because you always spit out
mindless drivel. That's why.

297
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,500
I do think before I speak, you know!

298
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,750
I'm not as short-sighted as you think!

299
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Let's say Master Jang does put up
his real estate in a hurry.

300
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,760
The rumors will spread like wildfire
across Gyeongseong.

301
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
So what? Is that such a bad thing?

302
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,850
Then Ishikawa will hear about it.

303
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,180
And when he does,

304
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,770
what would he do to Master?

305
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,520
My bad.

306
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,240
I didn't think it through.

307
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Ishikawa has a lot of eyes on me.

308
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,130
- Mr. Gu.
- Yes, go on.

309
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,970
Contact every informant
and connection we have,

310
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,850
and look for leads on Myeong-ja.

311
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,230
Find out whatever she did
before she went missing.

312
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,480
All right.

313
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,060
Sounds like a good plan.

314
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,860
Let's do everything we can, Mrs. Nawol.

315
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,820
Beom-o.

316
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,900
Go and find Young Master Kwon Jun-taek.

317
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,240
Why do you need him?

318
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,240
He's the only man in Gyeongseong

319
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,990
audacious enough
to mess with Ishikawa's girl.

320
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,580
Tell him to come here.

321
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,620
Yes, sir.

322
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,040
Mrs. Nawol.

323
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,540
Start selling the most expensive items
in the vault

324
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,170
as quickly and discreetly as possible.

325
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:13,130
Take gold as well as cash.
Secure as many funds as you can.

326
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,060
And look into ships
that set sail over the next month.

327
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,810
If need be,

328
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,810
we might really have to leave Gyeongseong.

329
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,310
Yes, Master.

330
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,050
Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong, huh?

331
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,260
He gets a lot of attention, indeed.

332
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,490
Jang Tae-sang is on the move, sir.

333
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,670
All of his employees have set out
to look for leads regarding Miss Akiko.

334
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,380
All right.

335
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,540
You're dismissed.

336
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,630
Yes, sir.

337
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,110
<i>I think I'm pregnant.</i>

338
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,570
Pregnant?

339
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,620
Yes.

340
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,290
With your child, sir.

341
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,130
Your wife called, sir.

342
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,840
She wishes to know
when you will be coming home today.

343
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,510
Tell her not to wait.

344
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,470
I'll be very late
due to the missing persons case.

345
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,020
Yes, sir. I'll let her know.

346
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,530
Yes.

347
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,690
I see.

348
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,360
No. Yes.

349
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,870
Bye, then.

350
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,970
Get up, all of you. To your positions!

351
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,510
Hurry up! Move your ass!

352
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,730
What's happening?

353
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,230
Don't make a sound.

354
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,020
Keep your head down.

355
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,730
What?

356
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,750
Will two be enough?

357
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,880
Yes. That will be enough for now.

358
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,940
This one.

359
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,190
- Take her out.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,780
Don't kill me.

361
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,610
Please don't kill me!

362
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,240
Tell me about that one.

363
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,040
We brought her
from Seodaemun Prison a while ago,

364
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,710
but her condition is a bit...

365
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,210
Let me see.

366
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,880
- Take her out.
- Yes, sir.

367
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,580
Heads down!

368
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,920
What shall we do, sir?

369
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,380
Please don't kill me!

370
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,090
Don't do this.

371
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,100
These two will do.

372
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,520
Please don't kill me.

373
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,850
Please don't!

374
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,270
Please!

375
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,230
Let me live.

376
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,150
Please don't kill me!

377
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,120
Don't kill me!

378
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,550
What is it?

379
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,770
Can you give me a ride to Bukchon?
I have to meet someone there.

380
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
What?

381
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,770
You speak the Joseon tongue.

382
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,690
You must be bored
from watching me all day.

383
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,780
Why don't you have some fun
by giving me a ride?

384
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,700
You were going to tail me anyway,
so let's not make this complicated.

385
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,990
Seriously...

386
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,200
Hey, wait...

387
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,870
Let us go to Bukchon.

388
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,000
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,190
My goodness, are you trying to empty out
the secret vault in your shop?

390
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,810
Dear me...

391
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,860
All the items are of the highest quality.
No need to check.

392
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,740
Well, that goes without saying.
They're from the House of Golden Treasure.

393
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,200
Can you get it done in ten days?

394
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,540
Ten days? That's a bit tight.

395
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,340
It isn't like you to rush things.
What's the hurry?

396
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,510
Has Master Jang really decided
to leave Gyeongseong?

397
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,340
The rumors have spread all over town!

398
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,680
That he's in a pickle
because of Ishikawa's mistress or whatnot.

399
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,020
Shut your trap,
or I will sew it shut for you.

400
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,980
Actually, I'm only bringing this up
because I heard that sleuths are in town.

401
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,650
They could be of some help to Master Jang.

402
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,700
Sleuths?

403
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,950
Yes, sleuths.
They're experts at finding missing people.

404
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,540
In Manchuria, they call them sleuths.

405
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,160
Go on.

406
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,210
I know a friend
whose older cousin's daughter

407
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:50,460
went missing for three years
after she disappeared during Dano.

408
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,130
But then those sleuths

409
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,550
went all the way to Southern China
and brought her back.

410
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,550
She was forced to be a comfort girl,
but they still found her!

411
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,300
They went to Southern China?

412
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,720
Yeah, not to mention
every corner of Joseon.

413
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,600
They cover Manchuria, Yanbian,
Southern China, you name it.

414
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,690
If the person is already dead,
they bring back the bones at least.

415
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,270
Is that right?

416
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,690
Where can I find these sleuths?

417
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,010
Thanks for the ride.
It was nice and comfortable.

418
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,610
- Wait...
- Don't...

419
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,520
Hey!

420
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,820
Treat yourself to a meal.

421
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,450
I won't tell Ishikawa, so just take it.

422
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,130
What the heck?

423
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,350
Welcome, sir! How many of you are there?

424
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,190
I'm not here to dine.

425
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,480
I need to pass through your back door.

426
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,690
This way, Master Jang.

427
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,180
IDIOT

428
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,310
Who are you?

429
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,520
Why are you following me?

430
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,150
You don't seem like
one of Ishikawa's underlings.

431
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,110
Who do you work for?

432
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,110
Tell me who sent you here!

433
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,030
Master Jang of Golden Treasure?

434
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,780
It's bad manners to answer a question
with a question.

435
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,700
Not to mention...

436
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,040
that you're carrying
such a dangerous item.

437
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,390
Are you here to kill me?

438
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,930
I wasn't planning on it.

439
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,270
But now, I'm rather tempted to do so.

440
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,940
I'll take that as a no.

441
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,770
Lower your knife so we can talk.

442
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,270
Why don't you lower your gun first
before you ask?

443
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,650
Okay, fine.

444
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,570
Let's both lower our weapons
on the count of three.

445
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,660
Now.

446
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,200
One.

447
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,450
Two.

448
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,870
Three.

449
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,380
I see that you don't trust me.

450
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,170
I could say the same about you.

451
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,050
Are you a hitman?

452
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,390
You must have led quite a shady life

453
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,220
to keep fearing for your life like that.

454
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,180
We live in such times, do we not?

455
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,890
You can't survive
without committing a crime.

456
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,150
And even the innocent can die
for all sorts of reasons.

457
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,010
What do you want from me?

458
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,220
I heard that you're Mr. Omniscient.

459
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,680
Then you must know that my prices vary
depending on the information.

460
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,890
It's quite the range of prices
from high to low-level information.

461
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,730
I'm looking for someone.

462
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,400
He's Japanese.

463
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,730
- Occupation?
- A painter.

464
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,820
Unless he's a soldier or a high official,
his information is considered low-level.

465
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,660
Unfortunately,
I don't deal with low-level information.

466
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,450
It takes too much work
and barely makes any money.

467
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,000
Sachimoto is his name.

468
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,670
- I don't know him.
- He's in his mid-30s.

469
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,250
No clue.

470
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:51,130
He wasn't fluent in Joseon tongue,
which means he hadn't been here for long.

471
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,590
I still haven't got a clue.

472
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,940
I'm looking for my mother
who went missing ten years ago.

473
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,440
So,

474
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,280
Sachimoto must be the lover
she ran away with.

475
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,700
What?

476
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Ten years is quite a long time.

477
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,450
If she's started a new family,
it might be best not to look for--

478
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,000
Rude bastard.

479
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,090
Your crude words tell me
that you're not Mr. Omniscient,

480
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,130
but Mr. Trash of this city.

481
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,770
Well, I won't deny it.

482
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,890
I was born trash,

483
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,730
and I've lived a trashy
and desperate life to get here.

484
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,860
Watch that mouth of yours.

485
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,030
Your vain words
will lead you to die in vain.

486
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,030
What's your name?

487
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,090
You have quite beautiful eyes.

488
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,850
Are you taunting me?

489
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,230
Should I pluck your eyes out?

490
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,320
Either way, it was nice meeting you.

491
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,240
You're crazy.

492
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,000
Till we meet again.

493
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,630
She's looking for Sachimoto?

494
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,090
Sachimoto...

495
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,720
Mr. Sachimoto, you have been summoned.

496
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,270
What's the occasion, my friend?
You rarely send word to me.

497
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,110
Do you know where that girl Myeong-ja is?

498
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,360
Myeong-ja?

499
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,030
Myeong-ja, Myeong...

500
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,530
The cheeky courtesan
from Spring Moon Hall?

501
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,830
She once professed her love for me
while in my arms.

502
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,840
But then she became Ishikawa's mistress
and broke my heart.

503
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,590
Why are you asking me?

504
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:04,630
It's been a week since she disappeared.
You didn't know?

505
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,180
I know she's gone missing,
but I don't know where she is, silly.

506
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,520
Why? Did you think I kidnapped her
and hid her away?

507
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,230
So you don't know.

508
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,530
Why not

509
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,650
take this chance
to put your money to good use?

510
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,070
I heard the news.

511
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,870
You're going to lose it all
to Ishikawa anyway.

512
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:33,120
Wouldn't it be nice to spend it
on our patriotic comrades?

513
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,620
You will get to be a patriot,

514
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,000
and our comrades will gain
a wealthy benefactor.

515
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,260
Who said I'm going to lose it?

516
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,550
I just have to find the girl, that's all.

517
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,230
If she could be found,
Ishikawa would have found her already.

518
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,190
It's been a week,
but there's still no sign of her.

519
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,770
That's why he dragged you in.

520
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,400
But I'm sure you know that already.

521
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,070
You're drunk.

522
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,990
You should go home.

523
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,540
You may have earned your money like a dog,
but don't you spend it like one!

524
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,130
If money

525
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,340
cannot be used to help someone,
let alone be spent,

526
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,090
it'll be nothing but a pile of dust.

527
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,350
Don't obsess over the meaningless.

528
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,060
I earned my money like a dog,
so I can spend it like one too.

529
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,480
I put my life on the line to earn it.
Can't I spend it however I want?

530
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,820
Do you have no place for Joseon
in your heart?

531
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,570
No desire to do something for our country?

532
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,110
I've never known the kind of Joseon
without Japan!

533
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,740
I was born without a father and a country.
What do you want me to do about it?

534
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,500
It's fine if you insult me,

535
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,080
but don't insult my money.

536
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,460
I may have worked like a dog to earn it,
but it means something to me.

537
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,760
I don't care if it's a pile of dust
or a pile of crap.

538
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,680
My money and fortune made me who I am,
and they keep me safe even now. Got that?

539
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,160
I was just about to head home.
Can you give me a ride?

540
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,510
Come in.

541
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,140
Test Subject One is showing symptoms.

542
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,770
It's faster than usual.

543
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,150
Would you like to see it?

544
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:13,910
Help me.

545
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:16,910
My head...

546
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,460
Please help me.

547
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,960
My head is aching so much!

548
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,880
It hurts so much!

549
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,050
The serum?

550
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,550
Not injected yet, sir.

551
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,520
Another failure, then?

552
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,360
What about Room Two?

553
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,820
She has been quiet so far.

554
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,740
What should we do?

555
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,700
Shall I inject the serum?

556
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,870
Proceed.

557
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,000
Yes, sir.

558
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,820
You've returned.

559
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,070
Mrs. Nawol. You're still here?

560
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,030
Actually, I have been waiting for you.

561
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,330
The broker introduced me
to these people called sleuths.

562
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,460
Apparently, they are experts
in finding missing people.

563
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,530
So, how exactly do you find
the missing people?

564
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,290
It depends on the situation.

565
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,370
But I'm sure there's a process
that works particularly well.

566
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,340
A secret method or special approach
that only you know...

567
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,250
Nothing?

568
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,550
We do not give up.

569
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,090
We don't give up on the person
that needs to be found.

570
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,680
Our method is to track them persistently
to the ends of the earth.

571
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,640
How many have you found that way?

572
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,270
If we don't seem reliable,
you can find someone else.

573
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:55,740
I'm about to entrust you
with a serious task.

574
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,070
It's only right for me
to perform a simple check.

575
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:01,120
We aren't interested enough
to put up with such a thing.

576
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,370
We have taken more than 200 cases
over the past ten years.

577
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,080
Of those, we have found about 140.

578
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,340
Including the dead.

579
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,670
You don't have to answer his questions.

580
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,090
He's not Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong.

581
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,090
He's Mr. Trash.

582
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,470
Chae-ok.

583
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,220
I refuse to work for such a man.

584
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,100
Just what did you do?

585
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,730
I didn't do anything.

586
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,770
All I said was that her eyes

587
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,730
were quite beautiful.

588
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,650
- Pardon?
- Let's go, Chae-ok.

589
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,410
Sachimoto, you said?

590
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,490
A Japanese man.

591
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,080
A painter in his mid-30s.

592
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,880
I thought you didn't deal
with low-level information.

593
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,590
In principle, I don't.

594
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,550
But the situation calls for it.

595
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:05,010
If it changes depending on the situation,
that's an anomaly, not a principle.

596
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,560
Let's call it flexibility
in dealing with urgent situations.

597
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,430
Maybe you're just being crafty?

598
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,890
That's how desperate I am.

599
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,900
You're also that pathetic, you know that?

600
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,980
In this city,

601
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,070
I'm the man to talk to
for Japanese connections.

602
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,820
Be it Government-General officials,
businessmen,

603
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,740
doctors, or judges...

604
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:30,250
I have connections to anyone, anywhere.

605
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,790
If you have that many connections
and information,

606
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,420
you can find Myeong-ja
of Spring Moon Hall on your own.

607
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,920
If she's still alive, that is.

608
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:44,220
Most times, when I pull this many strings,

609
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,470
any kind of lead will surface
within half a day.

610
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,930
But since I haven't heard anything so far...

611
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,940
Do you think she might be dead?

612
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,600
Whatever the case, please find her.

613
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:58,610
In the meantime, I will ask around
for information on Sachimoto.

614
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,950
You don't have to.
We'll take care of our own business.

615
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,990
Aren't you looking for your mother?

616
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,250
I'm sure I can be of help.

617
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,460
I guarantee it.

618
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,840
Let me ask you one thing.

619
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,050
Are you a good man or a bad man?

620
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:35,940
I'm just...

621
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,860
a man who is determined to survive.

622
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,620
How much time can you give us?

623
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,910
Father.

624
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,210
Until the cherry blossoms fall.

625
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,530
What do I need to draw today?

626
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,950
Go to Room Two.

627
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,620
You may step closer for a better look.

628
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,620
But don't get too close.

629
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,170
It could be dangerous.

630
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,840
Yes, sir.

631
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,660
Excuse me.
Can I shine a light for a moment?
