GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

2
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,700
Tae-sang, don't trust anyone.

3
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,620
WINTER, 1925

4
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,620
There is no one in this world
who can protect you.

5
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,460
You have to fend for yourself.

6
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,550
All right?

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,920
Mother, are you going somewhere?

8
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,880
Get inside!

9
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,340
Hurry!

10
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,760
Don't you ever come out!

11
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,180
Whatever happens, whatever you may hear,
you must not come out.

12
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,400
Hide until daybreak
and don't make a sound, all right?

13
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,900
Mother!

14
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,230
You must stay alive. You must!

15
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,740
Promise me that you'll stay alive
no matter what happens, okay?

16
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,330
Get in!

17
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,260
Sim Sun-deok. Where's Kim Si-yeong?

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,310
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,600
We know everything!

20
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,940
You're the contact for Kim Si-yeong
of the Heroic Corps.

21
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,610
I have no clue
as to what you're talking about.

22
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,840
<i>You must stay alive.</i>

23
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
<i>You must!</i>

24
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,340
<i>Promise me that you'll stay alive
no matter what happens.</i>

25
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,810
I intend to take this seriously too,

26
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,940
so I can survive.

27
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,150
I don't daydream
about something like independence.

28
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,110
All I want, in these turbulent times,

29
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,150
is to strive as stubbornly as I can

30
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,740
to stay alive and safe day after day.

31
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,330
<i>I thought I had kept my promise
to my mother pretty well.</i>

32
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,330
Cheers!

33
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,790
Cheers!

34
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,510
<i>But then, my life started
to turn into a mess.</i>

35
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,680
"Until the cherry blossoms fall."

36
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,180
<i>It was from that moment.</i>

37
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,100
<i>No.</i>

38
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,850
<i>Was it then?</i>

39
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,940
Will you go and help the prisoners?

40
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,940
I don't want
any more innocent people to die.

41
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,490
<i>I should've thought it over
before making such a promise.</i>

42
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,920
What? Where did everybody go?

43
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
Don't move!

44
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,570
Or we'll shoot!

45
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,280
Run!

46
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,120
Hey! Get up, Hui-do!

47
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,420
Go back to where you were.

48
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,170
Or else we'll kill you all!

49
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,340
You son of a bitch.

50
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,510
I said go back to your cells!

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
Go ahead and shoot me, you fucker!

52
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,850
Hui-do, no!

53
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,390
What difference would it make
if I die here or out there?

54
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,600
I'll escape even if it kills me.

55
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,980
Just try and stop me.

56
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,860
Shoot, you fucking sons of bitches!

57
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,970
This way.

58
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,390
There's a dented metal door down the way.

59
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,940
Let's hide in there for now.

60
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,560
Move. Come on!

61
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,740
Hurry!

62
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,280
Get going!

63
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,330
Stop!

64
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,150
<i>That's where it all began.</i>

65
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,040
Once this thing enters the human body,

66
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,500
it takes over the brain.

67
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,550
After gaining complete control
of the brain's synapses...

68
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,510
it begins to cause mutations.

69
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,680
I asked you where my mother is.

70
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,970
Answer me.

71
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
Now.

72
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,770
Ultimately, all life seeks

73
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,850
to evolve into its strongest form.

74
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,440
Humans, in particular,
desire to become apex predators.

75
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,070
And this tiny organism in this cup

76
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,370
has made that possible.

77
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,670
Run.

78
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,840
Run!

79
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,400
<i>For the time being,
it will not cease to hunt.</i>

80
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,910
Hui-do!

81
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,410
<i>Its sole instinct right now is to survive
and to have no mercy on the way.</i>

82
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,970
No! Don't!

83
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,470
Hey...

84
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Help me...

85
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,430
Damn it!

86
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,980
Shit, come on!

87
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,420
Please save me.

88
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,510
Come this way.

89
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,080
<i>The human race will soon be greeted
with a new world.</i>

90
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,580
And that world

91
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,130
was brought to us by Seishin.

92
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,760
Your mother.

CHAOS

95
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,670
WOMEN DISAPPEARING IN GYEONGSEONG

96
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,460
An interesting tip-off.

97
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,500
So, what you're saying is,

98
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,970
Ongseong Hospital is linked
to the missing women, and you'd like us

99
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,720
to investigate it?

100
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,310
This is a violent crime.

101
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,680
If the police bureau doesn't step up,
who will?

102
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,350
Aren't the police responsible
for Gyeongseong's safety?

103
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,060
Ongseong Hospital
is under military jurisdiction.

104
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,280
We can't just butt our heads in.

105
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,200
You know better.

106
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,540
Tae-sang, that boy,
seems to have found Myeong-ja in there.

107
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,290
He has dragged my son in with him,
and they've gotten themselves in trouble.

108
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,170
So,

109
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,760
what do you want?

110
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,010
I just want my son back safe and sound.

111
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,180
That is all.

112
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,840
But do you think we can really trust him?

113
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,380
Have you ever seen me
trust anyone that easily?

114
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,050
In fact, I don't even trust myself.

115
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,350
But you trust
the Golden Treasure members, right?

116
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,810
We've been to hell and back together,

117
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,770
through thick and thin like a family!

118
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,650
Have you ever had

119
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,730
your nails plucked out?

120
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,110
Have you ever been burned

121
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,110
or gone through electric torture?

122
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,910
I may like to gamble,
but I haven't lived life on the edge.

123
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Do you know what happens

124
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,080
when water mixed with chili powder
is poured down your nose

125
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,170
while hanging upside down?

126
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,590
I don't really care to know, actually.

127
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,470
Persist to that point,

128
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,760
and a person can no longer remain human.

129
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,020
If they tell you to bark, you bark,

130
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,480
and if they tell you to crawl, you crawl.

131
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,730
Family, comrades, or whatnot,

132
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,490
none of them will matter anymore.

133
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,280
Hey, you're scaring me!

134
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,320
What's wrong with you today?

135
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,580
What's with the random torture talk?

136
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,920
If you're ever in such a situation,

137
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,210
don't try to hold back and ruin your life.

138
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,510
Just tell them everything you know.

139
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,680
I won't ever resent you for betraying me
in a situation like that.

140
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,890
Keep that in mind.

141
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,810
We're running late. Let's head back now.

142
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,110
Not like it's ever to happen,

143
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,230
but even if I find myself
in that situation,

144
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,530
I won't be betraying anyone.

145
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,570
<i>You</i> keep that in mind, Mrs. Nawol.

146
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,960
How long were you in there?

147
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,550
My mother is in there too.

148
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,300
Have you seen her?

149
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,970
Her name is Sim Sun-deok.

150
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,350
Do you know her?

151
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,070
No.

152
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,030
You haven't heard her name either?

153
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,990
I haven't.

154
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,710
It's cold.

155
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,840
You should drink this and hurry home.

156
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,160
Why didn't you keep your word?

157
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,210
I insisted you wait there for my return,
so why didn't you?

158
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>He's not coming back.</i>

159
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,380
Jang Tae-sang is nothing
but a lowborn bastard.

160
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,550
A no-good filthy rogue
who only cares about money and himself!

161
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,970
"No-good filthy rogue"?

162
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,560
It's true that you've been one
your entire life.

163
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,810
You turned a blind eye

164
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,140
when Joseon fell to ruin
and your people suffered.

165
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,480
Comrade Kwon asked you to join our group,
but you always refused.

166
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,320
Am I wrong?

167
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,240
Let me ask you something.

168
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,700
Am I a bad person
if I don't align myself with your cause?

169
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,660
You're a fence-sitter
with no clear allegiance.

170
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,160
How can we trust you?

171
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,460
Have you always made the right choice
with that clear allegiance of yours?

172
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,750
All I ever wanted

173
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,750
was to escape from this hell--

174
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,010
Then you should have waited!

175
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,340
You didn't know the way out.
You had no plan.

176
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,300
Did you think getting out of your cell
was all there was to it?

177
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,470
What will you do about those
who died for nothing in that mess?

178
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,220
Their sacrifices were inevitable!

179
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,730
How was it inevitable?
You didn't even try!

180
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,350
You even had the key,

181
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,860
but you got scared
and ran off like a coward!

182
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,440
What are you doing? Let go of me!

183
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,820
Stop justifying
and rationalizing your faults,

184
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,570
your mistakes,
and your incompetence like that!

185
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,780
You didn't even have the courage to die,

186
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,120
so don't you dare take
the sacrifices of others for granted!

187
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,210
I heard you were a man of conviction.

188
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,470
Jun-taek must have been sorely mistaken.

189
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,260
Now, let's list the names of the members
of the Patriotic Society, shall we?

190
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,720
Start with the organization chart.

191
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,110
Master Jang.

192
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,160
You're alive.

193
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,040
Are you all right?

194
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,340
Are you injured?

195
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,250
It's nothing serious.

196
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,010
But Chae-ok...

197
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,640
I don't see her here.

198
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,060
Say it isn't true.

199
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,610
It can't be.

200
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,990
How is that even possible?

201
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,410
How can a human turn into such a creature?

202
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,160
Not just a creature.
It's an evolved being!

203
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,790
It's become more powerful and beautiful
than the weak humans!

204
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
How about it?

205
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,670
Don't you want to try it for yourself?

206
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,210
What?

207
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
Who knows?

208
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,300
If you mutate like your mother did,

209
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,560
perhaps she'll recognize her baby girl.

210
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,390
You crazy bastard!

211
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,520
Answer me.

212
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,270
Answer me now!

213
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,860
That creature,

214
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,620
tell me how it can be stopped.

215
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,910
You can't stop it.

216
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,080
Because...

217
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,960
I don't want it to stop!

218
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,800
I see.

219
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,720
So my wife was here.

220
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,140
She left a message on the wall,

221
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,980
but what happened to her afterward
isn't clear.

222
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,860
We don't know if she's still in here.

223
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,610
And Chae-ok went to find that out?

224
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,360
I'm sorry I couldn't stay with her

225
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,120
until the end.

226
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Don't be.

227
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,420
I know you are doing your part,
Master Jang.

228
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,040
I've always known.

229
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,210
Even though you may not act like it
on the outside,

230
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,510
I knew you would make
the right decision in the end.

231
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,850
You saved all these people, Master Jang.

232
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,110
We still have a long way to go.

233
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,070
They all need to be moved
to somewhere safe.

234
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,700
Could you take care of them, sir?

235
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,500
There is an emergency exit this way.

236
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,340
Follow the stairs to the second floor.

237
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,630
At the end of the eastern hallway,
there should be an empty ward.

238
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,470
Tuberculosis recently spread there,

239
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,970
so it's currently vacant.

240
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,020
You should be able to hide
for a few hours.

241
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,930
Is that information reliable?

242
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,650
I paid a high price for it,
so it should be.

243
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,480
Then what about you?

244
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,360
I'll find Ms. Yoon,
and we'll meet you there together.

245
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,080
Please do.

246
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,130
Everyone.

247
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,800
I know you're all exhausted,
but we shouldn't stay here.

248
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,470
We'll get moving,
so prepare yourselves and follow me.

249
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,430
Let's go.

250
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,980
Wait.

251
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,570
Master Jang asked me to give you this.

252
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,290
I trust you to cover the rear.

253
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,610
Did you call for me, Director?

254
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,690
Idiot.

255
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,690
Stupid idiot!

256
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,860
You son of a bitch!

257
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,410
Why the hell are all these doors open?

258
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,200
Why are the cells empty?

259
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,290
Why?

260
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,950
Why?!

261
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,540
Please give me some time.
I'll find out what happened and--

262
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,790
So, you don't know?

263
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,920
You're the one in charge here, idiot!

264
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,960
You fool!

265
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,470
Stupid shit!

266
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,890
Forgive me, sir!

267
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,850
Sir, we have a problem!

268
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,940
What is it?

269
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,450
Corpses infected with anthrax
have been found in the Level 2-1 area.

270
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,700
What?

271
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,220
And the specimen?

272
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,720
It had already gone by the time
the disease control platoon got there.

273
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,900
Tell me more in detail.

274
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,990
Including the sentry who discovered it,
all 13 corpses were infected with anthrax.

275
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,620
Nine of them
were Joseon prisoners who escaped.

276
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,990
Where are the rest?

277
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,460
The dead be damned.
Where are the Josenjings who are alive?

278
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,880
Oh, my apologies, sir.
We haven't found them yet.

279
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,800
Sir, a message has arrived
from the main gates.

280
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,220
What is it now?

281
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,680
Commissioner Ishikawa is here.

282
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,850
He's requesting cooperation
in investigating the missing women cases.

283
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,180
What?

284
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,900
Did you hear that, Soma?

285
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,440
Even Ishikawa has noticed
that something is off.

286
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,440
Forgive me, sir!

287
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,570
Sort this out immediately.

288
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,620
Yes, sir!

289
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,580
If even a single Josenjing
escapes the hospital,

290
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,090
you and your family
will be imprisoned in their place.

291
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:53,090
I'll personally cut out their intestines
while they are still alive.

292
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,090
Understood?

293
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,180
Do you understand, you goddamn moron?

294
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,060
Yes, sir!

295
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,520
Worthless prick.

296
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,370
Walk faster.

297
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,710
You and I are going to find that creature.

298
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,800
If we do, then what?

299
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,380
I'm going to stop it at all costs.

300
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,800
I told you it's impossible.

301
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,140
Then think of a way.

302
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,390
You created it.

303
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,850
Colonel Kato.

304
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,690
What is it?

305
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,100
We're currently pursuing the specimen,

306
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,480
but I'm afraid we'll have to release
the rest of the nitrogen gas in Level Two

307
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,360
in order to drag the creature out.

308
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,280
What if you fail to capture it
even after you do so?

309
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,580
That's why I'm here
to ask for your permission.

310
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,040
If we fail to sedate the creature...

311
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,550
You'll shoot it dead?

312
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,130
We can't afford to lose any more men.

313
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,970
Please give me your permission
to kill it, sir!

314
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,230
There's only one way to kill Seishin.

315
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,190
What is it, sir?

316
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,190
You burn it.

317
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,860
But do you really think

318
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,200
you can do it?

319
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,030
Sir?

320
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,580
It's your mother, after all.

321
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,460
Can you actually kill it?

322
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,210
Shit!

323
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,300
Her appearance may have changed,
but it's still your mother.

324
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,800
Do you really think you can kill it?
Do you?

325
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,580
A message from Mr. Shiro, ma'am.

326
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,740
THE MISSION TO RESCUE AKIKO HAS BEGUN

327
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,170
It's been a while, Director Ichiro.

328
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,840
What brings you to our hospital?

329
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:49,260
We got a tip that your hospital
was involved in the missing women cases.

330
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,470
As you know,
the hospital is currently shut down.

331
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,810
No outsiders are allowed to enter,
without exception.

332
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,440
And the reason being?

333
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,900
There is an unknown infectious disease.

334
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,240
It's highly contagious,
so I hope you understand.

335
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,740
You say it's highly contagious,

336
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,080
yet I don't see any protective clothing
or equipment on you.

337
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,370
We should also be safe, then.
Don't you think?

338
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,170
This hospital
is under military jurisdiction.

339
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,250
The police bureau has no authority
to investigate or control this place.

340
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,960
Civilians have disappeared,

341
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,590
which means the police
may intervene and investigate.

342
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,220
Don't make me lose face
in front of my subordinates.

343
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,730
I'm afraid we must investigate,
even as a mere formality.

344
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,320
Please excuse us for the time being.

345
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,620
- Move the girl somewhere else.
- Yes, sir.

346
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,410
Put your hands up.

347
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,080
Who are you?

348
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,750
How did you get in here?

349
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,540
I'm looking for someone.

350
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,050
Where's the woman?

351
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,930
Where's the girl that was here?

352
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,460
Get inside. Now!

353
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,340
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't have time for that.

354
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,350
Get in there now!

355
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,430
I told you.

356
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,060
I don't have time to waste here with you.

357
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,720
It's no use.

358
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,230
Don't waste your energy.

359
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,310
What the hell do you want?

360
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Soon

361
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,360
your dearly missed Seishin will show up.

362
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,950
It's been ten years, you said?

363
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,790
I'm not sure
if your mother will recognize you.

364
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Current status?

365
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,550
We've cornered it to ride in the elevator.

366
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,250
Hey.

367
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,840
Hey!

368
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,890
It was the woman. She took my clothes.

369
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,350
She took my clothes,
and Mr. Soma beat me--

370
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,320
So, where is the woman now?

371
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,350
Sergeant.

372
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,350
What will happen to that woman?

373
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,520
Will she die at the hands of the creature?

374
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,940
Shut up, Josenjing.

375
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,400
This is no place for you to talk.

376
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,650
I'm sorry, sir.

377
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,020
Kill her.

378
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,030
Go on and kill her, Seishin!

379
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,370
Devour your daughter!

380
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,380
Go on!

381
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,420
Mother!

382
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,960
Mom?

383
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,720
Is it you, Mother?

384
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,060
Is it really you?

385
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,030
Mother...

386
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,800
<i>Mother!</i>

387
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,410
Seize it!

388
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,120
Seize it!

389
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,160
Mother...

390
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,330
Release the nitrogen gas.

391
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,870
Release the nitrogen!

392
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,900
- Fire!
- Fire!

393
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,640
Halt!

394
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,770
Where's the girl?

395
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:16,730
Where's the girl? Find her!

396
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,900
No! Let me go!

397
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,860
- Let go!
- What's wrong with you?

398
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,450
- Mom!
- Where are you going?

399
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,790
Pull yourself together!

400
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,540
Where do you think you're going?
To your own death?

401
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,630
That was my mother.

402
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,010
What?

403
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:56,860
Those bastards turned my mother
into that creature.

404
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,780
Please help me.

405
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,320
Help me.

406
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,080
Help me!

407
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,620
Unbelievable.

408
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,340
It withstood
all the nitrogen gas we shot at it.

409
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,260
Could it be that the maternal instinct...

410
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,260
conquered the Najin in the end?

411
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,890
What should we do about the girl?

412
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,730
Don't let her live.

413
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,690
Yes, sir!

414
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:31,240
All of you, follow me.

415
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,790
The hunt begins now!

416
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,040
Yes, sir!

417
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:50,890
Search thoroughly!

418
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,040
Try it.

419
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,210
It should make you feel better.

420
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,500
I won't ask if you're okay.

421
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,710
Because I know you aren't.

422
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,260
But still...

423
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,220
I hope you'll feel better.

424
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,730
The last words my mother spoke to me were,

425
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,690
"You must stay alive."

426
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,860
She told me to survive,
no matter what happens.

427
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,950
I was nine years old then.

428
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,830
I was too young to fully comprehend

429
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,960
what it meant to survive
without my mother.

430
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,720
For now, let's get out of here alive.

431
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:01,060
Then let's take our time
and come up with a plan.

432
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,730
Do you have more?

433
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,880
Yes, sir.

434
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:09,600
What are you doing?

435
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,400
You can't park your vehicle here.

436
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,780
I'm waiting for Commissioner Ishikawa.

437
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,450
Plus, my back is aching. Hold on.

438
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,740
I had a sudden craving as well.

439
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:25,790
You can't drink here.

440
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,710
Come now! Don't be so hard on yourself.

441
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,420
What do you say?
How about a drink together?

442
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,590
It's a chilly night,

443
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:38,710
but with a sip of this,
you'll feel nice and warm.

444
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,470
- Not allowed.
- What?

445
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:41,800
Hold on.

446
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,810
Not even champagne?

447
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,310
Cham...

448
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,560
Just a second.

449
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,110
Now, come this way. Come on!

450
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:06,870
How was Level Three?

451
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,080
All clear, sir.

452
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,290
- And Level Two?
- Nothing, sir.

453
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:13,460
It seems that she may have
already escaped.

454
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,170
Starting from now,
search the entire military ward.

455
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,340
The underground lab, the first floor,
and even the admission ward.

456
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,430
Yes, sir!

457
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,010
Sergeant Haneda!

458
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:28,970
You should see this.

459
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,350
Help us.

460
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,940
Damn it to hell.

461
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,330
Have you searched that side?

462
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,000
Currently underway, sir.

463
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,170
Start searching from the ward at the end.

464
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,170
But that's where
tuberculosis spread recently.

465
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,300
Silence!

466
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,800
Those are your given orders!

467
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,220
Yes, sir.

468
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,170
Father!

469
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,210
Chae-ok.

470
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,100
Chae-ok.

471
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,070
Are you okay?

472
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,290
Myeong-ja?

473
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,760
Let us escape with you, Master Jang.
I'd like to leave too.

474
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,250
The time allocated to us is ten minutes.

475
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,130
We start moving at six o'clock sharp.

476
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:29,200
Everyone must get in the truck
within those ten minutes.

477
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,870
What if we fail to get everyone
on board in time?

478
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,790
What happens then?

479
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,460
The truck will leave on time regardless.

480
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,470
Block all entryways to the military ward.

481
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,300
Seal off the building. Move out!

482
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:56,390
Yes, sir!

483
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:01,350
Are you all ready?

484
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,740
Then,

485
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,740
let's begin.
