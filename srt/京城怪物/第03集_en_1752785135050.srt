Any casualties?

3
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,540
We lost three soldiers and four members
of the disease control platoon.

4
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,630
One major was heavily injured.

5
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,300
Most of the Joseon test subjects are dead.

7
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,210
How did it move?

8
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,220
Just how fast was it?

9
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,430
Tell me.

10
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,930
Tell me how perfect it was.

12
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,490
Excuse me, Major.

13
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,120
I haven't seen the floating spores
in a while now.

14
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,930
Help!

15
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,970
Somebody help me!

16
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,640
Lights!

17
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,230
Quickly! Now!

18
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,360
Aim!

19
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,500
Do you see anything?

20
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,370
No, sir. I can't make anything out!

21
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,480
Help me.

22
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,070
Please, somebody help.

23
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,610
Help me!

24
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,660
I don't want to die.

25
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,910
Please... Please help me.

26
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
Shut the door.

27
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,590
Shut the door. Now!

28
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,030
Don't stop!

29
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,030
Shut it now.

30
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,710
I said, shut the door.

31
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,500
Hurry up!

32
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,060
Help me, please!

33
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,110
Please! Help me, sir!

34
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,450
Shut the door. Do it now.

35
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,200
I don't want to die. Please help me!

36
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,540
Help me, Major Endo!

37
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,840
- Let go.
- No!

38
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,000
No, I won't!

39
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,550
- The door won't close!
- No!

40
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,170
It won't close because of you!

41
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,940
Let go!

42
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,190
Major Endo!

43
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,190
Asshole!

44
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,840
Answer me.

45
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,590
Was our experiment

46
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
a success?

47
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,510
Please...

48
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,720
destroy it.

49
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,270
What you have created...

50
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,190
is a calamity.

51
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,650
Before it's too late,

52
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,160
please destroy

53
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,990
that creature.

54
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,050
A calamity, you say?

55
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
I see.

58
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,210
The tea is very fragrant.

59
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,050
All thanks to you, Mr. Jang.

60
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
My tea ceremonies have become
twice as enjoyable

61
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,600
thanks to the elegant cups
you procured for me.

62
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,850
Your pronunciation of the Joseon tongue
has become much more natural.

63
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,230
Also thanks to you and the great teacher
you introduced me to.

64
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,750
Oh, I heard that Ongseong Hospital
has shut down.

65
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,080
Have you heard anything?

66
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,670
Well,

67
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,880
I did hear in passing

68
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,550
that an unknown infection
has spread in there.

69
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,430
The thing is, I've since lost contact
with a friend who was admitted there.

70
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,520
If you know anyone inside,
I was hoping you could ask them

71
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,020
about what it's like inside
and when it might open again.

72
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,150
Is this because of the girl
named Myeong-ja?

73
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,490
If so, it would be best
not to look for her.

74
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,550
There is a Joseon saying that goes,
"A drowning man will grasp at straws."

75
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,180
It means that a desperate man will cling
to anything, no matter how trivial.

76
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,020
I'm that drowning man, Lady Maeda.

77
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,900
You're more than capable of brushing off
my husband's threats, aren't you?

78
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,900
If they were mere threats,
I would've done so.

79
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,110
But I think he's serious this time.

80
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,700
So?

81
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,740
I intend to take this seriously too,

82
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,000
so I can survive.

83
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,750
You can't enter
Ongseong Hospital right now,

84
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,630
but even if you do,
you won't find what you're looking for.

85
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,470
So, you should look for another way,
Mr. Jang.

86
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,270
I'm advising you as a friend.

87
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,280
I need the blueprints for the hospital.

88
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,490
You have pull
with the Governor-General's Office.

89
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,740
Please bring me the most detailed prints.

90
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,410
What's the point of getting the blueprints
if we have no way in?

91
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,450
The hospital is shut down.

92
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,210
All outsiders and even the suppliers
have been denied entry.

93
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,460
There is no way of slipping in.

94
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,000
Bring them to me before the day is over.

95
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,670
They say it's an infection.

96
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,340
God knows what disease it might be.
We might all kick the bucket.

97
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,760
I'll go in alone, then. Okay?

98
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,720
What if it's a lie?

99
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,520
What if that sleuth girl lied
to save herself?

100
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,810
It's possible, isn't it?

101
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,310
The hospital's closed. There's no way out.
And the infection is spreading.

102
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,530
She could be lying about finding Myeong-ja
to save her own skin!

103
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,910
- Do you really think so?
- Think about it.

104
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,830
How can she be in a hospital reserved
for high-ranking Japanese officials?

105
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,660
There's no way she's there!

106
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,580
I'll bet my entire fortune of 380 won.

107
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,840
How can you be so consistently unlucky?

108
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,800
What?

109
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,420
Every card you draw is crap.
Every bet you make ends in a loss.

110
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,760
Every time you gamble,
you get your pockets totally cleaned out.

111
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,720
Hey, when has that ever happened to me?

112
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,100
Myeong-ja is definitely in there.

113
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,600
I just had it confirmed by Lady Maeda.

114
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,810
Ishikawa's wife?

115
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,110
Did that woman tell you
that Myeong-ja is in there?

116
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,820
Did she?

117
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,820
That broad said that? For real?

118
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll be getting inside Ongseong Hospital
by 10:00 p.m. tonight.

119
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,990
Please prepare accordingly.

120
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,260
WE FOUND MYEONG-JA

121
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,440
Send a signal by 10:00 p.m.
to the east wing of Ongseong Hospital.

122
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,360
Any recognizable signal will do,
such as smoke or a flame.

123
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,610
You won't find what you're looking for.

124
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,110
Please find a way

125
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,740
to get them out.

126
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,280
You should look for another way,
Mr. Jang.

127
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,730
So, what has Jang Tae-sang been up to?

128
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,360
Well, he's been busy all morning
moving about the town.

129
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,320
But...

130
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,780
<i>But what?</i>

131
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,530
<i>His route has been a bit strange.</i>

132
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,620
<i>Mahjong?</i>

133
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,750
I win!

134
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,830
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

135
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,420
<i>He played mahjong for an hour
at the general store of Wang the Chinese.</i>

136

FIREWORKS

137
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,770
The next round is double.

138
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,400
Will you accept?

139
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,020
Sure!

140
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,070
<i>And then?</i>

141
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,740
<i>He rode a rickshaw around the streets
of Bonjeong for 30 minutes.</i>

142
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,490
- He just rode around the streets?
- Yes, sir.

143
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,750
Then lastly, he visited...

144
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,130
A tailor shop?

145
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,590
Yes, sir. He seemed to be getting
a new suit tailored.

146
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,930
I'd like a suit in the bold style
that's popular these days.

147
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,220
Yes, sir.

148
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,110
This American-made pure wool
just came in from Tokyo last month.

149
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,900
I think you'd prefer
the second option of fabric far more, sir.

150
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,160
It was sent over from the Moonlight Bar
just last night.

151
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,340
I'm here for afternoon cleaning.

152
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,760
Go in.

153
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,310
Yes, sir.

154
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,030
CLEANING SUPPLIES

155
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,760
Have you delivered the note?

156
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,800
I passed it on to someone we can trust.

157
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,340
By now, it should be
at the House of Golden Treasure.

158
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,220
By the way,

159
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,270
are you certain that Myeong-ja is in here?

160
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,850
It seems so.

161
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,270
Actually, last night...

162
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,900
Don't shoot him.

163
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,440
He's on our side.

164
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,190
- What?
- But that's a Japanese soldier.

165
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,650
No, I'm not!

166
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm from Joseon.

167
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,990
I really am from Joseon.

168
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,850
Now, let's take a look here.

169
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,900
It's in good condition.

170
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,310
But it's rather old.

171
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,730
It was my family's source of income
for the past ten years.

172
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,990
I sent my eldest
to medical school with it.

173
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,450
The most I can give you is 90 won.

174
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,580
Will you still pawn it?

175
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,740
I don't need the money.

176
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,750
Instead,

177
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,290
could you please find my son?

178
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,800
I heard he was evacuated from Bongrim
after getting wounded in the battle.

179
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,260
But I've lost contact with him.

180
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,510
I was drafted while attending
Gyeongseong Medical School.

181
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,600
In Bongrim, China,
I got injured during battle

182
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,520
and was sent here, Ongseong Hospital.

183
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,810
After recovery, I was assigned
to the disease control platoon.

184
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,400
Disease control?

185
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,190
It seems that this hospital also has
a human experiment lab underground.

186
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,910
I saw countless Joseon people
lose their lives...

187
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,120
with my own eyes last night.

188
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,250
What happened last night...

189
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,540
was due to anthrax.

190
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,340
I witnessed something like this
in Bongrim.

191
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,470
An entire village
was stamped out by anthrax.

192
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,890
It was so horrific
that I still remember it to this day.

193
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,150
Those damn bastards!

194
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,660
Did you happen to see a young man
in his early 20s among the dead?

195
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,620
He is medium-height and has a black spot
next to his right ear.

196
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,830
I'm sorry.

197
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,750
I couldn't examine all the bodies.

198
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,180
Many Joseon people are still being kept
in the underground prison.

199
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,310
That's where I saw Myeong-ja as well.

200
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,400
Don't move
until we finish sterilizing the area.

201
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,450
It's dangerous,
so please stay where you are.

202
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,280
You could die
just by touching the anthrax.

203
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,500
So don't move and stay in that corner
until everything is sterilized.

204
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,040
All right?

205
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,710
You have to help me.

206
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,880
Please find Commissioner Ishikawa
at the Police Bureau.

207
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,550
Tell him I'm here.

208
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,970
Myeong-ja of Spring Moon Hall...
No, tell him Akiko is imprisoned here.

209
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,140
I'm sure he will reward you handsomely.

210
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Please.

211
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:09,110
Please tell Ishikawa.
Tell him that I'm here, will you?

212
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,650
Shut it!

213
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,740
Keep quiet. Stay back!

214
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,420
<i>But there was nothing I could do for her.</i>

215
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,420
<i>Because I was in the same boat as them.</i>

216
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,940
What are you doing?

217
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,280
Get it together, Josenjing!

218
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't spill your filthy vomit!

219
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,220
You Josenjing!

220
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,280
Filthy Josenjing!

221
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,870
<i>There was only one way to escape</i>

222
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,120
<i>this living hell.</i>

223
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,590
Mother.

224
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,760
Please forgive me!

225
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,130
Don't waste your life.

226
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,300
The time will come when your death counts.

227
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,220
You can die then.

228
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,930
Who is she?

229
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,180
Well,

230
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,980
I don't know
who the woman in the drawing is.

231
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,770
But I do know who drew this.

232
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,280
He's Japanese.

233
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,820
He calls himself a painter.

234
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,860
His name was

235
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,530
Sachimoto, I believe.

236
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,310
What are all these?

237
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,430
What have you drawn?

238
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,530
Tell me more.

239
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,570
Who does he work for? Where does he live?

240
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,950
Do you like Chinese food?

241
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,280
At 8:00 p.m. tonight. Sahaeru restaurant.

242
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm afraid I have no luxury
to enjoy Chinese food at the moment.

243
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,500
I'm talking about Sachimoto, not you.

244
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,590
We arranged to meet at Sahaeru tonight.

245
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,880
- Tonight?
- At 8:00 p.m.

246
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,470
Don't be late.

247
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,770
You must be running
an interesting experiment.

248
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,400
I heard you lost
an entire disease control platoon,

249
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,280
along with stacks of Joseon test subjects.

250
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,830
I only wish that your experiment
will have strategic value for us.

251
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,870
What do you mean?

252
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,580
Tokyo has been burned to ashes
from the recent air strikes.

253
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,210
We are in dire need

254
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:08,630
of a powerful weapon that could
turn the tides of the war in our favor.

255
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,890
How about we make use
of that creature down below?

256
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,390
It's too early to reach any conclusion.

257
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,940
Its intelligence, its cognitive abilities,

258
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,820
and whether it could be tamed or not

259
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,940
haven't been confirmed yet.

260
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:35,450
Every living thing in this world
can eventually be tamed,

261
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,120
just as we have tamed Joseon.

262
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,960
I've only gone down
to the second basement.

263
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,460
This is the underground prison.
And Myeong-ja...

264
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,380
PRISON

265
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,710
...was here.

266
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,550
How many guards?

267
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,350
A pair of guards are stationed
every ten meters.

268
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,010
They are all armed.

269
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,930
Getting her out is going to be
as difficult as getting in.

270
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,060
But...

271
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,940
if you get her out,
is there a way to escape the hospital?

272
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,110
Let's wait in our positions
until we get a signal from outside.

273
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,330
You should head back to your platoon.

274
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,330
No, I'll never return to that place again.

275
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,870
If they search the ward looking for you,
it will cause us more trouble.

276
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,380
They might even find out about these two.

277
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,630
Then the entire operation would be over.

278
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,300
We should all be able to escape.

279
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,100
I'm sure of it.

280
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,480
I'll see you later, then.

281
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,310
Please...

282
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,900
don't forget about me.

283
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,180
Do you recognize it?

284
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,510
- The layout of this floor.
- Yes.

285
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,600
It's like the underground laboratory
back in Manchuria.

286
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,520
LABORATORY

287
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
It's worth trying, don't you think?

288
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,110
You remember what happened in Manchuria.

289
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,030
What went on
in that underground laboratory.

290
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,410
What horrors the people went through.

291
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,160
- Chae-ok.
- If the same thing is happening here...

292
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,540
shouldn't we try
to do something this time?

293
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,760
Let's wait at least
until the signal arrives.

294
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,910
It's already been 30 minutes.

295
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,830
Who are you waiting for anyway?

296
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,580
A woman.

297
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,410
A wooman?

298
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,170
Not "wooman." A woman.

299
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,750
There she is!

300
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,930
Good work. Get yourself something to eat.

301
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,990
Oh, excuse...

302
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,410
Look who it is.

303
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,040
Jang Ttai-sang of Golden Treasure.

304
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,720
Could you let me through?
I have urgent business to attend to.

305
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,300
Welcome. This way, please.

306
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,450
I think we have
some unfinished business to settle first.

307
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
Okay. I get it.

308
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,660
If that's what you want,
come to my shop tomorrow morning.

309
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,410
Sound good?

310
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,090
- Sir...
- Yeah.

311
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,010
You must be hungry.
Here, it's Joseon <i>hotteok.</i>

312
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Try it.

313
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Yes, sir.

314
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,730
So good!

315
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,070
These Josenjing folks
really know their way around food, huh?

316
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,530
Sir...

317
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,570
Do you think he'll be okay?

318
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Mori.

319
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,960
Our job is to observe, not intervene.

320
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,590
We observe, report,

321
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,050
and receive orders.

322
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,470
That's all there is to it.

323
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,010
- Yes, sir.
- Go on, try a bite.

324
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,520
Hang on. Wait.

325
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,690
Just a second.

326
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,360
We can resolve this with money.

327
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,240
No need to bring swords
into this fight, right?

328
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,660
Settle down, guys.
How much money do you want?

329
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,160
Golden Treasure.

330
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,540
Golden Treasure!

331
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,500
What about it?

332
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,340
Give us the House of Golden Treasure.
Then I'll spare your life.

333
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,890
Let's not kid around.

334
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,220
I told you, I'm quite busy right now.

335
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,310
I'm supposed to meet someone at 8:00 p.m.
A very important person!

336
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,390
Would you look at the time?
Look, it's almost time!

337
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,310
I'll be off.

338
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,690
Hey, you should think carefully
about who means more to you.

339
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,700
Many apologies,
but you're just not my type.

340
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,780
Please don't force me
to think so dearly of you!

341
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,580
- Hey, Jang Ttai-sang.
- Tae-sang!

342
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,500
It's Tae-sang, not Ttai-sang!

343
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,790
Say my name again.

344
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,210
Do you wish to die?

345
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,220
Of course not.

346
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,970
I might be a luckless guy,

347
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,180
but I never wish to get killed
by a bunch of scum.

348
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,600
Jackass!

349
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,780
You there!

350
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,540
What's going on?

351
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,410
Look here.

352
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,170
I'm Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

353
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,090
These thugs are attacking me
for no apparent reason.

354
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,090
Help me, Officer.

355
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,260
We're just teaching
this stubborn Josenjing a lesson.

356
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,640
You can just go on your way, sir.

357
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,650
Look, they are all brandishing swords!

358
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,230
My life is in danger!

359
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,650
I don't want you causing a scene,
so go easy on him.

360
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,150
Yes, sir.

361
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Officer.

362
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,280
Officer!

363
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,950
See that?

364
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,080
This is the Joseon you're living in.

365
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,710
And you're nothing but trash
with a lot of money.

366
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,340
Filthy and pathetic

367
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,340
Josenjing

368
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,640
trash.

369
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,440
Boss!

370
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,980
You're right.

371
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,190
This is the Joseon I'm living in.

372
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,240
So give it a rest.

373
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,540
I'm already pissed off as it is.

374
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,800
Look!

375
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,600
Josenjings never die!

376
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,810
He's one tough nut.

377
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,050
This won't do, Father.

378
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:02,390
If we wait here any longer,
we will be wasting the whole night.

379
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,760
I'll go out and look around the ward.

380
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,940
<i>If this place has the same layout,</i>

381
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,780
there should be a vent
that leads into the underground lab.

382
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,820
- And the vent would be...
- Connected to the rooftop.

383
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Chae-ok.

384
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,480
Should things get out of hand,
you must return without hesitation.

385
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,400
Do you understand?

386
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,490
I'll be back.

387
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,540
Hurry! Get a move on!

388
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,180
The blueprints?

389
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,020
I got them as I was told to.

390
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,270
But is this the right thing to do?

391
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,020
We are basically pushing him
right into his grave.

392
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,110
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

393
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,940
Master Jang calls the shots.

394
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,660
Is Tae-sang upstairs?

395
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,040
No, he's out. What's the matter?

396
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,290
An urgent matter has come up.
Where is he right now?

397
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,620
I'm not sure.

398
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,670
- Tae-sang!
- Sir!

399
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,590
Master Jang!

400
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,070
Please wait here for a moment.
I'll go after him.

401
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,030
Sure.

402
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,370
You're getting into sword fights now?

403
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,080
For heaven's sake!

404
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,330
What kind of rotten pricks
would be foolish enough to mess with you?

405
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,000
Wait here.
I'm going to report this to the police.

406
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,840
We'll go to the hospital first.
Get the car ready.

407
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,500
Right, the hospital. Okay.

408
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,050
Did you get the blueprints
for Ongseong Hospital?

409
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,050
Of course I did!

410
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,470
They are downstairs...

411
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,100
Forget about the blueprints.

412
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,310
Let's wrap the wound up
and go to the hospital.

413
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,140
Yeah, the hospital first.

414
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,480
I'm fine. Show me the blueprints, Mr. Gu.

415
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,150
Disinfectants and antibiotics
aren't going to heal this wound.

416
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,660
We don't have much time left
until 10:00 p.m.

417
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,030
Sir.

418
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,790
The blueprints now, Mr. Gu!

419
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,080
Tae-sang, please!

420
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,250
What could possibly be more important
than your own life?

421
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,470
Is Myeong-ja worth
getting stabbed over like this?

422
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,010
Is she really?

423
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,140
- Mrs. Nawol.
- I don't want to hear it.

424
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,930
Shut your mouth and go to the hospital.
Is that clear?

425
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,520
Right.

426
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,230
You're right, Mrs. Nawol.
Myeong-ja means nothing to me.

427
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,030
But...

428
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:16,120
those bastards are using her
as a ridiculous excuse to take my stuff.

429
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,040
They're claiming what's mine as theirs
without a speck of shame!

430
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,630
They even took our country.

431
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,920
They can take anything.

432
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,800
I suppose so.

433
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,670
But...

434
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,680
I'm going to hold out to the end.

435
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:42,310
They can beat me up and knock me around,
but I'll fight like hell for what's mine!

436
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,570
If I run away because they threaten me
and let them take what is mine,

437
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,690
they will never get to learn
a proper lesson.

438
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,740
Am I wrong?

439
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,160
You...

440
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,160
You were stabbed.

441
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,160
You're seriously wounded, okay?

442
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,630
This kind of wound doesn't hurt me.

443
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,880
What hurts me is not a sword.

444
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,510
It's my broken pride.

445
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,210
You're Yeong-chun.

446
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,880
I apologize for visiting at this hour,

447
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,210
but there is someone
who wishes to see Master Jang.

448
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,090
Wang. Open the door!

449
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,670
It's Gu from Golden Treasure!

450
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,300
Wang!

451
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:51,360
LABORATORY

452
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:16,880
Mr. Sachimoto.

453
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,750
I've been out to buy some new supplies.

454
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,840
There are a lot of items.
Could you let us pass?

455
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,100
I'll send him out
as soon as I unload them.

456
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,810
I can't allow that.

457
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,230
No outsiders are allowed
to enter the hospital.

458
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:42,610
Then go ahead
and report directly to Director Ichiro.

459
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,440
Pardon?

460
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,240
The director ordered me to bring these in,
so there's no choice.

461
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,080
You better tell the director yourself
that you can't allow us in.

462
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,240
Are you here to save us?

463
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,530
What?

464
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,870
I saw you coming down from the vent.

465
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,370
Please save us.

466
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,330
Help us get out of here, please!

467
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:28,840
Hurry up!

468
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,050
Damn it!

469
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,260
Come on out.

470
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,890
Oh gosh.

471
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,100
I nearly suffocated in there.

472
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,610
This way.

473
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,540
CLOSED

474
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,350
What's going on?

475
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,940
Are you sure this is the meeting place?

476
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,570
This is the only cleaning supplies room
on the first floor I know of.

477
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:01,360
The signal...

478
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,410
I think our timing was off
because the signal was delayed.

479
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,890
The night breeze of Joseon
is so refreshing.

480
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,180
Let's drink here.

481
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:31,850
Yes, sir.

482
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,570
I found whiskey in the storage room.

483
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,660
So I snuck it out.

484
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,540
Hey. Be quiet.

485
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,280
Don't shoot.

486
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,160
Don't shoot.

487
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,540
Who are you?

488
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,230
- Fireworks.
- What is that?

489
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,700
Chae-ok!

490
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,680
Forgive me.

491
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:39,930
I'm late.

492
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,530
What a sight.

493
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:19,600
They succeeded.

494
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,350
I'm not so sure.

495
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,850
I hope they did.

496
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,610
No, I'm not sure what's going on.

497
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,320
Yes, of course.
Fireworks are banned in Gyeongseong.

498
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,000
Yes, sir! I'll find the culprits
and report them to you immediately.

499
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,540
Yes, sir!

500
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,750
I'm heading over to the bureau. Get ready.

501
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,670
Yes, sir.

502
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,730
How beautiful.

503
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,400
Have you found Myeong-ja?

504
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:13,940
Where is she? Did you get her out?

505
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,610
You can come out now.

506
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:44,770
Careful.

507
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:47,850
There we go.

508
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,070
Wait.

509
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,320
Where's Myeong-ja?

510
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,580
Get these kids out of here first.

511
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,250
What are you talking about?
Who are these kids?

512
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,080
If you take the kids out of here,

513
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,040
I'll go and find Myeong-ja.

514
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,390
You have something to show me?

515
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,270
Yes.

516
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:44,200
Move.

517
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,990
Get in there now!

518
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,480
What is this place?

519
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,210
I'm going to make that creature
recognize me.

520
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,420
Every time I ring the bell,

521
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,050
it will remember
and know that I'm feeding it.

522
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,890
It will know who its master is
and whom it must obey.

523
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,180
That's how I'll tame it.
