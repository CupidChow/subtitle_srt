<i>Mother once told me...</i>

3
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,970
<i>"You can make so many different shapes
with just one string."</i>

4
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,560
<i>"So imagine how many shapes could be made</i>

5
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,940
<i>when two people meet."</i>

6
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,610
<i>"Those unpredictable bonds of fate</i>

7
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,530
<i>shape the mold of a new life</i>

8
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,030
<i>and steer its direction."</i>

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,660
<i>"For one seemingly coincidental encounter,</i>

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,130
<i>days, eras, and space</i>

11
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,130
<i>all start moving
in one specific direction," she said.</i>

12
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,310
<i>An attraction that seems vague
yet so very clear and palpable.</i>

13
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,200
<i>It defies calculation.</i>

14
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,910
<i>An incalculable force
that sweeps you off your feet.</i>

15
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,480
<i>It draws to an endless pull
until two finally meet as one.</i>

16
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,980
<i>She told me that is the power of fate.</i>

17
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,390
Forgive me.

18
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm late.

IMPRINTING

21
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,620
Where were the fireworks set off from?

22
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,960
From the east of Namsan,
near Ongseong Hospital, sir.

23
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,290
- Ongseong Hospital?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,050
They have to be around here somewhere!

25
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,390
Find the culprits
who set off the fireworks!

26
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,310
Yes, sir!

27
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,360
Over here, sir!

28
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,070
There!

29
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,610
Move!

30
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,420
Where is Jang Tae-sang now?

31
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,040
I apologize, sir.

32
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,670
I thought I was right on his tail, but...

33
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,670
Where did you lose him?

34
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,010
On the way
to the third district of Bonjeong.

35
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,640
No, it's on me.

36
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,180
No, I'm paying!

37
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,890
Where are we--

38
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,980
- Hey.
- What the hell?

39
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,980
Hey, you!

40
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,770
Relax.

41
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,360
I want an apology for that!

42
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,780
Hey, let's just go for another round.

43
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,260
Are the length of the sleeves and pants
to your liking?

44
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,680
They fit perfectly.

45
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,390
It looks good on me, this bold style.

46
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,810
Are you hurt, sir?

47
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,940
The rickshaw?

48
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,980
It's waiting out the back.

49
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,580
Can you make room in your rickshaw
to fit a person inside?

50
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,290
When do you need it by?

51
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,710
Meet me behind Mr. Heo's tailor shop
at 9:00 p.m. tonight.

52
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,380
Will this do?

53
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,180
I'll make sure to return the rickshaw
as soon as I'm done.

54
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,930
Just a moment, sir.

55
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,940
Take care of yourself, Master Jang.

56
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,570
Could it be

57
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,160
that Jang Tae-sang
went inside Ongseong Hospital?

58
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,160
<i>That's right.</i>

59
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,420
<i>I, Jang Tae-sang,</i>

60
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,670
<i>decided to break into Ongseong Hospital</i>

61
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>to protect my shop and my people
despite being injured.</i>

62
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,500
I heard you're getting someone out
of Ongseong Hospital.

63
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,630
I want to help.

64
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,300
You could get really badly hurt.

65
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,130
Please let me help.

66
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm coming with you.

67
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,180
We're not going out for a walk.

68
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,970
I was told that one of my comrades
was arrested and taken to the hospital.

69
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,680
I won't get in your way
of finding Myeong-ja.

70
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,940
Just drop me off inside.

71
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,190
Myeong-ja is the only person
I can bring out of there.

72
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,450
You'll have to find
your own way out of the hospital.

73
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,070
I am aware.

74
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
If, by any chance, you run into trouble,

75
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,910
I may have no choice
but to turn a blind eye.

76
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,540
I won't hold any grudges.

77
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,750
Please think it over just one more time.

78
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,800
This plan is just too dangerous.

79
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,630
Look here.

80
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,380
I'm Jang Tae-sang.

81
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,050
Japanese bullets and swords
won't give a hoot about who you are.

82
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,480
I'll dodge them on my own,
so don't worry is what I'm saying.

83
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,990
Come back alive, Master Jang.

84
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,780
I'll have your favorite cognac ready.

85
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,630
Let's go.

86
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,630
<i>I risked my life as such, but...</i>

87
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,400
This isn't what we agreed on.

88
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,810
You said you found Myeong-ja.

89
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,690
You even sent me a note.
So, what is all this?

90
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,570
Once you'd found a way out of here
and sent a signal,

91
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,360
then I was going to bring her out.

92
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,450
All right, fine.

93
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,290
Let's say there was a misunderstanding.

94
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,710
But what's the deal
with bringing along those kids?

95
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,960
Do you know them?

96
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,550
- I don't.
- Then why?

97
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,340
Why bring along
a string of total strangers?

98
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,590
What were you thinking? Why?

99
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
To save them.

100
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,060
Otherwise, they will all die.

101
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,770
Let's talk after we get down from here.

102
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,820
Two are already dead.

103
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,490
The rest of them
won't be making any noise for a while.

104
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,950
All right, kids. Follow me.

105
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,500
Here.

106
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,790
Come on.

107
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,870
Let us go.

108
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,020
What's this about an accident?

109
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,820
There are no traces
of any outsiders breaking in.

110
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,950
The kids who escaped
must have done this, sir.

111
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,370
Don't just stand there!

112
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,540
Split up and find those kids now! Go on!

113
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,630
Yes, sir!

114
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,640
What's all this? Where's Myeong-ja?

115
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,480
That I don't know.

116
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,730
And who on Earth are those kids?

117
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,770
I have no idea.

118
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,480
They were in the laboratory.

119
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,650
Laboratory?

120
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,610
They have a laboratory?

121
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,530
Who might you be?

122
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm Kwon Jun-taek, Tae-sang's friend.

123
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,830
He's told me about you two.

124
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,080
Who's the Japanese guy?

125
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,510
He works at this hospital.

126
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,800
He doesn't look like a soldier
or a doctor.

127
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,850
Can we trust him?

128
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,850
Saving Myeong-ja is our priority.

129
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,140
Let's focus on that for now.

130
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,440
I think we should discuss
what to do with those kids first.

131
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,110
But what is this laboratory
you just mentioned?

132
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,550
I was working at a munitions factory

133
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,510
before I got dragged here.

134
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,890
They've been giving me shots every day.

135
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,020
What kind of shots could they be?

136
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,770
I don't know.

137
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,980
I just watched the other kids
die off one by one.

138
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,610
Some died after suffering
from a high fever.

139
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Others died in their sleep.

140
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,120
Every day I heard people
screaming in agony...

141
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,540
begging to be saved.

142
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,500
They kept...

143
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
They kept screaming to be saved.

144
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,670
I saw something similar in Manchuria.

145
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,350
They were conducting
inhumane experiments on people there.

146
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,480
It looks like they are doing
the same thing here.

147
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,120
So, what?

148
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,620
Are you trying to say

149
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,540
Myeong-ja's going through
something similar?

150
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,080
Perhaps.

151
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,580
Then all the more reason for us
not to dawdle.

152
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,800
If we delay any longer,
something might happen to Myeong-ja.

153
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,210
But first, these kids need--

154
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,630
This doesn't concern me.

155
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,630
You caused this mess, so you handle it.

156
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,390
Are you really going to ignore these kids?

157
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,070
I have my own fish to fry.
I'm up to my ears in my own problems.

158
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,570
If I don't bring Myeong-ja to Ishikawa,

159
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,450
I'll lose everything I own
and everyone I hold dear.

160
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,080
I have no time or reason
to care about strangers,

161
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,290
so don't you try to guilt-trip me.

162
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,370
I won't risk my life to save these kids.

163
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,540
All I'm gonna do is find Myeong-ja
and take her out. Got that?

164
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,240
We can't find them anywhere.

165
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,830
Maybe they have already left the ward.

166
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,870
No, it's too heavily guarded
for them to slip past so easily.

167
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,710
Search more thoroughly.

168
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,170
They're hiding here somewhere.

169
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,590
Kids are good at hide-and-seek after all.

170
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,320
It should be able to fit at least two.

171
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,820
There's no time.
The smallest ones first. You and you.

172
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,820
And...

173
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,560
Why did you do that? What frightened you?

174
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,360
Come here.

175
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,530
That man... who is he?

176
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,570
What exactly does he do at this hospital?

177
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,290
Who is he?

178
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,290
He's Sachimoto.

179
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,880
The painter you've been looking for.

180
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,760
That's him.

181
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,940
What is that?

182
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,910
A present from my daughter.

183
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,790
She was 12, I think.

184
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,950
She had just learned wood carving

185
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,420
and gave her mother and I one each.

186
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,050
By the way, how did you two
end up becoming sleuths?

187
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,260
We're searching for my wife
who went missing ten years ago.

188
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,140
This.

189
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,900
Did you draw this about a year ago?

190
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,780
Yes, I did.

191
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,400
Do you know the woman in this drawing?

192
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,820
When and where did you meet her? No...

193
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,540
Do you happen to know where she is now?

194
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,290
How do you know her?

195
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,420
She's my mother.

196
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,520
Anything will do.

197
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,400
Just tell me anything you know about her.

198
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,480
Do you know...

199
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,360
where my mother is?

200
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,650
Fast, quiet,

201
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,940
and dangerous, right?

202
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,490
And moreover, powerful.

203
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,330
How many more can you create?

204
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,660
I can't say.

205
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,710
That's the only successful specimen
so far.

206
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,920
All the other specimens died
or became deformed in the process.

207
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,840
You must increase the success rate.

208
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:22,930
I would love to show His Majesty
this great result as soon as possible.

209
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,410
We're done for today.
Take the rest of the prisoners back up.

210
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,250
I have other business to attend to.
Excuse me.

211
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,420
Take them back.

212
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,670
I'm sorry.

213
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,670
I don't know.

214
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,500
You said you drew this.

215
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,840
I drew it, yes.

216
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,680
But where she is...

217
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,810
that I don't know.

218
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,940
Do you really not know?

219
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,950
I have spent ten years searching for her.

220
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,870
More than three years in Manchuria.

221
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,870
When I saw this drawing,
I returned in a heartbeat,

222
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,710
hoping that whoever drew this
would know where she was.

223
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,050
Yet you say you don't?

224
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,600
Are you sure you don't know?

225
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,600
My deepest apologies.

226
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,900
Can you pull a rickshaw?

227
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,450
I've done it a couple of times.

228
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Come here.

229
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
From now on,

230
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,880
you are the leader.

231
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,970
As a man,

232
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,430
it's your responsibility to take
these kids out of here. All right?

233
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,270
We are going to play hide-and-seek now.

234
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,570
Don't let the Japanese soldiers find you

235
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,570
until the rickshaw stops moving.

236
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,870
You can't make a sound.

237
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,580
Can you do that?

238
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,380
Win and don't get caught,
and I'll give you one more as a prize.

239
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,170
Can you do it?

240
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,220
Here.

241
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,800
What's your plan?

242
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,680
We're going to send these kids out.

243
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,850
Let's get that done first,

244
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,810
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

245
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,110
What?

246
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,360
Mr. Sachimoto's room?

247
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,530
Yes, sir.
I heard a little girl's scream there.

248
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,470
Mr. Sachimoto.

249
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,470
Mr. Sachimoto!

250
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,850
Open it!

251
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,340
Mr. Sachimoto.

252
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,440
What is it?

253
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,490
Where are you headed, Mr. Sachimoto?

254
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,200
Why do you ask?

255
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,250
Some kids have escaped
from the underground laboratory.

256
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,460
And?

257
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,540
One of my corporals says

258
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,590
he heard a little girl's scream
coming from your room.

259
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,800
I was just cleaning up junk from my room.

260
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,970
May we take a look inside the cart?

261
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,180
<i>Look straight ahead and run.</i>

262
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,350
Don't hesitate or falter.

263
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,350
And do not stop or look back
as you pass the main gates.

264
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,780
Hold on.

265
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,240
Be confident. Stand tall.

266
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,750
You're simply leaving
the way you're supposed to, you hear?

267
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,490
Open the gates!

268
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,080
Hey!

269
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,550
Inform Director Ichiro
that the guest from Bonjeong is here.

270
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,470
Yes, sir!

271
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,450
Is there anything else
you'd like to check?

272
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,630
Tell me,

273
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,050
am I to inform the military police
every time I clean my room now?

274
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,970
No. I apologize for the trouble,
Mr. Sachimoto.

275
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,090
PAWNSHOP

276
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,620
Go and get Mr. Gu here right now.

277
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,200
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,830
And the other kids? Where are they?

279
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,510
My goodness. Not one, but two?

280
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,260
Come on out.

281
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,640
- There you go.
- Well done.

282
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,180
- You did well.
- You did well.

283
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,560
Good job.

284
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,230
- You did good.
- Good girl.

285
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,620
Oh dear. Two more?

286
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,620
Here, come on out.

287
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,170
Did the man give this to you?

288
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,760
But did we really win?

289
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,010
Win what?

290
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,930
Hide-and-seek.

291
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,260
He said he would give us
another tin of cookies

292
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,180
if we didn't get caught
by the Japanese soldiers.

293
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,770
Yes. That's right, you won.

294
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,860
There's no doubt about it.

295
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,320
You must be hungry.

296
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,820
Let's get you some food.

297
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,530
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

298
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,620
Come this way.

299
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,290
The carotid artery was severed
in one blow.

300
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,460
There was a teenage boy
among the escaped kids.

301
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,380
No.

302
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,720
The killer knows how to use a knife.

303
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,350
See if there were any Josenjings
among the soldiers who entered the lab.

304
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,430
Yes, sir. Right away, sir!

305
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,770
The guest from Bonjeong has arrived, sir.

306
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,750
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

307
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,760
I had some matters to take care of.

308
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,390
May I ask why you're here
at this hour, ma'am?

309
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,720
Jang Tae-sang.

310
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,020
I believe

311
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,270
he's inside this hospital right now.

312
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,980
Myeong-ja seems to be imprisoned here...

313
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,900
PRISON

314
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,990
...in the second-level underground prison
based on our information.

315
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,580
Are other Joseon people there as well?

316
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,410
It seems so.

317
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,710
We should hurry.

318
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,750
Only three hours left until dawn.

319
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,840
If we can't get Myeong-ja out before then,
things will get tricky.

320
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,090
Understood.

321
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,880
My shift ends soon.

322
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,760
They will suspect me
if I don't return in time.

323
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,390
Yes. I understand.

324
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,770
If you do reach the underground prison,
please find my little brother too.

325
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,900
His name is Oh Sang-deok.

326
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,190
He's in his early 20s
and of average height.

327
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,320
There is a black, thumb-sized mole
next to his right ear.

328
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,360
Please find him.

329
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,660
You have my word.

330
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,120
We'll search for him.

331
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,240
Thank you.

332
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,080
I should say goodbye here as well.

333
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,590
I sincerely hope
that you find what you're looking for.

334
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,350
All right. We should get going too.

335
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,060
You two should leave now as well.

336
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,280
You found Sachimoto
but didn't gain what you were looking for.

337
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,990
We've reached the end of our contract,

338
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,490
so you can stop here.

339
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,580
However, I will be taking this.

340
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,620
We promised to bring back Myeong-ja.

341
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,500
You found her whereabouts.
That's more than enough.

342
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,760
You have kept your promise,

343
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,050
so we'll keep ours as well.

344
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,430
As I said, you already kept your promise.

345
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,980
You have a knack for annoying people.

346
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,730
Why do you keep making me repeat myself?

347
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,650
Did I... do that?

348
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,450
I'll lead the way.

349
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,780
So try not to get lost.

350
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,580
Well...

351
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,870
Please excuse her.

352
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,210
My daughter takes promises very seriously.

353
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,460
Yes, well...

354
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,150
Damn it.

355
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,830
What's with those men?

356
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,250
I'll explain later.

357
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,080
Come on.

358
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,880
Are you all right?

359
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,090
What do you mean?

360
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,970
Are we supposed to go down here?

361
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,760
I see nothing.

362
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,360
Do you even know where this leads?

363
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,570
For God's sake.

364
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,280
We have no time to lose.

365
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,200
I'll have a look around,
so head down first.

366
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,450
I'll be right behind you.

367
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,110
I see someone on the rooftop of the ward.

368
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,280
Please go check!

369
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,080
<i>Keep an eye on it!</i>

370
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,950
Yes, sir!

371
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,480
I sprained my ankle a bit,
but not to worry.

372
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,670
What in the world...

373
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,000
This way.

374
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,400
FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF KOREA

375
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,830
- Hurry up!
- Move it!

376
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,040
Run!

377
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,620
This is an emergency!

378
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,380
We'll be moving in. Follow me!

379
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,290
Yes, sir!

380
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,220
Get up!

381
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,680
You there, Josenjing. Stand up!

382
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,850
We have an intruder.

383
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,180
Disease Control Platoon, arm yourselves
and head to the underground lab.

384
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,690
Get a move on!

385
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,730
Yes, sir!

386
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,910
Pardon me, Lady Maeda.

387
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,290
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

388
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,370
I apologize for the inconvenience.

389
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,000
Those who consider themselves
to be flawless

390
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,050
let their guard down more easily.

391
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,220
In any case,

392
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,640
I insist that you safely guard
what I've entrusted to you.

393
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,350
Until the baby is born,

394
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,680
she must not be harmed

395
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,520
or killed.

396
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,110
But I'm sure you're already aware.

397
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,740
Yes, Lady Maeda.

398
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,240
I'll take care of it straight away.

399
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,040
Open it.

400
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,170
Get out.

401
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,970
Get out, now!

402
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Drag her out.

403
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
No!

404
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,720
I don't want to die!

405
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,020
Please don't kill me!

406
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,140
Let go! Let go of me!

407
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,980
Don't kill me! Please!

408
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,780
What will become of us now?

409
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,950
Spare me!

410
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,930
Please don't kill me!

411
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,530
Help!

412
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,380
Please, I'm begging you! I'm with a child!

413
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,800
Please, spare the child!

414
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,850
Cool it if you want to live.

415
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,060
Don't make a fuss and keep quiet.

416
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,070
That way you will be safe,
at least until your baby is born.

417
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,420
Was that the lower floors?

418
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,630
The intruder reached
that far down already?

419
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,550
I don't believe so.

420
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,350
From now on, monitor and guard
every path leading to the underground lab.

421
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,480
Any outsider who has seen
the underground laboratory

422
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,770
must not leave this place alive.

423
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,780
Understood?

424
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,360
Yes, sir!

425
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,030
They must have found out
that we're inside.

426
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,830
What were those gunshots?

427
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:06,120
Whatever they were, I don't think
we can use the emergency stairs anymore.

428
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,380
Then what do we do now?

429
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,880
Sachimoto showed me another route.

430
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,090
Here.

431
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,430
This leads to the laundry room
in the second-level basement.

432
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,760
It's usually used to send surgical gowns

433
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,680
from the underground laboratory
down to the laundry room,

434
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,810
but it is wide enough
for a person to pass through.

435
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,360
Where is that break room?

436
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,020
Right across from here.

437
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,490
Clean it up. Move it.

438
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,250
Are you okay?

439
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,420
Quickly now.

440
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,270
- All of you, to the other floors!
- Yes, sir!

441
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,320
Get a move on!

442
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,780
This is an emergency! Get it together!

443
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,030
Yes, sir!

444
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,400
Let's go on ahead.

445
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,430
We must hurry.

446
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,600
A soldier's onto us. Come on.

447
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,550
I'm not hurt. I'm fine. Totally fine.

448
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,300
Are you hurt?

449
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:49,850
I'm okay.

450
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,480
You're okay?

451
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:02,900
Don't move!

452
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,740
Hand it over.

453
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,410
Hand it over!

454
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:21,920
Dirty Josenjing bastard!

455
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:49,530
Chae-ok!

456
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,280
Sir, please help!

457
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,360
That thing... That creature...

458
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,860
It's on its way up here!

459
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,380
So you managed to keep your bravado
in this state.

460
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,010
Bravado?

461
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,020
More like bravery.

462
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:46,560
I wasn't being reckless,
just confident that I could win.

463
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:07,370
I think your friend
has already made his escape.

464
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,380
We agreed to move separately
when we came in.

465
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,010
Will you be all right?

466
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,590
Sturdy as a rock.

467
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:22,470
Let's go and find Myeong-ja.

468
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,770
We should split up here.

469
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,770
Master Jang,
check the second-level underground prison.

470
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,020
I'll take the third-level basement.

471
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,570
I'll go down instead.

472
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,740
Can't you see that he is injured?

473
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,030
Stay by his side and help him.

474
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,450
Father.

475
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,530
Do as I say.

476
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,370
That way, we can all move efficiently.

477
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,370
Let's meet up at our rendezvous
in an hour.

478
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:53,130
If I'm late, don't wait for me.
You know the drill.

479
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,170
Be careful.

480
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,440
You can go with him. I'll be fine.

481
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,400
I can handle it myself.

482
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:15,940
Follow me.

483
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,810
I heard quite a lot of gunshots earlier.

484
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,230
Don't you think something's going on
inside this place?

485
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,810
Stay here for now.
