00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,150
I have arranged it
with Director Ichiro of Ongseong Hospital.

<i>The child in your womb

5
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,750
<i>That being said...</i>

6
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,260
please take exceptional care of yourself,

7
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
Miss Akiko.

8
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,890
Sorry, but we are closed for the day.

9
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,130
The spores stopped floating around
an hour ago.

10
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,010
Has it awakened?

11
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,430
Yes, but it's not moving.

12
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,930
Perhaps we used too much nitrogen gas?

13
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,940
What's on your mind?

14
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,570
Seishin.

15
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,580
Lieutenant Colonel Kato, we have a guest.

16
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,670
This is Lady Maeda.
She is the wife of Commissioner Ishikawa

17
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,010
and the daughter
of Lieutenant General Maeda of the Army.

18
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,930
Outsiders are not allowed down here.

19
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,220
She's also the most generous sponsor
of our hospital, Colonel.

20
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,780
Is that it?

21
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,200
I'd advise you not to get too close.

22
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
Seishin.

23
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
So you were still alive.

24
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,220
Teacher Seishin.

AWAKENING

27
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,160
<i>He must have gone through an ordeal.</i>

28
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,500
<i>He hasn't been able to sleep a wink
or swallow a bite of food.</i>

29
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
What about Tae-sang?

30
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,540
He didn't make it back.

31
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,210
And the merchants in Bonjeong
have all been arrested.

32
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,220
Yes, hello.

33
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,640
Yes.

34
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,350
Yes.

35
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,810
- Yes, sir.
- Quiet!

36
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,350
Sit down!

37
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,480
Mr. Gu, what's going on?

38
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,110
Why haven't we heard from Master Jang yet?

39
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,370
Is he... not coming to save us?

40
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Is that it?

41
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,290
Damn it!

What are you up to?

46
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,720
Hurry back home, will you?

47
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,690
Is he dead?

48
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,530
He's breathing, just about.

49
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,860
Take him so he can get treated.

50
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,280
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir!

51
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,080
Kill him...

52
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,050
Find...

53
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,050
the bastard

54
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,930
and kill him!

55
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,470
All of you, stop and stand back!

56
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,360
As you were.

57
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,800
Sir! I have something to report.

58
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,800
Is it urgent?

59
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,310
First Sergeant Haneda
was found next to the body dump.

60
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,890
He has a serious gunshot wound.

61
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,520
My apologies, Lady Maeda.
Would you wait inside for just a moment?

62
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,310
Mr. Jang!

63
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,690
What are you... doing here?

64
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,150
I came in to do a job

65
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,360
but missed my chance to leave.

66
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,570
So I need you

67
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,660
to help me, Lady Maeda.

68
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,540
Are you saying that a Josenjing
is still hiding in here?

69
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,500
Yes, sir. It seems so.

70
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,800
Director Ichiro!

71
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,760
The Josenjing seems to be in this wing.

72
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,930
This soldier just found blood
near the supply room.

73
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,320
Lady Maeda, I'm afraid

74
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,860
now is not a good time...

75
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,040
It's an emergency! Emergency!

76
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,000
Lady Maeda is in danger!

77
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,960
Find Lady Maeda immediately! Now!

78
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,860
Lady Maeda.

79
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,540
No questions. Just drive.

80
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,770
Go.

81
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,410
Thank you.

82
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,050
What should I do, ma'am? Shall I stop?

83
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
To Bonjeong.

PAWNSHOP
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

85
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,150
Were you at Golden Treasure again?

86
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,820
Waiting for me?

87
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,200
It's been four days.

88
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,120
The fact that he hasn't reached out

89
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,960
means it's unlikely for him to return.

90
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,590
Besides, our job was to find Myeong-ja.

91
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,760
Since we've done our part,
it is time for us to head back home.

92
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,470
Get ready to leave early tomorrow morning.

93
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,890
I should have stayed in his place.

94
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
It was his choice.

95
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,940
All he had to do was save Myeong-ja, but...

96
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,780
because of us...

97
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,910
I should've stayed
and found a way to rescue Mother.

98
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,910
I should've at least gotten revenge
on those who did that to her.

99
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,670
Then he wouldn't have been left alone.

100
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,670
And I wouldn't be wracked with guilt.

101
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,050
What do you mean by that?

102
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,430
I met Mother.

103
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,770
She's still there...

104
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,520
at Ongseong Hospital.

105
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,750
It's been in that state
ever since Lady Maeda's visit.

106
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,130
It seems to be enraged by something.

107
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,920
It's looking for its young.

108
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,340
Sir?

109
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,970
It's not enraged,

110
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,100
but agitated.

111
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,760
I'll ask again.

112
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,810
Where are the Josenjings
you helped escape?

113
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,810
I don't know.

114
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,900
Where is Jang Tae-sang right now?

115
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,820
I wish...

116
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,610
I wish I knew.

117
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,160
You don't seem to understand.

118
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,580
Should we start over?

119
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,000
Over...

120
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,000
Start... over...

121
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,510
<i>Have you ever had</i>

122
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,640
<i>your nails plucked out?</i>

123
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,850
<i>Have you ever been burned...</i>

124
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,110
<i>or gone through electric torture?</i>

125
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,660
<i>Do you know what happens</i>

126
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,160
<i>when water mixed with chili powder
is poured down your nose</i>

127
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,420
<i>while hanging upside down?</i>

128
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,130
<i>Persist to that point,</i>

129
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,550
<i>and a person can no longer remain human.</i>

130
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,050
<i>If you're ever in such a situation,</i>

131
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,470
<i>don't try to hold back and ruin your life.</i>

132
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,390
<i>Just tell them everything you know.</i>

133
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,770
I won't ever resent you for betraying me
in a situation like that.

134
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,770
Keep that in mind.

135
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,990
Let me ask you again.

136
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,780
What is the true purpose of your pawnshop?

137
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Are you rebels?

138
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,330
Or do you secretly fund
the independence army?

139
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,040
Answer me!

140
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,330
Where is Jang Tae-sang?

141
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,930
Goddamn it...

142
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
You are awake.

143
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,130
Lady Maeda.

144
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,940
Your fever has gone down, thankfully.

145
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,690
Your wounds are also healing well.

146
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,790
How long have I been here?

147
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,330
As of today, it's been four days.

148
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,420
You caused quite a stir
at Ongseong Hospital.

149
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,300
Though you didn't need to risk your life
over someone else's trouble.

150
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,560
It's not like you.

151
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,690
It just

152
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,280
made me a bit angry.

153
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,570
It's not my fault that this country
has come to this.

154
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,700
It's not my fault those people
were kept in there and suffering, but...

155
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,370
But?

156
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,420
But...

157
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,550
once I saw it with my own eyes,

158
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,050
it made me angry.

159
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,800
It pissed me off.

160
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,770
Could you not stand the injustice
as a fellow Joseon person?

161
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,400
No, I couldn't stand it

162
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,150
as a fellow human being.

163
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,700
Do you think all human lives are equal?

164
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,160
Do you somehow think they're not?

165
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,670
Do you still

166
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,380
consider us friends?

167
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,360
A serial murder case?

168
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,940
Yes, 11 deaths around Cheonggyecheon
over the past four days.

169
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,150
We've requested the military ward
for autopsies.

170
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,450
An unusually large number of corpses
were in a very strange state.

171
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,740
Strange? In what way?

172
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,290
They were missing their brains, sir.

173
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,780
He's from the military ward.

174
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,010
This is the House of Golden Treasure!

175
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,800
No.

176
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,390
We haven't put the store up for sale.

177
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,060
What are you talking about?

178
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,940
Dead...

179
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,520
What do you mean? Who's dead?

180
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,280
Just who do you think you are?

181
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,240
You watch your mouth
and the crap that comes out of it!

182
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,950
That's right, you heard me! Oh, pipe down!

183
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,000
Shut your trap,
or I will sew it shut for you.

184
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,500
Like they know it all.

185
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,000
How dare they say shit like he's dead
as if they have a say in it?

186
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,480
You've got to be freaking kidding me.

187
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,780
House of Golden Treasure.

188
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,910
I believe my employee
has already answered that question.

189
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Me?

190
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,200
I'm the master of this shop,

191
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,170
Jang Tae-sang.

192
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,250
Yes.

193
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,760
I'm still alive and well.

194
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,430
More people have been eyeing up
my treasured shop lately, haven't they?

195
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,310
Tae-sang, you...

196
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,400
Look what you've done.

197
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,110
You didn't have to close up shop.
I was only gone for a few days.

198
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,610
No wonder they got the wrong idea.

199
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,860
Are...

200
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,120
Are you all right?

201
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,660
Of course I am.

202
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,210
You're not hurt?

203
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,790
Of course not!

204
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,630
Fool!

205
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,840
If you're okay,
then what took you so long?

206
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,880
Did you enjoy giving this old woman
a heart attack?

207
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,300
You heartless boy!

208
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,930
Hey, I'm sorry.

209
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,390
I had my reasons!

210
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,770
So calm down, Mrs. Nawol.

211
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,150
I said I was sorry.

212
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,950
Enough of this.

213
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,120
You should go and fetch Mr. Gu now.

214
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,710
Where is he?

215
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,670
Get up.

216
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,350
No! I won't go!

217
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,850
Get out!

218
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,150
Master Jang!

219
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,880
Wait here.

220
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,460
Stop right there!

221
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,930
Where do you think you're going?

222
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,140
Is that Jang from Golden Treasure?

223
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,770
I'm here to see Commissioner Ishikawa.

224
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,070
Hey, you! Are you ignoring me?

225
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,320
Go tell him I'm here.

226
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,990
You insolent bastard!

227
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,120
Swinging a fist at someone

228
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,160
who's come to have a conversation
is what thugs do.

229
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,630
If you're a police officer,
why don't you act like one?

230
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,600
You caused a bigger scene than I expected.

231
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,730
Only because you told me to do
whatever it took.

232
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,070
So,

233
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,570
what did you do with the Joseon people
you helped escape?

234
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,540
Which Joseon people are you referring to?

235
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,500
Like I said, I'm here as a representative
of the Bonjeong Merchants Association.

236
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,840
I'm asking you to release
the wrongfully imprisoned merchants.

237
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,010
No less than ten violations
were committed that night.

238
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,850
Loud singing, jazz-playing,

239
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,890
violation of public order
and security regulations, et cetera.

240
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,060
Let's settle this with a fine.

241
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,440
Do you think money
will fix this situation?

242
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,070
It's the cleanest and easiest way,
isn't it?

243
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
And if I refuse?

244
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,370
Then all businesses in Bonjeong
will close up starting today.

245
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,540
You know that the fundraising party
for the war effort will be held

246
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,710
in two days.

247
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,250
All deliveries of food and drinks
to the party will be stopped.

248
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Plus, all the officials and their wives
who have put in orders for their garments

249
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,340
will not be able to receive them in time.

250
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,010
When that happens,
the authorities will begin to investigate.

251
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,390
That would put you in a tight spot,
would it not?

252
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,730
Is that a threat?

253
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,230
When there comes a time
for the weak to be strong,

254
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,730
we do something called "unite."

255
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,660
We are simply doing what we can do
in light of the situation.

256
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,370
Know your limits.

257
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,540
Don't risk your life
for matters that don't concern you.

258
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:58,300
I learned an important lesson
from my visit to Ongseong Hospital.

259
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,630
When you need to risk your life,

260
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,510
you go all in.

261
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,100
If you hesitate to do so,

262
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,770
you'll end up dead.

263
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,230
I know the prime suspects
in this incident.

264
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,530
Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure,

265
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,160
Yoon Chae-ok the sleuth, and...

266
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,620
a Joseon courtesan named Akiko.

267
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,840
Miss Akiko?

268
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,920
Are you okay?

269
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,890
Do you have reasons to believe
that they are suspects?

270
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,730
The suspects I've just mentioned

271
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,570
all entered Ongseong Hospital
and then escaped.

272
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,610
What exactly happened at the hospital?

273
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,280
I'm not inclined
to divulge that information.

274
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,530
It's a military secret.

275
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,080
Akiko.

276
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,250
Aki...

277
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,450
What in the hell...

278
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,710
<i>Tell me.</i>

279
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,710
What went on in there?

280
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,090
What exactly is happening
inside Ongseong Hospital?!

281
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,890
As you know,

282
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,940
the price for my information
is quite steep.

283
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,100
And confidentiality
about Ongseong Hospital

284
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,230
is considered to be
of the highest level, you know.

285
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,200
I can only hand over such information
when enough trust has been built.

286
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,990
Are you trying to strike a deal?

287
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,530
Mr. Ishikawa!

288
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,490
I'm trying to talk about mutual trust.

289
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,960
I have already kept my promise

290
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,170
and returned Akiko to you.

291
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,300
Now it's your turn.

292
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,050
Release my people.

293
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,820
Get out!

294
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,070
You're all released!

295
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,990
Released! We're free!

296
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,480
Master Jang...

297
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,400
You're alive?

298
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,120
Can you stand up?

299
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,290
What took you so long?

300
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,180
Let's get out of here first.

301
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Come on.

302
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:26,190
Bonjeong!

303
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,610
Do you all want to die?

304
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,740
Be quiet!

305
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,920
Bonjeong.

306
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,230
- Mori.
- Yes!

307
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,310
Commissioner, sir.

308
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,610
Keep Jang under close observation
from now on.

309
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,440
Pardon? Again, sir?

310
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,490
Understood, sir.

311
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,710
MILITARY WARD, UNDERGROUND LAB
HUMAN EXPERIMENTS, LADY MAEDA

312
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,260
LADY MAEDA

313
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,860
Don't worry too much. He'll be all right.

314
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,320
I owe Mr. Gu too great a debt.

315
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,410
Hardly.

316
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,330
I can't even count
all the times you saved his life.

317
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,040
He just repaid you for one of them.

318
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,210
The aftermath of torture...

319
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,590
lasts a while, huh?

320
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,470
You should go now.

321
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,690
No, I'll stay here.

322
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,150
There is someone else waiting for you.

323
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,440
She came by every single day

324
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,160
to check whether you had returned safely.

325
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,120
Leave Mr. Gu to me.

326
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,540
Go pay her a visit.

327
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,200
Aren't you having dinner?

328
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,370
I'm not hungry.

329
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,790
You go and eat.

330
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,120
Should I grab some dumplings for you?

331
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,170
I'll be right back.

332
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,860
Who are you?

333
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,420
You're still as aggressive as ever.

334
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,130
Now that you've seen my face,

335
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,220
will you let me go?

336
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,350
Master Jang...

337
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,760
I felt the same way.

338
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,180
I also...

339
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,480
missed you a lot.

340
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,140
Did you have something to say?

341
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,470
Tell me.

342
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,640
How much do you know
about the underground laboratory

343
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,150
in Ongseong Hospital?

344
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,320
Are you even remotely aware
of what exactly is going on there?

345
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,620
There is nothing I don't know about.

346
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,580
What have you done to Akiko?

347
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
I asked you what you did to her!

348
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,920
You seem to be mistaken.

349
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,510
You have no right to ask me such things.

350
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,060
And I have no obligation to answer you.

351
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,720
What's that now?

352
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:21,270
From the beginning, our relationship
was formed for mutual benefit.

353
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,400
I needed a husband
so I could come to Joseon.

354
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:34,160
And you needed my good name and lineage
to move up and succeed.

355
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,460
You suddenly assuming
the role of my husband like this

356
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,710
puts me in an awkward position,
Mr. Ishikawa.

357
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,380
You shouldn't have touched Akiko.

358
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,470
And you had no need
to send Mr. Jang in there.

359
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,640
We agreed not to interfere
in each other's personal lives.

360
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,390
You're the one who broke the agreement
in the first place!

361
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,360
I respect what you do for a pastime.

362
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,690
But having a child

363
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,070
is a completely different story.

364
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,130
Did you know that Jang Tae-sang
found himself a woman?

365
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,890
A Joseon woman named Yoon Chae-ok.

366
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,770
Apparently, she's young and pretty.

367
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,440
How unfortunate for you.

368
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,650
All that effort nursing him back to health

369
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,150
was absolutely in vain.

370
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,370
Here are your dumplings.

371
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,050
Let's get going.

372
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,730
What a fool!

373
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,980
Stop.

374
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,240
Go... go away!

375
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,290
Get away from me!

376
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,750
Myeong-ja?

377
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,860
So, these are the Najin?

378
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,110
Correct.

379
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,610
They were found inside the glaciers
of Muryong Snow Mountain,

380
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,530
where the Na people live.

381
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,700
And you're saying
that this enters the human brain

382
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,870
to create creatures like Seishin?

383
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,710
No.

384
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:18,460
With Najin alone,
it only turns them into predators.

385
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,800
<i>While retaining the appearance of a human,</i>

386
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,090
<i>they will hold only the survival
and hunting instincts</i> ,

387
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,720
<i>and prey primarily on human brains.</i>

388
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,640
<i>Highly aggressive and more violent
than most predatory animals,</i>

389
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,970
<i>they can move quickly
and heal wounds almost immediately.</i>

390
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,650
Then why does Seishin
appear the way she does?

391
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,950
Because she was injected with a serum
that contained anthrax.

392
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,850
Once injected with this serum
during their predatory stage,

393
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,230
they will move on to Seishin's phase.

394
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,730
Do they have any weaknesses?

395
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,740
They hate sunlight and fire,

396
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,710
and they are weak against nitrogen.

397
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,980
Get a hold of yourself.

398
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:43,770
Why are you doing this?

399
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,030
Myeong-ja!

400
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,830
<i>How horrid.</i>

401
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,250
<i>To remember what it was like
to be human, even in that state...</i>

402
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,960
Ongseong Hospital.

403
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,550
They must've experimented on her.

404
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,450
A flare was fired from Jongno, sir!

405
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,590
Over there! Get her!

406
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,350
Stop!

407
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,970
Don't lose her. Get her!

408
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:36,970
Yes, sir!

409
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:05,250
It was not able to remember at first,
not until it met its daughter.

410
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,960
Daughter?

411
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,590
Seishin has... a daughter?

412
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:19,220
She snuck in here, looking for her mother
who had gone missing ten years ago.

413
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,890
When it recognized its daughter, it...

414
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,520
flipped a switch, I think.

415
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,440
And her daughter's name is...

416
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,110
Yoon Chae-ok.

417
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,490
She works as a sleuth.

418
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,320
<i>Did you know</i>

419
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,490
that Jang Tae-sang found himself a woman?

420
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,580
A Joseon woman named Yoon Chae-ok.

421
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,960
- Find her!
- Yes, sir!

422
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,210
- This way too!
- Yes, sir!

423
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,840
- Hurry up!
- This way!

424
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,260
- Move!
- Find her!

425
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,040
That way! Get her!

426
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,300
Are you all right?

427
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,390
If she's caught, she might get killed.

428
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,190
No, she will go through much worse.

429
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,520
Like my mother did.

430
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,480
Go after her!

431
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,070
Run!

432
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,620
Catch her!

433
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,220
Go.

434
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,480
Don't kill me...

435
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,770
Please don't kill me!

436
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,280
Please don't...

437
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,030
Hold it!

438
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,410
That way!

439
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,260
Find her!

440
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,430
Don't lose her!

441
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,840
Stop right there!

442
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,980
Don't kill me...

443
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,650
Please don't kill me!

444
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,650
Please don't kill me...

445
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,780
Don't kill me!
