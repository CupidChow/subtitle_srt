GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

2
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,000
FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF KOREA

3
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,040
In two weeks' time...

4
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,460
...a fundraiser will be held at Bumingwan
for the Frontline General Rally.

5
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,170
After Tokyo's bombing, the Japanese Army
planned a propaganda event

6
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,640
to exploit our resources and deploy
more Joseon men to the front lines.

7
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,220
It will be a fundraising party
to procure money for that rally.

8
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,980
Lieutenant General Minami,
Lieutenant General Seijiro,

9
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,150
Major General Junji,

10
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,110
Police Chief Nishimura,
and Commissioner Ishikawa will be there,

11
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,610
as will all the big names in Gyeongseong.

12
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,740
Jin Seon-jung of the United Society
and Park Yong-su

13
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,370
of the People's Livelihood Corps
will also be attending.

14
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,080
It will be a momentous occasion.
Make sure to attend it.

15
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,880
So, the leaders
of the Japanese occupation forces

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,800
and the heads of the pro-Japanese traitors
will all be gathered in one place.

17
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,890
This will be
the chance of a lifetime for us.

18
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,430
We have about 20 kilograms
of dynamite we swiped

19
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,350
when we were planning to explode
the Han River railway.

20
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,060
We had to abort the plan
when Comrade Jeong Seung-jong got caught,

21
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,860
but we still have the dynamite.

22
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,780
It's imperative that we don't get caught
before the rebellion.

23
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,570
Don't worry, Comrade Kwon.

24
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,660
Only I know the location

25
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,950
of the explosives.

26
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,630
Run!

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Move it!

28
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Comrade Kwon.

29
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,530
Comrade Lee In-hyeok? How did this happen?

30
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,910
For handing out seditious flyers.

31
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,830
And strangely, he's being taken
not to Seodaemun Prison, but...

32
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,040
But?

33
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,710
...to Ongseong Hospital.

34
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,020
Look here!

35
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,610
LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR
DEVOTE ALL TO WAR

36
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,460
Comrade Lee?

37
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,550
Who are you?

38
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,970
- Are you a Joseon-born?
- Excuse me.

39
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,050
Hey!

40
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,390
Help us, sir.

41
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,140
Please help us get out of here.

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,730
Do you know Lee In-hyeok?

43
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,690
I have a three-year-old
and a five-year-old at home.

44
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,150
They must've been starving
for days. Please.

45
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,240
Please help me get back home. Please?

46
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,700
Forgive me.
I'm on a more urgent mission right now.

47
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,790
Sir, please.

48
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,370
Hey! Over here!

49
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,870
Here!

50
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,580
- I'm sorry.
- Sir!

51
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,090
Comrade Kwon!

52
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,170
You came all this way...

53
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,260
Now, come on. Get us out of here.

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,430
I'm afraid I don't have time.

55
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
What do you mean?

56
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,730
Aren't you here to free us?

57
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,650
Tell me where you hid the dynamite.

58
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,150
We have less than ten days left
until the rebellion.

59
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,400
We cannot waste this precious opportunity!

60
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,660
Tell me where you hid the dynamite,
Comrade Lee.

61
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,910
No.

62
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,700
Free us first.

63
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,620
I can't afford to do that right now.

64
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,340
First, tell me where the dynamite is.

65
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,300
I promise, as soon as I get out,

66
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,180
I will find a way to free you two.

67
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,510
Freeing us comes first.

68
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,510
Comrade Lee!

69
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Listen!

70
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,810
This place is a living hell!

71
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,770
This isn't an ordinary prison!

72
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,520
Comrade Kwon,
if we don't get out of this place...

73
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,740
you'll get no dynamite.

74
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,740
Don't move.

75
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,830
Hands above your head!

76
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,900
What on Earth was that thing?

77
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,280
I don't know what it is,
but I'm sure it was created here.

78
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,230
First, let's get out of this place.

79
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,200
There is a way to reach the central vent
behind this boiler room.

80
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Let's head that way.

81
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,090
Drop your weapon.

82
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,470
Did you not hear me?!

83
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,560
Drop your knife.

EPISODE 5
DESPERATION

86
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,920
I said drop your knife!

87
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,010
For now, let's do what he says.

88
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,840
And what, die here in vain?

89
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,930
I'm saying let's not get carried away
by ill-advised bravery.

90
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,390
Not only are you quick to compromise,
but also quick to give up.

91
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,020
Call it quick judgment.

92
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,980
The ability to deal with crises

93
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,070
flexibly.

94
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,780
I can't believe you're laughing.

95
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,320
At least we escaped the creature.

96
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,990
I'm not so sure.

97
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,290
I wonder which creature is worse.

98
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,580
This is your final warning.

99
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,880
Drop your knife right now!

100
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,690
To die so recklessly
means to lose against them.

101
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,020
Drop it.

102
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,730
Surrender has never been an option for me.

103
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,030
I understand as I also hate losing,

104
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,190
so trust me and drop it.

105
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,070
My intention is not to die, but to live.

106
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,170
There are no survivors.

107
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,540
Is the 1st Military Police Squad all gone?

108
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,500
Yes. That's correct, sir.

109
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,990
Could it be

110
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,570
that it learned
how to operate the elevator?

111
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,500
How could you allow
something like this to happen?

112
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,040
My apologies.

113
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,790
We were attacked out of nowhere.

114
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,300
So, where is the specimen right now?

115
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,630
Rest assured, sir.

116
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,880
The elevator has already been shut down,

117
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,550
and machine gun crews are stationed
in all paths to the first-level basement.

118
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,270
We've also deployed combat units,
so the situation will be over soon.

119
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,020
Do you know what I hate the most?

120
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,940
Problems occurring when they shouldn't.

121
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,240
And what I hate more than that
is failing to fix such problems.

122
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,900
Forgive me, sir.

123
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,160
Apologizing helplessly and pathetically
without a plan to fix the problem

124
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,540
is what failures do, Mr. Soma.

125
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,170
Take care of it before something
even more annoying arises.

126
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,500
Understood?

127
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,630
Yes, sir!

128
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,970
We have captured an intruder, sir.

129
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,060
Look who we have here.

130
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,110
The young master of the Bugang Company.

131
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,360
I have heard
that you're quite a troublemaker.

132
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,660
It seems you're in big trouble now.

133
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,910
Did Jang Tae-sang
of Golden Treasure tag along?

134
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,830
This has nothing to do with them.

135
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,710
Don't tell me...

136
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,000
you're a rebel too?

137
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,720
I'd rather you didn't tell my old man.

138
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,810
Don't get smart with me.
You're in the wrong place for that.

139
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,100
It doesn't matter whose son you are.

140
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,360
That is to say, no one will care
should you die in here.

141
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,240
Understood?

142
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,830
Take him to the laboratory.

143
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,910
Yes, sir!

144
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,630
The timing couldn't have been better.
The hospital's funds were running short.

145
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,760
Teach him a hard lesson,
but not enough to kill him.

146
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,220
Get in.

147
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,070
Open this door! Open it!

148
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,780
Open the door.

149
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,070
Let go!

150
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,150
Keep still!

151
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,450
Sir!

152
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,200
What is it?

153
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,950
The disease control platoon sent word.

154
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,330
Two intruders caught on the second level
are being taken to Colonel Kato.

155
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,510
Who are they?

156
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Intruders who have snuck
into the building.

157
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,110
Master Jang?

158
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,490
Is that Master Jang?

159
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,910
That's Master Jang.

160
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,120
Shut it!

161
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,130
This one is coming with me.

162
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,340
- Bring him.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,630
Where are you taking me? What about her?

164
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,550
Don't move!

165
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,680
Get your hands off her!

166
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,190
What? Is she your woman or something?

167
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,190
Let's go.

168
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,810
Stay where you are.
I'll find you no matter what.

169
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,240
I'll come for you!

170
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,110
I promise!

171
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,780
<i>The creature may be
more intelligent than expected.</i>

172
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,240
<i>It knows how to use the elevator...</i>

173
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,450
<i>and it's been more than an hour
since we lost sight of it.</i>

174
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,720
I wonder what it is that it's after.

175
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,650
We just apprehended the intruders.
It seems that they've seen the specimen.

176
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,160
Now, let's talk, shall we?

177
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,410
Why did you sneak in here?

178
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,420
What is your purpose?

179
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,750
I'm looking for someone.

180
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,380
Speaking the Joseon tongue
is prohibited, Josenjing.

181
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,840
I order you to speak in Japanese.

182
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,310
So it's illegal for a Joseon person
to speak the Joseon language,

183
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,770
but it's legal for you to do
what you're doing here?

184
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
Speak

185
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,030
in

186
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,910
Japanese.

187
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,080
If you can't understand me,
bring someone who speaks my language.

188
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,370
You seem more desperate, after all.

189
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,510
Now, why don't we start over?

190
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,760
Why did you sneak in here?

191
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,900
<i>What do you want to know?</i>

192
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,190
I'm sure you heard the news
about the Bombing of Tokyo.

193
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,940
Well,

194
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,400
through the grapevine, sure.

195
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,740
That being said,

196
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,830
I don't intend to return to Tokyo
even after the war ends.

197
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,000
My wife and child
share an affection for Gyeongseong.

198
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,620
They wish to keep living here.

199
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,460
So?

200
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,340
A settlement fund of 300 yen,
a house to live in,

201
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,300
and a store about ten <i>pyeong</i> big.

202
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,220
Provide me with these,
and I'll let you leave this place alive.

203
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,610
Why should I agree to those terms?

204
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,530
Because you already owe me once
for your life.

205
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,280
May we take a look inside the cart?

206
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,630
Is there anything else
you'd like to check?

207
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,510
No. I apologize for the trouble,
Mr. Sachimoto.

208
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,350
<i>Frankly, I was quite taken aback.</i>

209
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,930
I knew you were here for Akiko,

210
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,850
but I didn't expect you
to help the kids escape.

211
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,770
Anyway, where is Myeong-ja?

212
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,030
Give up.

213
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,910
Leaving with her is impossible now.

214
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,740
Your plan has failed.

215
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,410
Why is the underground prison
filled with Joseon people?

216
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,500
What are you doing
with those innocent women and children?

217
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,130
And what about that horrifying creature?

218
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,340
Why have you created such a thing?

219
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,350
Have you actually been running
biological experiments on people?

220
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,140
I take it...

221
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,400
that you're rejecting my offer.

222
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,360
What about Yoon Chae-ok?

223
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,740
Where is the woman that was with me?

224
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,250
That must hurt.

225
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,550
Look at that.

226
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,190
If you want to live,
accept my terms and save yourself!

227
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,980
If I do leave here,
I'll be a dead man anyway.

228
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,610
So tell me where Akiko
and Yoon Chae-ok are being kept...

229
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,700
or we won't have a deal.

230
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,880
Why did you come in here?

231
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,000
What is your purpose?

232
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,720
Answer me right now!

233
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,310
Screw you.

234
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,400
Come grab her.

235
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,270
I know quite well

236
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,690
how to deal with girls like you.

237
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,610
Answer me, Josenjing!

238
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,580
You may be able to violate me by force...

239
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,920
but that doesn't mean you win.

240
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,510
Do you still not understand?

241
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,720
Bitch.

242
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,680
You're dead!

243
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,680
Stop!

244
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,110
That's enough, First Sergeant Haneda.

245
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,030
No, sir.
I'll make sure she learns a lesson.

246
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,570
Can't you see?

247
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,200
You have already lost.

248
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,300
<i>You were right.</i>

249
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,890
<i>Just when you think</i>

250
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,850
<i>the cherry blossoms
have bloomed splendidly,</i>

251
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,810
<i>they begin to fall.</i>

252
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,790
Mrs. Nawol!

253
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,580
What about Master Jang? Has he returned?

254
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,550
He's not back yet?

255
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,020
You seem to have stayed up all night.

256
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,780
Mm-hmm.

257
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,950
You seem to have gone out
very late last night.

258
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,330
Yes.

259
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,860
Have a seat.

260
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,320
I came as soon as I received your message.

261
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,330
What on Earth is going on?

262
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,950
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Water, please.

263
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,590
Your immature son
has gotten himself into big trouble.

264
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,760
Last night, he was caught trespassing
in Ongseong Hospital.

265
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,520
I am deeply ashamed
that he's caused such inconvenience.

266
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,390
Inconvenience is an understatement.

267
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,610
The situation is quite serious.

268
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,530
Not only did he trespass...

269
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,530
I heard he's a rebel.

270
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,000
If things go wrong, your son

271
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,170
and the Bugang Company
could both end up in danger.

272
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,150
So, you're a rebel?

273
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,150
What is it that you lot want?

274
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,650
Joseon's independence.

275
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,120
Something like that?

276
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,980
To be honest,

277
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,360
torture isn't my cup of tea.

278
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,780
It's exhausting, unpleasant, and messy.

279
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,620
It'd be much neater

280
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,700
to put you on the table
and crack your head open

281
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,170
or slice open your stomach.

282
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,180
Write down the names
of your fellow intruders

283
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,890
and the exact purpose of your intrusion.

284
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,110
You have an hour.

285
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,900
If you don't write it down in an hour,
you'll find yourself

286
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,450
lying face-up on that dissection table.

287
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,040
Joseon's independence, huh?

288
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,090
Will you ever grow up?

289
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,960
Are you even aware
of who the Bugang Company leeches off of?

290
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,930
Foolish bastard.

291
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,150
If you do reach the underground prison,
please find my little brother too.

292
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,780
His name is Oh Sang-deok.

293
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,700
<i>There is a black, thumb-sized mole
next to his right ear.</i>

294
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,760
Why do you do that to yourself?

295
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,650
Do you think getting wasted
will solve your problems?

296
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,620
But I feel better now that I've thrown up.

297
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,740
Your family called several times
from Anguk-dong.

298
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,830
You should call it a night and go home.

299
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Tae-sang.

300
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,050
I'm so ashamed of my father.

301
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,100
I'm ashamed of how well-off he's become
from betraying his country.

302
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,810
And I hate myself
for living lavishly thanks to that.

303
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,570
The very people who groveled
at my father's feet for crumbs

304
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,740
also pointed fingers at us
and badmouthed us behind our backs.

305
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,120
I was so ashamed of that.

306
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,580
That's why I beat the hell out of everyone

307
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,340
who pointed their fingers at you.

308
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,970
You really were something, even back then.

309
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:52,300
You threw the best punches
yet refused to lead a gang of your own.

310
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,560
Because making a living
was the most important thing for me.

311
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,850
You're smart.

312
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,060
You're competent.

313
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,110
So why are you running a pawnshop?

314
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,900
Because it suits my taste,

315
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,280
and I'm good at it.

316
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,830
As a man,

317
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,580
do you truly have no desire
to serve a bigger cause?

318
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,920
You really are persistent.

319
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,960
Aren't you tired of saying that
for the past ten years?

320
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,800
Well, you're a good man.

321
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,930
My sincerity, my patriotism,
my everything.

322
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,140
You're the only friend
who recognizes them.

323
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,570
So join us at the Patriotic Society,
Tae-sang!

324
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,280
Go away. The smell of alcohol
is ruining my new suit.

325
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,740
Let's burn for our country
and go out like a passionate flame, okay?

326
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,950
I said no.

327
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,460
I'm going to live a long, cold life.

328
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,460
Damn it.

329
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
Hey!

330
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,130
Tae-sang! I'm not done with you yet.

331
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,230
I guess even the filthy-rich master
of the House of Golden Treasure

332
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,070
can't escape prison.

333
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,820
You didn't care to grease
some big shot's palm with your fortune?

334
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,490
How did someone like you end up here?

335
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,490
I know, right?

336
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,330
This is all because of Myeong-ja.

337
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,830
Wait, no.

338
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,250
Not Myeong-ja. Is it because of Ishikawa?

339
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,670
No.

340
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,920
Maybe that wife of his?

341
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,840
Look.

342
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,850
Did you come in with Comrade Kwon?

343
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,430
I don't deserve
to be mentioned alongside him.

344
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,900
He's risking his life for a nobler cause
than rescuing a nobody like Myeong-ja.

345
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,150
They say that human lives
are so common and trivial,

346
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,740
yet it scares me
to think about losing mine.

347
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,960
My goodness, I rambled on for a bit there.

348
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,300
I should stop running my mouth
and start preparing to get out of here.

349
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,760
What do you mean?

350
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,300
How are you going to escape?

351
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,510
I'm Jang Tae-sang.

352
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,390
Did you really think
the filthy-rich master of Golden Treasure

353
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,600
came in here
without greasing anyone's palm?

354
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,110
From now on, grant me these three things.

355
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,070
First, send word to Mrs. Nawol
of the House of Golden Treasure.

356
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,000
Hello?

357
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,840
Pardon?

358
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,920
Yes, this is Mrs. Nawol speaking.

359
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,760
This is a message from Master Jang.

360
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,550
Listen carefully.

361
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:19,930
Go ahead.

362
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,260
What's your second request?

363
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,770
Remove all guards and sentries
from the prison.

364
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,020
You two, follow me.

365
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,690
Right now, sir?

366
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,780
It's about the specimen
on the fourth-level basement.

367
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,400
Shut up and follow me!

368
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,070
Yes, sir.

369
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,870
Hey, you!

370
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,330
You too.

371
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,460
Yes, sir.

372
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,310
Let us come with you!

373
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,360
Take us with you.

374
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,280
Master Jang, don't abandon us.
Take us too!

375
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,900
Save us, Master Jang. Save us!

376
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,570
Save us, Master Jang.

377
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,790
- Master Jang...
- Just wait 30 minutes.

378
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,710
I'll be back.

379
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,920
How do you expect us to believe that?

380
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,040
What if you don't come back?

381
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,460
You seem to have a bit of a trust issue.

382
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,590
I promise to come back,

383
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,430
so don't do anything
and stay put until I do.

384
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,640
Okay.

385
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,770
- Master Jang.
- Master Jang! Where are you going?

386
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,020
The third request is too much.

387
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,980
You could die.

388
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,570
I'll decide for myself
whether I die or not.

389
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,780
Yoon Chae-ok.

390
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,990
Where is she?

391
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,210
Do you need this?

392
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,730
Thank you.

393
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,730
I don't speak the Joseon tongue.

394
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,990
I was stationed in Manchuria.

395
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,370
With the disease control platoon?

396
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,910
Did you bring that creature
from there as well?

397
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,460
You...

398
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,460
Are you with the Resistance?

399
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,050
I was on the search for my mother
who'd gone missing ten years ago.

400
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,760
While searching for her,

401
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,640
I found out what you people did
on Manwol Island.

402
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,100
I never expected
to hear about Manwol Island here.

403
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,440
Why did you bring the creature
all the way to Gyeongseong?

404
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,030
Because of my sincere curiosity
and passion as a scientist

405
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,530
and my affection for my creation.

406
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,540
You know,

407
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,080
for those complex reasons.

408
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,130
By the way,

409
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,350
have we met before?

410
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,390
I'm certain

411
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,940
that I know those eyes from somewhere.

412
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,200
Tell me,

413
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,200
what was the name of your lost mother?

414
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,790
Choi Seong-sim.

415
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,920
Seishin.

416
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,190
Your name.

417
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,770
Choi...

418
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,070
Seong-sim.

419
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,990
Seishin.

420
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,330
But

421
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,670
why do you ask for my mother's name?

422
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,760
How was it in person? My specimen.

423
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,810
It was horrifying.

424
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:18,930
Did you perhaps

425
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,400
feel anything else
when you faced the specimen?

426
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,110
Not really.

427
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,940
I was too busy running away
to feel anything else.

428
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,360
It seemed like it existed only to attack.

429
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,370
Now it's your turn to answer.

430
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,130
Why did you ask for my mother's name?

431
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
Do you...

432
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,380
know my mother, by any chance?

433
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,480
Your Japanese is quite good.

434
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,560
Why did you suffer needlessly back there?

435
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,980
Even if I had answered in Japanese...

436
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,780
nothing would've changed.

437
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,740
I see.

438
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,920
- Take her away.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,350
Don't touch her
without my explicit permission.

440
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,980
If you disobey my orders,

441
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,320
you will be demoted to an infantryman.

442
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,690
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

443
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,510
Just wait.

444
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,510
I'm going to kill you with my own hands.

445
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,100
I'd like to see you try it.

446
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,680
Inferior soldier.

447
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,150
"Inferior soldier"?

448
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,310
"Inferior soldier"!

449
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,650
"Inferior soldier."

450
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:13,860
Shut up.

451
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,740
Do you have a death wish?

452
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,660
Officer Asano would like to see you, sir.

453
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:23,720
My son may be immature at times,
but I've no brother and he's the only son.

454
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,510
He is to carry on the family name.

455
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,020
Please have mercy
and forgive him just this once.

456
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,730
I beg of you, Dr. Ichiro!

457
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,990
You put me in a difficult position.

458
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,370
We'll see what happens.

459
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,130
Did you put in the right amount?

460
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:57,630
Yes, sir.

461
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,970
I did as you instructed.

462
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,060
<i>He's a fickle man.
We will need to prepare alternative plans.</i>

463
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,190
Yes, sir.

464
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,020
Why don't you leave that up to us?

465
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,870
Aren't you
from the House of Golden Treasure?

466
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,450
Yes.

467
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:31,040
And we just got ahold of a plan
to save Master Kwon.

468
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:05,920
I MISS YOU, CHAE-OK
MY DEAR DAUGHTER

469
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,900
<i>Have we met before?</i>

470
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,360
I know those eyes from somewhere.

471
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,410
What was the name of your lost mother?

472
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,510
<i>I want</i>

473
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,970
<i>to live.</i>

474
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,440
<i>I want to live...</i>

475
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,940
<i>so I can see you.</i>

476
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,910
<i>My dear daughter.</i>

477
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:19,750
I MISS YOU, CHAE-OK
MY DEAR DAUGHTER

478
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,880
Chae-ok.

479
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,450
Mother.

480
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,670
I'm starving.

481
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,420
What time is it?

482
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,800
We still have an hour left.

483
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,110
- It's the real deal!
- What is it?

484
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,910
Caramel?

485
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,240
Why is something so valuable
rolling around in here?

486
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,160
There's another one here.

487
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,140
Hey, are you all right?

488
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,810
What's wrong? Are you hurt? Ms. Yoon!

489
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:14,700
What happened?

490
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:16,490
What's wrong?

491
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,790
My mother was here.

492
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:22,910
Your mother?

493
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,750
I MISS YOU, CHAE-OK
MY DEAR DAUGHTER

494
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,170
Your mother was here?

495
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,510
She might still be here.

496
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,430
I get where you're coming from,
but we're in a bad spot. Why don't we...

497
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,190
You move according to your plan.

498
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,730
I'll move on my own from now on.

499
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,730
Where will you even go?

500
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,490
Now that I know my mother is here,
I can't just leave.

501
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,490
I'm going to find her.

502
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,410
Look.

503
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,040
This place is swarming
with Japanese soldiers.

504
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,500
They are armed and searching for us.
And that's not all.

505
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,800
A mysterious creature is wreaking havoc.
What can you do by yourself?

506
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,090
Listen to me.
Why don't we get out of here for today?

507
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,430
I'll look for another way
to find out about your mother.

508
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,850
What are you going to do
if you run into the creature again?

509
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,060
How do you plan to fight it on your own?

510
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,940
And should something bad happen--

511
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,030
Thank you.

512
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,330
And I'm sorry
I can't stay with you until the end.

513
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:07,980
Must you really go?

514
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,150
Ten years.

515
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:17,030
For ten years, I've looked everywhere
in search of my mother.

516
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,950
And now I know she's here.

517
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,790
So I have to find her.

518
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:41,840
Stay alive.

You.

526
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,820
You know who Choi Seong-sim is, don't you?

527
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,200
Where is she?

528
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,960
Answer me!

529
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,880
Where is my mother right now?
