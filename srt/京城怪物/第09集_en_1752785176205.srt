00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,960
<i>We have conducted
extensive research and experimentation</i>

3
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,250
<i>on the limitations of the human body.</i>

4
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,980
<i>We discovered the existence of the Najin
during one of those experiments.</i>

5
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,950
So, it was all a coincidence?

6
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,290
It's like the Penicillium
that appeared in a petri dish.

7
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,340
Much like how that chance discovery
of mold changed the course

8
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,470
of the history of human diseases...

9
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,850
the discovery of the Najin will lead
humanity to the next level of evolution.

10
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,810
Are you referring to the healing ability?

11
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,850
Perhaps.

12
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,070
But we believe
it holds potential for more.

13
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,730
I see.

14
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,150
Thank you for the explanation.

15
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,290
Director Ichiro
will be returning to Japan soon.

16
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,130
You can take his place
in charge of Ongseong Hospital

17
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,710
and complete your ongoing experiments.

18
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,680
I will support you
by whatever means necessary.

19
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,270
I cannot guarantee how long it will take
or how much money will be needed.

20
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,230
Nothing is certain as of now.

21
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,900
That doesn't matter.

22
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,360
Seishin is what I want, after all.

23
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,450
Your job is to make her
obey me completely.

24
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,410
That's all you need to do.

25
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,430
Mr. Ishikawa.

26
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,600
So, it was you all along?

27
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,440
Have you been
wandering around in that state

28
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,650
killing people for the past three days?

29
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,070
Mr. Ishikawa.

30
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,000
What in the world happened to you, Akiko?

31
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,000
Help me, Mr. Ishikawa.

32
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,510
Go back to Ongseong Hospital.

33
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,270
You have murdered more than ten people.

34
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,150
You will be executed anyway, Akiko.

35
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,700
What about the baby?

36
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,320
Our baby--

37
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,450
Look at yourself!

38
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,660
How can you still expect me
to acknowledge that baby as my own?

39
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,250
Don't make things
any more difficult for me, Akiko.

40
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,560
Get in there yourself.

41
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,100
This is the last act of kindness
I can offer you.

42
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,570
Stop stalling and get in.

43
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Now!

44
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,210
What are you doing?

45
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,600
Commissioner!

46
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,020
Commissioner Ishikawa!

47
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,600
Get him to the car!

48
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,400
Commissioner! Stay with me!

51
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,160
Father.

52
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,290
I'm coming in.

53
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,490
<i>Chae-ok.</i>

54
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,460
<i>I'm heading over to where your mother is.</i>

55
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,500
Hey! Who goes there?

56
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Stop!

57
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,880
Stop or we'll shoot!

58
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,350
I am here to find my wife.

59
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,930
Go and tell the person named Kato

60
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,570
that the Seishin you are experimenting on
in the underground laboratory

61
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,440
is my wife.

62
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,120
<i>I am going to fulfill
my last duty as her husband.</i>

63
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,870
<i>So, Chae-ok,</i>

64
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,290
<i>go on with your life.</i>

65
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,670
<i>Please</i>

66
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,000
<i>cherish your life dearly.</i>

67
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,780
Colonel Kato, we brought the man.

68
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,670
You're Seishin's husband?

69
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,760
I am.

70
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,510
Let me meet my wife.

71
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,510
It's been ten years, correct?

72
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,430
How does it feel

73
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,900
to see your wife again

74
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,730
for the first time in ten years?

75
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,360
You evil bastards.

76
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,610
How...

77
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,450
How could you...

78
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,450
You sons of bitches!

79
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,500
Fucking bastards!

80
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,080
Let go of me! Let go!

81
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,210
Sons of bitches!

82
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,460
You bastards,
how could you do something like this?

83
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,050
How could you?!

84
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,550
We managed to calm it with food,

85
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,100
but what should we do now?
It's becoming violent again, sir.

86
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,930
I guess

87
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,310
there really is no other way
than to find its child.

88
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,420
<i>What do we do?</i>

89
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
We can't turn a blind eye.

90
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,970
Yet even if we were to help her,
there's not much we can do.

91
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,480
We'll have to think of a way.

92
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,520
You can't go back to Ongseong Hospital.

93
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,320
Don't even think about it, okay?

94
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,740
Look here!

95
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,080
Why in the world
would you do such evil things?

96
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,120
A hospital is where you treat people,
not do such damned things!

97
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,330
Well,

98
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm not really aware
of what goes on in there.

99
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,090
Now you know!
So try coming up with a plan!

100
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,680
As a so-called officer
of the police bureau,

101
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,970
you just discovered an illegal act!
Are you just going to sit there?

102
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,270
I just follow orders,
so even if I were to do something,

103
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,690
I wouldn't have any powers.

104
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,610
So you're powerless!

105
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,240
Does that give you an excuse
to go along with every wrong thing?

106
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,400
Excuse me--

107
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,780
You people might run things around here,

108
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,990
but there are things you should
and shouldn't do as human beings!

109
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,330
If you don't know where to draw the line,
can you call yourself human?

110
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,670
How are you any different from an animal?

111
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,130
You're right.

112
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,470
Let's keep the shop closed
until this situation is resolved.

113
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,720
It would also be safer
if we moved Mr. Gu somewhere else.

114
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,640
What is your plan?

115
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,520
When a problem arises,
you must nip it in the bud.

116
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,810
Master!

117
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,740
I saw exactly what's going on
in Ongseong Hospital.

118
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,370
What's happening in there is something
that shouldn't happen to any human being.

119
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,290
But I bet they will deny it
in front of the world

120
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,130
and say that they did no such thing,
that such things never even existed.

121
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,970
Myeong-ja killed so many people, but look,

122
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,010
not one paper covered the murders.

123
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,470
This is how they operate.

124
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,390
They cover things up
as if they never happened at all.

125
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,440
But sir--

126
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,060
As you said,
there are clear rights and wrongs.

127
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,190
If we turn a blind eye
because it doesn't seem to concern us now,

128
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,070
then the same thing
will eventually happen to all of us.

129
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Tell us.

130
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,210
What can we do to help?

131
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,220
I'm afraid there isn't much
that we can do.

132
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,680
The wounds on his face
and carotid arteries are too wide and deep

133
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,020
for us to stop the bleeding.

134
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,690
- We will do our best.
- Stop the bleeding!

135
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,810
- But if the bleeding continues...
- More gauze! Now!

136
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,110
I'm terribly sorry to say this,

137
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,820
but he may not survive the night,
Lady Maeda.

138
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,450
Oh, well, that is unfortunate.

139
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,280
Pardon?

140
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,950
Anyways,

141
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,290
take good care of my husband, please.

142
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,330
Good night.

143
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,060
Found it.

144
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,250
Lady Maeda, a message from Mr. Shiro.

145
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,210
What were you doing?

146
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,510
You know,

147
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,680
just watching.

148
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,450
The world seems so peaceful
from up here, doesn't it?

149
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,700
There's no pain,

150
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,040
no death...

151
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,370
and no unjustness.

152
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,920
It's all so quiet.

153
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,300
It's hard to see through the darkness now,

154
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,140
but I'm sure that everyone

155
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,560
is holding their breath,
waiting for the night to pass.

156
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,940
What about Myeong-ja?

157
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,070
What happened to her?

158
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,440
It seems she was taken back
to Ongseong Hospital.

159
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,780
And Ishikawa seems to have been
seriously injured in the ordeal.

160
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,920
So Father and Myeong-ja
are both back in that hospital.

161
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,760
Could it be that...

162
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,310
we'll never be able to stop
what they are doing?

163
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Will you come with me?

164
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,950
I have something to show you.

165
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,550
What is all this?

166
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,300
This is my collection.

167
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,520
Some things were pawned
and never reclaimed,

168
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,480
and others I bought from time to time.

169
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,480
That's the nature of a pawnshop.

170
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,980
Every item that comes in
has its own story.

171
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,240
Yes.

172
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,990
That gramophone belonged to Wang Su-bok,
the courtesan from Pyeongyang.

173
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,660
And...

174
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,080
that coat hanging over there,

175
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,920
Mr. Yun Dong-ju pawned it so he could buy
his fellow students some food,

176
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,710
but he didn't make it back to reclaim it.

177
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,010
And this is Na Hye-seok's work.

178
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,930
She is a genius who had her work
shown at the Joseon Art Exhibition.

179
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,520
I suppose living as an artist
is not all smooth sailing.

180
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,230
Mrs. Nawol chided me for paying too much
for a painting of little value,

181
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,690
but I like her drawings.

182
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,700
I have a few more of her pieces, actually.

183
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,670
Could you

184
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,790
give me your hand?

185
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,360
I bought this silver bracelet
from an American missionary.

186
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,370
Embedded in the middle
is a thing called an opal.

187
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,660
I heard it is considered
a lucky stone in Europe.

188
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,830
There.

189
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,710
You will only experience good luck
from now on.

190
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,770
I have many more interesting items.

191
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,440
We can look through them later,
whenever we have time.

192
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,440
Let's

193
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,440
make a promise to each other.

194
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,530
If either of us ends up dying
before the other...

195
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,170
whoever remains has to remember...

196
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,130
the other person.

197
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
What do you think?

198
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,480
I don't feel that sad about dying...

199
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,280
but if no one in this world remembers
even a trace of my existence...

200
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,780
that would make me feel...

201
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,660
a little lonesome.

202
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,250
I'm sorry, but it won't come to that.

203
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,130
Because the two of us

204
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,930
will be together,
even through the good times.

205
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,690
Do you really think...

206
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
those good times will come to us?

207
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,620
They will.

208
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,080
I will make sure...

209
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,380
that they come to us.

210
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,420
So--

211
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,270
Stay with me.

212
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,280
Stay...

213
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,910
right by my side.

214
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,660
Be safe.

215
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,700
Take care of yourself.

216
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,810
Keep watch over the shop.

217
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,890
Don't forget to lock the doors.

218
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,600
I will. Goodbye.

219
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,530
Tae-sang!

220
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
You're safe.

221
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,410
Thank goodness.

222
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,750
What a relief.

223
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,360
My sincere condolences.

224
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,410
I'm afraid I have no choice, Mr. Ishikawa.

225
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,580
I must do this to keep my position here.

226
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,500
Please direct your resentment
toward Lady Maeda.

227
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,460
This is all according to her will.

228
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,210
No...

229
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
No...

230
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,890
Help me...

231
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,910
I would like my husband's death
to be more honorable.

232
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,870
A commissioner of the Government-General

233
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,210
murdered by a Joseon-born courtesan.

234
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,260
Imagine how shameful that would be
for the police bureau as well.

235
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,010
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,680
COMMISSIONER ISHIKAWA DIES
WHILE ARRESTING JOSEON-BORN SERIAL KILLER

237
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,020
Ishikawa died early this morning.

238
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,860
A Joseon person
becomes the offender once again.

239
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,570
It's always the same pattern, isn't it?

240
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,030
They hide, fabricate, and distort
the facts to cover up their wrongdoings.

241
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,700
And if that doesn't work, they will turn
their swords to the Joseon people again.

242
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,080
Think about the KantÅ earthquake.

243
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,750
What would they have done without us?

244
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,590
They blame us whenever something happens.

245
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,590
They will choose
one of two methods, as always.

246
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,380
Either take it out
on the innocent citizens...

247
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,430
Or take it out on us.

248
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,890
Why us? What crime have we committed?

249
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,190
The crime of knowing too much, I suppose.

250
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,400
About the underground lab in the hospital,
what occurred there, and even Myeong-ja.

251
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,950
So, what's your plan?

252
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
Tell me.

253
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,250
I know you called me here at this hour
because you have a plan in mind.

254
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,090
I now have someone I'd like to protect.

255
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,590
That's why...

256
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm thinking of putting my neck
on the line as well.

257
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,810
<i>Do you know what I really fear?</i>

258
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,610
<i>Having a dream</i>

259
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,110
<i>in this hopeless world.</i>

260
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,750
Director Ichiro, have a safe trip back.

261
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,800
Comrade Kwon.

262
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,030
<i>I fear that my resolve will grow weak
because of that vain hope,</i>

263
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,070
<i>that I might hesitate and falter
to do what must be done.</i>

264
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,910
<i>That is what I fear.</i>

265
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
<i>And so I bid you goodbye.</i>

266
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,510
<i>Thank you.</i>

267
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,010
<i>Thank you, Master Jang.</i>

268
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,480
<i>I'll always remember you.</i>

269
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,480
Wait, hold on!

270
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,770
So long.

271
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,020
Stop!

272
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,490
<i>You know what?</i>

273
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,370
<i>What I fear the most</i>

274
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,370
<i>is losing those I do not wish to lose.</i>

275
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,330
<i>Director Ichiro has been shot!</i>

276
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,170
<i>Get her!</i>

277
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,480
What did you just say?

278
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,530
With the dynamite you have,

279
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,070
how many bombs can you make?

280
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,700
Why do you ask?

281
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,200
Do you wish to join the rebellion?

282
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,750
Unfortunately, the Bumingwan event
won't be happening.

283
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,460
What?

284
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,380
It appears Ishikawa's funeral ceremony
will be hosted by the Government-General.

285
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,380
The Bumingwan event
has been delayed indefinitely.

286
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,550
Is this confirmed?

287
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,300
We've heard nothing of this
from our sources yet.

288
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,010
This intel came from within,
so I'm sure of it.

289
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,810
I will vouch for its accuracy
and trustworthiness.

290
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,980
In any case,
why did you ask about the bombs?

291
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,650
The rebellion is all but lost now.

292
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,280
I was hoping to use those bombs first.

293
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,400
So you're not here to give us a hand,
but to take the bombs for yourself.

294
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,320
Forget it. I've heard quite enough.

295
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,240
Please leave.

296
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,120
How do you plan on using the bombs?

297
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,250
- Comrade Lee.
- Ongseong Hospital.

298
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,460
My plan...

299
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,720
is to wipe it off the map.

300
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Colonel Kato!

301
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,640
Sir!

302
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,790
We have a problem, Master Jang.

303
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300
It's about that sleuth, Yoon Chae-ok.

304
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,470
She's caused some trouble.

305
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,780
What happened? Where is the specimen?

306
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,030
We can't see it.

307
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:02,120
We've been watching for almost an hour,
but there has been no movement.

308
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,880
And the elevator?

309
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,090
It's been shut down.

310
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,010
It's the only way
to get to the upper floors,

311
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,970
which means the specimen
should still be down there.

312
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,650
What do you mean by that?

313
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,480
Chae-ok has disappeared? Where to?

314
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,110
We don't know either.

315
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,780
After that woman shot Director Ichiro,

316
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,700
the officers nearby
chased after her immediately,

317
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,830
but then she vanished.

318
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,870
Officers from Jongno Station
and the police bureau

319
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,580
are searching for her
from Bonjeong to Jongno,

320
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,040
but she's nowhere to be found.

321
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,300
They have just ordered
a search of your shop as well.

322
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,930
- Find her!
- Yes, sir!

323
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,600
Hurry! Search the place!

324
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,850
Yes, sir!

325
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,600
What are you doing?

326
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,330
<i>The situation is</i>

327
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,160
turning from bad to worse.

328
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,120
This could be the last time I can give you

329
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,920
information like this, Mr. Jang.

330
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,510
Thank you.

331
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,430
What you just told me was very helpful.

332
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,850
You should go.

333
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,810
It'd be best to keep your distance
from me for a while.

334
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,310
Do you understand?

335
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,070
Be careful, Mr. Jang!

336
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,740
There is an invisible hand

337
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,870
that controls everything.

338
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,590
How could you let this happen
as the police chief?

339
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:23,130
A shooting in broad daylight
in front of Lady Maeda's house

340
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,470
while she's in mourning?

341
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:28,640
My sincerest apologies!
We should have been more vigilant.

342
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,390
This is not only
an act of provocation toward us all,

343
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,190
but a clear act of terrorism.

344
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,900
You must find out who's behind it at once!

345
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:44,950
Take this opportunity to wipe out
all seditious Joseon-borns in Gyeongseong.

346
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,620
Anyone who is a nuisance
should be dealt with!

347
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,080
- That's right!
- Yes!

348
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,580
- We can't let this go on.
- Let's dispose of them!

349
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,330
Hello?

350
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,460
Shiro?

351
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,550
What is going on?

352
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,260
You promised you would leave
the House of Golden Treasure alone!

353
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,600
You said I just needed to tell you
where the sleuth woman was.

354
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,110
But officers just came
and turned this place upside down!

355
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,440
No, I can't do this anymore.

356
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,320
I quit. Just give me my money.

357
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,040
You promised to put me
on a ship bound for Tokyo.

358
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,450
This is not the time.

359
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,790
We'll talk later.

360
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,330
Hello?

361
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,520
Mr. Gu...

362
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,650
Is it still not moving?

363
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,980
No, sir.

364
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:06,780
Throw it some prey.

365
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,160
We're out of test subjects, sir.

366
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,530
We still have one left.

367
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,840
Hey. Come out.

368
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,270
Hey!

369
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,100
Hey!

370
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Help me out.

371
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,600
Yukiko Maeda?

372
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,100
Dear me.

373
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,020
You already know who I am,

374
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

375
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,450
This is strange.

376
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:19,040
The Japanese officers
have suddenly quieted down.

377
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,550
Papers! Get your papers.

378
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,840
Papers!

379
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,890
Get your papers!

380
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,470
Papers!

381
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,060
And the Jongno Police Station?

382
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,520
They don't seem to have found
the whereabouts of Yoon Chae-ok either.

383
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,400
Then why have they gone so quiet?

384
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,110
Normally, they would have turned
Bonjeong and Jongno upside down by now.

385
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,410
Whatever it is, I find it quite different
from how it used to be.

386
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,450
They're also keeping quiet
about Ichiro's death.

387
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,460
Master.

388
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,130
Mrs. Nawol. How did it go?

389
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,880
It went well.

390
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,220
But I think you need to head downstairs.

391
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,970
You have a visitor.

392
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Well then,

393
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,260
I'll leave you two alone.

394
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:15,530
What brings her here?

395
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:16,700
I'm not sure.

396
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,780
They're just sitting there
without much to say.

397
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,540
Wait, I don't see Beom-o.
Where could he have gone?

398
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,120
Forget about him.

399
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,290
He's not coming back.

400
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,100
That woman, Mrs. Nawol,

401
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,970
is she trustworthy?

402
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,600
She's been like family
since I was a child.

403
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,400
Just because they're like family
doesn't mean you can trust them.

404
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:00,700
You shouldn't trust people so easily.

405
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,370
They don't betray you
because they are evil.

406
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,330
They betray you because they are weak.

407
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:12,580
And most human beings are weak.

408
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,970
What is the reason for this visit?

409
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,100
So, don't bother waiting.

410
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,730
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok will not be coming back.

411
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,310
What do you mean?

412
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,650
I just told you.

413
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,690
Betrayal is caused not by evil,
but by weakness.

414
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,780
That woman wasn't strong enough

415
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,410
to stay by your side.

416
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,750
Do you know where she is?

417
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,000
Where is she?

418
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,460
Lady Maeda!

419
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,340
She is dead.

420
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,800
And guess what.

421
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,270
I liked you much better
before you went to Ongseong Hospital.

422
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,440
You clearly differentiated
what would bring you profit versus loss.

423
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,190
Simple-minded.

424
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,860
Hence, powerful.

425
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,530
Please

426
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,240
return to your former self.

427
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,660
Forget about Ishikawa, Akiko,
and Ongseong Hospital.

428
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,250
Even Yoon Chae-ok.

429
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,830
Forget all about that woman.

430
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,250
Just live your life like before,

431
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,880
as if nothing had ever happened.

432
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,140
Do that, and you
and the House of Golden Treasure

433
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,060
will be safe.

434
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,850
<i>Be careful, Mr. Jang!</i>

435
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,480
There is an invisible hand

436
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,780
that controls everything.

437
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,150
How did you find out?

438
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,620
I pulled every string

439
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,500
in Bonjeong and Jongno,
but couldn't even find a trace of her,

440
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,580
so how...

441
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:20,210
how is it that you know about her death?

442
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,670
If it wasn't for me,

443
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,100
you would have been arrested already.

444
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,060
The fact that you were close
with the woman who shot Director Ichiro

445
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,060
is enough to classify you as seditious.

446
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,310
So,

447
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,780
don't do anything dangerous anymore,

448
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,440
Mr. Jang.

449
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,360
Where is Yoon Chae-ok?

450
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,910
I told you. She is dead.

451
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,830
Then let me see her body.

452
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,040
Stop...

453
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,710
disappointing me.

454
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,710
I don't want us to become enemies.

455
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,000
Yoon Chae-ok!

456
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,670
Where is she?

457
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:12,100
You will never see her again.

458
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,840
I don't care what you've done.
I will find her.

459
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,970
Whether she's dead or not,
I will find her, no matter what!

460
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,810
Are you saying you plan to go against me?

461
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,400
How can someone like me
possibly be a match for you?

462
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:10,400
You're a Japanese citizen with power
from a mighty family--

463
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,070
If you know that, stay quiet.

464
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,160
You'll be safe that way.

465
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,330
Even so!

466
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,370
This is about Yoon Chae-ok.

467
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,880
I may run a petty pawnshop,

468
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,630
I may have lived a life without pride

469
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,340
doing all sorts of crap so I could get by,
but for once in my life,

470
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,600
I wanted to protect her,
even if I had to give up all that I have.

471
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,850
So?

472
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,100
Just how will you go against me?

473
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,980
With what?

474
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:50,240
Not those pieces of trash
by your side, I hope.

475
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,320
Watch your mouth. They are my people!

476
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:58,080
Do you even know
how those people betrayed you?

477
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,620
That woman, Mrs. Nawol,
whom you consider family.

478
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,000
She ratted out your mother
a long time ago.

479
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,760
<i>My mother is in there too.</i>

480
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,590
Have you seen her?

481
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,260
Her name is Sim Sun-deok.

482
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,220
Do you know her?

483
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,850
No.

484
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,100
You haven't heard her name either?

485
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,440
I haven't.

486
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,200
SIM SUN-DEOK

487
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,460
That man, Gu Gap-pyeong,

488
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,670
recently betrayed you
in the police bureau's torture chamber.

489
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,180
I will...

490
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,270
tell you everything now.

491
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
Everything...

492
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,730
And that kid, Beom-o?

493
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,490
To find his mother who left him
and ran away to Japan when he was a kid,

494
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,700
he betrayed you.

495
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,870
He sold you out
for a cheap passage ticket,

496
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,580
even when you've treated him like family.

497
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,960
And your so-called friend?

498
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:32,380
<i>It took him only a few hours to confess
that you and your friends were key rebels.</i>

499
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,640
That's what humans do
when they are pathetically weak.

500
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,980
So desperate to save their own skin
that they forget the favors they received.

501
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,600
They have no morals.

502
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,940
And yet,

503
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,520
what did you say you'd do
with those pieces of trash?

504
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,400
You'd go against me?

505
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:59,740
When I'm the one working tirelessly
for you, even at this very moment?

506
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,040
You say you'll betray me?

507
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,000
Is that what you're saying, Mr. Jang?

508
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:19,800
Fine.

509
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,640
You may be right.

510
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:27,640
But

511
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:29,810
did you know?

512
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,150
None of those people

513
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,950
would have gone through those things

514
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,780
had the world been different.

515
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,200
If the world had been different,

516
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,750
they wouldn't have ended up in jail

517
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:52,340
and beaten to near death
so as to betray their friends.

518
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:57,380
They wouldn't have gotten burned
or had their nails plucked out.

519
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:02,140
And they wouldn't have had to give in,
give up the names of their friends,

520
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,720
and live the rest of their lives
wracked with guilt.

521
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,390
But despite all that,

522
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:12,110
they're fighting tooth and nail
and living with the pain

523
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,820
because they need to survive,
no matter how humiliating and shameful!

524
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,360
We have to survive,

525
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,490
or no one will remember
what we went through.

526
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:31,880
So don't you dare
call them pieces of trash.

527
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,550
Not a single one of them

528
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,300
deserves to be called such
by the likes of you.

529
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:55,770
So...

530
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,940
that's your choice.

531
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
Exactly.

532
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,200
This is my choice.

533
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,120
This is it for us.

534
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,670
Lady Maeda.

535
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,780
Let's go inside.

536
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,700
The night

537
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,450
is still cold.

538
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,780
Master!

539
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,150
Master!

540
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,990
Master.

541
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,080
What did I...

542
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,910
What did I just say out there?

543
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,380
You were being yourself.

544
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,090
You said everything there is to be said.

545
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,090
Just wait.

546
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,510
I will find the clues...

547
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,100
to Yoon Chae-ok's whereabouts...

548
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:02,150
before I die.

549
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,160
Tae-sang.

550
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,710
When did you find out?

551
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
That I...

552
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,130
gave up...

553
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,470
your mother's name?

554
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:34,720
It was...

555
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:42,070
a little after Mother passed away.

556
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:47,990
And you...

557
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,660
still

558
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,490
took me in?

559
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,340
Because I didn't think it was your fault.

560
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,020
Don't worry too much.

561
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,480
You know Mr. Gu.

562
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:25,320
Once he sets his mind on something,

563
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,360
he always comes back with a hint.

564
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:33,160
Let's wait.

565
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,620
What if it's true?

566
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,960
What if she really is dead?

567
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:13,200
Is the prey ready?

568
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,780
Lady Maeda sent us a Josenjing woman.
