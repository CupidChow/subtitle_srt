00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,960
<i>We have conducted
extensive research and experimentation</i>

3
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,250
<i>on the limitations of the human body.</i>

4
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,980
<i>We discovered the existence of the Najin
during one of those experiments.</i>

5
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,950
So, it was all a coincidence?

6
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,290
It's like the Penicillium
that appeared in a petri dish.

7
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,340
Much like how that chance discovery
of mold changed the course

8
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,470
of the history of human diseases...

9
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,850
the discovery of the Najin will lead
humanity to the next level of evolution.

10
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,810
Are you referring to the healing ability?

11
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,850
Perhaps.

12
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,070
But we believe
it holds potential for more.

13
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,730
I see.

14
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,150
Thank you for the explanation.

15
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,290
Director Ichiro
will be returning to Japan soon.

16
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,130
You can take his place
in charge of Ongseong Hospital

17
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,710
and complete your ongoing experiments.

18
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,680
I will support you
by whatever means necessary.

19
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,270
I cannot guarantee how long it will take
or how much money will be needed.

20
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,230
Nothing is certain as of now.

21
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,900
That doesn't matter.

22
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,360
Seishin is what I want, after all.

23
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,450
Your job is to make her
obey me completely.

24
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,410
That's all you need to do.

25
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,430
Mr. Ishikawa.

26
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,600
So, it was you all along?

27
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,440
Have you been
wandering around in that state

28
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,650
killing people for the past three days?

29
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,070
Mr. Ishikawa.

30
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,000
What in the world happened to you, Akiko?

31
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,000
Help me, Mr. Ishikawa.

32
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,510
Go back to Ongseong Hospital.

33
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,270
You have murdered more than ten people.

34
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,150
You will be executed anyway, Akiko.

35
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,700
What about the baby?

36
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,320
Our baby--

37
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,450
Look at yourself!

38
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,660
How can you still expect me
to acknowledge that baby as my own?

39
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,250
Don't make things
any more difficult for me, Akiko.

40
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,560
Get in there yourself.

41
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,100
This is the last act of kindness
I can offer you.

42
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,570
Stop stalling and get in.

43
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Now!

44
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,210
What are you doing?

45
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,600
Commissioner!

46
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,020
Commissioner Ishikawa!

47
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,600
Get him to the car!

48
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,400
Commissioner! Stay with me!

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Father.

52
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,290
I'm coming in.

53
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,490
<i>Chae-ok.</i>

54
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,460
<i>I'm heading over to where your mother is.</i>

55
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,500
Hey! Who goes there?

56
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Stop!

57
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,880
Stop or we'll shoot!

58
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,350
I am here to find my wife.

59
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,930
Go and tell the person named Kato

60
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,570
that the Seishin you are experimenting on
in the underground laboratory

61
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,440
is my wife.

62
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,120
<i>I am going to fulfill
my last duty as her husband.</i>

63
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,870
<i>So, Chae-ok,</i>

64
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,290
<i>go on with your life.</i>

65
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,670
<i>Please</i>

66
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,000
<i>cherish your life dearly.</i>

67
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,780
Colonel Kato, we brought the man.

68
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,670
You're Seishin's husband?

69
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,760
I am.

70
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,510
Let me meet my wife.

71
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,510
It's been ten years, correct?

72
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,430
How does it feel

73
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,900
to see your wife again

74
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,730
for the first time in ten years?

75
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,360
You evil bastards.

76
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,610
How...

77
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,450
How could you...

78
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,450
You sons of bitches!

79
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,500
Fucking bastards!

80
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,080
Let go of me! Let go!

81
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,210
Sons of bitches!

82
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,460
You bastards,
how could you do something like this?

83
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,050
How could you?!

84
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,550
We managed to calm it with food,

85
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,100
but what should we do now?
It's becoming violent again, sir.

86
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,930
I guess

87
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,310
there really is no other way
than to find its child.

88
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,420
<i>What do we do?</i>

89
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
We can't turn a blind eye.

90
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,970
Yet even if we were to help her,
there's not much we can do.

91
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,480
We'll have to think of a way.

92
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,520
You can't go back to Ongseong Hospital.

93
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,320
Don't even think about it, okay?

94
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,740
Look here!

95
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,080
Why in the world
would you do such evil things?

96
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,120
A hospital is where you treat people,
not do such damned things!

97
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,330
Well,

98
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,920
I'm not really aware
of what goes on in there.

99
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,090
Now you know!
So try coming up with a plan!

100
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,680
As a so-called officer
of the police bureau,

101
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,970
you just discovered an illegal act!
Are you just going to sit there?

102
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,270
I just follow orders,
so even if I were to do something,

103
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,690
I wouldn't have any powers.

104
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,610
So you're powerless!

105
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,240
Does that give you an excuse
to go along with every wrong thing?

106
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Excuse me--

107
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,780
You people might run things around here,

108
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,990
but there are things you should
and shouldn't do as human beings!

109
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,330
If you don't know where to draw the line,
can you call yourself human?

110
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,670
How are you any different from an animal?

111
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,130
You're right.

112
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,470
Let's keep the shop closed
until this situation is resolved.

113
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,720
It would also be safer
if we moved Mr. Gu somewhere else.

114
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,640
What is your plan?

115
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,520
When a problem arises,
you must nip it in the bud.

116
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,810
Master!

117
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,740
I saw exactly what's going on
in Ongseong Hospital.

118
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,370
What's happening in there is something
that shouldn't happen to any human being.

119
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,290
But I bet they will deny it
in front of the world

120
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,130
and say that they did no such thing,
that such things never even existed.

121
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,970
Myeong-ja killed so many people, but look,

122
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,010
not one paper covered the murders.

123
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,470
This is how they operate.

124
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,390
They cover things up
as if they never happened at all.

125
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,440
But sir--

126
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,060
As you said,
there are clear rights and wrongs.

127
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,190
If we turn a blind eye
because it doesn't seem to concern us now,

128
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,070
then the same thing
will eventually happen to all of us.

129
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Tell us.

130
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,210
What can we do to help?

131
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,220
I'm afraid there isn't much
that we can do.

132
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,680
The wounds on his face
and carotid arteries are too wide and deep

133
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,020
for us to stop the bleeding.

134
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,690
- We will do our best.
- Stop the bleeding!

135
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,810
- But if the bleeding continues...
- More gauze! Now!

136
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,110
I'm terribly sorry to say this,

137
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,820
but he may not survive the night,
Lady Maeda.

138
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,450
Oh, well, that is unfortunate.

139
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,280
Pardon?

140
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,950
Anyways,

141
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,290
take good care of my husband, please.

142
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,330
Good night.

143
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,060
Found it.

144
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,250
Lady Maeda, a message from Mr. Shiro.

145
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,210
What were you doing?

146
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,510
You know,

147
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,680
just watching.

148
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,450
The world seems so peaceful
from up here, doesn't it?

149
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,700
There's no pain,

150
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,040
no death...

151
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,370
and no unjustness.

152
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,920
It's all so quiet.

153
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,300
It's hard to see through the darkness now,

154
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,140
but I'm sure that everyone

155
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,560
is holding their breath,
waiting for the night to pass.

156
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,940
What about Myeong-ja?

157
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,070
What happened to her?

158
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,440
It seems she was taken back
to Ongseong Hospital.

159
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,780
And Ishikawa seems to have been
seriously injured in the ordeal.

160
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,920
So Father and Myeong-ja
are both back in that hospital.

161
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,760
Could it be that...

162
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,310
we'll never be able to stop
what they are doing?

163
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Will you come with me?

164
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,950
I have something to show you.

165
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,550
What is all this?

166
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,300
This is my collection.

167
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,520
Some things were pawned
and never reclaimed,

168
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,480
and others I bought from time to time.

169
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,480
That's the nature of a pawnshop.

170
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,980
Every item that comes in
has its own story.

171
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,240
Yes.

172
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,990
That gramophone belonged to Wang Su-bok,
the courtesan from Pyeongyang.

173
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,660
And...

174
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,080
that coat hanging over there,

175
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,920
Mr. Yun Dong-ju pawned it so he could buy
his fellow students some food,

176
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,710
but he didn't make it back to reclaim it.

177
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,010
And this is Na Hye-seok's work.

178
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,930
She is a genius who had her work
shown at the Joseon Art Exhibition.

179
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,520
I suppose living as an artist
is not all smooth sailing.

180
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,230
Mrs. Nawol chided me for paying too much
for a painting of little value,

181
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,690
but I like her drawings.

182
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,700
I have a few more of her pieces, actually.

183
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,670
Could you

184
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,790
give me your hand?

185
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,360
I bought this silver bracelet
from an American missionary.

186
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,370
Embedded in the middle
is a thing called an opal.

187
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,660
I heard it is considered
a lucky stone in Europe.

188
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,830
There.

189
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,710
You will only experience good luck
from now on.

190
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,770
I have many more interesting items.

191
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,440
We can look through them later,
whenever we have time.

192
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,440
Let's

193
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,440
make a promise to each other.

194
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,530
If either of us ends up dying
before the other...

195
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,170
whoever remains has to remember...

196
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,130
the other person.

197
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,380
What do you think?

198
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,480
I don't feel that sad about dying...

199
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,280
but if no one in this world remembers
even a trace of my existence...

200
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,780
that would make me feel...

201
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,660
a little lonesome.

202
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,250
I'm sorry, but it won't come to that.

203
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,130
Because the two of us

204
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,930
will be together,
even through the good times.

205
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,690
Do you really think...

206
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
those good times will come to us?

207
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,620
They will.

208
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,080
I will make sure...

209
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,380
that they come to us.

210
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,420
So--

211
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,270
Stay with me.

212
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,280
Stay...

213
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,910
right by my side.

214
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,660
Be safe.

215
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,700
Take care of yourself.

216
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,810
Keep watch over the shop.

217
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,890
Don't forget to lock the doors.

218
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,600
I will. Goodbye.

219
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,530
Tae-sang!

220
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,040
You're safe.

221
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,410
Thank goodness.

222
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,750
What a relief.

223
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,360
My sincere condolences.

224
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,410
I'm afraid I have no choice, Mr. Ishikawa.

225
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,580
I must do this to keep my position here.

226
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,500
Please direct your resentment
toward Lady Maeda.

227
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460
This is all according to her will.

228
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,210
No...

229
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,960
No...

230
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,890
Help me...

231
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,910
I would like my husband's death
to be more honorable.

232
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,870
A commissioner of the Government-General

233
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,210
murdered by a Joseon-born courtesan.

234
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,260
Imagine how shameful that would be
for the police bureau as well.

235
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,010
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,680
COMMISSIONER ISHIKAWA DIES
WHILE ARRESTING JOSEON-BORN SERIAL KILLER

237
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,020
Ishikawa died early this morning.

238
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,860
A Joseon person
becomes the offender once again.

239
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,570
It's always the same pattern, isn't it?

240
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,030
They hide, fabricate, and distort
the facts to cover up their wrongdoings.

241
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,700
And if that doesn't work, they will turn
their swords to the Joseon people again.

242
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,080
Think about the KantÅ earthquake.

243
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,750
What would they have done without us?

244
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,590
They blame us whenever something happens.

245
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,590
They will choose
one of two methods, as always.

246
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,380
Either take it out
on the innocent citizens...

247
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,430
Or take it out on us.

248
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,890
Why us? What crime have we committed?

249
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,190
The crime of knowing too much, I suppose.

250
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,400
About the underground lab in the hospital,
what occurred there, and even Myeong-ja.

251
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,950
So, what's your plan?

252
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Tell me.

253
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,250
I know you called me here at this hour
because you have a plan in mind.

254
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,090
I now have someone I'd like to protect.

255
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,590
That's why...

256
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm thinking of putting my neck
on the line as well.

257
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,810
<i>Do you know what I really fear?</i>

258
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,610
<i>Having a dream</i>

259
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,110
<i>in this hopeless world.</i>

260
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,750
Director Ichiro, have a safe trip back.

261
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,800
Comrade Kwon.

262
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,030
<i>I fear that my resolve will grow weak
because of that vain hope,</i>

263
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,070
<i>that I might hesitate and falter
to do what must be done.</i>

264
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,910
<i>That is what I fear.</i>

265
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
<i>And so I bid you goodbye.</i>

266
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,510
<i>Thank you.</i>

267
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,010
<i>Thank you, Master Jang.</i>

268
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,480
<i>I'll always remember you.</i>

269
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,480
Wait, hold on!

270
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,770
So long.

271
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Stop!

272
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,490
<i>You know what?</i>

273
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,370
<i>What I fear the most</i>

274
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,370
<i>is losing those I do not wish to lose.</i>

275
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,330
<i>Director Ichiro has been shot!</i>

276
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,170
<i>Get her!</i>

277
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,480
What did you just say?

278
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,530
With the dynamite you have,

279
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,070
how many bombs can you make?

280
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,700
Why do you ask?

281
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,200
Do you wish to join the rebellion?

282
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,750
Unfortunately, the Bumingwan event
won't be happening.

283
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,460
What?

284
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,380
It appears Ishikawa's funeral ceremony
will be hosted by the Government-General.

285
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,380
The Bumingwan event
has been delayed indefinitely.

286
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,550
Is this confirmed?

287
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,300
We've heard nothing of this
from our sources yet.

288
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,010
This intel came from within,
so I'm sure of it.

289
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,810
I will vouch for its accuracy
and trustworthiness.

290
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,980
In any case,
why did you ask about the bombs?

291
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,650
The rebellion is all but lost now.

292
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,280
I was hoping to use those bombs first.

293
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,400
So you're not here to give us a hand,
but to take the bombs for yourself.

294
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,320
Forget it. I've heard quite enough.

295
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,240
Please leave.

296
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,120
How do you plan on using the bombs?

297
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,250
- Comrade Lee.
- Ongseong Hospital.

298
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,460
My plan...

299
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,720
is to wipe it off the map.

300
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Colonel Kato!

301
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,640
Sir!

302
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,790
We have a problem, Master Jang.

303
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
It's about that sleuth, Yoon Chae-ok.

304
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,470
She's caused some trouble.

305
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,780
What happened? Where is the specimen?

306
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,030
We can't see it.

307
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:42,120
We've been watching for almost an hour,
but there has been no movement.

308
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,880
And the elevator?

309
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,090
It's been shut down.

310
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,010
It's the only way
to get to the upper floors,

311
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,970
which means the specimen
should still be down there.

312
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,650
What do you mean by that?

313
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,480
Chae-ok has disappeared? Where to?

314
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,110
We don't know either.

315
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,780
After that woman shot Director Ichiro,

316
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,700
the officers nearby
chased after her immediately,

317
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,830
but then she vanished.

318
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,870
Officers from Jongno Station
and the police bureau

319
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,580
are searching for her
from Bonjeong to Jongno,

320
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,040
but she's nowhere to be found.

321
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,300
They have just ordered
a search of your shop as well.

322
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,930
- Find her!
- Yes, sir!

323
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,600
Hurry! Search the place!

324
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,850
Yes, sir!

325
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,600
What are you doing?

326
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,330
<i>The situation is</i>

327
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,160
turning from bad to worse.

328
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,120
This could be the last time I can give you

329
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,920
information like this, Mr. Jang.

330
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,510
Thank you.

331
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,430
What you just told me was very helpful.

332
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,850
You should go.

333
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,810
It'd be best to keep your distance
from me for a while.

334
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,310
Do you understand?

335
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,070
Be careful, Mr. Jang!

336
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,740
There is an invisible hand

337
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,870
that controls everything.

338
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,590
How could you let this happen
as the police chief?

339
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,130
A shooting in broad daylight
in front of Lady Maeda's house

340
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,470
while she's in mourning?

341
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,640
My sincerest apologies!
We should have been more vigilant.

342
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,390
This is not only
an act of provocation toward us all,

343
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,190
but a clear act of terrorism.

344
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,900
You must find out who's behind it at once!

345
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:24,950
Take this opportunity to wipe out
all seditious Joseon-borns in Gyeongseong.

346
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,620
Anyone who is a nuisance
should be dealt with!

347
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,080
- That's right!
- Yes!

348
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,580
- We can't let this go on.
- Let's dispose of them!

349
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,330
Hello?

350
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,460
Shiro?

351
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,550
What is going on?

352
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,260
You promised you would leave
the House of Golden Treasure alone!

353
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,600
You said I just needed to tell you
where the sleuth woman was.

354
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,110
But officers just came
and turned this place upside down!

355
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,440
No, I can't do this anymore.

356
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,320
I quit. Just give me my money.

357
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,040
You promised to put me
on a ship bound for Tokyo.

358
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,450
This is not the time.

359
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,790
We'll talk later.

360
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,330
Hello?

361
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,520
Mr. Gu...

362
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,650
Is it still not moving?

363
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:43,980
No, sir.

364
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,780
Throw it some prey.

365
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,160
We're out of test subjects, sir.

366
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,530
We still have one left.

367
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,840
Hey. Come out.

368
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,270
Hey!

369
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,100
Hey!

370
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,940
Help me out.

371
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,600
Yukiko Maeda?

372
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,100
Dear me.

373
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,020
You already know who I am,

374
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,400
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

375
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,450
This is strange.

376
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,040
The Japanese officers
have suddenly quieted down.

377
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,550
Papers! Get your papers.

378
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,840
Papers!

379
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,890
Get your papers!

380
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,470
Papers!

381
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,060
And the Jongno Police Station?

382
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,520
They don't seem to have found
the whereabouts of Yoon Chae-ok either.

383
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,400
Then why have they gone so quiet?

384
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,110
Normally, they would have turned
Bonjeong and Jongno upside down by now.

385
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,410
Whatever it is, I find it quite different
from how it used to be.

386
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,450
They're also keeping quiet
about Ichiro's death.

387
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,460
Master.

388
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,130
Mrs. Nawol. How did it go?

389
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,880
It went well.

390
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,220
But I think you need to head downstairs.

391
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,970
You have a visitor.

392
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Well then,

393
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,260
I'll leave you two alone.

394
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,530
What brings her here?

395
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,700
I'm not sure.

396
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,780
They're just sitting there
without much to say.

397
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,540
Wait, I don't see Beom-o.
Where could he have gone?

398
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:08,120
Forget about him.

399
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,290
He's not coming back.

400
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,100
That woman, Mrs. Nawol,

401
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,970
is she trustworthy?

402
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,600
She's been like family
since I was a child.

403
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,400
Just because they're like family
doesn't mean you can trust them.

404
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:40,700
You shouldn't trust people so easily.

405
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,370
They don't betray you
because they are evil.

406
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,330
They betray you because they are weak.

407
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,580
And most human beings are weak.

408
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,970
What is the reason for this visit?

409
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,100
So, don't bother waiting.

410
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,730
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok will not be coming back.

411
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,310
What do you mean?

412
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,650
I just told you.

413
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,690
Betrayal is caused not by evil,
but by weakness.

414
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,780
That woman wasn't strong enough

415
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,410
to stay by your side.

416
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,750
Do you know where she is?

417
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,000
Where is she?

418
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,460
Lady Maeda!

419
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,340
She is dead.

420
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,800
And guess what.

421
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,270
I liked you much better
before you went to Ongseong Hospital.

422
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,440
You clearly differentiated
what would bring you profit versus loss.

423
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,190
Simple-minded.

424
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:56,860
Hence, powerful.

425
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:01,530
Please

426
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,240
return to your former self.

427
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,660
Forget about Ishikawa, Akiko,
and Ongseong Hospital.

428
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,250
Even Yoon Chae-ok.

429
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,830
Forget all about that woman.

430
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,250
Just live your life like before,

431
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,880
as if nothing had ever happened.

432
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,140
Do that, and you
and the House of Golden Treasure

433
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,060
will be safe.

434
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,850
<i>Be careful, Mr. Jang!</i>

435
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,480
There is an invisible hand

436
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,780
that controls everything.

437
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,150
How did you find out?

438
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,620
I pulled every string

439
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,500
in Bonjeong and Jongno,
but couldn't even find a trace of her,

440
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,580
so how...

441
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,210
how is it that you know about her death?

442
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,670
If it wasn't for me,

443
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,100
you would have been arrested already.

444
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,060
The fact that you were close
with the woman who shot Director Ichiro

445
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,060
is enough to classify you as seditious.

446
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,310
So,

447
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,780
don't do anything dangerous anymore,

448
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:24,440
Mr. Jang.

449
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,360
Where is Yoon Chae-ok?

450
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,910
I told you. She is dead.

451
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,830
Then let me see her body.

452
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,040
Stop...

453
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,710
disappointing me.

454
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,710
I don't want us to become enemies.

455
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,000
Yoon Chae-ok!

456
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,670
Where is she?

457
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,100
You will never see her again.

458
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,840
I don't care what you've done.
I will find her.

459
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,970
Whether she's dead or not,
I will find her, no matter what!

460
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,810
Are you saying you plan to go against me?

461
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,400
How can someone like me
possibly be a match for you?

462
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,400
You're a Japanese citizen with power
from a mighty family--

463
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,070
If you know that, stay quiet.

464
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,160
You'll be safe that way.

465
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,330
Even so!

466
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,370
This is about Yoon Chae-ok.

467
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,880
I may run a petty pawnshop,

468
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,630
I may have lived a life without pride

469
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,340
doing all sorts of crap so I could get by,
but for once in my life,

470
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,600
I wanted to protect her,
even if I had to give up all that I have.

471
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,850
So?

472
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,100
Just how will you go against me?

473
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:22,980
With what?

474
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,240
Not those pieces of trash
by your side, I hope.

475
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,320
Watch your mouth. They are my people!

476
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:38,080
Do you even know
how those people betrayed you?

477
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,620
That woman, Mrs. Nawol,
whom you consider family.

478
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,000
She ratted out your mother
a long time ago.

479
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,760
<i>My mother is in there too.</i>

480
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,590
Have you seen her?

481
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:55,260
Her name is Sim Sun-deok.

482
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,220
Do you know her?

483
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:00,850
No.

484
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,100
You haven't heard her name either?

485
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,440
I haven't.

486
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,200
SIM SUN-DEOK

487
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,460
That man, Gu Gap-pyeong,

488
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,670
recently betrayed you
in the police bureau's torture chamber.

489
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,180
I will...

490
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,270
tell you everything now.

491
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,560
Everything...

492
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,730
And that kid, Beom-o?

493
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,490
To find his mother who left him
and ran away to Japan when he was a kid,

494
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,700
he betrayed you.

495
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,870
He sold you out
for a cheap passage ticket,

496
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,580
even when you've treated him like family.

497
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
And your so-called friend?

498
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,380
<i>It took him only a few hours to confess
that you and your friends were key rebels.</i>

499
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,640
That's what humans do
when they are pathetically weak.

500
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:23,980
So desperate to save their own skin
that they forget the favors they received.

501
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,600
They have no morals.

502
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,940
And yet,

503
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,520
what did you say you'd do
with those pieces of trash?

504
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,400
You'd go against me?

505
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:39,740
When I'm the one working tirelessly
for you, even at this very moment?

506
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,040
You say you'll betray me?

507
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,000
Is that what you're saying, Mr. Jang?

508
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,800
Fine.

509
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,640
You may be right.

510
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,640
But

511
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:09,810
did you know?

512
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,150
None of those people

513
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,950
would have gone through those things

514
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,780
had the world been different.

515
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,200
If the world had been different,

516
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,750
they wouldn't have ended up in jail

517
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:32,340
and beaten to near death
so as to betray their friends.

518
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:37,380
They wouldn't have gotten burned
or had their nails plucked out.

519
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:42,140
And they wouldn't have had to give in,
give up the names of their friends,

520
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,720
and live the rest of their lives
wracked with guilt.

521
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,390
But despite all that,

522
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,110
they're fighting tooth and nail
and living with the pain

523
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,820
because they need to survive,
no matter how humiliating and shameful!

524
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,360
We have to survive,

525
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,490
or no one will remember
what we went through.

526
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,880
So don't you dare
call them pieces of trash.

527
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,550
Not a single one of them

528
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:21,300
deserves to be called such
by the likes of you.

529
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:35,770
So...

530
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,940
that's your choice.

531
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,320
Exactly.

532
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,200
This is my choice.

533
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,120
This is it for us.

534
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,670
Lady Maeda.

535
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,780
Let's go inside.

536
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,700
The night

537
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,450
is still cold.

538
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,780
Master!

539
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,150
Master!

540
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,990
Master.

541
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,080
What did I...

542
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,910
What did I just say out there?

543
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,380
You were being yourself.

544
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,090
You said everything there is to be said.

545
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,090
Just wait.

546
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,510
I will find the clues...

547
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,100
to Yoon Chae-ok's whereabouts...

548
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,150
before I die.

549
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,160
Tae-sang.

550
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,710
When did you find out?

551
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:02,960
That I...

552
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,130
gave up...

553
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,470
your mother's name?

554
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,720
It was...

555
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,070
a little after Mother passed away.

556
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:27,990
And you...

557
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:31,660
still

558
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,490
took me in?

559
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,340
Because I didn't think it was your fault.

560
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,020
Don't worry too much.

561
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,480
You know Mr. Gu.

562
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,320
Once he sets his mind on something,

563
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,360
he always comes back with a hint.

564
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,160
Let's wait.

565
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,620
What if it's true?

566
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,960
What if she really is dead?

567
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,200
Is the prey ready?

568
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,780
Lady Maeda sent us a Josenjing woman.
