GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,710
<i>Ordinary life...</i>

3
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,130
<i>was all I ever dreamed of.</i>

4
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,220
<i>Gathering with my family for dinner</i>

5
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,890
<i>and sharing the day's stories.</i>

6
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,810
<i>Dreaming of the future</i>

7
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,770
<i>with the person I love.</i>

8
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,020
<i>Just like that.</i>

9
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,830
<i>I just wanted to live...</i>

10
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,790
<i>the ordinary life...</i>

11
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,250
<i>that everyone else has.</i>

12
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,310
<i>What a futile dream you had.</i>

13
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,360
In this world you live in,
the more you dream of such things,

14
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,780
the more painful life becomes.

15
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,200
Why are you keeping me here?

16
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,160
I was curious
as to what kind of person you were.

17
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,670
Seeing you like this,

18
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,300
I can tell you have Seishin's eyes.

19
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,970
Do you know my mother?

20
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,050
There's a time in life when we realize

21
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,230
that we are linked together
by chains of fate far more powerful

22
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,600
and mysterious than we'd expect.

23
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,440
For you, Ms. Yoon Chae-ok, Seishin, and I,

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,860
it seems that is the case.

25
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,740
He says he knows
where Yoon Chae-ok was taken.

26
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,450
Excuse me.

27
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,120
Do you really believe
what that kid is saying?

28
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,460
Can we believe him?

29
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,790
I'm sure of it.

30
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,960
I just saw her with my own eyes.

31
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,420
You bit the hand that fed you!

32
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,220
How could you do this
to Master Jang, you ingrate?

33
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,430
He's already heard those words from me.

34
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,760
When you were starving to death,

35
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,390
who took you in and made you
into a decent human being?

36
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,140
I already said that too.

37
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,900
I was told that Master Jang
wouldn't be harmed

38
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,650
and that he would be safe
if I reported the woman.

39
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,150
Lady Maeda said
this was all for Master Jang's sake.

40
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,700
My goodness, you thickheaded buffoon.
You actually believed that?

41
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,220
Where is it?
Where is Yoon Chae-ok being held?

42
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,100
Is the prey ready?

43
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,690
Lady Maeda sent us a Josenjing woman.

44
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,690
What are you doing?

45
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,110
Hold onto it for me.

46
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,530
If I don't make it back...

47
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,740
Master Jang.

48
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,870
...then sell this shop.

49
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,040
Please, Mrs. Nawol.

50
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,090
The short wicks go off after five minutes,

51
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,090
and the long ones after eight minutes.

52
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,800
Each explosive has a blast radius
of about five to six meters.

53
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,770
It probably won't knock down the building,
but it will deal a serious blow.

54
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,360
Look, Master Jang.

55
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,530
Master?

56
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,280
I wish you success.

57
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,370
Come back safely.

58
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,670
<i>Will you be okay on your own?</i>

59
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,340
I have already been inside once,
so I know my way around.

60
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,050
It's quicker and easier to move alone,
and getting caught is less likely.

61
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,550
Tae-sang--

62
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,810
Stay safe.

63
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,810
When this is all over,
let's have a drink at the Moonlight Bar.

64
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,570
Sounds good.

65
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,030
Let's go.

66
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,960
It seems
that I have underestimated Lady Maeda.

67
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,180
I didn't expect her
to have you brought here so quickly.

68
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,810
In a moment,

69
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,810
your father will be here as well.

70
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,900
It will be an interesting experiment.

71
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,190
I wonder,

72
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,280
between you and your father,

73
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,410
whose head will your mother devour first?

74
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,230
Hey!

75
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,520
Stop!

76
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,130
How is it...

77
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,930
How is it that

78
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,850
you people never get scared?

79
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
You know you can't win.

80
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,360
So, how can you still look at me
with those eyes?

81
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,190
I have a question for you too.

82
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,910
How are you all so unabashedly proud?

83
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,790
You violated my mother.

84
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,830
You trampled on my family's happiness.

85
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,420
Even after killing
so many innocent people...

86
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,930
how can you be so shameless?

87
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,400
My glorious results and achievements

88
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,990
are too great for the likes of you
to dare discuss, Josenjing.

89
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,540
Achievements?

90
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,080
Is that right?

91
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,840
Do you think justifying
and glorifying what you do...

92
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,300
will really erase your crimes?

93
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,100
You can pretend all you want,

94
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,230
but do you think you can hide
your people's inferiority complex?

95
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,070
Colonel Kato?

96
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,700
Colonel Kato!

97
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,500
What?!

98
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,880
Mother...

99
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,190
That's right.

100
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,740
Don't move!

101
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,780
Or your daughter will get hurt, Seishin.

102
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,500
Fire.

103
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,340
Fire!

104
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,890
No, stop!

105
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,140
No!

106
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,080
GYEONGSEONG CREATURE
BETWEEN THE END AND ANOTHER BEGINNING

107
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,750
EPISODE 10

108
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,510
You're returning to Tokyo next month?

109
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,890
I'm so jealous.

110
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,470
So, will your anatomy book
be published in Tokyo?

111
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,480
Probably.

112
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,360
Will you become famous, then?

113
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,820
She's beautiful.

114
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,820
Who is she? Your Joseon-born lover?

115
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,200
It's Seishin. Don't you remember?

116
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,410
Wait, <i>that</i> Seishin?

117
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,040
She had such a pretty face.

118
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,460
No wonder her husband
couldn't forget about her.

119
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Husband?

120
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,130
Yes. Haven't you heard?

121
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,640
Apparently, Seishin's husband
came looking for her.

122
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,430
He requested to meet his wife.

123
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,210
MILITARY USE
GASOLINE

124
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,910
Master Jang!

125
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,660
Mr. Yoon?

126
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,080
Bring all the nitrogen gas we have!
Release it all.

127
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,420
Don't let the creature
come up to Level Two!

128
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,550
Yes, sir!

129
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,090
Wait!

130
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,100
It's here. Stop it!

131
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,310
You five!

132
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,400
Grab her and follow me.

133
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,700
So, my daughter

134
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,870
has been captured
and brought back in here?

135
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,250
I'm sorry.

136
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,170
I should've taken better care of her.

137
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,850
Here.

138
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,360
A ship bound for Shanghai will be leaving
from Incheon in the morning.

139
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,400
Chae-ok is currently wanted
for shooting Director Ichiro.

140
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,110
You must get on that ship
right after you escape.

141
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,120
Master Jang...

142
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Leave the rest to me
and take Chae-ok with you.

143
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,080
That way, she'll agree to get on the ship.

144
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,620
No!

145
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,910
Shut the door quickly!

146
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,120
Move! Now!

147
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,210
Mother!

148
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,140
Hurry!

149
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,570
The specimen is currently
blocked off at Level 2-2.

150
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,070
And Colonel Kato?

151
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,110
Coming up the eastern emergency exit
with the Josenjing hostage.

152
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,410
Stop the specimen
at Level Two by all means.

153
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,700
It must not come up any further.
Understood?

154
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,620
Yes, sir!

155
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,330
Damn it.

156
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,210
Did you hear that? That was about Chae-ok.

157
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,220
The eastern emergency exit
is near the central elevator.

158
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,050
It's not far from here.
Let's head that way first.

159
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,930
What are you doing?

160
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,980
I'll take care of the rest.

161
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,860
Please take Chae-ok out with you.

162
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,570
No, this is my duty.

163
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,190
- Master Jang.
- Listen.

164
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,780
I have never once dumped
my responsibilities on someone else.

165
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,530
Moreover, this isn't something
I can leave in someone else's hands.

166
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,120
For Chae-ok's sake, I can't do that.
Don't you get it?

167
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,710
For Chae-ok's sake,

168
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,710
it's only right that you go to her.

169
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,880
Don't you get it?

170
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,050
Master Jang.

171
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,510
I'm someone who lives in the past.

172
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,480
But you and Chae-ok,
you two will live for the future.

173
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,570
Besides, it's my wife who is down there.

174
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,950
How could I let someone else

175
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,530
see to the last moments of my beloved?

176
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,830
Please take...

177
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,420
good care of Chae-ok.

178
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,100
Please be safe.

179
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,310
Colonel Kato!

180
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,270
How's the situation?

181
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,900
We're forming a defense line
to stop it from ascending,

182
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,400
but it would be best to shut down
the underground laboratory, just in case.

183
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,990
I must retrieve
some things from my office.

184
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,080
In ten minutes,

185
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,160
we're shutting this place down.

186
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,670
- Take the girl up with you.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,920
Damn it!

188
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,380
MILITARY USE
GASOLINE

189
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,630
Stay still,

190
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,380
or we will shoot you!

191
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,500
No!

192
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,590
Help me...

193
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,600
My stomach

194
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,680
hurts so much.

195
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,230
Please help me.

196
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,690
My stomach,

197
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,900
it hurts so much...

198
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,280
Save me...

199
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,240
Help me...

200
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,710
My stomach, it hurts so much...

201
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,990
This way.

202
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,340
<i>I have heard no news</i>

203
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,510
<i>Of the boat that left</i>

204
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,430
<i>On the day of</i> Chilseok

205
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,600
<i>Over there</i>

206
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,190
<i>Across the sea</i>

207
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,150
<i>The boat returns</i>

208
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:06,290
<i>And the song of the boatsman</i>

209
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,710
<i>Draws nearer and nearer</i>

210
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,640
<i>But you, my love</i>

211
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,930
<i>I've not heard from you</i>

212
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,520
<i>Ever since you left</i>

213
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,770
Honey.

214
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,980
Seong-sim!

215
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,580
It's time...

216
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,040
for us to leave here together.

217
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,690
Let's go.

218
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,540
The way out is this way, not that way.

219
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,660
My father and mother are still down there.

220
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,420
It was his last request!

221
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,930
I promised to get you out of here safely.

222
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,890
I made that promise to your father.

223
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,480
You met my father?

224
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
He said

225
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,440
he wanted to be with your mother.

226
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,060
There was a large explosion
at Ongseong Hospital just now.

227
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,490
Hey! I heard there was a loud explosion
over at Ongseong Hospital!

228
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,820
Loud enough to shake the buildings!

229
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,070
It's caused a hell of a ruckus.
The fire brigade is on its way!

230
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,070
Let's go!

231
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,690
- Put 'em out!
- Hurry!

232
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,860
Put the fire out!

233
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,950
Before it spreads all over!

234
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,610
Water! Bring more water!

235
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
- Bring more!
- Put it out now!

236
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,630
The specimen is nowhere to be seen, sir.

237
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,750
It wasn't found in Area One either.

238
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,590
Any chance it perished in the fire
or was crushed under the rubble?

239
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,510
Then there should be traces of it,
but there's nothing.

240
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,930
What? Where could it have gone?

241
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,360
The entrance to the yard is open,
thanks to the firefighters.

242
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,830
You'll be able to make your escape
amid the chaos.

243
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,960
We'll go on our own from here.

244
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,000
But--

245
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,460
You helped us escape the ward,
and we're more than grateful.

246
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,930
But I can't let you risk your life.

247
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,680
I sincerely apologize.

248
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,860
For the things that happened to you
and your mother...

249
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,820
I'd like to apologize.

250
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,120
I've been making excuses,
telling myself that

251
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,620
I have no choice given the time I live in.

252
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,750
But the truth is...

253
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,710
I was just...

254
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,130
one of the bystanders.

255
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,550
Please...

256
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,930
take care of yourself, Mr. Sachimoto.

257
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,650
Your papers.

258
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,230
Mr. Wang sent me.

259
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,570
It's a message from Master Jang.

260
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,110
Beom-o, go and bring Mr. Park over.

261
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,650
We need to use his rickshaw.

262
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,900
Mrs. Nawol, I'll do it.
A car is faster than a rickshaw.

263
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,030
And have the whole police bureau
take notice?

264
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,990
They won't. I'll be careful!

265
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,620
Forget it. Safety comes first.

266
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,200
Then I'll deliver it.

267
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,790
Well, a bicycle is faster than a rickshaw.

268
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,880
And the police won't care about me.

269
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,300
Please...

270
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,720
give me one chance to redeem myself.

271
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,310
Please?

272
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,910
Follow him.

273
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,880
Thanks.

274
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Go to Mrs. Nawol in the morning,
and she'll pay you.

275
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,550
Take care, Master Jang.

276
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,440
HEINOUS MURDERER

277
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,960
I arranged our ride to Incheon. Let's go.

278
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,310
Ms. Yoon.

279
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,310
Let's end it here.

280
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,940
I'll go alone from here.

281
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,450
What do you mean?

282
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,030
I'm the one who killed Director Ichiro.

283
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,410
I'm the one they're looking for.

284
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,080
I may have to live
the rest of my life on the run

285
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,380
without knowing
when I'll be captured and killed.

286
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,130
That's why I want you
to get on the ship with me.

287
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,380
I don't wish to drag you...

288
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,850
into my life of worries.

289
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,150
Do you...

290
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,240
not like me?

291
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,330
You know that's not what I mean.

292
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,910
Then it's all settled.

293
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,040
I'm going with you.

294
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,290
Master Jang.

295
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,880
I...

296
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,760
have already died once.

297
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,100
The reason I'm standing here

298
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,640
is because your father granted me

299
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,900
a bonus life, if you will...

300
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,780
to protect you.

301
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,280
To stay by your side.

302
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,950
They won't give up looking for me.

303
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,080
And I will never give you up.

304
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,170
I can't live without you.

305
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,040
You already know that.

306
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
No way.

307
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,200
We cannot delay any longer.
Let's get going so we don't miss the ship.

308
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,920
Wait.

309
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,720
- Beom-o, you came.
- Yes.

310
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,980
I'm a bit late because I had to lose
a tail along the way.

311
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,620
Well done, Shiro.

312
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,410
No.

313
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,870
Master, it's not what it looks like.
It really isn't. I swear!

314
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,380
Please believe me!

315
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,970
All right. Hide over there.

316
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:37,940
In any case,

317
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,190
I have to give it to you, Mr. Jang.

318
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,570
Once you set your eyes on something,
you acquire it by any means necessary.

319
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:52,700
But burning the hospital to the ground
like that was a bit too much.

320
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,250
Nothing compared to the things
you people did inside those walls.

321
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,500
So, what are you going to do now?

322
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,340
Will you really give everything up
for that seditious Joseon woman?

323
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,630
I believe I gave my answer.

324
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,110
There was a time
when I considered you a friend.

325
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,110
I suppose I'm losing a friend today.

326
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,160
Come to think of it,
I lost another friend of mine

327
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,460
just like this in the past.

328
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,920
At that time...

329
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,590
it was because of that girl's mother.

330
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,360
Now,

331
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,280
I ask you both to die here.

332
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:15,700
Goodbye.

333
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,110
Kill them!

334
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,540
Let's go.

335
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,640
Hang on.

336
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,480
Get up.

337
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,950
Get up.

338
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,310
Mother...

339
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,020
Stop this now.

340
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,900
I know you're in pain too.

341
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,210
This man...

342
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,590
This is the man I love.

343
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,260
So...

344
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:57,730
let's...

345
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,440
stop this now.

346
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,320
Let's end it here.

347
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,710
Ms. Yoon.

348
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,170
Ms. Yoon.

349
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,590
Ms. Yoon!

350
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,810
You'll be all right. Hang in there!

351
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:40,640
We promised to be together.

352
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,480
Try getting up.

353
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,280
Ms. Yoon, please get up.

354
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,660
The cherry blossoms...

355
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,830
have all fallen.

356
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,620
<i>Stay with me.</i>

357
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:43,790
Stay...

358
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,630
right by my side.

359
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,390
This can't be.

360
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,390
No...

361
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,150
No!

362
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,150
No!

363
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,280
No!

364
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,080
No...

365
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,000
No...

366
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:43,600
Please, no...

367
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:42,830
Colonel Kato!

368
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,410
Sir!

369
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,510
Colonel!

370
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,110
Colonel.

371
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Keep it down.

372
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:56,110
How amazing!

373
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,230
My friend asked me
to give this to you, ma'am.

374
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:35,810
Your friend?

375
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:40,030
Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

376
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,890
FAREWELL

377
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,220
FROM JANG TAE-SANG
OF HOUSE OF GOLDEN TREASURE

378
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,850
FROM AKIKO
COURTESAN OF SPRING MOON HALL

379
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,430
FROM PRIVATE CHOI YEONG-GWAN

380
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,150
FROM YOON JUNG-WON

381
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:01,230
FROM YOON CHAE-OK
SLEUTH

382
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,360
FROM CHOI SEONG-SIM

383
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,720
FAREWELL

384
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,740
"Justice prevails. You reap what you sow."

385
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,370
That's how it goes, you know.

386
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,090
You've been a big help.

387
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:09,340
If you hadn't come that day
and convinced Comrade Lee In-hyeok,

388
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,590
this rebellion wouldn't have happened.

389
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:15,560
Ultimately, you are the true patriot.

390
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,160
Thanks for the drink.

391
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,080
I'll see you again.

392
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,080
Comrade Jang!

393
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,000
What a huge achievement.

394
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,590
You really are a true hero and fighter
for our nation. Isn't that right?

395
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,390
- Hear, hear.
- That's right.

396
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,690
Are you in urgent need of money?

397
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,440
Pardon?

398
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,770
If you have anything useful,
bring it over.

399
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:07,860
I'll pay you handsomely.

400
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,160
By the way, I'm not Comrade Jang.

401
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:17,490
I'm Master Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

402
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,870
Well, then.

403
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,550
<i>Here's the truth, Tae-sang.</i>

404
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,220
When I was locked up
in the underground lab,

405
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,390
I gave your name up.

406
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,520
I ratted out my friend and my comrades

407
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,020
and begged for my life.

408
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:56,370
When this is all over,
let's have a drink at the Moonlight Bar.

409
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,380
Silk! Come take a look at our silk!

410
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,390
They are silk!

411
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,440
Ask them to bring some green onion.

412
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,400
Yes, please slice some of this meat.

413
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,740
Hey, excuse me. I'd like one <i>gukbap</i> !

414
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,130
Let's go inside. The night is cold.

415
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,970
<i>Spring went past unusually quickly
in Gyeongseong that year.</i>

416
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,200
<i>And in August of the same year,</i>

417
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:51,540
<i>we finally recovered
those that were taken from us.</i>

418
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,630
<i>As she once said,</i>

419
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,390
<i>the cherry blossoms</i>

420
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,430
<i>had already begun to fall.</i>

421
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,160
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

422
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,500
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

423
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:38,590
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

424
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:41,170
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

425
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,560
Lady Maeda.

426
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,530
As of today, Ongseong Hospital
is closing its doors.

427
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:15,330
Most of the doctors and nurses
will be returning to Japan.

428
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,630
You must also...

429
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,640
make a decision now.

430
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,970
Will you return to Kyoto,

431
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:30,310
or

432
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,600
will you continue
to explore new possibilities?

433
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,620
<i>As for me,</i>

434
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:38,620
<i>I'm still waiting
for the things I have dreamed of.</i>

435
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,160
Chae-ok.

436
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:59,180
IN REMEMBRANCE OF OUR COLLEAGUES
KIM HYEON-JUNG AND SEO JI-HUN

437
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,400
JUNE 25TH 4:20 A.M.

438
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,440
SILENT PROTEST

439
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,240
DREAMS COME TRUE

440
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:53,030
Ho-jae, we're ready. Let's go!
