00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,150
I have arranged it
with Director Ichiro of Ongseong Hospital.

<i>The child in your womb

5
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,750
<i>That being said...</i>

6
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,260
please take exceptional care of yourself,

7
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Miss Akiko.

8
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,890
Sorry, but we are closed for the day.

9
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,130
The spores stopped floating around
an hour ago.

10
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,010
Has it awakened?

11
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,430
Yes, but it's not moving.

12
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,930
Perhaps we used too much nitrogen gas?

13
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,940
What's on your mind?

14
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,570
Seishin.

15
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,580
Lieutenant Colonel Kato, we have a guest.

16
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,670
This is Lady Maeda.
She is the wife of Commissioner Ishikawa

17
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,010
and the daughter
of Lieutenant General Maeda of the Army.

18
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,930
Outsiders are not allowed down here.

19
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,220
She's also the most generous sponsor
of our hospital, Colonel.

20
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,780
Is that it?

21
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,200
I'd advise you not to get too close.

22
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
Seishin.

23
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
So you were still alive.

24
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,220
Teacher Seishin.

AWAKENING

27
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,160
<i>He must have gone through an ordeal.</i>

28
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,500
<i>He hasn't been able to sleep a wink
or swallow a bite of food.</i>

29
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,620
What about Tae-sang?

30
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,540
He didn't make it back.

31
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,210
And the merchants in Bonjeong
have all been arrested.

32
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,220
Yes, hello.

33
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Yes.

34
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,350
Yes.

35
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,810
- Yes, sir.
- Quiet!

36
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,350
Sit down!

37
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,480
Mr. Gu, what's going on?

38
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,110
Why haven't we heard from Master Jang yet?

39
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,370
Is he... not coming to save us?

40
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Is that it?

41
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,290
Damn it!

00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
What are you up to?

46
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,720
Hurry back home, will you?

47
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,690
Is he dead?

48
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,530
He's breathing, just about.

49
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,860
Take him so he can get treated.

50
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,280
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir!

51
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,080
Kill him...

52
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,050
Find...

53
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,050
the bastard

54
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,930
and kill him!

55
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,470
All of you, stop and stand back!

56
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,360
As you were.

57
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,800
Sir! I have something to report.

58
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,800
Is it urgent?

59
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,310
First Sergeant Haneda
was found next to the body dump.

60
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,890
He has a serious gunshot wound.

61
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,520
My apologies, Lady Maeda.
Would you wait inside for just a moment?

62
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,310
Mr. Jang!

63
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,690
What are you... doing here?

64
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,150
I came in to do a job

65
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,360
but missed my chance to leave.

66
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,570
So I need you

67
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,660
to help me, Lady Maeda.

68
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,540
Are you saying that a Josenjing
is still hiding in here?

69
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,500
Yes, sir. It seems so.

70
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,800
Director Ichiro!

71
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,760
The Josenjing seems to be in this wing.

72
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,930
This soldier just found blood
near the supply room.

73
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,320
Lady Maeda, I'm afraid

74
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,860
now is not a good time...

75
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,040
It's an emergency! Emergency!

76
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,000
Lady Maeda is in danger!

77
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,960
Find Lady Maeda immediately! Now!

78
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,860
Lady Maeda.

79
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,540
No questions. Just drive.

80
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,770
Go.

81
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,410
Thank you.

82
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,050
What should I do, ma'am? Shall I stop?

83
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
To Bonjeong.

PAWNSHOP
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

85
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,150
Were you at Golden Treasure again?

86
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,820
Waiting for me?

87
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,200
It's been four days.

88
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,120
The fact that he hasn't reached out

89
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,960
means it's unlikely for him to return.

90
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,590
Besides, our job was to find Myeong-ja.

91
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,760
Since we've done our part,
it is time for us to head back home.

92
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,470
Get ready to leave early tomorrow morning.

93
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,890
I should have stayed in his place.

94
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
It was his choice.

95
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,940
All he had to do was save Myeong-ja, but...

96
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,780
because of us...

97
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,910
I should've stayed
and found a way to rescue Mother.

98
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,910
I should've at least gotten revenge
on those who did that to her.

99
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,670
Then he wouldn't have been left alone.

100
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,670
And I wouldn't be wracked with guilt.

101
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,050
What do you mean by that?

102
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,430
I met Mother.

103
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,770
She's still there...

104
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,520
at Ongseong Hospital.

105
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,750
It's been in that state
ever since Lady Maeda's visit.

106
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,130
It seems to be enraged by something.

107
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,920
It's looking for its young.

108
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,340
Sir?

109
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,970
It's not enraged,

110
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,100
but agitated.

111
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,760
I'll ask again.

112
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,810
Where are the Josenjings
you helped escape?

113
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,810
I don't know.

114
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,900
Where is Jang Tae-sang right now?

115
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,820
I wish...

116
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,610
I wish I knew.

117
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,160
You don't seem to understand.

118
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,580
Should we start over?

119
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,000
Over...

120
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,000
Start... over...

121
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,510
<i>Have you ever had</i>

122
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,640
<i>your nails plucked out?</i>

123
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,850
<i>Have you ever been burned...</i>

124
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,110
<i>or gone through electric torture?</i>

125
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,660
<i>Do you know what happens</i>

126
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,160
<i>when water mixed with chili powder
is poured down your nose</i>

127
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,420
<i>while hanging upside down?</i>

128
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,130
<i>Persist to that point,</i>

129
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,550
<i>and a person can no longer remain human.</i>

130
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,050
<i>If you're ever in such a situation,</i>

131
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,470
<i>don't try to hold back and ruin your life.</i>

132
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,390
<i>Just tell them everything you know.</i>

133
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,770
I won't ever resent you for betraying me
in a situation like that.

134
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,770
Keep that in mind.

135
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,990
Let me ask you again.

136
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,780
What is the true purpose of your pawnshop?

137
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
Are you rebels?

138
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,330
Or do you secretly fund
the independence army?

139
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,040
Answer me!

140
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,330
Where is Jang Tae-sang?

141
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,930
Goddamn it...

142
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
You are awake.

143
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,130
Lady Maeda.

144
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,940
Your fever has gone down, thankfully.

145
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,690
Your wounds are also healing well.

146
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,790
How long have I been here?

147
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,330
As of today, it's been four days.

148
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,420
You caused quite a stir
at Ongseong Hospital.

149
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,300
Though you didn't need to risk your life
over someone else's trouble.

150
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,560
It's not like you.

151
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,690
It just

152
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,280
made me a bit angry.

153
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,570
It's not my fault that this country
has come to this.

154
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,700
It's not my fault those people
were kept in there and suffering, but...

155
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,370
But?

156
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,420
But...

157
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,550
once I saw it with my own eyes,

158
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,050
it made me angry.

159
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,800
It pissed me off.

160
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,770
Could you not stand the injustice
as a fellow Joseon person?

161
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,400
No, I couldn't stand it

162
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,150
as a fellow human being.

163
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,700
Do you think all human lives are equal?

164
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,160
Do you somehow think they're not?

165
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,670
Do you still

166
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,380
consider us friends?

167
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,360
A serial murder case?

168
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,940
Yes, 11 deaths around Cheonggyecheon
over the past four days.

169
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,150
We've requested the military ward
for autopsies.

170
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,450
An unusually large number of corpses
were in a very strange state.

171
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,740
Strange? In what way?

172
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,290
They were missing their brains, sir.

173
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,780
He's from the military ward.

174
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,010
This is the House of Golden Treasure!

175
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,800
No.

176
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,390
We haven't put the store up for sale.

177
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,060
What are you talking about?

178
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,940
Dead...

179
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,520
What do you mean? Who's dead?

180
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,280
Just who do you think you are?

181
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,240
You watch your mouth
and the crap that comes out of it!

182
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,950
That's right, you heard me! Oh, pipe down!

183
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,000
Shut your trap,
or I will sew it shut for you.

184
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,500
Like they know it all.

185
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,000
How dare they say shit like he's dead
as if they have a say in it?

186
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,480
You've got to be freaking kidding me.

187
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,780
House of Golden Treasure.

188
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,910
I believe my employee
has already answered that question.

189
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Me?

190
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm the master of this shop,

191
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,170
Jang Tae-sang.

192
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,250
Yes.

193
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,760
I'm still alive and well.

194
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,430
More people have been eyeing up
my treasured shop lately, haven't they?

195
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,310
Tae-sang, you...

196
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,400
Look what you've done.

197
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,110
You didn't have to close up shop.
I was only gone for a few days.

198
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,610
No wonder they got the wrong idea.

199
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,860
Are...

200
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,120
Are you all right?

201
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,660
Of course I am.

202
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,210
You're not hurt?

203
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,790
Of course not!

204
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,630
Fool!

205
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,840
If you're okay,
then what took you so long?

206
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,880
Did you enjoy giving this old woman
a heart attack?

207
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,300
You heartless boy!

208
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,930
Hey, I'm sorry.

209
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,390
I had my reasons!

210
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,770
So calm down, Mrs. Nawol.

211
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,150
I said I was sorry.

212
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,950
Enough of this.

213
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,120
You should go and fetch Mr. Gu now.

214
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,710
Where is he?

215
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,670
Get up.

216
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,350
No! I won't go!

217
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,850
Get out!

218
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,150
Master Jang!

219
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,880
Wait here.

220
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,460
Stop right there!

221
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,930
Where do you think you're going?

222
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,140
Is that Jang from Golden Treasure?

223
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,770
I'm here to see Commissioner Ishikawa.

224
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,070
Hey, you! Are you ignoring me?

225
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,320
Go tell him I'm here.

226
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,990
You insolent bastard!

227
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,120
Swinging a fist at someone

228
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,160
who's come to have a conversation
is what thugs do.

229
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,630
If you're a police officer,
why don't you act like one?

230
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,600
You caused a bigger scene than I expected.

231
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,730
Only because you told me to do
whatever it took.

232
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,070
So,

233
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,570
what did you do with the Joseon people
you helped escape?

234
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,540
Which Joseon people are you referring to?

235
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,500
Like I said, I'm here as a representative
of the Bonjeong Merchants Association.

236
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,840
I'm asking you to release
the wrongfully imprisoned merchants.

237
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,010
No less than ten violations
were committed that night.

238
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,850
Loud singing, jazz-playing,

239
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,890
violation of public order
and security regulations, et cetera.

240
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,060
Let's settle this with a fine.

241
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,440
Do you think money
will fix this situation?

242
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,070
It's the cleanest and easiest way,
isn't it?

243
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
And if I refuse?

244
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,370
Then all businesses in Bonjeong
will close up starting today.

245
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,540
You know that the fundraising party
for the war effort will be held

246
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,710
in two days.

247
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,250
All deliveries of food and drinks
to the party will be stopped.

248
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Plus, all the officials and their wives
who have put in orders for their garments

249
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,340
will not be able to receive them in time.

250
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,010
When that happens,
the authorities will begin to investigate.

251
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,390
That would put you in a tight spot,
would it not?

252
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,730
Is that a threat?

253
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,230
When there comes a time
for the weak to be strong,

254
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,730
we do something called "unite."

255
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,660
We are simply doing what we can do
in light of the situation.

256
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,370
Know your limits.

257
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,540
Don't risk your life
for matters that don't concern you.

258
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,300
I learned an important lesson
from my visit to Ongseong Hospital.

259
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,630
When you need to risk your life,

260
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,510
you go all in.

261
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,100
If you hesitate to do so,

262
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,770
you'll end up dead.

263
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,230
I know the prime suspects
in this incident.

264
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,530
Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure,

265
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,160
Yoon Chae-ok the sleuth, and...

266
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,620
a Joseon courtesan named Akiko.

267
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,840
Miss Akiko?

268
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,920
Are you okay?

269
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,890
Do you have reasons to believe
that they are suspects?

270
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,730
The suspects I've just mentioned

271
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,570
all entered Ongseong Hospital
and then escaped.

272
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,610
What exactly happened at the hospital?

273
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,280
I'm not inclined
to divulge that information.

274
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,530
It's a military secret.

275
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,080
Akiko.

276
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,250
Aki...

277
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,450
What in the hell...

278
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,710
<i>Tell me.</i>

279
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,710
What went on in there?

280
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,090
What exactly is happening
inside Ongseong Hospital?!

281
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,890
As you know,

282
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,940
the price for my information
is quite steep.

283
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,100
And confidentiality
about Ongseong Hospital

284
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,230
is considered to be
of the highest level, you know.

285
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,200
I can only hand over such information
when enough trust has been built.

286
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,990
Are you trying to strike a deal?

287
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,530
Mr. Ishikawa!

288
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,490
I'm trying to talk about mutual trust.

289
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,960
I have already kept my promise

290
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,170
and returned Akiko to you.

291
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,300
Now it's your turn.

292
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,050
Release my people.

293
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,820
Get out!

294
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,070
You're all released!

295
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,990
Released! We're free!

296
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,480
Master Jang...

297
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,400
You're alive?

298
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,120
Can you stand up?

299
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,290
What took you so long?

300
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,180
Let's get out of here first.

301
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Come on.

302
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:46,190
Bonjeong!

303
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,610
Do you all want to die?

304
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,740
Be quiet!

305
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,920
Bonjeong.

306
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,230
- Mori.
- Yes!

307
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,310
Commissioner, sir.

308
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,610
Keep Jang under close observation
from now on.

309
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,440
Pardon? Again, sir?

310
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,490
Understood, sir.

311
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,710
MILITARY WARD, UNDERGROUND LAB
HUMAN EXPERIMENTS, LADY MAEDA

312
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,260
LADY MAEDA

313
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,860
Don't worry too much. He'll be all right.

314
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,320
I owe Mr. Gu too great a debt.

315
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,410
Hardly.

316
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,330
I can't even count
all the times you saved his life.

317
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,040
He just repaid you for one of them.

318
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,210
The aftermath of torture...

319
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,590
lasts a while, huh?

320
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,470
You should go now.

321
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,690
No, I'll stay here.

322
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,150
There is someone else waiting for you.

323
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,440
She came by every single day

324
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,160
to check whether you had returned safely.

325
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,120
Leave Mr. Gu to me.

326
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,540
Go pay her a visit.

327
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,200
Aren't you having dinner?

328
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,370
I'm not hungry.

329
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,790
You go and eat.

330
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,120
Should I grab some dumplings for you?

331
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,170
I'll be right back.

332
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,860
Who are you?

333
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,420
You're still as aggressive as ever.

334
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,130
Now that you've seen my face,

335
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,220
will you let me go?

336
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,350
Master Jang...

337
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,760
I felt the same way.

338
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,180
I also...

339
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,480
missed you a lot.

340
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,140
Did you have something to say?

341
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,470
Tell me.

342
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,640
How much do you know
about the underground laboratory

343
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,150
in Ongseong Hospital?

344
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,320
Are you even remotely aware
of what exactly is going on there?

345
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,620
There is nothing I don't know about.

346
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,580
What have you done to Akiko?

347
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,920
I asked you what you did to her!

348
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,920
You seem to be mistaken.

349
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,510
You have no right to ask me such things.

350
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,060
And I have no obligation to answer you.

351
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:35,720
What's that now?

352
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:41,270
From the beginning, our relationship
was formed for mutual benefit.

353
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,400
I needed a husband
so I could come to Joseon.

354
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:54,160
And you needed my good name and lineage
to move up and succeed.

355
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,460
You suddenly assuming
the role of my husband like this

356
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,710
puts me in an awkward position,
Mr. Ishikawa.

357
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,380
You shouldn't have touched Akiko.

358
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,470
And you had no need
to send Mr. Jang in there.

359
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,640
We agreed not to interfere
in each other's personal lives.

360
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,390
You're the one who broke the agreement
in the first place!

361
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,360
I respect what you do for a pastime.

362
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,690
But having a child

363
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,070
is a completely different story.

364
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,130
Did you know that Jang Tae-sang
found himself a woman?

365
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,890
A Joseon woman named Yoon Chae-ok.

366
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,770
Apparently, she's young and pretty.

367
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,440
How unfortunate for you.

368
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,650
All that effort nursing him back to health

369
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,150
was absolutely in vain.

370
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,370
Here are your dumplings.

371
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,050
Let's get going.

372
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,730
What a fool!

373
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,980
Stop.

374
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,240
Go... go away!

375
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,290
Get away from me!

376
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,750
Myeong-ja?

377
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,860
So, these are the Najin?

378
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,110
Correct.

379
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,610
They were found inside the glaciers
of Muryong Snow Mountain,

380
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,530
where the Na people live.

381
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:27,700
And you're saying
that this enters the human brain

382
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,870
to create creatures like Seishin?

383
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:32,710
No.

384
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,460
With Najin alone,
it only turns them into predators.

385
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,800
<i>While retaining the appearance of a human,</i>

386
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,090
<i>they will hold only the survival
and hunting instincts</i> ,

387
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,720
<i>and prey primarily on human brains.</i>

388
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,640
<i>Highly aggressive and more violent
than most predatory animals,</i>

389
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,970
<i>they can move quickly
and heal wounds almost immediately.</i>

390
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,650
Then why does Seishin
appear the way she does?

391
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,950
Because she was injected with a serum
that contained anthrax.

392
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,850
Once injected with this serum
during their predatory stage,

393
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,230
they will move on to Seishin's phase.

394
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,730
Do they have any weaknesses?

395
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,740
They hate sunlight and fire,

396
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,710
and they are weak against nitrogen.

397
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,980
Get a hold of yourself.

398
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:03,770
Why are you doing this?

399
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,030
Myeong-ja!

400
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,830
<i>How horrid.</i>

401
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,250
<i>To remember what it was like
to be human, even in that state...</i>

402
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,960
Ongseong Hospital.

403
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,550
They must've experimented on her.

404
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,450
A flare was fired from Jongno, sir!

405
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,590
Over there! Get her!

406
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,350
Stop!

407
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,970
Don't lose her. Get her!

408
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:56,970
Yes, sir!

409
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:25,250
It was not able to remember at first,
not until it met its daughter.

410
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:28,960
Daughter?

411
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,590
Seishin has... a daughter?

412
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:39,220
She snuck in here, looking for her mother
who had gone missing ten years ago.

413
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,890
When it recognized its daughter, it...

414
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,520
flipped a switch, I think.

415
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,440
And her daughter's name is...

416
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,110
Yoon Chae-ok.

417
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:54,490
She works as a sleuth.

418
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,320
<i>Did you know</i>

419
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,490
that Jang Tae-sang found himself a woman?

420
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:04,580
A Joseon woman named Yoon Chae-ok.

421
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,960
- Find her!
- Yes, sir!

422
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,210
- This way too!
- Yes, sir!

423
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,840
- Hurry up!
- This way!

424
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,260
- Move!
- Find her!

425
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,040
That way! Get her!

426
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,300
Are you all right?

427
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,390
If she's caught, she might get killed.

428
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,190
No, she will go through much worse.

429
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,520
Like my mother did.

430
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,480
Go after her!

431
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,070
Run!

432
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:24,620
Catch her!

433
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,220
Go.

434
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,480
Don't kill me...

435
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,770
Please don't kill me!

436
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,280
Please don't...

437
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,030
Hold it!

438
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,410
That way!

439
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,260
Find her!

440
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,430
Don't lose her!

441
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,840
Stop right there!

442
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,980
Don't kill me...

443
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,650
Please don't kill me!

444
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,650
Please don't kill me...

445
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,780
Don't kill me!
