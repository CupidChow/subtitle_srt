ALL TROOPS RETREAT

3
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,234
Finish all preparations
to retreat within 48 hours.

4
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,029
Take all the documents
and research records back to Japan,

5
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,325
and incinerate everything
that cannot be taken.

6
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,952
Yes, sir!

7
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,085
Are we to burn

8
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,253
everything, sir?

9
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,797
Burn everything.

10
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,383
Do not leave a single trace

11
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,802
of what we did here.

12
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,721
That'll be all.

13
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,104
Quickly!

14
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,064
Destroy everything. There's no time!

15
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,107
Hurry up!

16
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,985
- On your feet!
- Yes, sir!

17
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,405
- Leave no evidence. Take this.
- No time!

18
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,741
All planted, sir.

19
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,868
- Over there!
- Okay!

20
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,256
- The serums?
- We have secured 12, sir.

21
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,341
- And the Najin?
- We have eight of them.

22
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,218
What about the other two?

23
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,554
We didn't have enough time
to retrieve them.

24
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,193
Lieutenant Colonel Kato!

25
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,745
There is not enough time. Please hurry!

26
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,539
Ready!

27
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,460
Fire!

28
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,220
Fire!

29
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,350
Fire!

30
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,022
Faster!

31
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,317
Hurry.

32
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,488
What are you doing? Hurry up!

33
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,322
Come on! There's no time!

34
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,198
Are we flying?

35
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,784
Traveling by land
seems to be the safest path right now.

36
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,579
We'll take the train at Harbin
and go to Gyeongseong first.

37
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,790
- Drive.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,643
Get your papers!

43
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,811
Shoeshine!

44
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,063

- Shoeshine!

45

- Papers!
- Kid!

46
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,068
Thank you.

47
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,530
Boy, I'll take one.

48
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:53,950
One jeon.

49
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,456
Get yourself some bread with the change.

50
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,207
Thank you, sir!

51
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,626
May you be blessed.

52
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,006
Tell you what,

53
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,634
this here is the real news.

So the rumors were true.

57
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,646
<i>After the Bombing of Tokyo on March 9,</i>

58
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,607
<i>the shadow of defeat loomed over Japan.</i>

59
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:32,446
<i>In the hopes that Japan may fall,
Joseon was quivering in silence.</i>

60
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,531
<i>However...</i>

61
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,371
Insurgents! Arrest them all!

62
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,748
Get them!

63
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,337
Don't move!

64
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,841
Arrest them all!

65
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,843
Let's go.

00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,435
JAPAN'S CRISIS!
LARGE-SCALE AIR RAIDS WRECK TOYKO

67
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,189
- Run!
- What is it?

68
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,274
Who is it?

69
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,213
People of the peninsula, rise!

70
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,717
It's your chance
to give your life for His Majesty!

71
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,264
Join the unbeatable Imperial Army
and enter the shrine of Yasukuni!

72
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,978
Either die in a torture chamber...

73
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,650
or become an honorable soldier.

74
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,363
Make your choice.

75
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,743
Damn it, what do I do?

76
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,748
CONSCRIPTION FORM

77
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,501
<i>You know what they say.</i>

78
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,379
<i>It's always darkest before the dawn.</i>

79
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,935
Admit it.

80
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,522
It... wasn't me.

81
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,858
So, you're going to keep denying it?

82
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,610
I swear...

83
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,030
I don't know anything.

84
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,584
<i>Is he part of the independence army?</i>

85
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,294
You don't know who he is?

86
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,547
That's Jang Tae-sang.

87
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,008
Jang Tae-sang? Who's that?

88
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,219
The master
of the House of Golden Treasure.

89
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,430
Golden Treasure?

90
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,100
<i>That's right.
The House of Golden Treasure.</i>

91
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,312
<i>Located in the corner
that is the prime spot of Bonjeong,</i>

92
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,563
<i>it is, without a doubt,</i>

93
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,567
<i>Gyeongseong's largest
and finest establishment.</i>

94
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,446
<i>Yes, it's that pawnshop
that everyone is talking about.</i>

95
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,992
It's <i>the</i> famous Waltham watches.

96
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,118
Four won, 50 jeon.

97
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,286
Hey!

98
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,456
This Waltham watch came
all the way from America!

99
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,791
Four won, 50 jeon.

100
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,295
Look.

101
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,715
I've lost my factory to the Japanese.

102
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,634
- I might lose my house too.
- Oh dear.

103
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,054
I have an elderly mother
and four little ones to provide for.

104
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,473
And we're about to end up on the streets...

105
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,391
Here.

106
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,771
That's one more won for you.
Take the money or take the watch back.

107
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,067
Next!

108
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,821
These are my dowries.
Please take good care of them.

109
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,824
I will come back for them, no matter what.

110
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,576
Fifteen won for the batch.

111
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,370
For the record, this one's a fake.

112
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,996
An Italian suit.

113
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,873
I had it custom-made at a shop...

114
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,501
Two won for used clothes.

115
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,838
I paid quite a lot for this <i>baekja</i>
three years ago.

116
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,965
Oh, is that so?

117
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,342
Take it back.

118
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,928
It's a chamber pot.

119
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,764
Stupid man.

120
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,335
- What do you mean?
- Kid.

121
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,808
Try stealing from the shop one more time,

122
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,935
I'll cut off all ten of your fingers.

123
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,773
It was just a little prank.
Don't be so harsh!

124
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,405
We don't get Walthams often.

125
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,036
Four won would have been enough,
but he gave five won and 50 jeon for it.

126
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,749
Manager Gu is being too generous
with money that isn't his.

127
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,500
This is good leather.

128
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,419
It's worth the price.

129
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,255
Beom-o, that kid, is also hopeless.

130
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,384
The little brat tries to swipe things
every chance he gets.

131
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,722
Have you prepared the tea set and tray
for Lady Maeda?

132
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,769
They say that one should avoid bad company
for their own good.

133
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,856
Her husband is Ishikawa,
and her father is General Maeda.

134
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,818
Her family has this city
in the palm of their hands.

135
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,488
Of course I should keep them close, dear.

136
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,824
Still, you should be careful.

137
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,785
Not to worry.

138
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,453
I'm

139
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,538
Jang Tae-sang.

140
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,292
<i>That's right. I'm Jang Tae-sang.</i>

141
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,088
<i>A man of means in Bukchon
and an icon of a self-made man.</i>

142
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,886
Oh my goodness!

143
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,306
- Greetings, everyone.
- Master Jang!

144
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,557
Calm yourselves.

145
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,476
One, two!

146
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,687
- Good! One more!
- A different pose?

147
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,616
Mr. Jang!

148
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,783
Hey!

149
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,244
<i>Nothing scares me. Nothing can stop me.</i>

150
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,081
<i>I'm the master of Golden Treasure,
and I can get anything I want.</i>

151
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,666
Everyone. Cheers!

152
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,502
Cheers!

153
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,255
<i>The one and only Jang Tae-sang.</i>

154
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,008
<i>So...</i>

155
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,730
<i>how did I end up in this sorry mess?</i>

156
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,149
<i>He must have secretly funded
the independence movement.</i>

157
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,400
<i>Wrong.</i>

158
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,319
Then was he a spy?

159
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,779
Nope.

160
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,118
It was an affair.

161
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,203
An affair?

162
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,876
Why did you meet her at a teahouse
about a month ago?

163
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:30,757
Lady Maeda was looking for <i>baekja</i> teacups
and a lacquered tray inlaid with nacre.

164
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,759
What about at the museum six days ago?

165
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:37,973
To tell her that it's not easy to acquire
<i>baekja</i> teacups and lacquered trays.

166
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,141
You sent her a message three days ago.

167
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,229
Because I had a stroke of luck
and was able to find

168
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,439
the teacups and the tray.

169
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,692
You even came to my house yesterday.

170
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,861
I had gone through a lot to get them, so...

171
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,280
I delivered them in person.

172
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,491
Don't mess with me!

173
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,745
You pathetic, inferior Josenjing bastard!

174
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,208
How dare you covet my wife?

175
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:13,008
It seems to me, Commissioner,
that there is a misunderstanding.

176
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,137
Cut the bullshit and spit it out.

177
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:23,102
What the hell did you do with my wife?
Tell me now!

178
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,150
You must be crazy...

179
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,947
crazily in love, Commissioner Ishikawa!

180
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,409
Don't tell me you're seriously
suspecting your own wife.

181
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,456
How could you doubt an honorable
and noble woman like Lady Maeda?

182
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,707
I must definitely say

183
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,461
that this is a great affront
and insult to her.

184
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,795
What are you saying?

185
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,007
Would it be okay with you
if Lady Maeda found out

186
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,428
that you were doubting her faithfulness?

187
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,013
That's what.

188
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,430
Now, why don't we move on
to the actual matter at hand?

189
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,641
What do you actually want from me?

190
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,273
This girl has gone missing.

191
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,320
It's been about a week now.

192
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,326
A missing persons case?

193
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,703
Sounds like a job for the police.

194
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,998
They say you're Mr. Omniscient.

195
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,125
You flatter me.

196
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,212
"You must go through Jang Tae-sang
if you want anything in Bonjeong,

197
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,299
whether it be money,
property, or a person."

198
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,384
Is that not true?

199
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,137
I catch those who don't pay me back,

200
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,973
not courtesans.

201
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,522
Find the girl.

202
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,485
Find out why she's vanished, where she is,
and if she found a lover to elope with.

203
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,489
If she did, then find him as well.

204
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,786
If you fail to find her...

205
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,580
Will I die?

206
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,213
You will lose everything you own.

207
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,424
From the house that you own,

208
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:04,263
to real estate, cash, cars, and even
the House of Golden Treasure in Bonjeong!

209
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,973
You'll lose them all.

210
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,225
And as for you?

211
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,311
You will be sent to war.

212
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,253
How much time do I have?

213
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,384
Until the cherry blossoms fall.

214
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,892
I see.

215
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,896
Okay, sir.

216
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,997
Sir!

217
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,226
What is the matter?

218
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,981
Who beat the crap out of you?

219
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,859
Mrs. Nawol.

220
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,112
How much cash
do we have on hand right now?

221
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,406
Cash?

222
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,286
If I put my buildings in Bukchon,

223
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,164
my house, and this shop
up for urgent sale,

224
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,167
how long would it take for them to sell?

225
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,758
Maybe a month?

226
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,303
What's going on this time?

227
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,013
Tell me, will you?

228
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,564
You know what?

229
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,650
It seems...

230
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,321
I'm screwed.

231
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,369
What is all this?

232
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,663
Look at the <i>yeot!</i>

233
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,582
It looks so good.

234
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,002
He's making that sound
with the scissors so well!

235
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,882
Wait here.

236
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,728
Excuse me.

237
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,023
We haven't opened yet.

238
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,738
I'm looking for someone.

239
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:15,495
Do you know a Japanese man named Sachimoto
who frequents this shop?

240
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,083
I heard that he was a painter.

241
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,837
I've known two Sachimotos in my life,

242
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,382
but they were both soldiers, not painters.

243
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,802
I heard he was a regular here.

244
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,553
I'm not sure.

245
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,807
I've been working here
for almost six months now,

246
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,726
but I haven't met such a man.

247
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,895
I see.

248
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,149
Why don't you try
the House of Golden Treasure?

249
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,321
Master Jang Tae-sang runs the place.

250
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,992
They say you must go through him
if you want anything in Bonjeong,

251
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,497
whether it be money,
property, or a person.

252
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,791
He's Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong.

253
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,751
What was that?

254
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,796
I asked if that thing outside
was for sale.

255
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,050
Oh, that?

256
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,886
It's broken. The engine's busted.

257
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,723
I'll buy it. How much do you want?

258
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,521
Judging by your appearance,
you must be from Manchuria, right?

259
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,314
- Say, 200 won?
- Hey!

260
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,483
It has a sidecar and everything.

261
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,568
Make it 300 won!

262
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,779
You said it was broken.

263
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,824
It's worthless junk
if you leave it like that.

264
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,784
A diamond on a dunghill
is still a diamond,

265
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,454
just as a broken motorcycle
is still a motorcycle!

266
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,211
Fine.

267
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,214
Make it 280 won, then.

268
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,926
- 280?
- Yes.

269
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,157
I will buy all of these and the bike

270
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,534
for 250 won.

271
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,453
I don't accept Chinese bills.

272
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,945
Did that kid strike gold or something?

273
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,532
My goodness!
I said it was broken, didn't I?

274
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,495
It's been there for over three years,
weathering the hail, snow, and rain.

275
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,581
There's no way you can get it to...

276
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,763
Forget it! There's no need to worry.

277
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,057
Hey. Don't look so serious.

278
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,769
I mean, who are you?
You're Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong.

279
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,855
We'll contact all your sources
and look for the girl.

280
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,441
Where else would Myeong-ja
of Spring Moon Hall be?

281
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,860
She probably eloped with a guy or--

282
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,739
What man in Gyeongseong
would be stupid enough

283
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,617
to run off with Ishikawa's girl?

284
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,165
Wait, could this be another case
of the recent disappearances of women?

285
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,211
It's causing quite a stir
all over Bukchon and Namchon.

286
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,172
They keep on disappearing, you know.

287
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,677
I've heard some horrible rumors.
What if Myeong-ja is a victim?

288
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,846
Gosh, this is bad. Real bad.

289
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,515
What do we do now?

290
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,769
Master Jang,

291
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,732
why don't we take this chance
to just sell everything and leave Joseon?

292
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,359
I have a close friend in Osaka--

293
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,320
Stop with the nonsense, Mr. Gu!

294
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,823
Let me talk for once, please!

295
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:24,327
Why do you shoot me down
every time I try to say something?

296
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,330
Because you always spit out
mindless drivel. That's why.

297
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,498
I do think before I speak, you know!

298
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,751
I'm not as short-sighted as you think!

299
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,921
Let's say Master Jang does put up
his real estate in a hurry.

300
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,759
The rumors will spread like wildfire
across Gyeongseong.

301
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,720
So what? Is that such a bad thing?

302
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,848
Then Ishikawa will hear about it.

303
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,183
And when he does,

304
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,769
what would he do to Master?

305
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,524
My bad.

306
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,235
I didn't think it through.

307
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,339
Ishikawa has a lot of eyes on me.

308
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,133
- Mr. Gu.
- Yes, go on.

309
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,969
Contact every informant
and connection we have,

310
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,847
and look for leads on Myeong-ja.

311
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,225
Find out whatever she did
before she went missing.

312
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,476
All right.

313
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,061
Sounds like a good plan.

314
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,856
Let's do everything we can, Mrs. Nawol.

315
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,817
Beom-o.

316
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,903
Go and find Young Master Kwon Jun-taek.

317
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,238
Why do you need him?

318
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,241
He's the only man in Gyeongseong

319
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,993
audacious enough
to mess with Ishikawa's girl.

320
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,578
Tell him to come here.

321
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,622
Yes, sir.

322
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,040
Mrs. Nawol.

323
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,544
Start selling the most expensive items
in the vault

324
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,172
as quickly and discreetly as possible.

325
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,134
Take gold as well as cash.
Secure as many funds as you can.

326
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,056
And look into ships
that set sail over the next month.

327
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,808
If need be,

328
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,812
we might really have to leave Gyeongseong.

329
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,314
Yes, Master.

330
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,049
Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong, huh?

331
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,261
He gets a lot of attention, indeed.

332
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,493
Jang Tae-sang is on the move, sir.

333
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:15,665
All of his employees have set out
to look for leads regarding Miss Akiko.

334
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,376
All right.

335
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,544
You're dismissed.

336
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,629
Yes, sir.

337
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,111
<i>I think I'm pregnant.</i>

338
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,573
Pregnant?

339
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,616
Yes.

340
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,285
With your child, sir.

341
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,131
Your wife called, sir.

342
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,843
She wishes to know
when you will be coming home today.

343
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,511
Tell her not to wait.

344
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,474
I'll be very late
due to the missing persons case.

345
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,018
Yes, sir. I'll let her know.

346
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,525
Yes.

347
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,694
I see.

348
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,364
No. Yes.

349
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,866
Bye, then.

350
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,965
Get up, all of you. To your positions!

351
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,511
Hurry up! Move your ass!

352
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,726
What's happening?

353
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,228
Don't make a sound.

354
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,021
Keep your head down.

355
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,731
What?

356
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,754
Will two be enough?

357
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,882
Yes. That will be enough for now.

358
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:40,935
This one.

359
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,187
- Take her out.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,776
Don't kill me.

361
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,611
Please don't kill me!

362
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,243
Tell me about that one.

363
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,040
We brought her
from Seodaemun Prison a while ago,

364
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,709
but her condition is a bit...

365
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,211
Let me see.

366
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,881
- Take her out.
- Yes, sir.

367
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,581
Heads down!

368
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,916
What shall we do, sir?

369
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,376
Please don't kill me!

370
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,092
Don't do this.

371
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,099
These two will do.

372
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,519
Please don't kill me.

373
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,854
Please don't!

374
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,273
Please!

375
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,233
Let me live.

376
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,152
Please don't kill me!

377
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,121
Don't kill me!

378
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,553
What is it?

379
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,765
Can you give me a ride to Bukchon?
I have to meet someone there.

380
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
What?

381
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,769
You speak the Joseon tongue.

382
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,688
You must be bored
from watching me all day.

383
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,775
Why don't you have some fun
by giving me a ride?

384
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,696
You were going to tail me anyway,
so let's not make this complicated.

385
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,989
Seriously...

386
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,199
Hey, wait...

387
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,867
Let us go to Bukchon.

388
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,000
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:35,187
My goodness, are you trying to empty out
the secret vault in your shop?

390
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,813
Dear me...

391
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,858
All the items are of the highest quality.
No need to check.

392
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,738
Well, that goes without saying.
They're from the House of Golden Treasure.

393
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,200
Can you get it done in ten days?

394
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,536
Ten days? That's a bit tight.

395
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,335
It isn't like you to rush things.
What's the hurry?

396
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:01,505
Has Master Jang really decided
to leave Gyeongseong?

397
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,342
The rumors have spread all over town!

398
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:09,680
That he's in a pickle
because of Ishikawa's mistress or whatnot.

399
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,017
Shut your trap,
or I will sew it shut for you.

400
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:19,982
Actually, I'm only bringing this up
because I heard that sleuths are in town.

401
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,651
They could be of some help to Master Jang.

402
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,695
Sleuths?

403
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,949
Yes, sleuths.
They're experts at finding missing people.

404
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,536
In Manchuria, they call them sleuths.

405
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,162
Go on.

406
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,207
I know a friend
whose older cousin's daughter

407
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,460
went missing for three years
after she disappeared during Dano.

408
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,129
But then those sleuths

409
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,549
went all the way to Southern China
and brought her back.

410
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,552
She was forced to be a comfort girl,
but they still found her!

411
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,304
They went to Southern China?

412
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,723
Yeah, not to mention
every corner of Joseon.

413
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,600
They cover Manchuria, Yanbian,
Southern China, you name it.

414
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,687
If the person is already dead,
they bring back the bones at least.

415
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,272
Is that right?

416
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,693
Where can I find these sleuths?

417
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,012
Thanks for the ride.
It was nice and comfortable.

418
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,605
- Wait...
- Don't...

419
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,523
Hey!

420
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,817
Treat yourself to a meal.

421
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,447
I won't tell Ishikawa, so just take it.

422
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,125
What the heck?

423
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,351
Welcome, sir! How many of you are there?

424
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,186
I'm not here to dine.

425
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,481
I need to pass through your back door.

426
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,691
This way, Master Jang.

427
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,177
IDIOT

428
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,305
Who are you?

429
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,516
Why are you following me?

430
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,147
You don't seem like
one of Ishikawa's underlings.

431
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,107
Who do you work for?

432
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,110
Tell me who sent you here!

433
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,030
Master Jang of Golden Treasure?

434
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,783
It's bad manners to answer a question
with a question.

435
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,702
Not to mention...

436
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,040
that you're carrying
such a dangerous item.

437
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,385
Are you here to kill me?

438
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,929
I wasn't planning on it.

439
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,265
But now, I'm rather tempted to do so.

440
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,935
I'll take that as a no.

441
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,770
Lower your knife so we can talk.

442
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,273
Why don't you lower your gun first
before you ask?

443
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,650
Okay, fine.

444
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,571
Let's both lower our weapons
on the count of three.

445
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,657
Now.

446
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,200
One.

447
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,452
Two.

448
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,872
Three.

449
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,378
I see that you don't trust me.

450
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,172
I could say the same about you.

451
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,049
Are you a hitman?

452
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,385
You must have led quite a shady life

453
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,220
to keep fearing for your life like that.

454
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,181
We live in such times, do we not?

455
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,893
You can't survive
without committing a crime.

456
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,148
And even the innocent can die
for all sorts of reasons.

457
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,007
What do you want from me?

458
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,218
I heard that you're Mr. Omniscient.

459
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,680
Then you must know that my prices vary
depending on the information.

460
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:11,894
It's quite the range of prices
from high to low-level information.

461
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,729
I'm looking for someone.

462
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,397
He's Japanese.

463
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,733
- Occupation?
- A painter.

464
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:22,821
Unless he's a soldier or a high official,
his information is considered low-level.

465
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,657
Unfortunately,
I don't deal with low-level information.

466
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:29,452
It takes too much work
and barely makes any money.

467
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,996
Sachimoto is his name.

468
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,666
- I don't know him.
- He's in his mid-30s.

469
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,251
No clue.

470
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:41,131
He wasn't fluent in Joseon tongue,
which means he hadn't been here for long.

471
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,591
I still haven't got a clue.

472
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,936
I'm looking for my mother
who went missing ten years ago.

473
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,443
So,

474
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,279
Sachimoto must be the lover
she ran away with.

475
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:05,697
What?

476
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,783
Ten years is quite a long time.

477
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,453
If she's started a new family,
it might be best not to look for--

478
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,998
Rude bastard.

479
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:20,087
Your crude words tell me
that you're not Mr. Omniscient,

480
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,131
but Mr. Trash of this city.

481
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,765
Well, I won't deny it.

482
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,893
I was born trash,

483
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,730
and I've lived a trashy
and desperate life to get here.

484
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,859
Watch that mouth of yours.

485
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,029
Your vain words
will lead you to die in vain.

486
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,033
What's your name?

487
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,086
You have quite beautiful eyes.

488
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,848
Are you taunting me?

489
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,228
Should I pluck your eyes out?

490
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,318
Either way, it was nice meeting you.

491
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,237
You're crazy.

492
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,996
Till we meet again.

493
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,630
She's looking for Sachimoto?

494
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,091
Sachimoto...

495
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,720
Mr. Sachimoto, you have been summoned.

496
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,269
What's the occasion, my friend?
You rarely send word to me.

497
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,109
Do you know where that girl Myeong-ja is?

498
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,361
Myeong-ja?

499
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,030
Myeong-ja, Myeong...

500
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,534
The cheeky courtesan
from Spring Moon Hall?

501
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,831
She once professed her love for me
while in my arms.

502
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,835
But then she became Ishikawa's mistress
and broke my heart.

503
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,588
Why are you asking me?

504
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,634
It's been a week since she disappeared.
You didn't know?

505
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,180
I know she's gone missing,
but I don't know where she is, silly.

506
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,519
Why? Did you think I kidnapped her
and hid her away?

507
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,232
So you don't know.

508
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,526
Why not

509
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,654
take this chance
to put your money to good use?

510
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,074
I heard the news.

511
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,867
You're going to lose it all
to Ishikawa anyway.

512
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,121
Wouldn't it be nice to spend it
on our patriotic comrades?

513
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,623
You will get to be a patriot,

514
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,001
and our comrades will gain
a wealthy benefactor.

515
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,259
Who said I'm going to lose it?

516
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,554
I just have to find the girl, that's all.

517
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:43,225
If she could be found,
Ishikawa would have found her already.

518
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,186
It's been a week,
but there's still no sign of her.

519
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,772
That's why he dragged you in.

520
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,401
But I'm sure you know that already.

521
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,073
You're drunk.

522
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,991
You should go home.

523
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:04,538
You may have earned your money like a dog,
but don't you spend it like one!

524
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,128
If money

525
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,340
cannot be used to help someone,
let alone be spent,

526
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,094
it'll be nothing but a pile of dust.

527
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,347
Don't obsess over the meaningless.

528
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,059
I earned my money like a dog,
so I can spend it like one too.

529
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,480
I put my life on the line to earn it.
Can't I spend it however I want?

530
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,816
Do you have no place for Joseon
in your heart?

531
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,568
No desire to do something for our country?

532
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,113
I've never known the kind of Joseon
without Japan!

533
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,742
I was born without a father and a country.
What do you want me to do about it?

534
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,496
It's fine if you insult me,

535
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,082
but don't insult my money.

536
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,462
I may have worked like a dog to earn it,
but it means something to me.

537
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,757
I don't care if it's a pile of dust
or a pile of crap.

538
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,679
My money and fortune made me who I am,
and they keep me safe even now. Got that?

539
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:24,159
I was just about to head home.
Can you give me a ride?

540
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,506
Come in.

541
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,139
Test Subject One is showing symptoms.

542
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,774
It's faster than usual.

543
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,151
Would you like to see it?

544
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,907
Help me.

545
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,910
My head...

546
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,455
Please help me.

547
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,959
My head is aching so much!

548
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,878
It hurts so much!

549
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,047
The serum?

550
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,549
Not injected yet, sir.

551
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,519
Another failure, then?

552
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,359
What about Room Two?

553
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,821
She has been quiet so far.

554
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,739
What should we do?

555
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,700
Shall I inject the serum?

556
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,869
Proceed.

557
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:51,997
Yes, sir.

558
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,819
You've returned.

559
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,072
Mrs. Nawol. You're still here?

560
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,033
Actually, I have been waiting for you.

561
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:33,330
The broker introduced me
to these people called sleuths.

562
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:37,459
Apparently, they are experts
in finding missing people.

563
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,534
So, how exactly do you find
the missing people?

564
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,287
It depends on the situation.

565
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,374
But I'm sure there's a process
that works particularly well.

566
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,335
A secret method or special approach
that only you know...

567
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,253
Nothing?

568
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,548
We do not give up.

569
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:29,093
We don't give up on the person
that needs to be found.

570
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:33,681
Our method is to track them persistently
to the ends of the earth.

571
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,644
How many have you found that way?

572
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,272
If we don't seem reliable,
you can find someone else.

573
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,735
I'm about to entrust you
with a serious task.

574
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,070
It's only right for me
to perform a simple check.

575
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,115
We aren't interested enough
to put up with such a thing.

576
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:56,371
We have taken more than 200 cases
over the past ten years.

577
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,083
Of those, we have found about 140.

578
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,335
Including the dead.

579
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,670
You don't have to answer his questions.

580
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,090
He's not Mr. Omniscient of Gyeongseong.

581
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,091
He's Mr. Trash.

582
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,468
Chae-ok.

583
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,220
I refuse to work for such a man.

584
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,099
Just what did you do?

585
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,726
I didn't do anything.

586
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,772
All I said was that her eyes

587
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,734
were quite beautiful.

588
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,654
- Pardon?
- Let's go, Chae-ok.

589
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,408
Sachimoto, you said?

590
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,494
A Japanese man.

591
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,081
A painter in his mid-30s.

592
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,877
I thought you didn't deal
with low-level information.

593
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,589
In principle, I don't.

594
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,549
But the situation calls for it.

595
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:55,012
If it changes depending on the situation,
that's an anomaly, not a principle.

596
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,557
Let's call it flexibility
in dealing with urgent situations.

597
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,434
Maybe you're just being crafty?

598
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,894
That's how desperate I am.

599
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,897
You're also that pathetic, you know that?

600
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,984
In this city,

601
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,071
I'm the man to talk to
for Japanese connections.

602
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,824
Be it Government-General officials,
businessmen,

603
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,743
doctors, or judges...

604
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,246
I have connections to anyone, anywhere.

605
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,790
If you have that many connections
and information,

606
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,420
you can find Myeong-ja
of Spring Moon Hall on your own.

607
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,923
If she's still alive, that is.

608
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,218
Most times, when I pull this many strings,

609
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,472
any kind of lead will surface
within half a day.

610
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,933
But since I haven't heard anything so far...

611
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,936
Do you think she might be dead?

612
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,604
Whatever the case, please find her.

613
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,607
In the meantime, I will ask around
for information on Sachimoto.

614
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,945
You don't have to.
We'll take care of our own business.

615
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,989
Aren't you looking for your mother?

616
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,249
I'm sure I can be of help.

617
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,459
I guarantee it.

618
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,837
Let me ask you one thing.

619
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,052
Are you a good man or a bad man?

620
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,937
I'm just...

621
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,858
a man who is determined to survive.

622
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,617
How much time can you give us?

623
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,911
Father.

624
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,208
Until the cherry blossoms fall.

625
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,527
What do I need to draw today?

626
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,945
Go to Room Two.

627
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,617
You may step closer for a better look.

628
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,622
But don't get too close.

629
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,167
It could be dangerous.

630
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:31,836
Yes, sir.

631
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,658
Excuse me.
Can I shine a light for a moment?
