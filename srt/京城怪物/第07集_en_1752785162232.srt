Mother...

3
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,320
Mother?

4
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,880
Master Jang!

5
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,770
What's wrong?

6
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,270
Are you badly hurt?

7
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,530
Help me.

8
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,850
Master Jang...

9
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,260
<i>Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.</i>

10
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,540
Master Jang.

EPISODE 7
CHASE

13
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,900
16 HOURS EARLIER

14
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,780
The time allocated to us is ten minutes.

15
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,950
<i>We start moving at six o'clock sharp.</i>

16
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,620
Block all entryways to the military ward.

17
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,710
Yes, sir!

18
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,720
Everyone must get in the truck
within those ten minutes.

19
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,970
What if we fail
to get everyone on board in time?

20
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
What happens then?

21
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,390
The truck will leave on time regardless.

22
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,690
Are you all ready?

23
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,630
Then,

24
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,210
let's begin.

25
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,570
Careful.

26
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,460
Let's have the women go first.

27
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,590
Climb up.

28
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,800
Hold on to it.

29
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,430
Hold on tight.

30
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,890
You can do this.

31
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Slowly.

32
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,340
They have stolen our uniforms
in an attempt to escape.

33
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,930
Search and find anyone
who looks suspicious or unfamiliar.

34
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,340
Yes, sir!

35
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
What about this area?

36
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,940
Has it already been searched?

37
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,610
No, three soldiers went in to search
a short while ago.

38
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,990
Then why don't I see any lights?

39
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,920
You need to hurry!

40
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,630
If you don't move fast,
we might all die here.

41
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,750
Go on!

42
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,590
Slowly.

43
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,670
Grab it.

44
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,430
Slowly.

45
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,570
Why aren't you getting in line?

46
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,450
I'm standing guard.

47
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,080
Women go first, remember?

48
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,990
I thought I made myself clear.

49
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,790
I take care of my own business.

50
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes, you made yourself very clear,
but you need to listen to me right now.

51
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,000
Get in line.

52
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,130
Do you have feelings for me?

53
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,900
Why would you ask such a random thing?

54
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,070
In the middle of this?

55
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,150
If you don't,

56
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,110
I refuse any unnecessary concerns
you have for me.

57
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,500
Careful!

58
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,710
Be careful!

59
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,920
Shit!

60
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,520
You have to move your truck quickly!

61
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,100
- Right now!
- Okay!

62
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,290
We have to move. Now!

63
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,090
Hurry!

64
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,640
- Let's move!
- Go on, hurry!

65
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,100
Just a bit more.

66
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,680
There you go. Slowly.

67
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,280
They're on the second floor.
Move your asses!

68
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,120
Faster now!

69
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,210
Yes, sir!

70
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,430
What do we do now?

71
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,940
They're onto us because of me!

72
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,520
Don't blame yourself.

73
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,360
It's not your fault.

74
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,740
They're going to swarm this place
any minute now.

75
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,490
We're all going to die.

76
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,950
No one's going to die.

77
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,660
We'll all be getting out of here,
so pull it together and hang in there.

78
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,630
You should head down.

79
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,460
I'll hold them off on my own.

80
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,470
Are you trying to be the hero?

81
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,050
I'm just trying to buy some time.

82
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,100
No. Let's deal with them quickly
and go down together.

83
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,980
Aren't we on the same side?

84
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,230
Why do you argue with everything I say?

85
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,560
We can be on the same side
and still disagree.

86
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,820
If we can't share
different opinions freely,

87
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,320
we'll no longer be on the same side.

88
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Wouldn't you agree?

89
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,140
I'll help too.

90
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,440
Let's save our bullets
and fire only when we have a clear shot.

91
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,220
Do not spare a single one of them!

92
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,340
Yes, sir!

93
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,590
Attack!

94
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,890
What exactly is going on
in this hospital right now?

95
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Are you sure it has nothing to do
with the serial disappearance?

96
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,400
Do you really wish to know
the truth about this hospital?

97
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,820
If so, you'll have to get permission
from the Governor-General first,

98
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,950
or you can return home
and ask Lady Maeda yourself.

99
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,990
What do you mean by that?

100
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,410
I mean that no outsiders
should be allowed to find out

101
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,710
what goes on in here.

102
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,840
And not a single Josenjing
that has set foot in this place

103
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,090
gets to walk out of here alive.

104
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,350
That is all I can tell you.

105
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,600
Even if that person
is someone I've been searching for?

106
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,270
There will be no exceptions.

107
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,240
Hold your fire!

108
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,090
Move forward.

109
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,150
Persistent bastards!

110
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,950
Are you hurt?

111
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,580
It's just a graze.

112
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,290
Are you all right?

113
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
I'm fine.

114
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,380
What about you?

115
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,260
Can you get up?

116
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,520
Try to stand up.

117
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,060
You said you wanted to meet your mother.

118
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,020
So let's get out of here.

119
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,730
Stay with me, please!

120
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,050
Please remember me.

121
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,470
My name is...

122
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,440
Choi Yeong-gwan.

123
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,360
And my address...

124
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,780
It's 9 Sangwangsimni-jeong...

125
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,580
Tell my mother...

126
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,790
that I miss her.

127
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,800
Please.

128
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,510
Let's escape together.

129
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,970
We can do it.

130
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,350
We promised to leave together, remember?

131
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,940
So, please... Please!

132
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,650
Please!

133
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,420
Don't blame yourself.

134
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,550
It's not your fault.

135
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,840
He didn't deserve this.

136
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,560
Neither did my mother.

137
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,030
Nor did all those people
who were kept in that underground prison.

138
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,660
But why...

139
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,240
Just why...

140
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,840
Come on. We should go.

141
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,130
Let's say we make it out alive.

142
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,140
Is there such a thing as hope
waiting for us?

143
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Well...

144
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,270
I don't know about hope,

145
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,270
but I don't plan on going down
without a fight.

146
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,530
You see,

147
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,990
I'm going to survive as long as I can.

148
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,950
I'm going to live

149
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,540
to give them
an endless, irritating headache,

150
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,960
to make their lives uncomfortable...

151
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,800
and to be a living reminder

152
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,090
of the things they did to us.

153
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,430
I will never

154
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,180
make it easy for them to kill me.

155
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,230
Everyone made it down.
You should get moving as well.

156
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,240
Let's retreat and get out of here.

157
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,210
There is no more time to delay!

158
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,430
March in at once
and kill every Josenjing inside!

159
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,140
- Yes, sir!
- Wait.

160
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,440
Here. Step up.

161
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,090
I'll see you at the bottom.

162
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,620
Would you like to go first?

163
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,460
What's the matter?

164
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,340
I'm afraid one of us has to stay behind.

165
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,970
<i>What do you mean?</i>

166
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,310
The director wants all the Josenjings
to be captured alive.

167
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,980
Captured alive?

168
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,440
We've already lost six of our men!

169
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,610
An order is an order,
First Sergeant Haneda!

170
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,280
Kill them all. We spare none!

171
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,740
Capture them alive!

172
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,880
What was that?

173
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,920
What just happened?
What about Master Jang?

174
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,670
He's not coming down.

175
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,010
<i>One of us has to stay behind?</i>

176
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,640
Until the truck leaves
Ongseong Hospital safely,

177
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,390
someone has to stay behind
and divert their attention.

178
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,060
Are you...

179
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,850
Once you get down,
leave this place at once.

180
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,070
I don't know how long I can hold them off,
but I'll try my best to buy you time.

181
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,330
We aren't leaving him behind.

182
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,830
It's his decision!

183
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,830
Move.

184
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,080
You're wasting time. Get in the truck!

185
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,250
I said move!

186
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,420
Look at those people!

187
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,800
Are you trying to get them killed?

188
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,180
Chae-ok.

189
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,830
<i>Mr. Gu.</i>

190
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,130
No matter what happens,
you must leave on time.

191
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,260
Even if some haven't gotten on the truck,

192
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,380
and even if that's Master Jang,

193
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,010
you must not delay.

194
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,970
Do you understand?

195
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,480
God damn it!

196
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,960
I'll take full responsibility.
Get in there now and kill them all!

197
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,830
Listen, Sergeant Haneda--

198
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,420
I'll report to Director Ichiro myself.

199
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,510
What are you waiting for? Move now!

200
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,510
Yes, sir!

201
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,720
Damn it!

202
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,500
Yes, sir.

203
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,210
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,470
Search every corner!

205
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,260
Find whatever you can!

206
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,400
He went that way!

207
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,110
He seems to be heading to Area N
on the west side, sir.

208
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,040
I'm certain of its authenticity.

209
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,670
This porcelain was crafted
in the late 18th century

210
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,920
during the reign
of King Jeongjo of Joseon.

211
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,010
Yes.

212
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Are you sure?

213
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,440
All right, then. I will.

214
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,740
They're taking quite a while, sir.

215
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,040
Sir!

216
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Young Master!

217
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,230
Sir!

218
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,900
I'm sorry!

219
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,400
- Don't kill me!
- Sir...

220
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,860
Please have mercy. Please don't kill me!

221
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
It's all right now.

222
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,400
Please forgive me.

223
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,530
You're safe now.

224
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,740
I beg you. Please spare me.

225
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,990
Have mercy on me. Please don't kill me.

226
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,330
Please have mercy...

227
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,830
Don't kill me!

228
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,550
Let's go.

229
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,630
Mr. Ishikawa?

230
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,130
Mr. Ishikawa!

231
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,830
Thank you, Mr. Ishikawa.

232
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,120
I knew you would come to save me.

233
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,160
Are you hurt?

234
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,800
Our child is fine too.

235
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,510
First,

236
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,590
you should bathe.

237
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,180
Please forgive me, sir!

238
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,810
But when I got here,
the woman was already gone!

239
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,610
She was already gone?

240
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,530
Then why are you locked in there?

241
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,530
I'm terribly sorry, sir!

242
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,120
Sir, Mr. Soma is behind this.

243
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,740
What?

244
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,250
That's right, sir!

245
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,380
I'm certain it was Mr. Soma.

246
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,710
Mr. Soma?

247
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,050
Mr. Soma!

248
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,970
Help me, Mr. Soma!

249
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:37,690
Mr. Soma!

250
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,900
Soma, that prick.

251
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,400
Wait.

252
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,780
What is it?

253
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,660
Did you drink...

254
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,580
the water in this cup?

255
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,580
No. I didn't drink it, sir.

256
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,330
I was tied up all this time.

257
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,420
Then

258
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,880
who drank it?

259
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,050
Well,

260
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,840
I'm not certain of that.

261
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,970
Lieutenant Colonel Kato.

262
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,010
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

263
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,600
It doesn't matter
who drank the water in this cup.

264
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,360
All the test subjects
in our underground prison are gone.

265
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,030
They're all gone, including the girl
who Lady Maeda entrusted to us!

266
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,610
Do you understand?

267
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,660
Go and look
for that son of a bitch Soma right now!

268
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
Return to the barracks and stand by.

269
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,670
Yes, sir!

270
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,420
- You.
- Yes, sir!

271
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,220
Who else did you say
had entered this room?

272
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,140
Well...

273
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,470
Take off your clothes.

274
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,940
It was those four people, sir.

275
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I see.

276
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,660
All right. You may go.

277
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,050
Could this mean

278
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,510
that one of those four...

279
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,640
drank from this cup?

280
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,850
At long last,

281
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,770
I got you!

282
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,520
I don't think
they're going to let us go easily.

283
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,920
Out of the way!

284
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,980
- Don't lose them!
- Yes, sir!

285
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:53,840
Attention, everyone!
Take as much as you want!

286
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,630
Master Jang of Golden Treasure
is treating everyone in Bonjeong!

287
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,140
Come, people.

288
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,430
- Is it free?
- Just for tonight.

289
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,930
Have as much as you want.

290
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Everyone, this way!

291
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,720
Over here!

292
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,520
Beer is on the house today!
Have as much as you want!

293
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,690
Drink up. Come this way!

294
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,290
Damn it!

295
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,080
Back up quickly.

296
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,580
We'll take the side road.

297
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,500
Hurry!

298
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,560
Move! Get out of the way!

299
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,930
Goodness! My apologies, Officer!

300
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,150
Step on it! Come on!

301
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,570
We have to catch them
before they leave Bonjeong.

302
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,740
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

303
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,490
Get out.

304
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,570
What?

305
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,740
I... I don't understand...

306
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,950
Get out!

307
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,950
Oh my, I didn't know
you spoke the Joseon tongue.

308
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,000
Sure, of course.

309
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,220
Who's in the truck?

310
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,470
What on Earth are you talking about?

311
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,720
No one's in it.

312
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,520
After I dropped off Myeong-ja,
no one else got in.

313
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
I'm telling the truth!

314
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,270
Is that right?

315
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,610
Officer! What is the meaning of this?

316
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,700
How did this happen?!

317
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,080
Where did they all go?

318
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,670
Where are all the Josenjings
you smuggled out of Ongseong Hospital?

319
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,220
I already told you.

320
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,850
No one but Myeong-ja got in the truck.

321
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,810
Akiko was the only one
Mr. Ishikawa wanted.

322
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,060
We returned Myeong-ja to him as promised.

323
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,690
That is all. Happy now?

324
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,580
Get changed!

325
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,710
Drink all you want!

326
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,680
Goodness! My apologies, Officer!

327
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,830
Easy now.

328
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,510
We have to catch them
before they leave Bonjeong.

329
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:13,640
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

330
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,830
You have all come a long way.

331
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,160
I'm afraid we don't have time
for introductions.

332
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,670
Hurry along for now.

333
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,130
Let's hurry. Go.

334
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,590
Let's go. Come on.

335
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,430
Are you

336
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,720
from the House of Golden Treasure?

337
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,140
Unfortunately,

338
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,230
Master Jang did not make it out with us.

339
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,360
I wish you a safe trip.

340
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,320
Let me ask one thing.

341
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,030
Was all of this

342
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,950
part of his plan from the start?

343
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,460
You must not know it yet,

344
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,170
but you must go through Master Jang
if you want anything in Bonjeong.

345
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,170
Be it money, property, people,
or someone's life,

346
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,090
Master Jang has a hand in everything.

347
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,810
That is what he really does
as the owner of Golden Treasure.

348
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,190
Arrest this man!

349
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,780
Search the streets of Bonjeong.

350
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,910
Arrest anyone
who seems even remotely suspicious!

351
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,330
Get to work!

352
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,410
Yes, sir!

353
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,350
Clean everything up!

354
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:16,630
<i>Until the cherry blossoms fall.</i>

355
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,810
Could he still be alive?

356
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,770
Master Ishikawa has just sent a message.

357
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,780
He will not be returning home tonight.

358
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,210
My apologies, Lady Maeda.

359
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,840
I am deeply ashamed.

360
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:30,430
I have already given you
enough chances, Director.

361
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,730
You asked for a hospital,
so I built one for you.

362
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:39,230
You wanted to experiment,
so I spared no expense in my support.

363
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,650
Ma'am, I will rectify this situation
no matter what it takes.

364
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,990
And by what means?

365
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,200
How do you plan on recapturing
the test subjects that escaped?

366
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,830
What about Akiko,
who has dropped out of sight?

367
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,830
How do you intend to find them all?

368
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,210
I'll come up with a plan right away.

369
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,800
If you could give me some time,
I'll take responsibility--

370
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,010
Please step down.

371
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:15,060
That is the one and only way you can
take responsibility for this incident.

372
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:26,110
We have had success
in a significant experiment recently.

373
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,040
We have created an organism
that is on another level.

374
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:44,050
It will not only change the medical world,
but perhaps also human history itself.

375
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:47,760
I assure you,
you won't be disappointed this time.

376
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,590
Please give me another chance,

377
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,470
Lady Maeda.

378
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,810
Yes, that's right.

379
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,150
It's the Josenjing woman
you asked me to take special care of

380
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,440
all those years ago.

381
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,310
The specimen has been sedated
and locked in a cage for now.

382
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,480
Should we keep releasing the nitrogen?

383
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,440
Colonel Kato?

384
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,280
Who could it be?

385
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,200
The one that drank from the cup.

386
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,140
Hurry! Get in!

387
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
<i>I wonder,</i>

388
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:59,200
<i>who's the one that swallowed the Najin?</i>
