GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,710
<i>Ordinary life...</i>

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,130
<i>was all I ever dreamed of.</i>

4
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,220
<i>Gathering with my family for dinner</i>

5
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,890
<i>and sharing the day's stories.</i>

6
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,810
<i>Dreaming of the future</i>

7
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,770
<i>with the person I love.</i>

8
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,020
<i>Just like that.</i>

9
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,830
<i>I just wanted to live...</i>

10
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,790
<i>the ordinary life...</i>

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,250
<i>that everyone else has.</i>

12
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,310
<i>What a futile dream you had.</i>

13
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,360
In this world you live in,
the more you dream of such things,

14
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,780
the more painful life becomes.

15
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,200
Why are you keeping me here?

16
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,160
I was curious
as to what kind of person you were.

17
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,670
Seeing you like this,

18
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,300
I can tell you have Seishin's eyes.

19
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,970
Do you know my mother?

20
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,050
There's a time in life when we realize

21
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,230
that we are linked together
by chains of fate far more powerful

22
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,600
and mysterious than we'd expect.

23
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,440
For you, Ms. Yoon Chae-ok, Seishin, and I,

24
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,860
it seems that is the case.

25
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,740
He says he knows
where Yoon Chae-ok was taken.

26
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,450
Excuse me.

27
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,120
Do you really believe
what that kid is saying?

28
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,460
Can we believe him?

29
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,790
I'm sure of it.

30
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,960
I just saw her with my own eyes.

31
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,420
You bit the hand that fed you!

32
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,220
How could you do this
to Master Jang, you ingrate?

33
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,430
He's already heard those words from me.

34
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,760
When you were starving to death,

35
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,390
who took you in and made you
into a decent human being?

36
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,140
I already said that too.

37
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,900
I was told that Master Jang
wouldn't be harmed

38
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,650
and that he would be safe
if I reported the woman.

39
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,150
Lady Maeda said
this was all for Master Jang's sake.

40
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,700
My goodness, you thickheaded buffoon.
You actually believed that?

41
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,220
Where is it?
Where is Yoon Chae-ok being held?

42
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,100
Is the prey ready?

43
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,690
Lady Maeda sent us a Josenjing woman.

44
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,690
What are you doing?

45
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,110
Hold onto it for me.

46
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,530
If I don't make it back...

47
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,740
Master Jang.

48
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,870
...then sell this shop.

49
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,040
Please, Mrs. Nawol.

50
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,090
The short wicks go off after five minutes,

51
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,090
and the long ones after eight minutes.

52
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,800
Each explosive has a blast radius
of about five to six meters.

53
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,770
It probably won't knock down the building,
but it will deal a serious blow.

54
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,360
Look, Master Jang.

55
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,530
Master?

56
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,280
I wish you success.

57
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,370
Come back safely.

58
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,670
<i>Will you be okay on your own?</i>

59
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,340
I have already been inside once,
so I know my way around.

60
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,050
It's quicker and easier to move alone,
and getting caught is less likely.

61
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,550
Tae-sang--

62
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,810
Stay safe.

63
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,810
When this is all over,
let's have a drink at the Moonlight Bar.

64
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,570
Sounds good.

65
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,030
Let's go.

66
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,960
It seems
that I have underestimated Lady Maeda.

67
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,180
I didn't expect her
to have you brought here so quickly.

68
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,810
In a moment,

69
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,810
your father will be here as well.

70
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,900
It will be an interesting experiment.

71
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,190
I wonder,

72
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,280
between you and your father,

73
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,410
whose head will your mother devour first?

74
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,230
Hey!

75
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,520
Stop!

76
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,130
How is it...

77
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,930
How is it that

78
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,850
you people never get scared?

79
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,180
You know you can't win.

80
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,360
So, how can you still look at me
with those eyes?

81
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,190
I have a question for you too.

82
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,910
How are you all so unabashedly proud?

83
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,790
You violated my mother.

84
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,830
You trampled on my family's happiness.

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,420
Even after killing
so many innocent people...

86
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,930
how can you be so shameless?

87
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,400
My glorious results and achievements

88
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,990
are too great for the likes of you
to dare discuss, Josenjing.

89
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,540
Achievements?

90
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,080
Is that right?

91
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,840
Do you think justifying
and glorifying what you do...

92
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,300
will really erase your crimes?

93
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,100
You can pretend all you want,

94
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,230
but do you think you can hide
your people's inferiority complex?

95
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,070
Colonel Kato?

96
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,700
Colonel Kato!

97
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,500
What?!

98
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,880
Mother...

99
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,190
That's right.

100
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,740
Don't move!

101
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,780
Or your daughter will get hurt, Seishin.

102
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,500
Fire.

103
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,340
Fire!

104
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,890
No, stop!

105
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,140
No!

106
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,080
GYEONGSEONG CREATURE
BETWEEN THE END AND ANOTHER BEGINNING

107
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,750
EPISODE 10

108
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,510
You're returning to Tokyo next month?

109
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,890
I'm so jealous.

110
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,470
So, will your anatomy book
be published in Tokyo?

111
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,480
Probably.

112
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,360
Will you become famous, then?

113
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,820
She's beautiful.

114
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,820
Who is she? Your Joseon-born lover?

115
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,200
It's Seishin. Don't you remember?

116
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,410
Wait, <i>that</i> Seishin?

117
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,040
She had such a pretty face.

118
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,460
No wonder her husband
couldn't forget about her.

119
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Husband?

120
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,130
Yes. Haven't you heard?

121
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,640
Apparently, Seishin's husband
came looking for her.

122
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,430
He requested to meet his wife.

123
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,210
MILITARY USE
GASOLINE

124
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:37,910
Master Jang!

125
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,660
Mr. Yoon?

126
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,080
Bring all the nitrogen gas we have!
Release it all.

127
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,420
Don't let the creature
come up to Level Two!

128
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,550
Yes, sir!

129
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,090
Wait!

130
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,100
It's here. Stop it!

131
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,310
You five!

132
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,400
Grab her and follow me.

133
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,700
So, my daughter

134
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,870
has been captured
and brought back in here?

135
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,250
I'm sorry.

136
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,170
I should've taken better care of her.

137
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,850
Here.

138
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,360
A ship bound for Shanghai will be leaving
from Incheon in the morning.

139
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,400
Chae-ok is currently wanted
for shooting Director Ichiro.

140
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,110
You must get on that ship
right after you escape.

141
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,120
Master Jang...

142
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Leave the rest to me
and take Chae-ok with you.

143
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,080
That way, she'll agree to get on the ship.

144
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,620
No!

145
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,910
Shut the door quickly!

146
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,120
Move! Now!

147
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,210
Mother!

148
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,140
Hurry!

149
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,570
The specimen is currently
blocked off at Level 2-2.

150
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,070
And Colonel Kato?

151
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,110
Coming up the eastern emergency exit
with the Josenjing hostage.

152
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,410
Stop the specimen
at Level Two by all means.

153
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,700
It must not come up any further.
Understood?

154
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,620
Yes, sir!

155
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,330
Damn it.

156
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,210
Did you hear that? That was about Chae-ok.

157
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,220
The eastern emergency exit
is near the central elevator.

158
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,050
It's not far from here.
Let's head that way first.

159
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,930
What are you doing?

160
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,980
I'll take care of the rest.

161
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,860
Please take Chae-ok out with you.

162
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,570
No, this is my duty.

163
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,190
- Master Jang.
- Listen.

164
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,780
I have never once dumped
my responsibilities on someone else.

165
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,530
Moreover, this isn't something
I can leave in someone else's hands.

166
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,120
For Chae-ok's sake, I can't do that.
Don't you get it?

167
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,710
For Chae-ok's sake,

168
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,710
it's only right that you go to her.

169
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,880
Don't you get it?

170
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,050
Master Jang.

171
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,510
I'm someone who lives in the past.

172
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,480
But you and Chae-ok,
you two will live for the future.

173
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,570
Besides, it's my wife who is down there.

174
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,950
How could I let someone else

175
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,530
see to the last moments of my beloved?

176
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,830
Please take...

177
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,420
good care of Chae-ok.

178
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,100
Please be safe.

179
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,310
Colonel Kato!

180
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,270
How's the situation?

181
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,900
We're forming a defense line
to stop it from ascending,

182
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,400
but it would be best to shut down
the underground laboratory, just in case.

183
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,990
I must retrieve
some things from my office.

184
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,080
In ten minutes,

185
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,160
we're shutting this place down.

186
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,670
- Take the girl up with you.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,920
Damn it!

188
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,380
MILITARY USE
GASOLINE

189
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,630
Stay still,

190
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,380
or we will shoot you!

191
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,500
No!

192
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,590
Help me...

193
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,600
My stomach

194
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,680
hurts so much.

195
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,230
Please help me.

196
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,690
My stomach,

197
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,900
it hurts so much...

198
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,280
Save me...

199
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,240
Help me...

200
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,710
My stomach, it hurts so much...

201
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,990
This way.

202
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,340
<i>I have heard no news</i>

203
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Of the boat that left</i>

204
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,430
<i>On the day of</i> Chilseok

205
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,600
<i>Over there</i>

206
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,190
<i>Across the sea</i>

207
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,150
<i>The boat returns</i>

208
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:46,290
<i>And the song of the boatsman</i>

209
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,710
<i>Draws nearer and nearer</i>

210
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,640
<i>But you, my love</i>

211
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,930
<i>I've not heard from you</i>

212
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,520
<i>Ever since you left</i>

213
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,770
Honey.

214
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,980
Seong-sim!

215
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,580
It's time...

216
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,040
for us to leave here together.

217
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,690
Let's go.

218
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,540
The way out is this way, not that way.

219
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,660
My father and mother are still down there.

220
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,420
It was his last request!

221
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,930
I promised to get you out of here safely.

222
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,890
I made that promise to your father.

223
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,480
You met my father?

224
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
He said

225
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,440
he wanted to be with your mother.

226
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,060
There was a large explosion
at Ongseong Hospital just now.

227
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,490
Hey! I heard there was a loud explosion
over at Ongseong Hospital!

228
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,820
Loud enough to shake the buildings!

229
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,070
It's caused a hell of a ruckus.
The fire brigade is on its way!

230
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,070
Let's go!

231
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,690
- Put 'em out!
- Hurry!

232
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,860
Put the fire out!

233
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,950
Before it spreads all over!

234
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,610
Water! Bring more water!

235
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
- Bring more!
- Put it out now!

236
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,630
The specimen is nowhere to be seen, sir.

237
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,750
It wasn't found in Area One either.

238
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,590
Any chance it perished in the fire
or was crushed under the rubble?

239
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,510
Then there should be traces of it,
but there's nothing.

240
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,930
What? Where could it have gone?

241
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,360
The entrance to the yard is open,
thanks to the firefighters.

242
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,830
You'll be able to make your escape
amid the chaos.

243
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,960
We'll go on our own from here.

244
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,000
But--

245
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,460
You helped us escape the ward,
and we're more than grateful.

246
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,930
But I can't let you risk your life.

247
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,680
I sincerely apologize.

248
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,860
For the things that happened to you
and your mother...

249
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,820
I'd like to apologize.

250
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,120
I've been making excuses,
telling myself that

251
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,620
I have no choice given the time I live in.

252
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,750
But the truth is...

253
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,710
I was just...

254
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,130
one of the bystanders.

255
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,550
Please...

256
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,930
take care of yourself, Mr. Sachimoto.

257
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,650
Your papers.

258
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,230
Mr. Wang sent me.

259
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,570
It's a message from Master Jang.

260
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,110
Beom-o, go and bring Mr. Park over.

261
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,650
We need to use his rickshaw.

262
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,900
Mrs. Nawol, I'll do it.
A car is faster than a rickshaw.

263
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,030
And have the whole police bureau
take notice?

264
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,990
They won't. I'll be careful!

265
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,620
Forget it. Safety comes first.

266
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,200
Then I'll deliver it.

267
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,790
Well, a bicycle is faster than a rickshaw.

268
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,880
And the police won't care about me.

269
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,300
Please...

270
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,720
give me one chance to redeem myself.

271
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,310
Please?

272
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,910
Follow him.

273
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,880
Thanks.

274
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Go to Mrs. Nawol in the morning,
and she'll pay you.

275
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,550
Take care, Master Jang.

276
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,440
HEINOUS MURDERER

277
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,960
I arranged our ride to Incheon. Let's go.

278
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,310
Ms. Yoon.

279
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,310
Let's end it here.

280
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,940
I'll go alone from here.

281
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,450
What do you mean?

282
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,030
I'm the one who killed Director Ichiro.

283
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,410
I'm the one they're looking for.

284
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,080
I may have to live
the rest of my life on the run

285
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,380
without knowing
when I'll be captured and killed.

286
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,130
That's why I want you
to get on the ship with me.

287
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,380
I don't wish to drag you...

288
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,850
into my life of worries.

289
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,150
Do you...

290
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,240
not like me?

291
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,330
You know that's not what I mean.

292
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,910
Then it's all settled.

293
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,040
I'm going with you.

294
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,290
Master Jang.

295
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:11,880
I...

296
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,760
have already died once.

297
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,100
The reason I'm standing here

298
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,640
is because your father granted me

299
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,900
a bonus life, if you will...

300
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,780
to protect you.

301
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,280
To stay by your side.

302
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,950
They won't give up looking for me.

303
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,080
And I will never give you up.

304
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,170
I can't live without you.

305
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,040
You already know that.

306
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
No way.

307
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,200
We cannot delay any longer.
Let's get going so we don't miss the ship.

308
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,920
Wait.

309
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,720
- Beom-o, you came.
- Yes.

310
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,980
I'm a bit late because I had to lose
a tail along the way.

311
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,620
Well done, Shiro.

312
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,410
No.

313
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,870
Master, it's not what it looks like.
It really isn't. I swear!

314
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,380
Please believe me!

315
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,970
All right. Hide over there.

316
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,940
In any case,

317
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,190
I have to give it to you, Mr. Jang.

318
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:26,570
Once you set your eyes on something,
you acquire it by any means necessary.

319
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,700
But burning the hospital to the ground
like that was a bit too much.

320
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,250
Nothing compared to the things
you people did inside those walls.

321
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,500
So, what are you going to do now?

322
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,340
Will you really give everything up
for that seditious Joseon woman?

323
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,630
I believe I gave my answer.

324
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:08,110
There was a time
when I considered you a friend.

325
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,110
I suppose I'm losing a friend today.

326
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,160
Come to think of it,
I lost another friend of mine

327
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,460
just like this in the past.

328
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,920
At that time...

329
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,590
it was because of that girl's mother.

330
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,360
Now,

331
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,280
I ask you both to die here.

332
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,700
Goodbye.

333
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,110
Kill them!

334
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,540
Let's go.

335
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,640
Hang on.

336
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,480
Get up.

337
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,950
Get up.

338
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,310
Mother...

339
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,020
Stop this now.

340
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,900
I know you're in pain too.

341
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,210
This man...

342
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,590
This is the man I love.

343
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,260
So...

344
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:37,730
let's...

345
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,440
stop this now.

346
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,320
Let's end it here.

347
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,710
Ms. Yoon.

348
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,170
Ms. Yoon.

349
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,590
Ms. Yoon!

350
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,810
You'll be all right. Hang in there!

351
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,640
We promised to be together.

352
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,480
Try getting up.

353
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,280
Ms. Yoon, please get up.

354
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,660
The cherry blossoms...

355
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,830
have all fallen.

356
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,620
<i>Stay with me.</i>

357
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:23,790
Stay...

358
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,630
right by my side.

359
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:40,390
This can't be.

360
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,390
No...

361
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,150
No!

362
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,150
No!

363
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,280
No!

364
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,080
No...

365
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,000
No...

366
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:23,600
Please, no...

367
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,830
Colonel Kato!

368
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:24,410
Sir!

369
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,510
Colonel!

370
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,110
Colonel.

371
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Keep it down.

372
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,110
How amazing!

373
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,230
My friend asked me
to give this to you, ma'am.

374
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,810
Your friend?

375
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,030
Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

376
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,890
FAREWELL

377
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,220
FROM JANG TAE-SANG
OF HOUSE OF GOLDEN TREASURE

378
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,850
FROM AKIKO
COURTESAN OF SPRING MOON HALL

379
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,430
FROM PRIVATE CHOI YEONG-GWAN

380
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,150
FROM YOON JUNG-WON

381
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:41,230
FROM YOON CHAE-OK
SLEUTH

382
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,360
FROM CHOI SEONG-SIM

383
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,720
FAREWELL

384
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,740
"Justice prevails. You reap what you sow."

385
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,370
That's how it goes, you know.

386
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,090
You've been a big help.

387
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,340
If you hadn't come that day
and convinced Comrade Lee In-hyeok,

388
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,590
this rebellion wouldn't have happened.

389
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,560
Ultimately, you are the true patriot.

390
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,160
Thanks for the drink.

391
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:17,080
I'll see you again.

392
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,080
Comrade Jang!

393
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,000
What a huge achievement.

394
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,590
You really are a true hero and fighter
for our nation. Isn't that right?

395
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,390
- Hear, hear.
- That's right.

396
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,690
Are you in urgent need of money?

397
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,440
Pardon?

398
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,770
If you have anything useful,
bring it over.

399
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,860
I'll pay you handsomely.

400
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,160
By the way, I'm not Comrade Jang.

401
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,490
I'm Master Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

402
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,870
Well, then.

403
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:11,550
<i>Here's the truth, Tae-sang.</i>

404
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,220
When I was locked up
in the underground lab,

405
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,390
I gave your name up.

406
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:22,520
I ratted out my friend and my comrades

407
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,020
and begged for my life.

408
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:36,370
When this is all over,
let's have a drink at the Moonlight Bar.

409
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,380
Silk! Come take a look at our silk!

410
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,390
They are silk!

411
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,440
Ask them to bring some green onion.

412
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,400
Yes, please slice some of this meat.

413
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,740
Hey, excuse me. I'd like one <i>gukbap</i> !

414
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,130
Let's go inside. The night is cold.

415
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,970
<i>Spring went past unusually quickly
in Gyeongseong that year.</i>

416
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,200
<i>And in August of the same year,</i>

417
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,540
<i>we finally recovered
those that were taken from us.</i>

418
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,630
<i>As she once said,</i>

419
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,390
<i>the cherry blossoms</i>

420
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,430
<i>had already begun to fall.</i>

421
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:12,160
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

422
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,500
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

423
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,590
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

424
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:21,170
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

425
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,560
Lady Maeda.

426
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,530
As of today, Ongseong Hospital
is closing its doors.

427
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:55,330
Most of the doctors and nurses
will be returning to Japan.

428
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:00,630
You must also...

429
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,640
make a decision now.

430
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:08,970
Will you return to Kyoto,

431
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:10,310
or

432
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,600
will you continue
to explore new possibilities?

433
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,620
<i>As for me,</i>

434
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:18,620
<i>I'm still waiting
for the things I have dreamed of.</i>

435
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,160
Chae-ok.

436
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:39,180
IN REMEMBRANCE OF OUR COLLEAGUES
KIM HYEON-JUNG AND SEO JI-HUN

437
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,400
JUNE 25TH 4:20 A.M.

438
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,440
SILENT PROTEST

439
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:58,240
DREAMS COME TRUE

440
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:33,030
Ho-jae, we're ready. Let's go!
