1 YEAR AGO
ONGSEONG HOSPITAL, GYEONGSEONG

3
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,880
Ryu Sachimoto, graduated
from Tokyo University of the Arts...

4
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,090
You volunteered?

5
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,180
Yes.

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,770
To serve His Majesty
and the Empire of Japan--

7
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,350
And get paid well while you're at it.

8
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,990
What is this, sir?

9
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,660
It's called <i>Kaitai Shinsho.</i>

10
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
You mean a book on anatomy?

11
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,670
Books such as those have been around
in Germany since 1722.

12
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,580
Although lagging behind,

13
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,920
we're working to elevate
our empire's medical standards

14
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,340
here at Ongseong Hospital via a vast range
of research studies and experiments.

15
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,890
Your job is to keep a record of them.

16
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,600
So,

17
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,640
what I'm supposed to draw is...

18
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,570
Now, which part shall we work on today?

19
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,990
We have a new painter with us today.

20
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,830
Why don't we start off lightly
by opening up the abdomen?

21
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,330
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,540
Scalpel.

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,290
Please don't kill me.

24
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,000
Please. Please spare me!

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,380
Doctor! Please!

26
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,130
Please don't kill me!

27
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,020
Sachimoto!

28
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,110
Get back here at once!

29
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,650
<i>- I was merely a penniless painter.
-</i> Sachimoto!

30
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,410
<i>I needed money,</i>

31
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,240
<i>and I chose Joseon
because of the high pay, but...</i>

32
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,640
There's no need to cry.

33
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,860
You'll get used to it soon enough,
just like everyone else here.

34
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,820
That's the thing about humans.

35
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,830
We are quick to adapt to anything.

36
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,410
Whether it be longing...

37
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,460
or anguish.

38
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,050
Hey, time's up. Hurry up.

EPISODE 2
MOTHER

41
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,260
<i>Why have you accepted
such a man's request?</i>

42
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,850
Well, there was no reason not to.

43
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,730
That man will find the missing person.
We will obtain information on Sachimoto.

44
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,940
He is an insolent and shameless man.

45
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Don't be so quick to judge a person.

46
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,860
I can tell by the way he speaks,

47
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,910
and how he treats
others' problems so lightly.

48
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,080
We are nothing but mere sleuths to him.

49
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,080
We've reached an agreement.

50
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,670
All we need to do
is work toward our mutual benefit.

51
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,880
This case...

52
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,630
I have a bad feeling about it.

53
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,800
I had the same feeling on Manwol Island,

54
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,010
and you were badly hurt then.

55
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,810
This will be the last time, Chae-ok.

56
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,110
After this is over,

57
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,530
you should return home.

58
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,360
What about Mother?

59
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,700
Finding your mother is my fate
and my burden to bear.

60
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,290
I can't let you bear it any longer.

61
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,250
Father.

62
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,880
You should live your own life.

63
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,250
This is our last job together.

64
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,410
Until the cherry blossoms fall.

65
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,090
What do you think about those sleuths?

66
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,010
Do you think they have what it takes?

67
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,270
Judging by what they said,

68
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,730
they didn't strike me as amateurs.

69
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,230
Who's taking the next shift?

70
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,900
I heard it was Kinoshita.

71
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,400
Oh, the new kid?

72
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,650
He's no good.

73
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,640
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir!

74
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,840
How is it
that we can't find a single lead?

75
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,550
I combed through
Myeong-ja's favorite tea shops,

76
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,390
restaurants, boutiques, and shoe stores.
No one knows her whereabouts.

77
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,970
How is this possible?

78
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,770
I even visited
that rickshaw office she frequents,

79
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,190
but even they didn't know.

80
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,610
No one's given her a ride or seen her.

81
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,900
Gosh, is she gone with the wind?

82
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,900
She disappeared without a trace.

83
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,280
It's as if she evaporated. That's it.
Myeong-ja evaporated.

84
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,950
A person always leaves behind
some trace wherever they go.

85
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,450
We just haven't found it.

86
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,040
By the way, is that really
how they're tailing us right now?

87
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,800
Do they think we're idiots?

88
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,130
I mean, that's the most conspicuous tail
I have ever seen.

89
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,470
It's quite unsettling to pretend
to not notice them. Sheesh!

90
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,640
- Fighting over that chamber pot.
- Has he lost his mind?

91
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,820
Answer me!
What color does this look like to you?

92
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,320
Well...

93
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,280
It's white.

94
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,990
And what do you call
white porcelain in Joseon?

95
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,990
<i>Baekja,</i> sir.

96
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,620
Then...

97
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,580
what is this?

98
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,460
Answer me!

99
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,380
I'm asking you what this is!

100
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,170
Let's see.

101
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,010
How do I put this?

102
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,720
It's too shoddy
to be called fine porcelain.

103
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,930
It looks like
an ordinary piece of pottery to me.

104
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,890
And yet, I paid 100 won for that.

105
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,560
So what?

106
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,020
How much would you give me
if I were to pawn it here?

107
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,070
Do you have a written guarantee on you?

108
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,360
A receipt would also be fine.

109
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,910
I don't have either.

110
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,830
You shelled out 100 won for a chamber pot
that's barely worth 10 jeon,

111
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,080
and you don't have a guarantee
or a receipt?

112
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,460
It's clear to me that you were scammed.

113
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,050
This is a matter for the police bureau,
not a pawnshop.

114
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,470
Master Jang.

115
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,060
Be a good man and just take the pot.

116
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,940
I heard Ishikawa will be confiscating
everything you own.

117
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,770
Says who?

118
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,030
Everyone in Bonjeong
knows about it already.

119
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,610
The House of Golden Treasure
will have a new master.

120
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,200
You're going to lose everything anyway.
What's one more chamber pot to you?

121
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,830
Would you look at this bastard?

122
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you yapping about?

123
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,090
What?

124
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,840
"This bastard"?

125
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,420
Stop disrupting my business and get out.

126
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,630
Keep pushing your luck
and you might get hurt.

127
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,510
Oh, and try not to speak
the Joseon tongue if you can.

128
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,510
Your pronunciation sucks.

129
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,430
It's the worst!

130
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,560
Damn you!

131
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,480
You're dead!

132
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,500
The House of Golden Treasure
is owned by me, Jang Tae-sang,

133
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,750
and it will stay that way.

134
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:37,420
So if you cause a disturbance in my shop
or even dare to dream of robbing me,

135
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,630
you better be prepared

136
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,340
to either die or come very close to dying.

137
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,730
Come on! My arm's hurting!

138
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,730
My arm keeps giving out.
It must be my age.

139
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,020
See? Look...

140
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Hey.

141
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,360
You should leave.

142
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,200
- Move!
- Get lost!

143
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,460
Out of the way!

144
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's go.

145
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
From now on, we must all stay vigilant.

146
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,520
What?

147
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,310
What do you mean?

148
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,480
He means we should find Myeong-ja soon,

149
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,320
or else scoundrels like him
will keep showing up to bother us.

150
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,150
Which reminds me.

151
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,700
They found the last place
Myeong-ja visited.

152
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,620
What?

153
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,720
We found the rickshaw puller
who gave her a ride seven days ago.

154
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,640
What? No way! That can't be!

155
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,260
I chased down every single puller
working for Spring Moon Hall.

156
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,480
I asked around
and investigated everything myself!

157
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,900
The man doesn't work for Spring Moon Hall.

158
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,400
Then what?

159
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,190
You said she could've been killed.

160
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,990
So we thought about
who could've killed her,

161
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,370
and only one person came to mind.

162
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,010
Where's Mr. Takashi?

163
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,680
He fell ill and will rest
for three to four days.

164
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,230
<i>Lady Yukiko Maeda.</i>

165
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,860
So Yukiko Maeda called Myeong-ja out?

166
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,780
She was called
to Ishikawa's house at first,

167
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,360
then moved elsewhere shortly after.

168
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,360
Where would that be?

169
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,120
Ongseong Hospital.

170
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,040
Ong... Ongseong Hospital?

171
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,950
Are you certain?

172
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,550
Please don't kill me!

173
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,180
You are certain it was Ongseong Hospital?

174
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,890
Yes! I swear it was Ongseong Hospital!

175
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,390
I swear it on my mother
and father's lives!

176
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,980
It was Ongseong Hospital!

177
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,270
I told you, I took her there myself!

178
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,280
She disappeared after the puller
dropped her off at Ongseong Hospital,

179
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,450
so it is likely that she's still in there,
don't you think?

180
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,120
Gosh, no. That makes no sense.

181
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,750
What doesn't make sense?

182
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,250
Look, here's the thing
about Ongseong Hospital.

183
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,630
It's hard to get in there

184
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,420
unless you are Japanese military, police,
or a Government-General official.

185
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,920
A Joseon courtesan
could never get past its gates!

186
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,050
You don't know how tight their security is
at the gate with all the inspections.

187
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,100
What if Yukiko Maeda pulled some strings
and arranged it?

188
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,600
Why would she do that?

189
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,270
Why would she take her husband's mistress
to a Japanese-only hospital?

190
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,730
We can get inside the hospital
to figure that out.

191
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,150
My God, what is the matter with you?

192
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,320
I just said that we Joseon-borns
are not allowed in there!

193
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,660
I heard that Master Jang
has good connections.

194
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,830
But not good enough to get us inside?

195
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,460
Well, I do know some Joseon individuals
who can visit that hospital.

196
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,550
So, can we get in or not?

197
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,300
That I'll have to see.

198
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,800
Forget it. If you can't make it happen,
we'll find a way.

199
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,220
You're an impatient one, aren't you?
Who says I can't do it?

200
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,810
I'm just saying, let's make a plan.

201
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,560
We ought to be fully prepared
in whatever we do.

202
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,900
Don't you know that?

203
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,910
Something on my face?

204
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,010
What are you doing?

205
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,760
Oh. Give these to the two outside.

206
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,180
What's your plan?

207
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,800
How dare they doubt me?

208
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,350
I'll show them
how shrewd and meticulous I am.

209
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,600
What's the money for?
What are you up to this time?

210
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,350
What do you think?

211
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,860
Doing the impossible, of course.

212
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,490
- What is this?
- Money.

213
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,620
It's money.

214
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,290
I don't care if you use it
for the independence movement.

215
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm giving it to you,
so spend it as you wish.

216
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,090
What trick are you pulling?

217
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,090
Let me borrow your ID.

218
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,470
My ID?

219
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,220
Only a few Joseon people in Gyeongseong
are allowed into Ongseong Hospital,

220
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,730
and your family is among them.

221
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,810
- Am I right?
- Why do you ask?

222
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,730
Are you unwell?

223
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,480
No, not me.

224
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,480
Wait!

225
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,900
If this has anything to do with Ishikawa,
leave me out of it.

226
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,830
Think of it as saving your friend's life.

227
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,580
If you still consider me a friend,
that is.

228
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,670
If you're not ill, then who is?

229
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,040
I should at least know who it is
before I lend it to you.

230
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,920
Don't ask too many questions.
It's for your own good.

231
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,800
You're here to steal my identity,
and you're worried about me?

232
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,890
Will you help?

233
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,810
How wonderful it would be
for you to use such passion for us.

234
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,030
Sorry, but I don't daydream
about something like independence.

235
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,360
How can I dare to take back
what even the king failed to protect?

236
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,490
All I want, in these turbulent times,

237
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,120
is to strive as stubbornly as I can

238
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,710
to stay alive and safe day after day.

239
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,670
So,

240
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,800
will you do this for me?

241
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,720
Return it in one piece.

242
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,060
Will do.

243
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,160
So, how did it go?

244
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,620
Are the sleuths here yet?

245
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,500
Oh, there they are.

246
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,290
That one's pretty too!

247
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,170
So beautiful!

248
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,960
- Let's get going.
- Huh?

249
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,870
We don't have all day.

250
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,420
Yes, we should go.

251
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Please hop in.

252
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,600
Oh, it's good manners
to help a lady get in the car.

253
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,850
No need.

254
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,360
Let's go.

255
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,930
Identification.

256
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,730
This is my master.

257
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,190
You're familiar
with the Bugang Company, aren't you?

258
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,070
He's the firstborn son of the family.

259
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,450
Are they with you?

260
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,950
They are my master's fiancĂ©e
and her father.

261
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,000
Oh, it's almost time for our appointment.

262
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,420
Please hurry.

263
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,220
Dr. Takahashi absolutely hates it
when people are late for appointments.

264
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,010
Damn Josenjing...

265
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,520
Hey, let them through!

266
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,850
Thank you!

267
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,440
Wait, hold up!

268
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,960
You forgot this.

269
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,090
Oh, silly me! Anyway...

270
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,340
Thank you, sir!

271
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,790
Ongseong Hospital?

272
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,630
Yes, sir.
He just went in with some company.

273
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,710
Should I tell him to stay and keep watch?

274
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,570
RECORDS ROOM

275
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,180
I'm here to see Dr. Takahashi.

276
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,520
Dr. Takahashi?

277
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,020
<i>Dr. Takahashi is our family physician.</i>

278
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,060
But he will be out of the office today.

279
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,940
He plays soft tennis
every Thursday afternoon.

280
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,440
Even better.

281
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,280
Dr. Takahashi is out of the office
this afternoon.

282
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,490
But I made an appointment
to see him today.

283
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,290
Could you check one more time?

284
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
- Please wait a moment.
- Sure.

285
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,850
Oh, my stomach!

286
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,600
What's wrong?

287
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,230
Are you all right?

288
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,690
- Where does it hurt?
- My stomach!

289
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,900
Hey, Gap-pyeong!

290
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,530
Gap-pyeong!

291
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,490
- Are you all right?
- Gap-pyeong!

292
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,070
- It's coming out of my bottom!
- What's coming out of your bottom?

293
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,660
Oh, it hurts!

294
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,080
What's coming out?

295
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,660
- It's coming out!
- Is it?

296
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,590
Hang in there!

297
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,420
Are there any doctors? A doctor!

298
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,010
Doctor!

299
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Hang in there!

300
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,520
Akiko...

301
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,560
Akiko...

302
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,400
Akiko...

303
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,250
Who are you?

304
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,800
What are you doing here?

305
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,840
I...

306
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,220
got a bit lost.

307
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,180
If you got lost,
why were you flipping through the records?

308
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,730
A friend of mine
is staying at this hospital,

309
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,190
but I just can't seem to find them.

310
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,070
I can tell you're from Joseon.

311
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,370
Let's not make a scene.

312
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,370
I'll leave quietly.

313
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,410
Is that all right?

314
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Why are you here?

315
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,290
Reveal who you are first.

316
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,930
Don't make a scene, she said.

317
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,520
Are you... from Manchuria?

318
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,480
Who are you?

319
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,490
The doctor will be here soon.
Hang in there.

320
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,080
I think the doctor's here. He's here!

321
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,330
This should ease his pain for now.

322
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,840
- Take off his jacket!
- Yes, Doctor.

323
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,340
Wait, no!

324
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,670
No...

325
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,220
No, stop!

326
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,380
You can't!

327
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,140
Please don't kill me! Please!

328
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,390
Master, please!

329
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,350
Please, Master...

330
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,020
- Let's hurry!
- Yes, Doctor!

331
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,770
It's okay. You'll feel better soon.

332
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,150
No!

333
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,480
- Gap-pyeong!
- No...

334
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,400
Hey, you! Come here!

335
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,650
Let's not do this!

336
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,530
Come here!

337
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,620
Oh, hold on! Hold on a second...

338
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,750
- What?
- The pain's suddenly gone.

339
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,750
Really?

340
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,800
How can this be?
My pain is completely gone!

341
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,050
What was that?

342
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,390
It doesn't hurt anymore, Doctor!

343
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,890
That's amazing!

344
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,730
Thank you, sir.
You truly are a skilled doctor!

345
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,780
Fascinating.

346
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,580
Were you going to let them
give me that shot?

347
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,580
Well, they didn't.

348
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,630
What was that?

349
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,540
What's going on? Did you hear that?

350
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,840
Please don't be alarmed!

351
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,220
The nearby military base
must be holding another target practice.

352
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,260
That's strange. The sound came
from underneath the building.

353
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,760
Let's move for now.

354
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,270
Follow me.

355
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,690
- Why did you open fire?
- We failed to capture it.

356
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,530
Two were attacked
before we approached the door!

357
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,620
One corporal is still alive, sir!

358
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,370
Please help me!

359
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,290
Please help...

360
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,750
What should we do?

361
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,510
I'll go and rescue the corporal!

362
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,800
Stay still. Nobody move!

363
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,640
Please let me save him, sir!

364
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,810
Be quiet.

365
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,730
Don't move a muscle!

366
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,940
This experiment is
of vital importance to us.

367
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,860
Understood?

368
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,070
Colonel Kato. Over there.

369
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,990
What... is that thing?

370
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,410
Save me!

371
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,370
Please...

372
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,120
Please save me!

373
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,670
Help me!

374
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,920
Please...

375
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,320
Stop it!

376
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,950
No! Stop right there!

377
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,010
She is a goddess.

378
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,770
A goddess has been born!

379
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,680
Hey, what are you doing here?

380
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,390
What is going on?

381
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,980
We will be spending the night here.

382
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,270
What?

383
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,400
What about us? Us too?

384
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,740
You will only get in the way,
so I suggest you get out.

385
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,030
At least tell us what's going on.

386
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,370
There is a military ward in the back.

387
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,420
Something very fishy is going on
in the basement.

388
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,500
They say Joseon people
from Seodaemun Prison are sent there,

389
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,090
but apparently, none of them

390
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,630
have come back.

391
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,760
Is Myeong-ja in there too?

392
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,140
We're planning to find that out.

393
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,220
What...

394
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,980
Where did you even get that information?

395
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,940
Something's afoot
in the military ward right now.

396
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,860
Why don't you come back another day?

397
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,410
We don't have time for that.

398
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,080
Just lead the way.
We'll take care of the rest.

399
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,710
Wait, just...

400
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,050
Just...

401
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,220
Just what is going on right now?

402
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,760
What could this janitor
possibly have told you that's--

403
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,060
My younger brother was transferred here
from Seodaemun Prison a year ago.

404
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,310
He was moved here because of a high fever,
but I've lost contact with him ever since.

405
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,730
I've looked for him,
but he wasn't even on the records here.

406
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,820
Oh dear. So you snuck in here to find him.

407
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,950
Why should we believe you?
You're a complete stranger.

408
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,790
What's that?

409
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,090
It's the sign of the Patriotic Society.

410
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,430
Heck, it's one of the independence groups.

411
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,680
You should head back first.

412
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,140
We'll check if Myeong-ja is actually here
and send you a message.

413
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,480
But...

414
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,900
I'm ready.

415
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,400
Follow me.

416
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,070
Hey, wait.

417
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,650
Oh, yeah. Thank you for the clothes.

418
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,990
You know that's not what I meant.

419
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,240
Did you have something else to say?

420
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,710
What is it?

421
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,830
Say it.

422
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,960
Well,

423
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,840
I just...

424
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,600
I just think this plan is too reckless,
so I'm saying

425
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,190
we should come up with a safer plan.

426
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,060
"Until the cherry blossoms fall."

427
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:12,280
Once cherry blossoms open,
they reach full bloom quickly.

428
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,570
Then they begin to fall
just when you think they've all bloomed.

429
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,780
So we have no time or reason to delay.

430
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,950
Still, it wasn't part of the plan
for you to stay here.

431
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,120
You tailor your principles to situations.

432
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,460
It's only a slight change in plan.
What's the big deal?

433
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,000
Isn't this what you call flexibility?

434
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,010
We'll do our job.

435
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,970
You do yours and look into Sachimoto.

436
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,810
All right?

437
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,720
Chae-ok.

438
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,140
I'm coming.

439
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,780
Wow, those two sure are quick
to take initiative. Right, Master Jang?

440
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,580
Hey, you there!

441
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,710
This area is off-limits to outsiders.

442
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,040
Who are you?

443
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,540
Oh, apologies!

444
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,710
We were only looking for the restroom.

445
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,220
Let us go, Master.

446
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,590
Wait just a minute!

447
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,640
Oh, there you are.

448
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,650
I checked, and Dr. Takahashi
is indeed out of the office today.

449
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,530
Oh, is that so?

450
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,990
There must have been a misunderstanding.

451
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,200
Dear me...

452
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,540
Is he a visitor?

453
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,830
Yes, he is Dr. Takahashi's outpatient.

454
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,090
You must leave now.

455
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,720
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

456
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:11,140
All visitors and outpatients
with appointments must leave the premises.

457
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,690
- Why is the military here?
- I repeat.

458
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,690
What is going on?

459
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:21,360
All visitors and outpatients
with appointments must leave the premises!

460
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,160
Please exit the building, everyone.

461
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,120
Colonel Kato. Please give the order.

462
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,880
The lab door might break any moment now!

463
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Sir!

464
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,300
We're moving it to Level 4.

465
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,760
Prepare the nitrogen.

466
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,890
Yes, sir!

467
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,890
Nitrogen! Bring the nitrogen!

468
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,970
Yes, sir!

469
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,190
There's nothing to worry about.

470
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,990
We are moving you to a place
more fitting of a goddess.

471
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,370
What was that about?

472
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,660
I'm sure they will be fine.

473
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,460
They are supposed to be experts.

474
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,250
Once they confirm Myeong-ja's in there,
they will get out of there.

475
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,260
- About those two...
- Yeah.

476
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,380
They seem to take their work
as seriously as I do, right?

477
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,700
NO ENTRY

478
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,540
NO ENTRY

479
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,460
NO ENTRY

480
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,280
Any movement?

481
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,780
None, sir. It seems to be fully asleep.

482
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,580
What are all these, sir?

483
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,420
They seem to be... some kind of spores.

484
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,170
They're anthrax.

485
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,880
It's protecting itself even in its sleep.

486
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,130
We're done moving it, sir.

487
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,300
Close the door.

488
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,690
Move it to Level 4.

489
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,740
Don't stop injecting nitrogen
during transportation.

490
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,820
Avoid contact with the spores in the air.

491
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,410
Let us all be careful.

492
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,820
Yes, sir!

493
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,740
Start moving!

494
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,110
I guess it's snow.

495
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,490
It melts away quickly.

496
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,630
Help!

497
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,930
Marvelous.

498
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,830
Didn't you say the Japanese soldiers
are being treated here?

499
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,170
Most patients stay
on the second and third floors.

500
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,800
The first floor has offices,
communications rooms, and liaison offices.

501
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,850
More like a military facility
than a hospital.

502
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:45,520
The security is so tight
that I'm not allowed to go near it.

503
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,100
I only get to go in once every two days
to clean the wards.

504
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,400
Why is that eastern watchtower empty?

505
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,690
A man fell to his death once
because it was too weak.

506
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,570
There were talks of renovation,
but it's been neglected since then.

507
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,240
Can you make it to that tower?

508
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,450
It won't be easy,

509
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,210
but I can do it.

510
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:10,920
- I'll be back.
- Wait.

511
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,300
Hey...

512
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:31,910
Where did she go?

513
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,590
- Quickly!
- Yes, sir!

514
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,100
- What should we do, sir?
- Get ready to move!

515
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,190
- Yes, sir!
- Move out!

516
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,360
Move it!

517
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,440
Quickly!

518
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,110
- Hurry!
- Come on!

519
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,650
- Prepare to move.
- Yes, sir!

520
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,280
- To the basement!
- Yes, sir!

521
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,870
Move along! Quickly!

522
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,180
You're still here?

523
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,600
Talk to me. What is it now?

524
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,150
I simply don't understand why.

525
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,480
Why what?

526
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,490
Why it bothers me so much.

527
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,910
What does?

528
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,870
I mean, look at the mess I'm in.

529
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,590
Ishikawa has my life in his hands.

530
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:28,800
If I don't find Myeong-ja,
my entire fortune will be confiscated,

531
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,390
and I could even be dragged off to war.

532
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:35,510
Moreover, hyenas and vultures
are circling this shop,

533
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,390
eager to take a bite of whatever they can.

534
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,900
So, why am I so...

535
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,320
bothered by her?

536
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,440
You mean the sleuth girl?

537
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,190
Who?

538
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,990
The "her" you just mentioned.

539
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,070
"Her"?

540
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:56,740
Did I just say that?

541
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,410
How unfortunate.

542
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,960
They say there's no cure for lovesickness.

543
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,620
Whoa, lovesickness? Watch what you say!

544
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,250
I'm Jang Tae-sang.

545
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,550
All the beautiful girls in this city
couldn't even make me flinch.

546
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,630
Bukchon's hottest guy!
Namchon's number one man!

547
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,470
Which proves that you're lovesick.

548
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,060
You turned your nose up
at all those beauties,

549
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:19,560
and look at you now.

550
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,690
Of all the girls,
a sleuth girl stole your heart.

551
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,600
No, it's not like that at all!

552
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,150
What is it, then?

553
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,070
You know...

554
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,280
Well... humanism?

555
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,780
Humanism?

556
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,240
Yes, humanism.

557
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,700
Love for mankind.

558
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:44,040
I'm worrying and pondering
purely out of my love for mankind.

559
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,960
Got that?

560
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,630
Then there's no need to worry.

561
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,000
I should have dragged her out of there.

562
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,760
I shouldn't have left her
at the hospital like that, right?

563
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,010
If you have time to waste,
go find Sachimoto.

564
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,350
Standing there worrying
won't change a single thing.

565
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,140
Be the man that you are
and show us how you do things your way!

566
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,480
Do your part is what I'm saying.

567
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
Do you think so?

568
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:15,280
You're right.

569
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,120
Where are you going?

570
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,700
I'm off to do my part my way.

571
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,220
What gives?

572
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,520
I refuse to drive you around anymore.

573
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,770
Okay. All right. Just write this down.

574
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,820
Sachimoto. A Japanese male in his mid-30s.

575
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,030
Write it down.

576
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,410
A professional painter.

577
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,660
Ask Commissioner Ishikawa
to search for such a man

578
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,330
among the residents of Gyeongseong.

579
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:09,540
This is crucial to finding Myeong-ja,
so he needs to be thorough, understand?

580
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:10,710
- Yes.
- Okay!

581
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,150
Enjoy.

582
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,120
Who are you drawing?

583
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:47,620
My apologies.

584
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,040
The woman in the drawing
looked like she was from Joseon.

585
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,510
How can you tell?

586
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,760
The parting of her hair.

587
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,180
Is that right?

588
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,520
You are very skilled at drawing.

589
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,190
I guess you're a painter?

590
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,120
Breaking news!

591
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,620
Ongseong Hospital
will be closed indefinitely!

592
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,710
Ongseong Hospital closes indefinitely
due to an unknown contagion!

593
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,290
- Choi was right.
- Breaking news!

594
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,670
- This is about yesterday.
- Breaking news!

595
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,420
- It will be closed indefinitely!
- Breaking news!

596
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,920
It's an unknown contagion!

597
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,010
ONGSEONG HOSPITAL CLOSED INDEFINITELY
POSSIBLY DUE TO CONTAGIOUS DISEASE

598
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,140
Get off now!

599
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,690
Hurry! Move your feet!

600
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,440
Faster!

601
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,650
Build the barricades.

602
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,480
I said, hurry up!

603
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,940
Get off! Move them quickly!

604
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,570
CLOSED

605
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:00,700
Speed it up!

606
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,260
What are you talking about?
The hospital's surrounded by soldiers?

607
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,850
No one can get in from the outside,
and no one can get out from the inside.

608
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:31,850
They even had machine guns.
It looks pretty serious, sir.

609
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,810
No word from the sleuths yet?

610
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,770
I don't think
they made it out of the hospital.

611
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,870
Master Jang. Where are you going?

612
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,330
Want me to come with you?

613
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,660
Go after him already.

614
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,710
Okay! I was about to!

615
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:12,270
I checked, and Dr. Takahashi
is indeed out of the office today.

616
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,060
What brings you here?

617
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,490
WE FOUND MYEONG-JA

618
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,070
What about the person
who gave this to you?

619
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,240
They are still inside.

620
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,290
I managed to escape

621
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,710
before the hospital
got completely shut down,

622
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,290
just as dawn broke.

623
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,050
Those people, are they safe?

624
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,170
I don't know.

625
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,970
Is it true that an infectious disease
has spread in there?

626
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,680
I don't know.

627
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,600
Please be honest with me!

628
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,190
What's going on in there right now?

629
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,150
I don't know either!

630
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,030
Last night...

631
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,620
so many people died at the hospital.

632
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,960
<i>Countless people lost their lives.</i>

633
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,040
<i>I don't know why.</i>

634
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,340
<i>And there's no way I can find out.</i>

635
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,130
Why you?

636
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,090
Why did you bring this note to me?
Answer me.

637
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,030
Horrific things are happening
inside Ongseong Hospital right now.

638
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:52,080
People are dying like crazy,
but we don't know why.

639
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,080
My comrades attempted
to find out the truth multiple times...

640
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,170
but no one made it back.

641
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,460
This time

642
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,970
may be no exception.

643
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,810
WE FOUND MYEONG-JA

644
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,380
- Mr. Gu.
- Yes, go on.

645
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:47,670
I'm afraid I have to go in there myself.

646
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,010
Go in where?

647
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,840
- Ongseong Hospital.
- Master Jang!

648
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,430
- Master.
- Master?

649
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,390
Get everything ready.

650
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,770
I'm going in.

651
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,480
<i>Stuck in my head</i>

652
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,740
<i>I've been searchin' for the reason</i>

653
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,240
<i>Nameless longing</i>

654
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,740
<i>I've been waitin' for you for so long</i>

655
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,740
<i>But got no direction</i>

656
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:21,250
<i>No matter I wanna reach you</i>

657
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,460
<i>Another way you runnin'</i>

658
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,040
<i>Goin' on and on</i>

659
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:26,920
<i>But need a way to get to you</i>

660
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,380
<i>You</i>

661
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,550
<i>You know I'm so stuck with you</i>

662
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,510
<i>No, oh, oh, oh</i>

663
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,390
<i>You</i>

664
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,560
<i>Babe, I don't care at all</i>

665
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,560
<i>You'll never know what I could do</i>

666
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,310
<i>You'll never know
What we could have been</i>

667
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,320
<i>For you
No, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

668
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,400
<i>Do you know</i>

669
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:52,530
<i>Oh, no</i>

670
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,070
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

671
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,320
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

672
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,410
<i>Oh, no</i>

673
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:00,160
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

674
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:03,330
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

675
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,870
<i>Oh, no</i>

676
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,760
<i>Chasing the lights
Even don't know where I'm goin'</i>

677
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,220
<i>Losing my sight</i>

678
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,810
<i>Hope you know that
What I'm lookin' for</i>

679
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,720
<i>But got no direction</i>

680
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,270
<i>No matter I wanna reach you</i>

681
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:28,150
<i>Another way you runnin'
Goin' on and on</i>

682
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,070
<i>But need a way to get to you</i>

683
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:36,160
<i>Ride on a paper plane</i>

684
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,910
<i>Sandcastles on a seaside</i>

685
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,370
<i>Don't scare me at all</i>

686
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,290
<i>If I can get on with you forever</i>

687
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,590
<i>Just wanna be there
With you forever</i>

688
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,340
<i>How beauty miserable us</i>

689
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,430
<i>Let me keep on</i>

690
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,640
<i>Know, what I could do</i>

691
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,350
<i>You'll never know
What we could have been</i>

692
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:04,310
<i>For you
No, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

693
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,350
<i>Do you know</i>

694
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,440
<i>Oh, no</i>

695
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,150
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

696
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,360
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

697
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,360
<i>Oh, no</i>

698
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,320
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

699
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,320
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

700
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:19,910
<i>Oh, no</i>

701
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:24,330
<i>Lead me to the way towards you</i>

702
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,590
<i>I've been waitin' for so long
I'm ready to run to you</i>

703
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,380
<i>Reason for another reason</i>

704
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:39,050
<i>Now I'm so sick of waitin'</i>

705
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,300
<i>Voices in my head</i>

706
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:44,430
<i>Mess around in my mind</i>

707
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,600
<i>Know, what I could do</i>

708
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,350
<i>You'll never know
What we could have been</i>

709
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,230
<i>For you
No, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

710
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,360
<i>Do you know</i>

711
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,610
<i>Oh, no</i>

712
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:58,570
<i>You'll never know
What I could do</i>

713
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,410
<i>You'll never know
What we could have been</i>

714
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:04,330
<i>For you
