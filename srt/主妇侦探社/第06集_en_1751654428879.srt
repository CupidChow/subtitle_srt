186
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,310
Hello

187
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,390
It's me, it's me

188
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,270
Who is who?

189
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,600
What? My number is not saved?

190
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,790
I am a resident representative.

191
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,640
Ah, hello

192
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,850
Go to the management office of Building 211 now.

193
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,290
Yes, I'm looking for

194
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,130
Wait a mininute

195
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,840
Yeah, here it is.

196
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,340
[Building 211, Room 806, Jin Dongmin]

197
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,410
Oh ok

198
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,090
Put that at my door.

199
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,540
OK

200
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,420
Do you treat the administrator as a personal secretary?

201
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,290
Oh, it's you.

202
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,520
Where's Mom?

203
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,970
Mom didn't come?

204
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,900
Why would mom let you come here alone so late?

205
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,370
In the company

206
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,380
It seems that mom is very busy.

207
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,890
Oh, are you home alone?

208
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,660
fine

209
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,530
By the way, what are you going to buy?

210
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,240
Instant noodles

211
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,010
Ah instant noodles

212
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,810
Wait a minute

213
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,090
This kid comes to buy instant noodles

214
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,240
Why don't you come in?

215
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,890
Maybe I'm shy.

216
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,240
Where is the money?

217
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,540
for you

218
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,470
This is the same instant noodles that my mother bought last time.

219
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,810
And this is a gift

220
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,040
Go back soon

221
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,100
Thanks

222
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,570
Don't run.

223
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,380
Will fall down

224
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,080
Is it tasty

225
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,560
Mmm, very delicious

226
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,500
Are you still in the mood to eat chicken legs?

227
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,210
Not the resident of Building 211

228
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,900
Say thank you for the hard work of the administrator and give us a fried chicken

229
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,600
What's the hard work?

230
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,490
They are clearly a group of salary thieves

231
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,200
The resident representative said this was a bit too much.

232
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,540
What is a salary thief?

233
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,470
Where is the new administrator?

234
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,480
Where did that young guy go?

235
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,430
Come Come

236
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,470
I bought a drink.

237
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,280
Hello, Hello, Hello

238
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,670
What is this doing suddenly?

239
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,650
Hello

240
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,360
Didn't I just tell you to leave the package at your door?

241
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,330
What does this mean?

242
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,880
I've put it at the door as instructed.

243
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,080
Why didn't I see it?

244
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,090
Please don't do it.

245
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,940
Is this how you help the resident representatives?

246
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,660
I really misjudged you. You have changed.

247
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,820
No wonder they say you can't just take in anyone.

248
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,350
Do you want to be fired?

249
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,110
I'll go find it. I'll go find it.

250
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,830
Find it now

251
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,910
Same with you

252
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,500
Can't even take care of a package.

253
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,230
Still eating chicken legs during work hours

254
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,300
Before I found my package

255
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,980
Don't even think about going home

256
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,190
Got it?

257
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,000
hateful

258
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,550
Isn't this an act of violence?

259
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,840
It's not the administrator's fault if the package is missing.

260
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,950
Whatever happens, it's the administrator's fault.

261
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,810
Are you sure you left the package at the door?

262
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,680
Of course

263
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,780
Let's split up and look for the packages first.

264
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,010
knew

265
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,650
At least tell me what it is. How can I find it?

266
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,290
I clearly put it here, where did it go?

267
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,380
How to find this?

268
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,620
Not here either

269
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,280
Did you find it?

270
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,000
There is no

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,620
So where did it run to?

272
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,900
Honey, you probably haven't been home.

273
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,150
What are you talking about? I'm out of town.

274
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,960
What's wrong? Did something happen at home?

275
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,660
What's the matter?

276
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,110
Will be back this weekend?

277
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,690
Do you want to play golf together?

278
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,560
Don't just play golf all day

279
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,430
Manage the building well

280
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,820
I haven't received the rent yet.

281
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,070
Did you know

282
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,530
These people have sent me text messages several times but I won't listen.

283
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,480
Don't just work with your fingers

284
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,040
You have to urge them in person.

285
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,350
Is this that difficult?

286
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,020
Got it Got it

287
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
I will go tomorrow

288
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,730
You think you can rely on the salary of a local university professor?

289
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,210
Is it easy to let Dong Yun study abroad?

290
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,960
Without rent, it's impossible

291
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
If you know, you can manage the building well.

292
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,740
You don't have anything to do, do you?

293
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,080
How can I have nothing to do?

294
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,490
After all, I am the resident representative.

295
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,060
It's really an amazing job.

296
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,090
Hang up

297
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,830
Do you treat your husband like shit just because you are good at making money?

298
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,110
Monitor?

299
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,720
We need to find the criminal.

300
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,130
It looks like it was taken away.

301
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,380
Oh, it's useless.

302
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,590
The surveillance cameras in this building are all decorations.

303
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,180
Two years ago, I spent the money to replace the monitor.

304
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,300
I used it to paint the exterior walls of the building.

305
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,280
But let’s look for it anyway.

306
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,290
See if you can find anything.

307
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,680
Well, let's report to the administrator first.

308
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,420
Why can't I get through on the phone?

309
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,440
It's been four months. What are you going to do?

310
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,690
If this continues, we will both be embarrassed.

311
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,500
If you can't pay the rent, move out.

312
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,600
Tell me your plans as soon as you hear the message.

313
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,010
Do you treat the landlord like shit?

314
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,340
Are you going out?

315
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,660
I'm going to the examination center.

316
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,960
Are you going again?

317
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,250
How many days are you going?

318
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,430
Why carry so many things?

319
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,690
It's a book because I need to finish reading it within this week.

320
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,960
Go by car

321
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,200
Mom can't use it

322
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,079
good

323
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,140
Ah wait a minute

324
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,349
I'll pack some side dishes for you.

325
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,210
There is barbecue marinating in the refrigerator

326
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,819
Mommy Mommy

327
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,660
No

328
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,920
Studying is also a kind of labor.

329
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,329
You have to eat well to keep going.

330
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,339
I'll take care of it myself

331
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,690
What have you accomplished by doing it yourself?

332
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,980
There must be a result this year anyway.

333
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,740
When neighbors asked my son what he was doing

334
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,770
Do you know how I feel?

335
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,740
Those who know the answer but still ask

336
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,940
I really want to rip their mouths apart

337
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,310
Look at me with that half-sympathetic, half-mocking look

338
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,800
I want to dig out their eyes.

339
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,900
Tae-hoon

340
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,640
yes

341
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,300
I don't expect you to achieve much.

342
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,340
I just want you to be like everyone else.

343
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,070
Don't let yourself be pointed at or noticed

344
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,580
Just be an ordinary person

345
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,800
Wait a moment

346
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,220
Just five minutes

347
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,600
Is it coming again?

348
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,310
Why don't you do recycling?

349
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,540
Why is it still like this after that lesson?

350
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,200
Why is the package box here?

351
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,130
What's this

352
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,970
What?

353
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,510
What sound

354
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,590
What's this

355
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,130
do not be afraid

356
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,150
I am a resident of the 2nd residential area

357
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,770
What happened

358
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,080
Are you okay? Are you injured?

359
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,170
Help me get this first.

360
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,190
Are you scared?

361
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,700
What happened

362
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,730
I feel like someone is following me.

363
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,970
So I turned around and looked

364
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,010
result...

365
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,700
This mouse is so perverted

366
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,990
Where did he go?

367
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,900
What's this

368
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,310
Fluorescence

369
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,540
Thong

370
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:56,350

376
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,500
What is this?

377
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,530
It's that perverted underwear

378
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,140
After he frightened a female resident who was about to return home

379
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,010
Just take it off and hang it beautifully on the branches

380
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,580

Found this at the garbage dump last night.

382
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,940
As you can see, although the locations of discovery are different

383
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,960
But the design and color are almost the same

384
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,550
This means it is likely the same person.

385
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,620

386
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,810

387
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,390

388
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,590

389
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,230

390
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,940
Ah, I can't see anything.

432
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,210
They all gave me a nickname.

433
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,750
This is exactly the same underwear we found in our store.

434
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,370
That's right

435

Three types of underwear found in a garbage dump in a supermarket residential area

436
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,620
They are all exactly the same

437
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,910
It's just a coincidence

438
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,730
The design and color preferences are too similar

439
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,880
So it's mouse eggs?

440
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,730
The possibility of mouse eggs living in our community has increased.

441
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,710
I also heard the rumors about rat balls

442
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,430
He mainly hangs out in residential areas 1, 2 and 3

443
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,840
After strengthening the security, they ran to the 4th and 5th residential areas.

If that guy really lived in our community

445
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,180
The problem is more serious than I thought.

446
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,390
If it develops into a sexual crime

447
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,650
Probably just an exhibitionist.

448
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,630
Didn't you say there was no touching or attempted crime?

449
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,320
Otherwise, why would it be called Mouse Eggs?

450
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,120
Probably just a petty criminal.

451
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,620
This is the problem.

452
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,040
Because he is a rat egg

453
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,560
Mouse balls Mouse balls

454
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,140
He must be very self-conscious about that.

455
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,480
That inferiority complex may trigger his impulse to kill.

456
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,690
Why did the first murder case happen?

457
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,530
The first murder case in human history?

458
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,910
Cain in Genesis killed his brother Abel

459
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,330
It is also caused by the inferiority complex towards his younger brother.

460
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,900
Look at those serial killers.

461
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,110
Always pick on those who are weaker and more helpless than themselves.

462
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,940
So mouse eggs could potentially kill people?

463
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,320
Don't you feel embarrassed?

464
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,180
He only feels pleasure when the woman screams and falls into fear

465
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,750
On the contrary, if you touch his inferiority complex

466
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,250
He'll go crazy.

467
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,070
What are the police doing?

468
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,280
Why don't you catch that guy quickly?

469
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,360
How could I not want to catch

470
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,460
I can't catch it.

471
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,790
Because he is so elusive

472
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,670
If only those monitors worked properly.

473
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,190
You can catch it immediately

474
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,710
All day long I keep saying there's no budget, no budget

475
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,370
It costs a lot to repair flowers, plants and trees.

476
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,380
Maybe that's what he was aiming for.

477
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,030
Yes, that guy knows this neighborhood well.

478
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,790
I did that so many times without getting caught.

479
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,800

482
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,530
I threw away a whole box of new underwear with the labels still on.

483
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,070
Maybe customer preferences have changed.

484

493
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,480

494

Even if someone tries, they will be caught quickly.

735
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,400
Why do we pay salaries to administrators?

736
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,390
If there are not enough monitors, the administrator should supplement them.

737
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,520
That's right.

738
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,480
Is the administrator a straw man?

739
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,420
Now with minimal manpower

740
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,090
Not only do you have to do all kinds of chores that are not part of your job requirements,

741
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,590
Still want to be a human surveillance camera?

742
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,830
Isn't this what is called Party A bullying?

743
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,330
Bullying behavior by Party A

744
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,480
Didn't you hear me telling you to get out?

745
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,810
Let me say one more thing

746
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,130
The value of the building

747
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,870
It is not determined by the level of management or the beautification of the building.

748
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,760
The real value of the building is

749
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,940
Based on basics and common sense

750
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,610
Well said Well said

751
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,910
Have you ever thought about how much the penalty would be if you terminate the contract?

752
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:45,000
All of this will be included in the residents' management fees.

753
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,210
If you replace the monitor device now

754
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,380
Give up the landscape project

755
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,350
Or raise management fees again

756
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,750
Management fees must not increase

757
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,960
Let's just do the landscaping project as it is.

758
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,040
Admin question will be discussed later

759
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,120
Today's meeting ends here

760
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,750
Get out of the way

761
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,650
President

762
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,800
You can't just leave like this

763
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,180
We have to discuss which is more important

764
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,450
Mouse Egg always comes on rainy nights

765
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,490
Occurs very frequently

766
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,040
This kind of weather is perfect with scallion pancakes and rice wine.

767
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,780
The date when someone reported seeing rat testicles in each building recently

768
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,830
Tell me about it

769
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,440
February 20

770
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,510
February 22

771
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,110
March 4 March 15

772
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,260
March 22

773
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,520
April 19

774
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,960
May 3 May 4

775
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,990
What happened to these dates?

776
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,230
Anyway, it wasn't captured by the old antique surveillance camera.

777
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,570
Sisters

778
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,690
Do you know what these dates have in common?

779
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,620
What is

780
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,680
The weather is always cloudy or rainy

781
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,750
Is it a coincidence?

782
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,570
Even considering that some people did not call the police or were unable to call the police

783
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,580
It is very clear that Mouse Egg likes rainy and cloudy days

784
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,740
That's right

785
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,700
It also rained the day the underwear was hung on the branch

786
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,430
Look

787
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,120
This weather is perfect for wearing a raincoat.

788
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,390
Want to catch the current

789
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,710
Today is the best opportunity

790
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Oh, really.

791
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,300
This lady is exaggerating.

792
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,700
This makes it clear that this was intentional.

793
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,670
The pace is a bit too artificial

794
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,070
It seems that there is no hope for this year's Korean middle-aged and elderly beauty pageant

795
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,660
Oh, don't tell her.

796
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,100
I know Ji Hyun is a beauty.

797
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,890
But it's too obvious that she's in her fifties.

798
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,710
If Suxi hadn't just happened to have a part-time job

799
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,290
This kind of thing is hers.

800
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,730
Oh, it's raining late at night

801
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,380
Perverts don't care about a woman's age or appearance

802
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,910
Only based on body shape or style

803
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,100
Choose people who appear weaker than you as your targets

804
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,440
Although I know this is the case

805
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,010
But that's a bit too...

806
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,500
Ah, it's time for him to come. Why hasn't he appeared yet?

807
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,520
Oh, if this elder sister continues like this

808
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,840
I'm gonna dance the cha-cha

809
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,580
Should we stop her?

810
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,470
sister

811
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,330
No, Miss Jun Ji-hyun

812
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Hey, you pervert.

813
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,860
Success

814
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,900
Take advantage of the pervert's relaxed vigilance to attack

815
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,550
How does it feel to be frightened in reverse?

816
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,840
You fucking pervert.

817
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,660
Mouse balls

818
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,160
hateful

819
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,140
Where are you going?

820
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,830
Got you, you pervert.

821
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,700
Why is there anything shameful about covering your face?

822
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,980
Didn't you take off your pants casually before?

823
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,880
Aunt Miri, hurry up

824
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,610
No no...

825
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,020
Resident Representative

826
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,940
Damn this pervert.

827
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,520
Thanks

828
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,800
I'm sick

829
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,280
Impulse Control Disorder

830
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,480
I can't control myself when I feel pressure.

831
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,480
To be honest, besides walking around in fluorescent underwear,

832
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,350
It didn't cause any harm to others.

833
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,030
How come there was no harm?

834
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,880
I am because of you

835
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,980
I was also wrongly accused of being a pervert.

836
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,150
Article 245 of the Criminal Law

837
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,410
Public indecency

838
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,930
Imprisonment for up to one year

839
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,790
(Note: Approximately NT$105,000)
Or a fine of less than 5 million won

840
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,650
There is... a fixed-term imprisonment

841
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,730
You're committing an exhibitionist crime.

842
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,090
It is psychological sexual violence

843
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,500
Do you understand? No. 806

844
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,670
The perverted pleasure you enjoy

845
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,290
It is a terrible nightmare that the victims will never forget.

846
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,070
Everyone, be quiet.

847
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,440
Sister-in-law, you can go back first

848
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,380
Please wait a moment, Detective Choi

849
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,510
We still have some unconfirmed things

850
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,460
Wait a mininute

851
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,460
yes

852
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,260
Hello, Detective Choi

853
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,910
Why don't you let those aunties go?

854
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,760
There are still some things that need to be confirmed.

855
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,060
Come out for a moment

856
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,510
Please wait a moment

857
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,640
Don't cause trouble

858
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,710
Damn it, people like me deserve to die.

859
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,990
Damn damn...

860
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,590
What are you doing? Stop it!

861
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,490
Can you die if you hit it like this?

862
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,960
If you want to hit it, hit it on the corner of the table

863
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,100
Try harder

864
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,080
Please let me go for once.

865
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,930
Help me

866
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,750
I was really not awake at that time

867
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,030
Oh, what happened?

868
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:59,060
Didn't I ask you to notify the merchants on the second floor to move out?

869
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,690
I am also very busy today because of the residents' representative meeting.

870
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,540
Stop working so hard on things that don't make money.

871
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,360
Focus on making money.

872
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,700
If this continues

873
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,270
I'll use the allowance I gave you to hire a building manager.

874
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,980
Wife, I was wrong

875
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,460
I will behave well in the future.

876
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,020
I, for my wife

877
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,750
Neither a husband nor a man

878
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,060
Just an administrator

879
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,980
I just want to relieve stress.

880
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,610
I just did a few stupid things impulsively.

881
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,720
several times

882
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,440
You dare to lie?

883
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,580
Since the beginning of this year, you have been causing trouble in the 1 2 3 residential area.

884
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,570
Later, I ran to the 4th and 5th residential areas.

885
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,520
We all know this

886
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,980
Do you want to call over all the residents you've hurt?

887
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,430
I have never been to 4 or 5 residential areas.

888
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:02,630
I'm not so depraved as to deliberately run to such a far residential area

889
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,780
This guy is still quibbling.

890
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,520
Our elusive Mr. Mouse Egg

891
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,650
Mouse balls

892
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,690
Me?

893
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,060
It's not that I look like a mouse.

894
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,650
I've lived so long.

895
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,480
I've never been insulted like this.

896
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,640
Why does my wife like me?

897
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,460
I am a real man who ranks among the top 1% in Korea.

898
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,320
Even urologists admit it.

899
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,820
Stop polluting everyone's eardrums and shut up.

900
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,550
Really

901
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,640
Aren't they mouse eggs?

902
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,450
Hey, are you free?

903
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,400
Do you want to listen to those aunties chatting?

904
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,280
No, it's not like that.

905
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,530
Ah, Keiko-senpai...

906
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,960
Ah, my sister-in-law said she must confirm some things

907
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,720
Confirm what?

908
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,140
Is the perverted suspect the real murderer?

909
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,130
We need the police to confirm this.

910
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,780
Are those aunties the police?

911
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,550
Okay, why don't you just confirm it?

912
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,740
See if I have rat balls

913
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,170
Stop doing embarrassing things.

914
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,130
I said no.

915
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:07,640

It's not some great secret.

If I had made my relationship with the administrator, Uncle Jin, clear from the beginning

If you don't have any other ideas,

Yes, Miri

00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,590
[Preview of the next episode]

1099
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,230
I'll find it anyway.

1100
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,440
Are you saying that Guangshan Community Housing is the final delivery location?

1101
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,170
Hat T-shirt

1102
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:09,970
Are they mouse eggs?

1103
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,680
Not just a disappearance

1104
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,530
I come to Guangshan Community House

1105
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,590
It's a destined thing

1106
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,270
From using the same knotting method

1107
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:18,860
The possibility of it being the same person is very high

1108
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,740
It's you.

1109
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,470
Instead of being perverted, I started doing other bad things

1110
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,880
The dead person could be you.

1111
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,450
This can be sued.

1112
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,230
It seems that we can find clues to the Ribbon Murder Case.

1113
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,100
Save me

1114
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,380
Who are you
