I just saw that the gum stuck on your car was red.

348
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,230
What else can I do? Of course I'm going to punish him.

349
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,060
Don't worry, I've thought about it.

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,490
Isn't there a saying that it's darkest under the lamp?

365
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,860
so

366
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,220
Can you help me?

367
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,580
I wrote down the license plate number.

368
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,130
You just give that bastard a ticket.

369
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,630
I know it's like this

370
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,580
I started doing some useless things again.

371
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,210
I'm busy enough with my mountain of cases.

372
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,090
What kind of society is this now?

373
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,820
Forget about the promotion. Do you want to see your husband being punished?

374
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,710
It's really dirty.

375
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,570
Sometimes I feel that you are not as good as outsiders

376
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,760
Misato, who just moved in not long ago, is very active in helping me get revenge

377
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,920
Is this the one in Miri, Building 213, No. 1004?

378
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,560
Um

379
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,930
I can do it

380
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,290
One more time

381
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,690
Wow, this smells like alcohol

382
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,250
How can I get so drunk? I can do it.

383
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,500
What

384
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,720
member

385
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,880
I am a member who drinks with members

386
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,330
Damn Members Members

387
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,190
Oh, wake up!

388
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,600
I really can't stand you

389
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,440
How much did you pay for the driver?

390
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,020
I don't know. ...

391
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,940
Did he give all the money in his wallet away?

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,470
Really

393
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,170
I know it's like this

394
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,780
hateful

395
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,320
I can do it

396
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,130
Where is your card?

397
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,530
I don't know, maybe it's somewhere.

398
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,500
Where is that place?

399
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,850
I don't know. ...

400
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,340
I can't stand it. I really can't stand it.

401
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,090
Wake up.

402
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,990
Really

403
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,680
It hurts so much

404
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,680
Member I'm in pain

405
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,420
Oh, really.

406
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,410
Where did it fall?

407
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,730
Could it have fallen somewhere else?

408
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,030
Really, that won't do.

409
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,030
I can't stand it.

410
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,720
I'm so pissed off.

411
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,630
Who parked in my parking space?

412
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,930
OK

413
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,200
Um

414
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,370
Hey, do me a favor.

415
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,290
What can I do for you?

416
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,070
You see that junky car on the left?

417
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,310
Found it

418
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,380
Park Seung-ho, you only wake up when something serious happens, right?

419
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,760
Oh, I can't stand it.

420
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,290
What? Who parked like this?

421
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,870
Ouch ouch

422
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,420
Oh my god, is this crazy?

423
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,170
No cell phone either.

424
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,880
What to do?

425
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,470
There's no way to step on the roof.

426
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,680
What? What's going on?

427
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,380
Is the battery dead?

428
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,560
No way

429
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,880
Not wait a minute

430
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,820
Oh my god

431
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,630
Am I trapped? Am I trapped?

432
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,450
Are you really trapped?

433
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,380
Ah Park Seung-ho

434
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,550
Is there anyone? Is there anyone?

435
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,630
Someone is trapped here.

436
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,120
Is there anyone outside?

437
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,970
I'm so sorry

438
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,820
There are people here

439
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,150
Uncle

440
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,360
Thank you

441
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,570
What are you doing? Everyone is sleeping now.

442
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,970
No, I'm stuck in the car.

443
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,390
The battery just ran out of power again

444
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,120
Can you let the car next to you?

445
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
Oh, there's a car blocking the way ahead.

446
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,260
Can you help me push the car in front of me?

447
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,120
Wait a minute

448
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,080
OK, thanks

449
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,460
Oops, the handbrake seems to be pulled up

450
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,840
What

451
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,170
It was the same last time

452
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,130
So

453
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,510
Could you help me make a call?

454
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,300
Refusal to answer?

455
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,620
What

456
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,820
Don't answer the phone

457
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,550
Could you please call the driver of the car next to you?

458
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,280
No phone number posted

459
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,170
What

460
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,380
Really

461
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,000
This seems to be the phone number of a store.

462
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,020
Please

463
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,700
Please answer the phone.

464
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,050
Oh, no one answered. What should I do?

465
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,800
Didn't answer?

466
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,520
I'm sorry, can I make a phone call?

467
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,030
sure

468
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,000
Park Seung-ho is really...

469
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,980
Ah Park Hyun-ji

470
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,090
These two Parks are really...

471
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,280
Alas Miri

472
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
It's so narrow, sister.

473
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,670
What's going on? There's really anything going on.

474
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,360
It's so cold

475
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,920
Miri, be patient.

476
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,080
The administrator has come to your house.

477
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,940
Um

478
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,310
Are these hooligans going too far?

479
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,340
I mean don't mess with them, right?

480
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,460
I went upstairs but no one answered the door no matter how many times I rang the doorbell

481
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,800
Please call a tow truck.

482
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,430
The building is a private area and trailers are not allowed.

483
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,150
What

484
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,200
Illegal parking in my sister's private area cannot be solved even if the police come

485
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,440
Otherwise, we have to change the law. There has to be a way to solve it.

486
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,430
I'll ask if I can broadcast it.

487
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,980
OK

488
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,890
Thank you. Thank you.

489
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,750
Sister, um

490
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,400
I think something's going to happen

491
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
My sister said she seemed to be in trouble.

492
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,290
What's wrong

493
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,130
I can't help it

494
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,120
She said she couldn't bear it anymore

495
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,030
I feel like I'm about to explode

496
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,410
She said it was going to explode

497
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,840
Hello

498
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,330
Hello Miri

499
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,560
Behind

500
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,090
How can I pee in here?

501
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,120
no

502
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,000
Can you help me find something else?

503
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,420
What's wrong

504
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,820
Hurry up!

505
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,990
Are you okay? Can you bear it?

506
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,430
The situation is very urgent now

507
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,690
Hold it, hold it, hold it

508
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,480
Hey Keiko

509
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,440
Mmm, Mmm, for you.

510
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,000
This one doesn't seem to fit in.

511
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,910
I can't put it in. I can't put it in.

512
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,200
this

513
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,920
Pull harder.

514
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,200
What?

515
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,710
I'll look for it later.

516
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,910
Yeah, go quickly and come back quickly

517
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,660
Please, someone save me.

518
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,530
I forgot I had this.

519
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,590
Give you a plastic bag

520
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,830
Is this the best option?

521
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,560
Otherwise, what should I do? Just pee directly?

522
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,100
Better than peeing your pants.

523
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,190
This can be stuffed in, hurry up

524
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,730
The bags in our supermarket are very sturdy.

525
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,270
Damn, I'm so sorry.

526
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,980
Coming, coming

527
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,520
This is good, isn't it?

528
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,350
Come to you

529
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,310
This is the best choice

530
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,380
Give it a try, yes.

531
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,580
You can

532
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,290
Look, look, hurry up.

533
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:33,760
Turn around

534
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,070
Oh, considering our relationship... turn around

535
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,650
Turn around, turn around

536
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,560
Sister, um

537
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,290
Misato must be very embarrassed. Sing a song.

538
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,230
Okay, I'll sing a song

539
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:53,750

Do you have to sing this kind of song?

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,130
Oh, the car is a famous brand

739
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,240
He is a fake counterfeit.

740
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,390
Oh, it's really stupid and rude.

741
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,700
Really

742
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,210
It seems I can't stand it anymore.

743
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,040
Delicious, huh?

744
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,110
It's so delicious. We shipped this directly from Jeju Island.

745
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,260

Hello, Hello, Hello

752
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,830
Why are you throwing this away?

753
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,190
Because this one is expired.

754
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,430
This isn't your store, you bastard.

755
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,400
Don't you know how to save?

756
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,820
It's only been a week since it expired

757
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,400
Ah, boss

758
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,380
That already smells bad.

759
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,450
It's okay. Just do it this way.

760
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,380
Get out, get out quickly

761
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,810
How come the workers have no sense of responsibility?

762
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,370
Please serve us some more side dishes

763
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,310
Oh ok, I'll be right there.

764
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,390
Our side dishes are delicious.

765
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,560
The food is very clean and fresh

766
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,210
Oh, of course it's clean. If it's not enough, just say it.

767
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,770

You guys messed up my car.

772
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,710
It's too late to apologize now.

773

779
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,240
What did I do wrong to be reported by you?

780
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,680
You did more than one or two things wrong.

781
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,580
How about starting with me?

782
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,720

788
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,760
Do you have evidence?

789
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,440
Is there?

790
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,680
You want evidence so much

791
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,700
Here

792
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,670
Where did you pick up this thing to frame someone?

793
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,310
Are you going to play dumb till the end?

794
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,780
So how about this

You kid

797
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,330
Hey, it's been a month.

798
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,190
It's been a year

799
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,590
Isn't it just a week ago?

800
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,580

801
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,890
Thank you, boss

802
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,100
Hello

803
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,740
By the way, have you left work five minutes earlier than the end of the day these days?

804
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,700
Oh, this is me

805
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,700
Not only is the salary in arrears

806
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,100
Violating the minimum wage standard

807
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,420
Ah, I didn't mean to not give it to you.

808
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,520
Hey, working people, working people

809
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,630
Hey, didn't I say I would give it to you?

810
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,260
Although thrift is a virtue

811
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,440
But even the side dishes are reused sparingly

812
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,200
Is this too much?

813
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,880
What are you talking about?

814
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,780
No, no

815
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,430
She's just talking nonsense.

816
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,270
Nothing can be recycled

817
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,010
So you've set your sights on the side dishes?

818
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,060
Auntie, what are you talking about?

819
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,170
No, no, no, no

820
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,000
It's only been a week since it expired

821
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,150
It already has a bad smell, it's okay, just do it this way

822
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,310
No, when was this filmed?

823
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,240
Ah, this is what I just...

824
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,040
I just did it secretly.

825
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,430
So we secretly took some photos.

826
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,090
Which guy took this photo?

827
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,830
Um which guy

828
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,620
No, not me

829
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,580
It's my brother

830
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,780
My brother also said that you have delayed paying my salary for two months.

831
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,310
That is to say, if the overdue salary can be paid on time,

832
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,770
This won't happen anymore.

833
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,660
We are all people who live on hourly wages

834
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,270
You guys come here.

835
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,480
I'm going to sue you guys today.

Is the boss here?

838
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,210
Who is it?

Where are you from?

843
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,500
We are the audit team

844
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,730
We received a report that this store was suspected of labeling false origin information

845
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,830
and using expired food

846
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,470
No

847
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,220
I heard you guys reuse side dishes.

848
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,120

849
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,310

00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,500
Hello

927
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,990
Why haven't you come yet?

928
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,920
Because you didn't come, I'm

929
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,500
Hey, hey, hey, come quickly anyway.

930
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,950
There is a baby carriage blocking the main entrance.

931
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,350
Baby carriage

932
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,210
It's said the tire burst

933
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,170
Really

934
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,200
Hey, hey, hey, then...

935
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,100
From the back door

936
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,870
Now the car can't get in through the back door.

937
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,000
Also, I have to close the iron door of the store.

938
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,480
My friend, stop bullying me.

939
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,200
Hello, Hello, Hello

940
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,740
How can you just leave like this?

941
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,590
Hey, Lauren, Lauren

942
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,740
Speak quickly

943
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,880
Can you come pick up my brother?

944
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,940
This is the parking lot of the Guangshan Housing Estate.

945
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:34,110
What is Brother Guangshan? Who is that?

946
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,330
My brother is really anxious.

947
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,290
Please wait for me, can you come and pick me up?

948
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,440
Speak slowly. Speak slowly.

949
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,210
But who are you with now?

950
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,990
The signal here is not very good

951
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,700
What did you say

952
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,270
What's going on?

953
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,480
I can't hear who you are with.

954
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,020
Hello

955
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,560
What?

956
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,170
Shut down

957
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,770
Then I can't even call the insurance company.

958
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,790
No

959
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,680
Damn

960
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,410
Very cold

961
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,680
No more oil

962
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,240
There's nothing left.

963
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,790
no

964
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,420
The battery is dead.

965
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,750
Damn it, it's cold.

966
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,400
This won't work.

967
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,030
Wait a moment

968
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,200
This won't work.

969
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,250
Is anyone there?

970
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,150
Is there anyone?

971
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,490
Uncle Security Guard

972
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,680
Someone come

973
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,120
Sisters, I was wrong.

974
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,230
I will never again

975
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,170
Never again.

976
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,890
I will really live kindly and quietly

977
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,100
Sisters, please move the car.

978
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,050
Sure enough, he is someone who doesn't understand what people say.

979
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,830
You should experience it yourself to wake up

980
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,290
yes

981
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,610
Have you reflected on this enough?

982
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,640
yes

983
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,050
Don't cause trouble to others and be a good person

984
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,400
We'll keep an eye on you

985
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,140
Please look at me.

986
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,860
Car, car, car... hurry up

987
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,470
Move the car

988
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,290
Looks anxious.

989
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,510
Thanks

990
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,590
You're here really early.

991
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,820
Come come come

992
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,480
Drive slower

993
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,820
If you go to the front of Building 212

994
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,510
There is a parking space

995
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:22,450
OK

996
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,230
OK

997
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,730
That's it.

998
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:25,890
Slow down

999
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,810
OK OK

1000
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:30,200
A little more. A little more. OK

1001
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,230
OK

1002
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,940
The sisters are here

1003
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,470
I worked hard today.

1004
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,270
Not hard

1005
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,270
Please come down and I'll park the car.

1006
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,500
No

1007
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,670
Get off

1008
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,240
Oh, really.

1009
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,850
Uncle can't park in front of the car like that

1010
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,680
Please drive away Please drive away

1011
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,640
Right, right, drive away. That's it.

1012
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,230
Please go back

1013
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,720
Wait, I'll bring the car keys up.

1014
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,520
OK, thanks

1015
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,620
Please go back

1016
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,660
Looks like he's cheered up.

1017
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,970
That is to say

1018
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,190
It's pretty cute looking at this.

1019
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,290
I'm going to take care of the beauty.

1020
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,580
Take care, sister, go back.

1021
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,710
good

1022
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,730
Ouch

1023
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,970
Hello

1024
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,300
She is the mother of child number 1004.

1025
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,010
Thank you for your hard work last time.

1026
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,500
There's nothing we can do together.

1027
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:29,660
Ouch

1028
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,710
Then you go slowly

1029
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,160
Okay, go back.

1030
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,380
So kind.

1031
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,140
Is this the new family that moved here?

1032
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,450
That's right

1033
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:44,080
Fortunately, the people who moved here are good people.

1034
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,900
That person doesn't know about that.

1035
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,360
It seems like that

1036
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,030
I've said it all, no

1037
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,160
Really, I saw you guys yesterday.

1038
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,440
No

1039
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,070
Do you want to eat spicy rice cakes?

1040
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:55,990
Spicy rice cake?

1041
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,270
No, I should go to cram school.

1042
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,600
The weather is great

1043
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,270
What?

1044
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,150
What's going on?

1045
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,770
What?

1046
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,810
You dare to run

1047
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,370
Miri Miri Miri

1048
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,530
Hey, stop right there.

1049
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,080
You crazy guy

1050
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,420
Don't come over here

1051
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,530
Misato, wait for me

1052
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,800
Chase him, chase him

1053
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,410
stop

1054
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,250
Don't follow me anymore

1055
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:57,290
Stop Miri

1056
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,560
Miri

1057
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,000
Hello

1058
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Miri

1059
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,910
hateful

1060
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,750
Hello

1061
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,610
Stop following me, damn it.

1062
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,000
stop

1063
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,880
Miri

1064
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,240
Misato, wait a minute.

1065
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,600
Uncle here

1066
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,310
Let's go together.

1067
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,560
Chasing the criminals Chasing the criminals

1068
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,980
I'm so busy.

1069
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,750
What kind of shit is this?

1070
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,540
Really

1071
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,350
Gather them all together first.

1072
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,620
Are you sure you ran in here?

1073
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,100
How can anyone come in?

1074
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,470
Everybody is working.

1075
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,590
We're delivering it tonight.

1076
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,200
We don't have the time.

1077
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,900
What did you see?

1078
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,020
They are all very angry

1079
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,090
uncle

1080
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,640
Where did you run off to?

1081
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,630
You must have seen it, right?

1082
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,330
Let's go talk, everyone.

1083
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,480
What do you want to talk about?

1084
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,870
Wait a moment

1085
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,920
Come inside and talk to me.

1086
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,770
Come in quickly, quickly

1087
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,020
I'm so busy. What are you doing now?

1088
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,270
Get in quickly

1089
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,980
It's yours, right?

1090
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,760
Sorry...I'm sorry.

1091
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,880
Sorry, I seem to have temporarily lost my mind.

1092
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,800
Spare me this time.

1093
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,410
sorry

1094
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,660
Is Kim Kyung Hee a pervert?

1095
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,680
Is Jin Jingxi crazy?

1096
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,960
You are really amazing

1097
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,440
Miri, how do you know who it is?

1098
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,970
I just saw that exhibitionist

1099
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,200
The bottom is just as small as this MP3

1100
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,980
So I told the police

1101
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,750
Please find the criminal according to this size.

1102
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,410
But I'm a little hungry.

1103
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,660
Should we go get something to eat?

1104
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:01,040
Misato, do you want to come to our house to eat spicy rice cakes?

1105
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:01,950
Spicy rice cake?

1106
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,420
OK

1107
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,240
Let's go.

1108
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,020
Eat more

1109
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,260
Thanks

1110
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,550
The same to you

1111
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,180
Eat it!

1112
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,890
How about it

1113
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,620
It's really delicious

1114
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,960
You can try it too

1115
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,460
Your mother's craftsmanship is really amazing

1116
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,430
Right? We can open a snack bar now.

1117
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:29,730
That is to say

1118
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,960
Then let's go for a walk after we finish eating.

1119
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,310
Where should we go?

1120
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,650
Ji-eun

1121
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,270
Ji-eun, what's wrong with you?

1122
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,390
Ji Eun Ji Eun

1123
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,970
Ji-eun, let me see if anyone is there.

1124
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,800
Is there anyone?

1125
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:03,340
Ji-eun, what's wrong with you?

1126
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,320
Ji-eun

1127
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:35,170
[3 months ago]

1128
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,800
If there is any special situation, please tell me immediately

1129
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,600
I'll leave it to you all.

1130
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:27,630
Find out what medicine this is.

1131
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,650
yes

1132
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,360
This is Lefude

1133
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,450
Psychiatric drugs

1134
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,090
Psychiatric?

1135
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,090
yes

1136
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,010
Do you have two daughters?

1137
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,560
What are the kids going to do?

1138
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:06,550
Really spacious

1139
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,910
Is this house really only sold at this price?

1140
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:18,350
The owner is in a hurry to sell the house due to personal reasons.

1141
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,070
There won't be anything wrong with the house, right?

1142
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,640
How could there be a problem?

1143
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,860
The owner is a very clean person.

1144
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,490
It's no different from a new house.

1145
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,930
It's really clean.

1146
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,540
Great view

1147
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,700
This is the golden floor.

1148
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,000
Such a good house

1149
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,490
The one who catches it immediately is the winner.

1150
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,610
I signed

1151
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,300
[Thanks to the actors Kim Min-ho, Kim Jun-hyun and Moon-hee for their friendly guest appearances]

1152
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,620
[Preview of the next episode]

1153
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,210
You can't ignore your friend's sincerity like this.

1154
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,320
Maybe he was bullied by bad students.

1155
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,190
What

1156
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,940
I'm afraid you'll get beaten and feel lonely.

1157
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,890
So I picked someone for you.

1158
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:35,890
Let you love each other and be beaten together

1159
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:36,780
Please stop fighting.

1160
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,490
Go up

1161
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,460
The gangsters are all together

1162
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,740
Aunties, come and help you.

1163
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,570
Please don't do anything.

1164
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,510
We're very quiet upstairs.

1165
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,710
I thought no one lived there.

1166
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,260
I heard there's a pervert in the 2nd residential area.

1167
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,660
A report was received

1168
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,970
We are law-breaking teenagers

1169
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,670
No matter what you do, you won't get caught.

1170
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,890
Everything has two sides.
