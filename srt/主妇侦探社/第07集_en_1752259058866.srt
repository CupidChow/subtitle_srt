Has anyone seen the puppy?

Do you remember who was the resident who noticed the puppy calling you?

It seems that this is really the dog of the resident in No. 902.

393
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,330
You don't believe that the dead dog is related to the disappearance of the owner.

394

Coincidentally, the dog owner also suddenly disappeared.

397

Is it just a coincidence?

398
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,770

If the resident of No. 902 took the puppy's body away

Let's take a look

424
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,250
The red ribbons tied to the two bodies were made of different materials.

The plush ribbon tied around the neck of the part-time student in the cafe

427
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,630
But the one tied around the neck of the victim in the Zhang Dachuan murder case was made of nylon.

428
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,190
So it means that the murderers in these two cases may be different people.

429
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,900
Here lies the problem

430
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,290
The knots on both bodies were tied in the same way.

431
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,920

432
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,720
Although plush and nylon are made of different materials

433
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,950
But the knotting method is the same

434
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,490

00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,380
This is the same material as the ribbon used in the recent coffee shop work-study incident.

447
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,430
The Ribbon Killer only uses the plush ribbon on his first victim.

448
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,070
Then nylon material was used

449

However, the material of the ribbons in the first case and the subsequent crimes is indeed different.

yes

548

Doctor, do you know that feeling of your whole body freezing up?

But all I can do is cry and tremble

556
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,740
You feel a great sense of powerlessness

557
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,400
And the self-blame and traumatic stress I felt at the time

558

582
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm afraid it will be harder to overcome that trauma.

583
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,500
No, I don't think so.

584
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,280

If I see clearly

586
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,760
I won't be trapped in endless self-blame and regret.

587
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,440
Instead, I will try my best to find the murderer.

I understand your pain.

589
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,790
But from now on

590
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,490
You have to try to differentiate

What are the things you can do and what are the things you can't do

592
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,040
Now you have to make a decision

593
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,500
Is it to continue to immerse in the painful past

594
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,570

Did she say she knew where Ji-eun's mother was buried?

603
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,900
She doesn't know

604

And was brutally murdered

631
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,020
Is this asking for trouble?

632
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,870
It's just asking for trouble if we pursue it.

633
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,989
Because she alone harmed the interests of the entire community

634
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:26,000

Who will move in?

636
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,760
He must be a person who behaves inappropriately.

637
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,290
Otherwise, how could you attract such brutal criminals to behave indecently?

638
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,650
Are you saying that the victim was killed because he made a mistake?

639

To be honest, I've seen her several times.

There is no manners and it is an eyesore.

642

Do you deserve to be killed just because you are an eyesore?

But our Yunzhu is a little different

902
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,770
She didn't scream or run away.

903
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,150
How can you live like this?

904
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,000
You've never really liked anyone, have you?

905
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,790
If you have someone you like, you won't live like this.

906
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:25,530
As long as you think of that person, you won't be able to do such a shameful thing.

907
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:37,050
It should be very cold. Be careful of catching a cold.

908
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,870
She was the first person to worry about me.

909
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,080
My shame welled up like a spring.

910
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,510
But the strange thing is that it's bumping around here

911
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,520
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop.

912
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,370
For the first time, I felt like I was alive

913
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,760
Do you like her?

914
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,980
No. 902

915
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,360
What is number 902?

916
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,810
It's not No. 902, it's Yunzhu

917
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,880
Kang Yoon-joo Kang Yoon-joo Kang Yoon-joo

918
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,720
Did you know it's Kang Yoon-joo?

919
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,990
Please forgive me I have a sick son

920
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,320
Without me, our Xiaolu would die.

921
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,110
Please forgive me

922
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,770
Please forgive me, please forgive me

923
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,840
Don't worry

924
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,710
This can't kill people.

925
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,570
Unless it's an animal

926
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,320
Did you kill the cat?

927
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,430
Did you also tear off the missing dog flyer?

928
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,030
Of course

929
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,350
The flyer has Yunzhu's contact number.

930
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,590
You can't let anyone know her contact number.

931
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,040
This world is so dangerous

932
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,000
Then why did you kill her?

933
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,800
If you like her so much, why kill her?

934
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,850
Let me tell you something interesting

935
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,330
Have you seen that?

936
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:34,810
That's Yunzhu's favorite scented candle.

937
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:39,770
When it's burned out, I'll send you off nicely.

938
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,030
This way, our Yunzhu won't be lonely.

939
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,100
Why me?

940
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,210
Why should I die?

941
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,530
I have never done anything to offend you.

942
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,640
What did I do to you?

943
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,540
Why should I die?

944
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,140
Let me go, save me.

945
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,680
Shhh

946
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,110
Damn it!

947
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,210
Did you kill No. 902 in this way?

948
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,830
Why kill her?

949
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,370
People live and die

950
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,560
Sometimes you will encounter something unavoidable

951
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,090
Just like today

952
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,370
Don't come over

953
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:38,220
Others may die but I won't.

954
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,870
I can't die

955
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,650
Because I'm a mom

956
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,500
Don't come over

957
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,650
Don't come over

958
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,220
It's okay. It's okay.

961

It's okay. It's okay.

962
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,320
Who are you?

963
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,080
Excuse me, do you order delivery from One Two Fried Chicken?

964
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,210
Who ate fried chicken? I'm losing weight.

965
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,390
Wait a moment

966
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,950
It tastes like fried chicken

967
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,700
What's the taste?

968
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,280
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

969
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,360
Wait a minute, I'll go in and take a look.

970
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,370
Auntie, Auntie

971
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:54,730
Auntie, you are trespassing.

972
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,610
Why did you lie? Didn't you say you didn't eat fried chicken?

973
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,830
Is there something hidden?

974
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,710
Take it away

975
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:06,760
Take it away

976
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,910
It's just a fried chicken, but you think I'm a thief

977
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:11,820
When I came back I saw fried chicken hanging on the door handle

978
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,630
I thought someone gave it to me for free.

979
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,720
Is this yours?

980
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,530
no

981
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:18,840
Then get out.

982
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,050
Sorry, sorry, get out of here!

983
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,520
I'm going out. I'm going out. Go out quickly.

984
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:31,930
Who on earth would order food to be delivered to someone else's house?

985
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,090
Is this a prank?

986
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,340
Are they using fake orders to lure people in?

987
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,600
No. 406

988
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,740
No. 404

989
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,170
I put it on because I was afraid it would get hit by a car like its mother...
