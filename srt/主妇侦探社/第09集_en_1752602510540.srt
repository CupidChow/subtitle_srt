00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,640
If there was one, they would have been arrested and handed over to the police.

545
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,020
I thought about it carefully

546
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,220
Could the person who framed you be Park Tae-hoon's accomplice?

547
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,240
What's the meaning

548
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,600
That day

549
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,270
That was the day you were framed as the murderer and taken away by the police.

550
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,320
Park Tae-hoon was preparing for his third murder at No. 405

551
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,630
At that time, someone anonymously reported you as the murderer.

552
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,470
Report innocent people

553
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,430
Trying to buy time for Park Tae-hoon to commit the crime

554
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,140
And they are interfering with us who are looking for Suxi.

555
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,250
Oh my god, you really care about Park Tae-hoon's case.

556
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,070
I heard that you were a classmate of the high school girl killed by the Ribbon Killer.

557
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,560
Is that why you're so persistent?

558
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,120
How do you know this?

559
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,230
I was released from the police station.

560
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,630
I heard this when I visited you in the hospital.

561
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,720
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

562
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,920
You must have felt heavy-hearted over the past twenty years.

563
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,260
If I could, I really want to catch him myself.

564
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,560
Maybe the Ribbon Killer thinks

565
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,260
21 years ago, he personally let that high school girl go

566
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,120
It was the mistake of his life.

567
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,830
Because the root of evil was not removed that day

568
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,810
Are you saying that I might die at the hands of that person?

569
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,630
If I were the Ribbon Killer, I would definitely do this

570
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,080
Is it me who dies or him who dies?

571
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,160
You have to try it to know.

572
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
He is old

573
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,250
And I am no longer a timid girl

574
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,610
I don't think Park Tae-hoon acted alone.

575
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,380
He should have been ordered to kill someone.

576
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,880
Or the person who led him to kill

577
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,220
You mean that person is the one who reported me?

578
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,670
He is the real Ribbon Killer

579
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,350
If it weren't for the Ribbon Killer himself

580
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,640
The one who was ordered by the Ribbon Killer

581
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,420
Let's make a deal

582
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,020
wrong

583
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,750
I think we should cooperate.

584
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,720
Cooperation?

585
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,970
Excuse me, uncle

586
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,820
[The murderer who killed my son]

587
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,610
Drink some of this before you do it.

588
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,820
Sorry for the trouble. Thanks.

589
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,300
Excuse me

590
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,150
Have you heard Auntie say who she suspects?

591
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,410
Even if someone doubts her, she will just keep it to herself.

592
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,650
I won't tell others easily.

593
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,450
Oh, there's something quite strange.

594
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,640
What is it?

595
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,140
On rainy days, you have to eat pancakes.

596
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,720
She hasn't come to see me for a while. What's wrong?

597
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,510
One day she came to me with a bad look on her face.

598
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,160
What's wrong

599
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,580
But she suddenly said

600
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,110
elder sister

601
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,390
If there is someone you want to kill

602
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,710
Will you kill him?

603
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,900
Someone you want to kill?

604
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,030
What happened?

605
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,210
I have someone I want to kill.

606
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,380
I must kill him myself.

607
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,200
I think it might be about the person who killed her daughter.

608
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,180
So I didn't continue asking.

609
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,460
Then a week later something happened.

610
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,910
It should be two days before the victims' family association meeting

611
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,090
Just leave it alone, I'll take care of it

612
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,080
I always owe favors to the residents

613
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,120
Always give back

614
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,760
I heard that the women's association president has been giving you trouble.

615
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,470
It probably won't happen after a while.

616
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,960
By the way, the previous resident of this house

617
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,730
Ms. Lee Min-sun

618
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,810
Ms. Li

619
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,430
I later found out she was my friend's mother

620
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,110
I just found out recently.

621
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,990
This is too coincidental.

622
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,200
yes

623
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,230
Are you familiar with her?

624
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,900
She is a very kind person.

625
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,180
I was told that I was a man living alone and gave me some side dishes.

626
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,670
Is a very good person

627
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,620
I don't know why I made such an extreme choice.

628
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,810
I also want to know

629
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,060
Wait a moment

630
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,800
Hello

631
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
Yes I know

632
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,700
What should I do? I have to leave first.

633
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,270
Oh, you are so busy, why are you still here to help me? Go quickly

634
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,490
Thanks for your hard work

635
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,450
So painful

636
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,230
I can't hold on any longer.

637
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,050
[It’s so painful, I can’t bear it any longer, I’ll go find you right away]

638
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,740
I'll find you soon

639
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,090
It's so painful I can't stand it anymore

640
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,840
[It’s so painful that I can’t bear it any longer. I want to be by your side...I want to rest]

641
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:35,370
I want to rest by your side...

642
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,270
Mom will come to you soon.

643
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,850
[I want to be with you...I will come to you right away after you have a rest]

644
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,380
Could this be...

645
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,840
It's so painful I can't stand it anymore

646
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,240
I want to rest by your side...

647
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,050
[It’s so painful that I can’t bear it any longer. I want to be by your side...I want to rest]

648
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,930
I'll find you soon

649
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,970
This is an incomplete sentence.

650
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,900
This is what my aunt wrote in her diary, and it's imprinted on the next page.

651
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,080
I copied down everything I could see.

652
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,090
Is this a suicide note?

653
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,500
So I want to confirm the contents of the suicide note, sister.

654
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,080
Come and see

655
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,750
This is the indentation where the words were written on the previous page

656
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,860
But the previous page is gone.

657
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,350
So sister, what you mean is that the page before it disappeared might be a suicide note, right?

658
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,520
But even if the previous page that disappeared was a suicide note

659
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,389
I always feel like something is wrong

660
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,610
What is a sister's suicide note?

661
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,570
What can

662
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,510
Aren't these the last words left before dying?

663
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,900
But you see, this is not the last page.

664
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,210
There is also something written at the back

665
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,920
Since it is not the last page

666
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,290
This means that this is not necessarily what was written before death.

667
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,330
That's right

668
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:42,179
I fully understand that you care about that person's death and feel sorry for her.

669
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,010
But you're wrong to suspect she didn't commit suicide.

670
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,449
What's wrong

671
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,460
If the death was caused by homicide

672
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,929
There will be traces left at the crime scene.

673
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,179
Such as the footprints or fingerprints of a second person

674
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,290
But there was no sign of murder.

675
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,160
That's why the police closed the case as suicide.

676
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,950
But now you doubt that it was not suicide

677
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,630
You are denying the police's findings.

678
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,180
It is also an insult to the Korean police.

679
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,100
I did not mean that

680
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,800
Maybe the police missed some clue.

681
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,210
so

682
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,390
You mean

683
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,210
South Korean Police

684
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,630
No, my husband who was in charge of the case at the time was a fool, right?

685
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,520
Oh, sister, why are you talking like that?

686
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,650
Qiu Qingzi, why are you so excited again?

687
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,120
Can't we do this in front of the police's family?

688
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,320
Raise reasonable doubt?

689
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,380
All right

690
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,000
If you disagree, stop talking.

691
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,080
elder sister

692
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,230
Are you really leaving like this?

693
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,260
Miri

694
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,120
I know you have a good sixth sense.

695
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,210
But don't trust that too much.

696
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,240
It might become a weapon to frame a good person.

697
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,650
elder sister

698
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,340
If you go over now, there will be another argument.

699
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,450
I'll go check it out

700
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,570
elder sister

701
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,300
It seems that Sister Qingzi is really angry

702
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,440
She seems to have misunderstood me.

703
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,540
Let her be

704
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,650
Even if she left in anger now, she wouldn't last more than a day.

705
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,280
Qiu Qingzi will never bear grudges.

706
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,890
What are these? So many

707
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,860
Everyone applaud!

708
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,890
I also want to find a woman with a good temper like my sister-in-law

709
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,200
What are you saying?

710
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,660
This seems a bit inappropriate.

711
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,020
But my sister-in-law is totally my dream girl

712
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,080
Really

713
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,130
Sister-in-law, I have something to give you

714
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,130
This is it

715
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,950
You lunatic, who are you competing with for love now?

716
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,990
Oh, but what to do?

717
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,560
My dream lover is Lu Kangzhi

718
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,220
What a shit dream girl

719
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,600
What does it mean to come here late at night?

720
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,350
Please do just one thing.

721
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,430
You must be asking me to do something weird.

722
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,630
Otherwise, they are threatening me.

723
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,350
What is the threat?

724
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,280
Everyone works so hard day and night.

725
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,270
How about this? Call over all the people who are working overtime.

726
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,380
Come on, everybody.

727
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,130
Team leader, Detective Jiang, please come over.

728
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,470
Suicide Note

729
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,510
I heard that the day when Lee Min-sun jumped off the building

730
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,680
Left a suicide note

731
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,490
There should be a suicide note in the case file.

732
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,630
Is it for this? Is it for this? To perform this act in the middle of the night?

733
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,640
Otherwise why would I do this?

734
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,680
So sudden and inexplicable in the middle of the night

735
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,000
Waste of money, time, energy

736
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Why am I so tired?

737
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,450
I don't allow it because of my self-esteem.

738
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,140
Otherwise I wouldn't come to you.

739
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,880
Disclosure of case records is prohibited

740
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,530
You were a police officer, so why are you still saying this?

741
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,620
Go back quickly

742
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,870
no

743
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,420
It's all because Kong Meili said the old man's death didn't seem like suicide.

744
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,490
What does this mean?

745
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,050
She thinks he was murdered.

746
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,910
These aunties are addicted to the detective game.

747
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,500
There's no medicine for this.

748
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,140
And you think we only rely on a suicide note

749
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,700
Just close the case as suicide?

750
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,440
It was based on the situation at the time

751
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,070
Conclusions from the investigation and autopsy results

752
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,110
I said, of course I know.

753
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,530
I used to be a policeman.

754
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,580
So you say I can't be angry?

755
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,090
She said it was murder.

756
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,510
Not that you had 24 hours a day.

757
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,590
How could I not know if I was investigated day and night 365 days a year?

758
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,130
Don't touch me

759
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,380
It hurts my self-esteem.

760
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,050
Do you think it's reasonable to say that he killed me?

761
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,050
Didn't Aunt Kong Meili say it was murder?

762
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,050
right

763
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,690
I'm speechless.

764
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,360
She said he killed her.

765
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,980
You also feel hurt in your self-esteem, right?

766
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,320
Qiu Qingzi just knows how to control me

767
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,540
This is also a form of emotional blackmail

768
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,780
[Report on Lee Min-sun's suicide by falling from a building]

769
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,230
That's why I said my previous boss was terrible.

770
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,760
[The cause of death was a skull fracture and other fractures caused by jumping from a building...]

771
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,820
[Based on the suicide note in the house and the shape and direction of the indoor tow truck on the balcony, it is judged that the person jumped from the building spontaneously]

772
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,520
Hello sister

773
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,340
Miri

774
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,820
The old man once ordered dried persimmons

775
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,940
Order dried persimmons?

776
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,260
I know someone in Sangju

777
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,850
We started selling dried persimmons last year.

778
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,440
I now find that the elderly have ordered gift boxes of dried persimmons

779
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,360
[Reservation of gift box dried persimmons for Room 1004, Building 213, February 15, 2025]

780
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,430
[The order was cancelled due to the sudden death of the orderer.]

781
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,480
It was booked on February 15th this year.

782
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,560
She died on February 20th, exactly 5 days ago.

783
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,050
Auntie should meet me

784
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,430
That persimmon

785
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,360
It should be sent to me.

786
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,250
She said at the time

787
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,760
It's for an important person I haven't seen for a long time.

788
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,150
She still remembers that I like to eat dried persimmons

789
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,630
elder sister

790
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,380
Do you think your aunt really died of suicide?

791
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,610
Miri

792
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,840
if

793
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,170
What would you do if her death was not suicide?

794
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,240
Of course we have to find out the truth

795
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,320
I will find out the truth

796
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,520
Hello, this is the management office.

797
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,610
This is number 1104. My toilet is clogged.

798
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,110
Please call someone.

799
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,520
Who should I call in the middle of the night?

800
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,210
Lend me the toilet tool

801
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,480
How long will you live here?

802
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,040
There is still one month left before the contract expires

803
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,740
The rent has been paid

804
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,760
Is this your first time in the basement?

805
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,720
What's wrong? Is there anything here?

806
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,380
There is a musty smell that is so unpleasant

807
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,470
Return it after use.

808
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,360
I've been away from my position for too long. I'm leaving now.

809
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,500
Please help me check something through this person

810
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,880
Because he never told me

811
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,530
But this matter

812
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,640
Is it really related to the Ribbon Killer?

813
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,570
What you need to know if you want to find out the truth

814
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,520
There has never been such a service so far

815
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,480
I am the gossipy Director Jin.

816
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,470
Hey, this customer is calling so late, is there something wrong?

817
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,250
Usually the people who call at this time want to find out about an affair.

818
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,880
How about I check on your wife?

819
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,610
Guangshan Community Housing Building 213, No. 1004

820
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,760
Who is the person Li Minshan asked you to investigate?

821
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,280
Damn this gentleman.

822
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,620
This is not a case commissioned by a deceased person.

823
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,960
Why should I tell you guys who don't even know who it is?

824
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,120
Please cooperate while I am talking.

825
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,590
I know you are using your former police identity

826
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,010
Using connections to help people investigate

827
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,610
Do you not even want the civil servant pension?

828
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,770
You also charge high fees to the client.

829
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,180
Do you pay your income tax honestly?

830
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,720
I have a registered business license and I am doing business legally. What do you know?

831
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,960
Since it is so open and aboveboard

832
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,380
I want to investigate too.

833
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,710
Is it legal for you to investigate others?

834
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,380
Is that an illegal credit agency?

835
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,790
Hey, you dare to investigate me?

836
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,330
I've never seen a rogue like you.

837
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,630
Hello, who are you?

838
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,360
Please reply me as soon as possible

839
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,630
Hello

840
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,600
Ouch

841
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,860
recorder

842
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,080
For mini recorders

843
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,960
She even ordered fried chicken just to ask me that.

844
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,860
Oh, thank you.

845
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,870
There are coupons inside, please use them slowly

846
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,300
that...

847
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,200
Wait a moment

848
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,550
I want to trouble you with one thing

849
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,940
Why does she need a mini recorder?

850
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,540
So did you tell her?

851
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,420
It's not because she doesn't know how to shop online

852
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,250
So I bought her one.

853
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,600
I don't know what she's going to do with it though.

854
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,460
But I feel like she really needs that thing.

855
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,260
I'm leaving

856
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,720
Su Hee

857
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,030
Do you also think my suspicion is exaggerated?

858
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,000
If that's the case

859
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,210
Would I make this trip so late?

860
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,900
(Note: about NT$63)
I can earn an extra 3,000 won by running one more delivery.

861
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,190
I trust you

862
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,480
Good night, sister

863
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,030
Mini Recorder

864
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,680
She even ordered fried chicken just to ask me that.

865
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,160
Park Hyun-ji

866
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,910
Have you slept yet?

867
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,260
Don't forget to bring your sportswear again and run home. Remember to bring it with you.

868
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,160
Did you hear that, Park Hyun-ji?

869
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,910
Park Hyun-ji

870
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,360
What's this

871
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,560
boss

872
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,980
It's me

873
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,240
I just ordered a latte but it was not hot.

874
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,310
Usually drinks with milk are not too hot.

875
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,590
I often order this at other places.

876
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,070
But it's never been so cold

877
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,430
Wait a mininute

878
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,340
It's a bit cold.

879
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,390
I'll warm it up for you.

880
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,450
You already drank it

881
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,460
Me?

882
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,430
sorry...

883
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,780
This is my first time opening a shop. I will make you a new cup.

884
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,360
never mind

885
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,170
I'm sorry

886
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:37,610
never mind

887
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm really sorry

888
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,930
OK...got it

889
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,560
Next time I come I'll give you a hot cup

890
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,680
No

891
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,020
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

892
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,050
It's all because of that spell.

893
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,600
You will be damned if you say that.

894
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,660
Hello Hyunji

895
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,790
The temperature is just right and the foam is dense. It tastes so good.

896
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,240
I told you not to come, why are you still coming?

897
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,930
Dad, haven't you had dinner yet?

898
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,510
This is the seaweed rice roll from the convenience store. It's not very hot.

899
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,660
Why buy this? Your pocket money is not much.

900
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,710
If you know, you can make more money.

901
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,040
Only daughter cares about her father the most

902
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,830
Not all cafes are open.

903
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,140
But why doesn't my sister-in-law come here once?

904
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,200
Isn't that too much?

905
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,970
So I'm here

906
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,050
Wife

907
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,290
Park Hyun-ji, why don't you come over to me?

908
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,350
It's because my mother didn't let me come here.

909
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,730
You are a student who doesn't study hard.

910
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,140
Why are you here so late?

911
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,560
I told her to come here because she was bored.

912
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,640
And why are you hiding? I can see you.

913
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,560
Mom, don't you think Dad is pitiful?

914
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,920
Your dad is really pitiful.

915
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,970
Pitiful

916
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,910
The most pitiful one is me who lives with your father.

917
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,280
Come quickly

918
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,470
Don't say anything, there are guests here.

919
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,270
A family should unite.

920
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,510
To save money

921
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,560
Dad doesn't hire part-time students, he does everything himself

922
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,780
Don't you think he's pitiful?

923
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,650
A man who ran out of money and took over a coffee shop full of flies

924
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,160
What's so pitiful?

925
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,590
The problem is there aren't even any flies.

926
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,100
Hello

927
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,830
Sorry, guest

928
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,210
We're so noisy. Sorry.

929
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,790
Oh... I will treat you well next time

930
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,940
Even the last table of guests has been sent away.

931
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,300
Park Seung-ho, do you really want to live such a humble life?

932
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,340
Why don't you listen to me?

933
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,220
Did I say stop before you lose everything?

934
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,120
I'm so sorry

935
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,910
I am helpless and hopeless, okay?

936
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,340
sister in law

937
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,920
Do you have to tell him off like this in a shop that's open for business?

938
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,730
Brother, where are you going? I don't know how to make coffee.

939
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,380
Mom, you're taking it too far.

940
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,970
Can't you forgive Dad?

941
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,810
What

942
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,770
Dad also wants to do business well.

943
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,310
Only then will I humbly cater to the guests.

944
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,560
What's wrong with doing something that hurts your self-esteem for your family?

945
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,290
Isn't this what parents are supposed to do?

946
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,460
dad

947
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,010
No one is on my side.

948
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,210
I don't know if the person who said he wanted to cooperate performed well.

949
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,060
[No. 1004 Miri Auntie]

950
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,680
[No. 1004 Miri Auntie]

951
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,290
Why don't you answer the phone?

952
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,460
Wow, delicious

953
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,740
Not with Ji Hyun

954
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,780
Why did you suddenly come here alone?

955
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,510
I provoked my husband and he sent this to me.

956
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,630
This is the content of Li Minshan's suicide note

957
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,890
Really

959

Take a look

960

[It’s so painful that I can’t bear it any longer. I want to be by your side...I want to rest]

961
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,970
The handwritten suicide note found that day

962
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,550
Almost the same as the contents of the missing diary

963
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,240
[Mom will come to you right away]

964
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,530
elder sister

965
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,350
Auntie wrote it down at the back of this page

966
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,930
Activities of the Victims' Families Association and lunch volunteer schedule

967
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:26,080
She wrote this down to show that she would attend

968
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,130
Write down your suicide note on the first page and the activity time on the second page

969
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,710
This is contradictory.

970
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,150
It is true.

971
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,810
Even so, are you sure this isn't a suicide note?

972
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,960
Was it just a few words to vent my feelings at that time?

973
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,200
It was packaged as a suicide note by someone other than my aunt.

974
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,290
Attempted to disguise his murder as suicide

975
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,250

976
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,070
A few days before my aunt passed away

977
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,430
Asked Suxi where to buy a mini recorder

978
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,010
Where should an elderly person in his seventies use it?

979

Gathering evidence

980
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,210
People like me who have doubts

981
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,740
But there is a lack of definitive evidence

982
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,400
Who is the person who has doubts?

983
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,770
Is this someone we know?

984
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,170
When I went in, I found it was a two-story house.

985
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:09,510
[The rough scene I saw was]

986
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,290
The scene I saw roughly was

987
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,270
The shelves have not been moved yet.

988
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,420
[I heard you want to explore abandoned houses?]

989
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,300
I heard you want to explore abandoned houses.

990
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,800
[I really want to go but I have a mock exam soon]

991
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,850
I really want to go but I have a mock exam soon.

992
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,650
[It was a close call]

993
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,870
It's a close call. If you were to compete, it would be too intense.

994
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,750
[If you are also involved in the competition, it will be too fierce. Where is the location?]

995
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,620
Is the location decided?

996
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,730
[Have you booked it yet?] [Someone I know recommended it but it’s a bit far]

997
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,940
Someone I know recommended it to me, but it's a bit far.

998
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,950
But that place is horrible

999
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,390
But that place is horrible.

1000
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,400
Where is it?

1001
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,470
[Where is it?]

1002
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,930
But you really didn't tell your mother?

1003
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,850
[But you really won’t tell your mother?]

1004
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:36,130
[Are you crazy? Will my mom let me go? I want to go secretly]

1005
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,630
Are you crazy? Will my mom let me go?

1006
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,230
I'm going to go secretly

1007
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,870
I'm almost there. I'm in front of the building.

1008
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,840

This is the same mini recorder I bought for the elderly.

After charging, just press the power button

1013
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,380
Where is she going to use it when it's so small?

1014
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,970
Did she record successfully?

1015
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,850
Sister, have you found anything?

1016
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,510
I asked my husband

1017
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,510
He said that the old man's belongings

1018
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,210
No mini recorder

1019
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,360
If they had, they would have listened to it a long time ago.

1021
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,540

1022

You are really rude.

You're not doing this right, are you?

1027
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,280
What does that mean?

1028
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,830
That person actually evaded taxes by operating illegally

1029
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,130
and civil servants' pensions openly threatened me

1030
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,720

1031
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,600

00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,750
Then I came to Guangshan Community as an administrator

1077
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:19,340
alright

1078
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,500
Wipe it with this.

1079
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,630
Thanks

1080
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,070
I wonder if there are any clothes you can wear at home.

1081
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,260
Oh, no need.

1082
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,950
Auntie investigated and found out that the reason why he bought the tape recorder was

Uncle Jin, the administrator who helped me when I was in trouble

1085

He is a very kind person.

The kind person who always makes people suspicious

1090
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,560
A few months before Minshan's accident

1091
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:05,010
She was worried that the letters from the victims' families association had not been sent.

1092

Letter?

Give it to me, I'll help you return it.

1096
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,190
No return letter was found.

1097

No return letter?

1098

That letter

1099
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,470
It's the letter from Lee Min-sun that was sent to my house before.

1100
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,650
You said you would help me return it, remember?

1101
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,870
Yes

1102
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:28,520
I remember I returned it the next day.

1103
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,430
The person who lied to me that he had returned the letter from the Victims' Families Association

1104
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,650
Because they were too close, they didn't notice the criminal hiding right under their noses.

1105
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,210
It turns out that he is the administrator of this community.

1115

It's because you're so useless

1116
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:00,150
Only then will you be bullied by cats and dogs

1117

What do you know?

1118
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:07,880
You are a good prey.

You said I was prey

1120

Next time you try to commit suicide, I won't stop you.

1121
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,320
But since I was born in this world

1122
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,050
Isn't it better to be the hunter than the prey?

It wasn't such an important thing, but he actually left it at the door and left.
