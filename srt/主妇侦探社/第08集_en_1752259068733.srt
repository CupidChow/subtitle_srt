What are you doing?

191
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,290
There has to be a reason for emergency arrest.

192

Let's go to the police station to find out the reason.

A search warrant will be issued within 48 hours

Just happened to live in the same residential area as me.

240

No. 902 seems to be facing her.

324
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,580

365
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,170
Because the man who always ignores and suppresses his wife

366
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,420
To protect that pitiful self-esteem

367
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,640
Are you happy living like this?

368
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,980
Are you on drugs?

369
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,080
Not like you normally.

370
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,050
I have too

371
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,790
I had dreams too.

372
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,590
I also want to be promoted to captain and deputy director

373
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,440
Spread your wings and fly high

374
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,260
Take off your uniform

375
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,060
Do you think it's easy for me?

376
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,600
OK, I know.

377
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,350
I know what you mean now

378
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,110
Let's talk about it when we get home

379
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,520
The day the Disciplinary Committee met

380
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,320
My mother-in-law came to the police station to see me.

381
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,270
Qiu Qingzi, please save my good-for-nothing son.

382
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,830
Please help him, I beg you.

383
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,620
You don't know

384
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,920
Wow, Aki Keiko

385
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,990
Now itâ€™s not enough to drag your daughter into this, are you also dragging the elderly into this?

386
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,790
Thanks to this incident, he agreed to our marriage.

387
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,120
I only care about your self-esteem as my only son.

388
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,500
But the old man completely crushed his daughter-in-law's momentum

389
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,000
What good is there in a mother-in-law like this?

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,100
Hello

391
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,160
You can scold me however you want, but don't say bad things about my mother.

392
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,230
I'm really gonna explode.

393
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,440
Shut up

394
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,060
You and mother-in-law are in collusion

395
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,690
Put the spell to suppress my luck in my closet

396
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,710
Do you think I don't know?

397
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

398
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,080
Go quickly

399
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,840
Am I talking nonsense?

400
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,350
Lu Kangzhi

401
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,820
Apologize quickly

402
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,110
Everyone is watching

403
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,580
Everyone is watching

404
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,220
It seems that you still know how to lose face.

405
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,110
I'll make you lose face today.

406
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,350
Hello, Detective Choi

407
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,380
Team Leader Kim

408
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,610
Surrender Surrender

409
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,380
I won't accept your surrender today.

410
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,800
Hello

411
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,230
Oh, by the way, have you found the delivery girl?

412
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,450
No, not found yet

413
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,190
Still looking

414
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,020
I saw something. Do you want to come and have a look?

415
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,880
What is

416
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,890
Is this it?

417
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,080
It looks like the motorcycle of the female deliveryman.

418
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,300
1985 Yes

419
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,760
Yes, it's Suxi's motorcycle.

420
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,140
Then I have to hand over my shift and go back first

421
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,940
Thanks for your hard work

422
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,210
Although the locomotive is here

423
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,120
But the final delivery location is Building 204

424
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,680
Su-hee must have disappeared there.

425
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,800
If you put the motorcycle in front of Building 204

426
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,540
Suxi's disappearance there will be discovered soon.

427
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,810
So I just found a place to hide.

428
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,810
But who is that guy?

429
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,210
I'll go find the women's association president.

430
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,800
Sister, please go to Building 204 to confirm.

431
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,160
good

432
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,330
Why go to the garbage dump in Building 213?

433
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,970
Black plastic bag inside

434
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,330
It means there is something unspeakable.

435
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,220
Oh, Sister Qingzi

436
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,820
I just had a big fight with the beautiful dad

437
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,820
I was so angry that I resorted to force.

438
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,770
He gave me the location.

439
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,310
Really

440
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,960
Where is the last location?

441
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,860
It is Guangshan Social Housing.

442
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,860
The phone was turned off at 8:15.

443
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,520
I've been doubting a place

444
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,510
I will contact you after confirmation

445
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,170
You'll come right over.

446
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,750
What? This is an empty house.

447
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,020
The water meter is turning.

448
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,380
Hat T

449
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,400
Is it mouse eggs?

450
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,480
That person is definitely Mouse Egg

451
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,420
Look

452
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,800
Since the resident representative was discovered

453
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,810
Because the incidents of perverts being victimized have not happened again.

454
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,940
Is that because of this?

455
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,690
To cover up his son's abnormal behavior

456
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,940
[5.14 Jiang Yunzhu lipstick]

457
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,540
[5.14 Jiang Yunzhu's hair]

458
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,420
[5.14 Jiang Yunzhu earrings]

459
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,500
[5.14 Jiang Yunzhu's manicure]

460
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,160
This madman

461
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,260
[Fried chicken flyer]

462
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,340
Part-time delivery

463
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,440
Eat more, little bastard.

464
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,990
Wednesday Pediatric Intensive Care Unit

465
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,580
Suxi's part-time job schedule

466
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,800
This neurosis

467
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,320
Oh sister

468
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,710
Room 405 doesn't seem to be vacant.

469
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,690
Water and electricity are now in use

470
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,440
The criminal is the son of the women's association president

471
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,960
What is the son of the women's association president?

472
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,320
He is the stalker of number 902

473
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,520
Suxi was also kidnapped by that guy

474
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,580
Su Hee is dangerous

475
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,080
We have to go to 405

476
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,980
Now

477
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,550
Got it, I'll go now

478
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,710
You already knew that.

479
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,630
Your son is the stalker of number 902

480
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,000
My son has nothing to do with that woman.

481
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,030
The pervert that terrifies the residents every night

482
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,480
No, he is the mouse egg.

483
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,490
Don't you even know this?

484
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,970
What are you talking about?

485
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,720
The resident representative is Mouse Egg

486
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,320
All residents know this.

487
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
What about the fact that he is the murder suspect in No. 902?

488
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,620
The murderer of No. 902 is the administrator's younger brother

489
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,040
Where is your son now?

490
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,810
I don't know either

491
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,370
Do you want me to tell you?

492
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,760
Room 405, Building 204

493
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,490
Are you playing detective now?

494
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,880
There's an empty house.

495
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,640
The female delivery person who was responsible for delivering to Guangshan Community Housing disappeared last night

496
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,130
After delivering fried chicken No. 406 for the last time, he disappeared

497
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,890
It's next to your house 405.

498
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,620
What does that have to do with my son?

499
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,190
Why your son

500
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,530
Want to check the delivery girl's schedule?

501
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,110
Do you want me to call the police right now and report your son as the murder suspect in No. 902?

502
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,800
Or do you want to open the door of No. 405 yourself?

503
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,280
Choose one

504
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,880
Please forgive me

505
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,600
Our Xiaolu will die without me

506
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
Please don't kill me

507
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
It's all my fault

508
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,940
It was my fault...

509
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,980
What's the point if you can't be with him anyway?

510
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,130
As a mother

511
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,720
I'll set you free now

512
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,900
This is much more comfortable than staying in the water.

513
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,050
No, Xiaolu can't live without me

514
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,020
Please

515
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
Too late

516
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,230
You already know too much

517
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,530
I will never tell anyone.

518
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,360
I swear I'll keep it a secret for the rest of my life

519
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,540
I really swear

520
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,590
Really

521
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,020
yes

522
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,400
I don't trust women.

523
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,800
Don't Kill Me

524
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,930
I think women are most beautiful when they beg.

525
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,900
A few more words

526
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,160
Say a little more

527
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,820
Wait a moment

528
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,750
This is the key, right?

529
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,320
how so

530
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,160
Open the door

531
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,610
If the other party has a plan, will he open the door?

532
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,990
Call the police now.

533
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,200
no

534
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,230
If Suxi dies during this period, can you be responsible?

535
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,730
Did your son change the lock?

536
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,080
Or did you switch the key and hide it somewhere else?

537
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,240
I'm going home now

538
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,920
I'll be right back, please.

539
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,170
Can you please wait 5 minutes before calling the police?

540
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,340
Less than 3 minutes

541
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,020
Please, I'll be back soon.

542
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,500
Now every second counts, how can we wait?

543
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,240
Su Hee

544
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,500
So Hee So Hee

545
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,210
Su Hee

546
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,760
Get out of the way

547

Sister, what do you want to do?

553
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,000
Isn't it just a door?

554
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,660

557
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,710
Is this a fragrant smell?

558

What is this

578

Are you holding some kind of sacrifice?

579

That was the first time

669
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,770
The reason why I didn't report your abnormal behavior to the police

670
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,100
It's because of your mother.

671
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,680
I just want to make your mother feel bad because she is always asking for rent a month late.

672
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,940
I want to take advantage of your weakness to threaten her

673

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,050
I'm going to expose all the facts about you being a rat.

00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,180
And report your stalking and trespassing to the police.

677
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,310
You are lying to me.

Not for me

679
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,120
It was because of my mom that I didn't call the police.

680
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,380
You lied to me, didn't you?

681
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,150

689

You're a psychopath

690
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,030
People like you shouldn't be born into this world.

691
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,870
I'll let you rot in a mental hospital for the rest of your life.

697
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,870
If you are stupid, at least you should be more diligent.

698
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,250
Reflect on what you did wrong.

699
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,520
Mom, I was wrong.

700
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,940
I will play the piano well.

701
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,240
When did it start?

702
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,740
Every time my mother scolds me

703
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,870
I will self-harm

704
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,040
When I see blood

705
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,550
My mood will magically get better.

706
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,870
The desire to kill my mother will also subside a little

707
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,690
You're a loser.

708
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,030
Are you awake?

00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,570
Whether it's you or your mother

710
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,130
They're all neurotic.

711
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,370
Yunzhu, why do you imitate my mother?

712
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,700
My mother is not a good person

713
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,020
What are you doing?

714
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,440
Don't come over

715
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,470
You shouldn't do that.

716
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,000
I like you so much

717
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,040
But why do I see my mother's shadow in you?

718
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:53,400
Don't order me, beg me to spare you.

00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,480
Why the Ribbon Killer?

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,260
You know who the Ribbon Killer is, right?

00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,880

Whether it's the part-time student in the coffee shop or the lady in room 902

742
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,770
You didn't intend to kill them from the beginning, did you?

743
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,490
Don't make the same mistake again.

744

But those are useless

762

A knife can solve it.

What what

772
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,620
I think you should go to the scene as soon as possible.

773
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,400
Why is there a kidnapping report all of a sudden?

774

795

00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,900
Otherwise, why do you mention that guy's name every time?

921
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,990
You are so excited

922
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,150
What does it matter?

923
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,230
He is everyone's enemy.

924
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,830
To everyone's enemy

925
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,000
You wait.

926
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,490
If it's related to the Ribbon Killer

927
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,110
The police will find out.

928
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,770
That guy might exercise his right to remain silent.

929
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,300
Will the guy who exercises his right to remain silent against the police speak to you?

930
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,110
Ah Kim Kwang-kyu

931
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,360
Kim Kwang-kyu should have been released by now.

932
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,620
What happened to Kim Kwang-kyu?

933
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,870
I was thinking about when Park Tae-hoon was arrested

934
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:28,390
Is he in the building?

935
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,340
Park Tae-hoon was still looking at someone when he was arrested

936
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,040
I smiled as if I saw an acquaintance.

937
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,540
Or they are residents of the same building.

938
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,130
Or someone you know

939
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,850
Who are you looking at?

940
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,560
Oh my god, So Hee

941
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,800
How's Suxi? Is she okay?

942
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,190
Even though he was fighting the disease alone, he managed to hold on.

943
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,520
Blood pressure, pulse, breathing are all good

944
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Thank you. Thank you.

945
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,740
Mother

946
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,850
Sorry for waiting so long.

947
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,420
Mom, are you sick?

948
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,150
I got hurt a little bit at work.

949
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,590
The doctor said that a few nights of sleep would be enough.

950
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,960
Didn't mom say that?

951
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,260
I'll blow on it for you and it won't hurt.

952
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,140
It doesn't hurt now, right?

953
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,560
Um

954
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,540
All is well

955
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,620
It doesn't hurt at all now

956
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,320
Thanks

957
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,730
Hey sister

958
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,570
What's the big deal? Why hide it?

959
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,580
I am very good at reading people's faces.

960
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,980
A person who is proud of his 100% loyalty

961
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,770
Suddenly he became a rude and disloyal guy.

962
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,410
No, I don't mean to hide it.

963
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,730
It must be very hard.

964
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,000
sorry

965
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,800
Some mothers can't even protect their healthy children

966
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:24,070
How do you take care of a sick child all by yourself?

967
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,010
It's really admirable

968
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,470
How's the kid's father?

969
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,310
I don't know the details.

970
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,640
I only know that she is a single mother.

971
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,680
I don't even know this.

972
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,650
Just say behind her back that she loves money like her life

973
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,980
Really

974
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,080
You can ask for help when you are in trouble

975
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,790
You can also accept help

976
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:51,060
This is life

977
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,230
Su Hee

978
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,380
Um

979
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,920
Are you saying bad things about me behind my back?

980
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,950
See, I interrupted the conversation as soon as I came here.

981
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:57,820
No No

982
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,700
How is the child?

983
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,790
Is Xiaolu okay?

984
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:02,300
Well, this guy is better than me.

985
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,830
I can persevere every time I encounter difficulties.

986
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,450
Very impressive

987
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,150
Of course

988
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,320
Don't even look at whose son it is.

989
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,040
Thank you, Suxi

990
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,660
Can come back alive and strong

991
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,210
I don't even think about who saved me.

992
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,280
Thanks to my sisters, I survived.

993
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,620
Our little Lu also survived

994
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,370
Thank you so much

995
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:29,510
sorry

996
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,490
At my age, I'm living like a dog.

997
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,660
Just gossiping behind your back

998
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,890
It's my sister's fault

999
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,400
Oh, let's keep it as it is.

1000
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,820
It's not easy to get used to

1001
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,180
Stay away

1002
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,040
But did you break up with the father of your child?

1003
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,490
Ah, skip, skip, skip

1004
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,190
Why do you seem like an old-fashioned person when you ask about the past?

1005
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:49,870
Have you ever seen such a cute old fashioned person?

1006
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,690

1007
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,030

1008

The nose has become a pig nose

1009
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,960
It's totally a big nose monster.

1010
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,690
hateful

1011
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:02,620
Oh, why did that guy hit his nose?

1012

What's this

1013
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,680
What's wrong

1014

[Ms. Kong*li's bank account balance is insufficient, please complete the remittance within today]

1015

1018

What

1019

Yesterday was payday

1020
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,430
But I was so confused that I couldn't confirm it.

1021
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,920
We were not free yesterday.

1022
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,640
I heard that the early morning coaching class was also cancelled.

1023
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,890
It seems that the gym is having trouble running.

1024
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:23,820
No one signed up for the gym?

1025
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:27,340
Seungho resigned last month

1026
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,210
Ah, you want to be a cafe owner.

1027
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,410

I can get such a good store at such a low price

But I am a little worried about my brother's wife.

1043

This matter should be decided after full discussion

The coward Park Seung-ho has retired

1046

Execute first and ask for permission later

1047
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,350
No, it is to execute first and then process

1048

I know you have a strong intuition.

1058
