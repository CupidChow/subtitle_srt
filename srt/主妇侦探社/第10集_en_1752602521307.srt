The victim killed by the Ribbon Killer two years ago was my student.

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,090
Because I can no longer stand on the podium

39

How can I write an article like my teacher?

42

From that day on, I also started preparing a novel based on the theme of the Ribbon Killer.

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,970
If you want to be a novelist so badly, you should write quietly by yourself.

Why do you appear in front of me again?

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,930

I'm so old, I'm sorry to make you laugh

53
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,640
It's okay to cry. What's wrong with that?

Yeah, if it was my son,

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,690
I'm so scared

550
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,340
Honestly, how can we possibly deal with that guy?

551
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,400
Why didn't you include me?

552
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,260
Here comes Suxi

553
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,690
It's almost time to give up.

554
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,409
You are the mastermind behind Park Tae-hoon, right?

555
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,860
Is that all you care about in this situation?

556
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,889
You are also the person behind Kim Kwang-kyu, right?

557
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,320
I'm tracking you and the tape recorder.

558
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
You must have used what Kim Kwang-kyu knew.

559
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,280
You are the one who took advantage of my students.

560
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,520
It was you who deliberately leaked the information to Guangkui to provoke me to come here.

561
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,670
Because I believe that if you are the Ribbon Killer

562
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,820
There will be action no matter what

563
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,880
But you never dreamed that I would take your daughter as a hostage.

564
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,550
You are shooting yourself in the foot.

565
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,660
alright

566
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,170
You can go die

567
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,830
wrong

568
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,060
I will never die

569
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,950
Kong Meili

570
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,000
elder sister

571
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,030
Miri

572
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,680
Kong Miri Keiko

573
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,080
Sister, I'm here

574
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,860
Sister, I'm here.

575
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,320
Kong Meili

576
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,720
Hammer Hammer

577
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,720
1 2 3

578
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,650
Ladies, do you smell anything?

579
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,360
What flavor again?

580
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,790
Use more force

581
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,380
1 2 3

582
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,390
Really

583
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,150
Get out of the way 1 2 3

584
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,420
Opened

585
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,040
Miri

586
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,550
Miri

587
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,100
If she takes one more step forward, this woman will die in my hands.

588
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Hello, Admin uncle

589
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,050
Mr. Bujin

590
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,080
Don't get too excited. Just listen to us.

591
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,830
You've made a big mistake now.

592
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,950
I'm calmer than ever.

593
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,870
You are the ones who are excited

594
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,250
OK... OK

595
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,620
Let's be rational.

596
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,420
Come on, how about just turning yourself in this time?

597
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,010
I have lived quietly for more than ten years.

598
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,340
Now I have to surrender myself

599
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,790
I can't do it

600
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,240
How about it

601
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,430
Finally, it feels like he died in my hands

602
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,120
This is totally a neurosis.

603
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,340
Miri

604
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,870
Sister, save Hyun-ji

605
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,310
Where is Xianzhi?

606
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,570
Just tell us where Hyun-ji is, please

607
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,480
Please

608
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,770
So touching!

609
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,730
But no one gets out alive today.

610
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,250
Okay, okay.

611
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,230
I don't have anything in my hands

612
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,420
Just tell me where Hyun-ji is.

613
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,190
Then we'll release Misato and leave quietly.

614
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,820
Seeing you here today

615
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,350
No, just pretend you haven't seen it.

616
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,090
So please, please.

617
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,430
Kong Meili

618
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,920
It's strange that none of your friends are afraid of death.

619
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,000
He's a guy who doesn't understand what people say.

620
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,750
People of our age are usually bolder.

621
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,980
Then you really can't read people's expressions.

622
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,280
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

623
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,670
Miri

624
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,560
sister

625
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,950
Are you okay?

626
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,620
Are you okay, sister?

627
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,000
It's okay. It's okay.

628
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,040
Miri Miri Miri

629
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,620
Kong Miri, are you okay?

630
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,250
You murderer.

631
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,830
Hey you fool

632
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,220
If you encounter difficulties, please speak up.

633
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,390
If you need help, just ask.

634
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,190
Why do you keep it to yourself?

635
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,480
Sorry, sis.

636
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,940
Oh, really.

637
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,790
Is this lady planning to spray the whole bottle?

638
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,810
Sister, stop spraying

639
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,990
Go find Hyun-ji.

640
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,980
good

641
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,140
Hyun-chi... Hyun-chi...

642
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,620
The guy named Jin got up.

643
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,890
Where are you going?

644
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,850
No one gets out of here alive.

645
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,810
Be careful, sister.

646
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,080
Wise

647
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,160
The police station in charge said the base station here is too old.

648
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,830
The phone can't get a signal

649
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,450
Please wait a moment until the support team arrives.

650
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,570
The kid Qiu Qingzi is in there now

651
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,070
I'll go in first

652
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,980
We'll contact you by radio once we understand the situation.

653
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,610
Stand by

654
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,930
Let's go in together when the support team arrives, brother.

655
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,390
Hey, don't come in.

656
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,090
Got it, bro?

657
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,830
Kang Shik

658
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,540
When will it come? Really?

659
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,850
Sister, go over there

660
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,760
good

661
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,820
Hyun Chi Hyun Chi...

662
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,820
One more step and your friend will die.

663
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,200
Miri, save me

664
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,140
here...

665
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,600
What's wrong

666
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,320
Cheer up! Cheer up!

667
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,340
Miri, are you okay?

668
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,550
Sister, I think Hyun-ji is here

669
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,520
Ah what

670
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,910
Wise

671
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,640
Hyun-ji, answer quickly, I am your mother

672
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,260
Wise

673
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,460
Wait, quiet.

674
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,760
Mommy Mommy

675
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,000
Can hear sound

676
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,770
Hyun-chi...

677
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,540
Mom is here to save you.

678
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,480
No matter it is the suburbs or the countryside, how long have they been out there? Why haven't they arrived yet?

679
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,550
Please hurry up, okay?

680
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,570
Please don't come in. You can't come in.

681
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,660
What's going on What's going on

682
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,730
We received a call from the delivery lady from Guangshan Community Housing.

683
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,410
What is going on?

684
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,590
My daughter and wife are in there, please think of a solution

685
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,780
It's dangerous here. Please wait to the side.

686
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,080
Oh my god...

687
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,510
Oh, Jun Ji-hyun

688
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,310
Hyun-ji

689
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,610
Wife

690
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,240
Aki Keiko

691
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,260
Aki Keiko

692
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:12,800
Damn

693
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,450
Hey, Detective Cui, has 119 not arrived yet?

694
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,790
Big brother hasn't come yet.

695
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,790
It may take some time.

696
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,900
I'd better go in first.

697
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,260
It's too dangerous for me to be alone.

698
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,780
Oh, don't come over here, don't come over here

699
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,950
Don't move until I give the order.

700
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,420
If you want to come, come in with the firefighters.

701
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,380
Sister, you guys go out first

702
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,770
I'll find a way for you to get out first.

703
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,820
Misato, if I was planning to abandon you, we wouldn't have come here.

704
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,460
We'll all die this way.

705
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,630
You guys go out first

706
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,780
Mother

707
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,990
1 2 3

708
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,230
Over there

709
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,180
Open the door quickly. The child will die if this continues.

710
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,200
You can only know if you will die after you open the door.

711
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,970
Open the door for me

712
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,490
No, Misato

713
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,640
Miri, we have to rescue Hyun-ji.

714
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,380
We can rescue Hyun-ji.

715
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,830
You can definitely rescue her.

716
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,350
Jin Xiande

717
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,550
Think about it carefully

718
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,270
Rather than being burned to death in pain

719
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,540
Better die in my hands

720
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,880
Isn't this more straightforward?

721
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,980
Jin Xiande

722
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,840
Like this

723
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,390
don't want

724
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,150
Administrator

725
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,200
Aren't you an accomplice?

726
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,350
How did you get here?

727
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,800
Here it comes again

728
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
I installed a location tracker on this guy's car a few days ago.

729
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,890
I didn't expect that he would trick me first.

730
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:33,940
[2 hours ago]

731
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,100
son

732
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,600
Get up quickly

733
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,580
Guangkui

734
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,360
It's time to get up

735
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,020
