189
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,370
Judging from the uniform, it seems that she goes to the same school as our Hyun-ji.

190
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,010
His father used to run a big travel agency

191
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,850
But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it completely collapsed

192
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,820
My wife cheated on me and we got divorced.

193
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,440
He raised his son alone.

194
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,580
When working on the construction site

195
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,950
Suffered a serious back injury

196
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,450
I can't go out to work recently.

197
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,080
It seems like I drink to drown my sorrows every day.

198
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,590
So miserable

199
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,900
Poor kid.

200
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,830
It's already so late

201
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,780
I should go pick up the beauty.

202
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm leaving first

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,350
Go back carefully

204
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,580
Got it, sister. I'm leaving.

205
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,680
Hyun-ji's cram school is almost over

206
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,290
Sister, I'm leaving.

207
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,410
well

208
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,060
Wait for me, sis.

209
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,530
Why is the skirt so short?

210
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,080
I can almost see the butt

211
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,280
That is to say, I think so too

212
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,040
Mother

213
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,730
Miss Lu, get in the car!

214
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,070
You said you don't need to pick me up.

215
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,920
Hello, Auntie

216
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,090
Oh, hello, Jung Eun

217
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,770
Can I play with Jung-eun for a while before going home?

218
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,360
What time is it?

219
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,799
If your dad knew about this, the nagging bomb would explode

220
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,169
Just find any excuse to get by.

221
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,570
Jingen and I will take a few photos of our lives and then go back.

222
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,049
It's so late. Do we have to go?

223
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,210
Today is my birthday

224
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,610
We'll take a few commemorative photos and then go back.

225
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,289
Okay?

226
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,159
It's your birthday today

227
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,929
yes

228
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,150
I'm a little worried about you two being the only ones around.

229
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,440
Okay, just one hour.

230
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
Happy Birthday Jingen

231
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,080
Thank you, Auntie

[Beauty's father]

233
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,660
Really

234
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,870
What's wrong

235
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,080
Um

236
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,050
Where are the beauties?

237
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,140
I just met her at the entrance of the cram school.

238
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,080
On the way home

239
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,330
Let her pick up the phone.

240
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,260
Why do we need to change her to take over?

241
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,400
Won't you see her when you get home?

242
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,330
Let her pick me up quickly. I want to hear my daughter's voice.

243
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,540
Really

244
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,500
Oh, she just fell asleep, husband.

245
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,460
So early

246
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,640
That wakes her up.

247
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,960
I haven't seen a beautiful woman's face for several days.

248
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,230
She looks tired.

249
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,080
Oh, what should I do?

250
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,720
She was so tired that she snored in her sleep

251
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,390
You're snoring so loudly, husband.

252
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,800
But the beautiful woman's snoring

253
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,250
How come you are exactly like me?

254
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,550
This is not right.

255
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,330
Anyway, take good care of your daughter.

256
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,130
There were two reports of a pervert in the 2nd residential area.

257
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,020
Beauty, this child looks like me

258
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,600
You'll be conspicuous wherever you go.

259
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,290
How nice it would be if she was like her mom at a time like this

260
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,430
It won't be so conspicuous.

261
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,050
knew

262
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,480
Hang up now

263
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,920
Do you have to talk like this?

264
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,180
It would be more conspicuous if I were like this, right?

265
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh, if I had known, I would have followed you.

266
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,500
So,

267
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,310
Don't you think he's really petty?

268
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,150
That idiot actually told his mother about the whole thing

269
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,270
Hey, after that

270
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,620
I heard her mother even called her math teacher

271
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,360
There was a big fuss

272
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,840
yes

273
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,450
The teacher is quite pitiful.

274

have no idea

275
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,840
So,

278

Hey, don't hang up.

279

281
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,700
The math taught in cram schools is really too difficult

282
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,960

287

289

No need, you guys go away

My husband has been avoiding sex since last year.

Although it is not obvious to escape

367

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,480
You seem to know a lot.

374
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,670
Do you do it?

375
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,760
Ah, this lady is asking this kind of thing in broad daylight

376
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,260
Where's my husband?

377
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,200
It's the kind of job where you have to work yourself to exhaustion before coming back.

378
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,710
But his basic physical strength is pretty good

379
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,580
I just want a fire

380
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,740
The whole thing will burn

381
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,630
The whole thing is on fire

382
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,640
Lu Kangzhi

383
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,520
Get Down

384
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,340
What?

385
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,460
How long has the class been over? Why are you just coming in now?

386
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,690
You ate the wrong thing. I'm dying of exhaustion.

387
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,920
Oh, what a lovely rebellion.

388
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,790
Get Down

389
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,910
Stop it.

390
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,430
I am the teacher and you are the student

391
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,000
Are you crazy?

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,480
I am the teacher and you are the student

393
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,000
Bones bones...

394
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,520
Bones? Bones...

395
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,360
Dear, where is it?

396
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,960
Where are the bones?

397
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,020
Does it hurt?

398
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,960
Sorry, I seem to be too immersed in the role.

399
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,040
Do you have nowhere to put your energy?

400
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,910
Put your energy on your husband who works like a dog all day

401
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,100
This shouldn't be painful.

402
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,230
Don't you know that even tofu can become a weapon in your hands?

403
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,320
You ignorant woman

404
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,810
There's no need to exaggerate.

405
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,510
I'm not doing this for myself.

406
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,190
Just to create a special atmosphere

407
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,220
I just did a little situation drama

408
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,100
Why can't you understand my efforts?

409
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,870
If you do it once more, your butt will be completely broken

410
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,390
Don't do these useless things. Just go cook.

411
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,820
I don't care, just cook it yourself.

412
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,820
Since you beat someone up, you should give him food.

413
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,680
Oh really

414
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,570
I just came to get my underwear and ended up getting beaten like this.

415
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,920
Miri, how are you?

416
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,720
This wise father actually

417
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,500
Want to do it every day

418
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,560
But how can I do it every day?

419
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,170
Is this... is this possible?

420
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,930
Honey, do you want to tell you a good news?

421
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,870
What

422
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,010
Clang

423
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,280
I collected all the grapes.

424
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,520
The grains are full, the juice and flavor are top-notch

425
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,830
Now just take it off.

426
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,630
Really

427
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,830
Don't talk about grapes.

428
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,650
Go to work quickly before Hyun-ji hears you.

429
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,220
Ah, what happened?

430
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,720
The grapes have been collected.

431
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,530
I collected these grapes

432
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,150
Even washing dishes, sorting garbage, and cleaning the toilet are done.

433
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,040
How long have I waited for this day?

434
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,280
Why are you rejecting me?

435
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,819
Were you drunk last week?

436
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,020
Dropped my credit card in my car and fell asleep

437
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,869
I did something bad, so I deducted 3 grapes.

438
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,930
Bring the grapes

439
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm not a child.

440
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,520
So... when do you plan to pick the grapes?

441
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,740
The grapes will rot.

442
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,860
Are you so sure today?

443
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,000
Of course

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,300
The Spartans will come to see you tonight

445
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,850
That guy

446
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,430
I won't fall down easily.

447
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,700
All the grapes have been collected.

448
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,110
Sparta

449
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,890
Let me help you

450
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,420
I don't know how long it has been since I had a hot night.

451
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,830
Is there another woman outside?

452
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,350
Well, that's 100% a matter of energy.

453
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,500
It's time to exercise.

454
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,160
Can you do that just by exercising?

455
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,690
Alas, I am getting worse than before.

456
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,900
Really

457
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,960
Yesterday my wife went to a Chinese medicine clinic and boiled some expensive Chinese medicine.

458
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,700
How much

459
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,800
(Note: Approximately NT$22,000)
One million won

460
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,540
It is said that there are all kinds of good things in it

461
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,730
But it's too bitter

462
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,580
Can't lose it

463
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,290
Since it is said to be good for men

464
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,680
Hello, Hello, Hello

465
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,720
You started taking Chinese medicine at this age.

466
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,110
I have never taken Chinese medicine or tonic medicine in my life.

467
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,860
Don't drink, I'll drink.

468
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,720
Hey, follow me and sit down.

469
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,230
Stand up

470
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,770
Do squats and it will be hard

471
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,440
Where is hard

472
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,310
thigh

473
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,000
Coach, please teach me how to use this

474
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,120
Oh ok, I'll be right there.

475
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,730
good

476
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,140
Hello

477
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,500
Are you crazy? You bring Chinese medicine with you when you teach people how to exercise?

478
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,040
Ah, then please put it on the counter for me.

479
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,960
knew

480
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,420
Don't drink secretly.

481
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,270
What to drink?

482
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,610
Oh, so bitter

483
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,140
Bitter but good

484
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,930
Too bitter

485
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,920
Hey, you're smiling so strangely now.

486
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,610
Me?

487
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,000
Um

488
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,230
I don't have

489
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,050
How are you, sister?

490
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,870
Yeah, what about you?

491
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,670
My old man?

492
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,070
Just don't take a shower

493
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,620
The whole body exudes the smell of a lonely old man

494
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,710
Oh, stingy old man

495
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,120
Water is also very cost-effective

496
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,980
Water and gas fees

497
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,810
Even my wife is spared

498
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,780
The old man who wants to save everything

499
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,900
It has caused my youth to be wasted

500
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,240
The province turned into shit in the end

501
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,220
shit

502
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,230
Clam

503
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,160
What shit

504
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,300
No, no, what?

505
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,030
Bird droppings at the store entrance

506
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,250
Let me clean it up.

507
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,740
You should go back and have lunch.

508
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,420
It's Minwoo

509
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,280
What to buy

510
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,850
that

511
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,500
I want to buy cigarettes

512
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,490
Smoke?

513
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,650
Ah, my father asked me to buy it.

514
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,740
Yeah

515
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

516
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,370
I can't sell you cigarettes.

517
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,120
If you sell cigarettes to minors, you're screwed.

518
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,840
Auntie's shop may be closed.

519
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,140
Please ask your father to buy it himself.

520
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,380
Otherwise, you can take this opportunity to quit smoking.

521
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,390
OK

522
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,100
Good go home and be careful

523
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,880
Good morning

524
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,110
Auntie, where is the Superman chocolate?

525
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,700
Oh over there

526
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,360
Auntie will get it for you.

527
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,480
How many

528
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,730
Five five

529
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,980
Need five

530
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,040
Sister, give me one too.

531
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,180
Oh, I see.

532
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,940
This kid is very popular recently. Come on, give me the cigarette.

533
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,810
If you don't bring it, you will become smoke.

534
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,330
I'll light a fire on you.

535
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,190
You have the taste of an elementary school student.

536
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,490
Is the whole bundle cookie deal over?

537
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,490
It's over already

538
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,390
Oh, that kid. Oh, oh, oh

539
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,220
How can you run so fast without fear of falling?

540
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,640
What the hell is going on with our country's football?

541
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,340
Are his feet in a triangle shape?

542
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,400
I kicked forward but it flew to the side

543
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,860
Hey, why don't you go and kick it?

544
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,460
Hello

545
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,960
How can you let the ash fall to the ground, jerk?

546
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,420
The floor is dirty.

547
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,060
Why are you suddenly going crazy on me?

548
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,150
Going to bounce it into the ashtray?

549
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,160
knew

550
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,180
Feed the ashtray

551
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,170
Feed the ashtray

552
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,610
Do you want to smoke one?

553
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,720
Put your hands up then, idiot

554
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,350
If the ash falls out, I will kill you

555
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,560
I told you to stop, you bastard.

556
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,020
Hello

557
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,760
You students

558
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,580
Smoking in the park

559
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,670
Bring me the cigarette.

560
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,800
Hey, give me the cigarette. What is he talking about?

561
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,680
Bring me the cigarette.

562
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,590
Uncle, mind your own business and go your own way.

563
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,030
How can you be so rude when talking to adults?

564
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,060
Damn

565
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,620
Otherwise, what do you want?

566
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,830
It's infuriating enough

567
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,010
Uncle, who are you?

568
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,540
Uncle, who are you?

569
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,580
I am an elder

570
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,120
It's bad enough, let's go.

571
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,030
These stinky boys dare to say bad things

572
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,470
Hey, he even flicked the cigarette at the elders...

573
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,440
Hey, don't let go, don't let go

574
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,340
Uncle, please let go first.

575
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,530
I have practiced letting go.

576
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,990
So what?

577
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,720
I remember when I was a National Games athlete.

578
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,470
No one asked you, uncle.

579
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm a gold medalist.

580
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,960
Dad, what are you doing here?

581
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
Hello Hyunji

582
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,240
Hey, Hyun-ji, don't come over here.

583
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,300
Don't come over here. Don't come over here.

584
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,060
Go away. Go away.

585
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,710
What? Park Hyun-ji

586
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,360
Is this uncle your father?

587
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,150
Hello, hello, hello...

588
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,970
What are you doing

589
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,540
Let me go

590
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,260
You dare to touch my daughter?

591
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,240
I won't let you go

592
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,560
You bastard

593
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,200
Hello

594
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,980
I count 1 2 3 and let go at the same time

595
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,840
1 2 3

596
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,520
You guy

597
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,220
dad

598
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,070
You are such a liar, how dare you lie to your elders?

599
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,850
Don't let go, you little bastard.

600
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,470
Fight, fight, fight

601
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,220
The cops will let us go anyway.

602
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,410
And uncle, you will go to jail for violence

603
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,260
Fight, fight, fight

604
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,370
Despite hitting

605
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
Brat

606
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,030
Can't fight

607
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,880
Then I'll fight.

608
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,090
Hello

609
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,880
Brat

610
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,610
You little brat

611
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,300
How dare you grab your elders by the collar?

612
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,920
Letting go

613
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,970
Put down this rude hand.

614
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,540
immediately

615
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,880
What? A pig-like auntie?

616
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,150
Auntie, who do you think you are to interfere here?

617
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,270
Mind your own business.

618
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,940
You are really eloquent.

619
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,610
Look at you little brats.

620
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,160
Ouch

621
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,220
Chiboro

622
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,990
It's so painful, it makes me miss it

623
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,940
These little bastards

624
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,830
A boy whose hair hasn't even grown out yet

625
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,530
Smoking

626
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,640
That is to say

627
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,600
These little brats

628
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,100
It's really lawless

629
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,130
Hey Auntie

630
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,060
We buy cigarettes and smoke them ourselves

631
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,480
Auntie, you are nothing, how dare you steal our things

632
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,280
Mind your own business and go away

633
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,070
Otherwise, come and beat me up and see.

634
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,230
I'm really curious about what would happen if an adult beat a minor.

635
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,170
Oh, look at these brats.

636
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,840
I haven't exercised for a long time.

637
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,660
These guys are not ordinary kids.

638
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,630
Come and listen carefully

639
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,620
Start now

640
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,440
If you can hit me, an old lady,

641
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,590
I'll buy as many Chiboros as you like.

642
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,490
Otherwise, go directly to the police station.

643
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,810
OK no no...

644
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,460
What is this aunt like?

645
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,620
So infuriating

646
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,700
Auntie, do you think we won't dare to hit you if you say that?

647
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,420
We won't show you mercy.

648
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,360
Brat

649
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,820
You little brat still smokes

650
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,340
What did you just say to me?

651
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,880
You pig lady

652
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,390
Brat

653
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,100
Go away

654
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,600
Get out of here, you bastards!

655
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,660
Get out of here, you bastard.

656
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,730
Although I don't know who you are

657
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,950
But thank you so much

658
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,620
Thanks to you, I can teach them a lesson.

659
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,700
fine

660
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,440
It's because the adults didn't teach me well.

661
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,540
It's Dad's schoolbag

662
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,640
That's evidence.

663
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,280
Bring it here quickly

664
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,780
I won't let them go.

665
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,270
I plan to handle this matter properly.

666
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,470
If I tell the school teacher

667
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,770
They're in big trouble.

668
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,370
Bring it here. Bring it here.

669
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,570
That being said...

670
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,730
There should be evidence.

671
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,600
Wait a moment

672
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,610
The wallet is here

673
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,350
Here

674
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,820
[Jin Minyu, Class 4, Grade 3]

675
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,350
Hey, Grade 3, Class 4

676
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,420
Isn't it your class in Grade 3, Class 4?

677
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,170
Um

678
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,220
Do you know him?

679
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,870
I'll give it to him.

680
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,170
No no, Dad, take it.

681
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,870
I'll give it to him.

682
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,220
You guys are back together.

683
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,420
Hyun-ji, just return the schoolbag to him.

684
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,250
Don't get involved with that kid Kim Min Woo.

685
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,520
He smokes in the street

686
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,250
Doesn't look like a good kid.

687
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,120
He is not that kind of person

688
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,070
What happened?

689
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,820
What It Isn't

690
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,070
I clearly saw him hanging out with bad boys and smoking

691
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,620
He must have been asked to run an errand for them to buy cigarettes.

692
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,720
I must have been bullied by those bad students just now.

693
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,600
What

694
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,250
You should tell the school teacher.

695
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,470
Let them take action.

696
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,920
It's useless

697
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,820
The teacher knew but couldn't do anything

698
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,670
You should at least help him.

699
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,820
But if you help blindly

700
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,720
I will be bullied too.

701
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,600
Who dares to bully our daughter?

702
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,050
If there is such a guy, you must tell dad

703
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,700
I'll knock these bastards down with one punch

704
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,750
But my husband

705
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,650
Why is your T-shirt collar so loose?

706
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,450
How come this got loose?

707
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,450
Mom, it's my room.

708
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,620
I've gained muscle mass recently.

709
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,250
Maybe this one has loosened up as well.

710
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,320
What kind of exercise are you doing that is not symmetrical?

711
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,220
I've lost face in front of my daughter.

712
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,370
Oh my god. Really?

713
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,700
husband

714
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,150
I have washed the T-shirts and hung them up

715
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,500
Throw it away. I never want to see that T-shirt again.

716
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,370
Or burn it?

717
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,620
What's wrong

718
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,850
But you're going to bed so early?

719
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,570
Where are our grapes?

720
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
ah

721
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
By the way, grapes

722
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,800
But I'm not in a good state today

723
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,100
You can pick it next time.

724
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,150
My throat is a bit uncomfortable.

725
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,220
I'm afraid of giving you the cold.

726
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,120
In the morning, I used the grapes to arouse others' expectations.

727
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Then take a good rest

728
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,070
All right

729
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,770
I'll take a good rest

730
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,470
Wait until next time... No, wait for me to recover.

731
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,920
I'll pick it up later.

732
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,570
Where are you going?

733
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,650
To let you sleep well alone

734
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,750
Sleep well

735
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,900
Is this ok?

736
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,300
Actually, you don't have to go.

737
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,300
If you don't want it, just say so.

738
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,420
Shameless

739
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,250
45-year-old sister Qingzi is still hot every night

740
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,800
What's the use of having a husband who is a fitness trainer?

741
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,650
Where did that guy go?

742
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,350
Where is the guy who won't fall down easily?

743
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,820
It hasn't started yet.

744
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,150
Sparta

745
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,970
Sparta shit!

746
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,220
Sparta fell today

747
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,470
Sparta fell today

748
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,750
Sister, what's wrong with you?

749
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,870
Be careful of indigestion if you eat grapes like this

750
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,150
The flesh is plump and delicious

751
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,470
This grape

752
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,250
It's quite delicious

753
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,020
[Guangshan Supermarket]

754
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,970
Ah my shoulders

755
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,070
Why is it so sore? Oh my...

756
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,300
Why do I feel sore all over?

757
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,250
Some activities during the day

758
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,600
My shoulder seems to be twisted.

759
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,850
Not at night but during the day

760
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,850
It's not about where you put some effort.

761
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,720
Has this sister been possessed by a sex demon recently?

762
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,850
Not when you pass by the park during the day.

763
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,820
I saw a group of students smoking there.

764
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,770
How could I turn a blind eye to something like that?

765
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,800
Just go over and teach those brats a lesson

766
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,020
Smoke

767
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,370
Is there a white skin inside?

768
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,200
A skinny but tall child

769
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
It's Minwoo who lives in our building.

770
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,370
This is the kid who came to buy instant noodles a few days ago.

771
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,100
That's right

772
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,970
A child forgot to take his schoolbag with him.

773
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,300
I found my student ID

774
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,270
It seems to say Kim Min Woo

775
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,150
He just came to our store.

776
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,050
He said he was running errands for his dad and wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes.

777
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,270
I refused.

778
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,320
But I didn't notice that a pack of cigarettes disappeared.

779
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,450
Alas, I am still skeptical

780
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,270
I didn't expect it was really him.

781
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,120
He looked quite good, but I didn't expect him to do such a thing.

782
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,420
He's not that kind of kid.

783
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,100
What

784
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,570
What does this mean?

785
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,570
I heard Hyun-ji say

786
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,400
Minwoo has been bullied by his classmates

787
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,920
But my friends were afraid to come forward...

788
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,850
Hey, I must secretly take a picture of my class teacher's underwear and upload it here today

789
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,460
[Hey, I must secretly take a picture of my class teacher's underwear and upload it. If I don't, I'll be beaten up.]

790
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,920
If it hadn't been transmitted

791
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,420
[Hey, I must secretly take a picture of my class teacher's underwear and upload it. If I don't, I'll be beaten up.]

792
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,520
Just waiting to be beaten up

793
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,920
Turn to page 194

794
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
The teacher wrote it on the blackboard

795
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,070
You must memorize what is written there.

796
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,470
Start looking from there

797
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,470
If you don't do this, it will really kill you.

798
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,450
The answer is too quiet. Speak louder.

799
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,370
yes

800
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,550
Come blood

801
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,870
Start reading from the pink grid.

802
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,450
Red blood cells transport oxygen

803
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,800
White blood cells eat bacteria

804
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,200
Platelets make the blood clot

805
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,150
Too British

806
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,250
sorry

807
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,200
Didn't you sleep well last night?

808
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,900
How can I sleep during class?

809
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,000
Now on page 194

810
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
Don't you want to take the test?

811
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,550
Where have you done?

812
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,450
Did you make it there?

813
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,470
Teacher, look at Minwoo

814
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,200
What are you doing

815
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,620
He took a photo of the teacher's skirt

816
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,420
The teacher is not like that.

817
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,470
What to do, teacher

818
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,370
Are you okay?

819
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,520
Kim Minwoo, what are you doing now?

820
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,870
Teacher, please hand over your phone.

821
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,870
No... Hand over your phone.

822
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,550
Follow me to the Academic Affairs Office

823
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,850
Come soon

824
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,500
Speak

825
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,520
Why shoot this?

826
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,150
You say

827
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,270
What are you thinking about why you want to shoot this kind of thing?

828
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,170
Minwoo

829
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,870
The teacher doesn't think Minwoo is that kind of person.

830
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,550
So you have to be honest, Minwoo

831
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,550
teacher

832
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,650
Actually, I...

833
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,450
teacher

834
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,300
I forgot to submit the application form for ordering milk

835
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,300
Me too

836
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,270
Leave it there.

837
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,020
yes

838
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,570
goodbye

839
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,420
Explain it to me clearly

840
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,670
What are you thinking about why you want to shoot this kind of thing?

841
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,400
I asked you what you were thinking about

842
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,650
Do you know how

843
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,370
What a dangerous move?

844
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,970
Kim Min Woo

845
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,020
You look so honest, yet you do such a thing

846
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,100
teacher

847
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,520
It's no use trying to persuade this kind of child.

848
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,700
Calling his parents can make him sober.

849
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,150
Teacher, please don't call me parents.

850
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,820
Why do you do such a bad thing?

851
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,500
What's your problem?

852
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,100
I was wrong

853
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
Brat

854
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,570
The teacher called his parents

855
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,350
Minwoo

856
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,650
Hey, why did you do that?

857
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,220
Our Minwoo doesn't look like that kind of person.

858
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,220
It's totally perverted.

859
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,900
You look down.

860
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,700
Laughing, a little brat is just joking

861
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,620
I'm here to help you relieve stress by singing, okay?

862
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,350
Today, because of my dad...

863
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,300
Damn

864
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,270
I have to go home

865
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,800
Don't talk too much, follow me

866
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,270
It's so heavy.

867
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,420
Those bastards

868
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,020
Those school bags are almost bigger than his body.

869
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,650
Those bastards

870
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,720
Go, go, go, go

871
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,920
I told you not to put your hands down

872
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,700
Do it well for me

873
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,100
Really

874
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,750
Wait a moment

875
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,920
what to do

876
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,170
Snap

877
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,469
Are you filming?

878
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,820
Hurry up! Hurry up!

879
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,520
Minwoo smiles

880
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,650
Like this

881
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,120
Stretch your arms out or I'll kick you in the face

882
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,300
I hope the bag won't fall off.

883
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,020
Straighten like this

884
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,469
Don't put on a face or I'll kick you down

885
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,520
Minwoo, time is almost up

886
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,270
Put money in quickly

887
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,650
Please invest money quickly.

888
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,719
Those damn bastards.

889
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,570
The atmosphere is interrupted.

890
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,600
Hello

891
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,820
Come sing a song

892
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,400
You need to relieve stress, right?

893
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,800
Come

894
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,000
Take it and sing it quickly

895
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,350
It's so suffocating.

896
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,350
Never mind. I'm going in.

897
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,300
Calm down

898
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,550
Let go of my boys.

899
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,170
I know, I know, I won't go in.

900
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,200
calm

901
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,170
Don't rush into it, it will only make the situation worse.

902
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,300
It will also hurt Minwoo's heart.

903
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,820
The most important thing about school violence is to collect solid evidence

904
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820
So observe again

905
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,570
elder sister

906
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,920
Oh, poor child

907
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,970
I can't bear it anymore

908
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,420
Suxi, you took pictures of what happened just now, right?

909
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,670
All filmed.

910
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,020
No, I'm going to deal with those bastards.

911
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,820
good

912
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,650
elder sister

913
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,370
What happened to him?

914
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,700
no

915
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,550
What to do?

916
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,600
Sister, are you okay?

917
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,970
This kid is really

918
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,220
sorry

919
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,300
Minwoo

920
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,570
What do you want to do?

921
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,050
No matter how sad you are, you can't do this.

922
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,920
How could you do something like that?

923
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,720
Minwoo

924
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,570
We know how difficult this time has been for you.

925
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,500
Now the aunties will help you

926
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,920
Help me?

927
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,900
How are you going to help me?

928
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,900
Why

929
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,350
Why did you save me?

930
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,550
Why don't you let me die?

931
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,550
Minwoo

932
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,550
Your father can only watch you live.

933
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,250
How can you say that?

934
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,450
Dad, he

935
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,970
He only drinks every day and doesn't care about me at all

936
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,970
Mom can't be contacted at all.

937
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,270
Minwoo

938
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,970
Dad is just having a little trouble now.

939
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,850
How could I not care about you?

940
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,620
You are his precious son.

941
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,820
Yes, Minwoo

942
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,700
Today, the aunts all saw

943
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,750
Very clear situation

944
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,550
We'll find a way no matter what.

945
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,500
I will also go to school to find teachers

946
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,350
Need not

947
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,870
Please don't do anything.

948
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,850
Do you think I haven't tried anything?

949
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,070
I told the teacher

950
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,870
I've been to the police station too.

951
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,500
But nothing changed

952
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,220
After telling the teacher

953
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,870
The next day, he will be beaten even worse.

954
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,500
Report to the police station

955
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,520
They just said they knew and told me to go home and wait

956
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,770
Come back to them when the situation gets more serious.

957
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,670
Adults always say they will help solve the problem.

958
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,650
Wait a minute

959
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,020
But for me

960
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,270
The waiting time is more like hell

961
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,520
I feel like I'm going to die in the next second

962
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,100
How long should I wait?

963
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,820
When will you help me solve it?

964
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,500
[An Taimin]

965
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,600
Auntie, let me answer the phone for you.

966
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,550
don't want

967
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,450
Stop interfering in my affairs.

968
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,770
Minwoo

969
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,020
What should I do?

970
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,560
[Taemin: Come quickly to buy cigarettes and beer. Didn’t I tell you to reply immediately?]

971
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,400
Come quickly to buy cigarettes and beer

972
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Didn't I ask you to reply immediately?

973
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,740
[Do you really want to die? Do you need to be beaten again to wake up?]

974
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,120
Do you really want to die?

975
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Do I need to be beaten again to wake up?

976
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,670
Have you read it but not replied?

977
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,120
You are such a rude boy.

978
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,170
You disappeared without saying hello, and I thought you were really dead.

979
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,250
Anyway, people without mothers are just uneducated.

980
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,770
If you don't want to get beaten

981
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,950
Get to the playground in Building 206 within 5 minutes

982
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,650
If you don't come, your girlfriend will get beaten.

983
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,400
hurry up

984
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,850
girlfriend

985
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,850
What are you doing now?

986
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,020
Minwoo

987
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,320
Got a girlfriend?

988
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,970
Let me go

989
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,770
Do you think you can continue to go to school?

990
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,720
Who is worrying about whom now?

991
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,520
You can't go to school tomorrow.

992
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,150
Worry about yourself, bitch.

993
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,250
Why don't you have any cigarettes in your schoolbag?

994
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,120
At least bring money for cigarettes.

995
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Come, come, come

996
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,670
Come here quick you bastard

997
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,420
Is it more than 5 minutes?

998
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,400
What 5 minutes?

999
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,770
It seems to have been more than 10 minutes.

1000
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,950
You all stop

1001
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,220
Just bully me.

1002
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,420
Let Hyun-ji go.

1003
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,250
Minwoo

1004
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,970
So you guys are really dating?

1005
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,300
I'm afraid you'll be too lonely when you get beaten up alone.

1006
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,270
Today I asked you to get beaten together to improve your relationship.

1007
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,300
Who will come first?

1008
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,300
Let the newcomers go first.

1009
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,450
stop

1010
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,870
don't want

1011
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,220
Feed it

1012
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,350
grab grab grab

1013
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:36,900
catch

1014
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,570
Target

1015
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,520
I am coming

1016
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,020
Don't you want us to beat you?

1017
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,020
Does it hurt?

1018
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,150
You asked us to beat you.

1019
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,500
stop

1020
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,470
Please stop fighting.

1021
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,200
Then it's your turn.

1022
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,570
Stop it

1023
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,920
Scare me

1024
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,120
Aunt

1025
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,100
Mother

1026
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,550
Hello Park Hyun-ji

1027
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,970
Is it mom again this time?

1028
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,770
That's enough.

1029
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,920
Hand over the cigarettes and lighter.

1030
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,670
What is this lady talking about?

1031
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,450
No, let's put out the fire first.

1032
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,620
We need to call the fire truck.

1033
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,970
Is this lady crazy?

1034
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,950
Are you looking for death?

1035
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,320
Hello, what should I do?

1036
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,750
Aunt Pig, you came at the right time

1037
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,470
Let's settle the accounts from last time together this time

1038
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,070
Ha, look at this guy.

1039
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,300
Smoking is not enough

1040
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,870
Now he's walking around with a knife

1041
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,320
Poor clothing

1042
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,170
Bad attitude

1043
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,750
The most important thing is bad character

1044
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,420
Auntie is worse.

1045
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,420
I got a scratch on my arm because of you

1046
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,620
My legs were bruised and I took photos.

1047
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,050
The diagnosis has been issued.

1048
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,050
Oh, is that so?

1049
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,100
Aunt

1050
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,420
We are minors

1051
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,370
You won't get caught no matter what you do.

1052
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,170
But you are not

1053
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,770
If you keep doing this, something bad will happen.

1054
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,600
Did you misunderstand something?

1055
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,420
I won't make the first move.

1056
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,370
You should know this best.

1057
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,470
What the hell is this lady talking about?

1058
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
How about it

1059
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,400
Do you want to come again?

1060
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,570
Is it okay?

1061
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,120
Hello

1062
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,220
How is the party?

1063
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,170
elder brother

1064
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,120
Look at these guys

1065
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,050
I don't know where these hooligans came from, but they all got together.

1066
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,470
Hey, are these the aunties you are talking about?

1067
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,650
That's right.

1068
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,220
Auntie, you are dead.

1069
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,070
You are no match for these big brothers.

1070
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,450
Hey, how old are you?

1071
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,620
Auntie, please take out your ID card first

1072
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,500
How old are we?

1073
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,700
Do you want to give New Year's money?

1074
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,170
The knife was also taken out

1075
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,620
Adults also showed up

1076
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,470
Then we don't have to worry.

1077
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,820
Come on, kids.

1078
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,750
Auntie is going to pickle the ribs now

1079
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,270
Let's make a quick decision

1080
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,950
OK

1081
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,020
What are you saying?

1082
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,150
Hey, kill them.

1083
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,350
come over

1084
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:28,920
careful

1085
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,670
Sister, are you okay?

1086
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,500
careful

1087
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,900
Ah hair hair

1088
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,320
Bro where are you going

1089
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,670
Where are you going, you bastards?

1090
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,150
You little bastards, hold your schoolbags up!

1091
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,870
If you bully our Minwoo again

1092
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,220
You're dead, you know?

1093
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,600
Auntie, who are you?

1094
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,070
Who is this?

1095
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,950
It's not that the boy's father doesn't care about him anymore

1096
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,950
Why do you aunties interfere?

1097
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,900
You ask who I am

1098
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,920
I am Minwoo's mother

1099
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,750
I am also Minwoo's mother

1100
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,920
I am also Minwoo's mother

1101
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,870
I am also Minwoo's mother

1102
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,420
There are four mothers

1103
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,570
You've been wronged

1104
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,850
This is the final warning

1105
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,650
Don't touch my son Minwoo

1106
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:01,750
Will die

1107
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,170
Your smoking thing

1108
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,870
Bullying my son Minwoo

1109
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,520
The knife thing

1110
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,020
I filmed the video.

1111
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,420
Now the law has changed

1112
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,770
Records of school violence among junior high school students

1113
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,570
Will stay until college enrollment

1114
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,920
Have you thought about the consequences?

1115
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,220
Alas, you fools who only rely on your minor status

1116
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,170
You bunch of stinky boys

1117
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,720
Apologize to my son Minwoo immediately

1118
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,270
Let's wait and see, auntie

1119
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,270
What do you mean by "wait and see"?

1120
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,470
Do you still think adults are easy to bully?

1121
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,250
Okay, very good.

1122
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,050
Let's see

1123
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,300
See you at school tomorrow.

1124
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,070
See you the next day

1125
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:36,870
Let's keep meeting each other.

1126
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,870
Until you wake up

1127
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,820
I will wait for you at school tomorrow morning

1128
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,820
See you tomorrow

1129
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,050

Always

1131
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,370
What?

1132
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,820
It's over, why did you call me?

1133
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,120
Those guys

1134
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
I was going to teach them a lesson.

1135
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,120
It's over

1136
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,050
Who are you...

1137
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,300
Ah, could it be that they just moved into Building 213?

1138
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,750
Yes, hello.

1139
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:03,450
My name is Park Seung-ho

1140
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,100

1141
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,720
Hello

1142
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,420
I heard he was a virtual coach.

1143
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,250
Me? Yes.

1144
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,250
It's not about being physically fit, it's about fitness

1145
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,370
I am a fitness trainer

1146
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:11,950
yes

1147
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,520
Who are you...

1148
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,200
I am Lu Kangzhi from Building 209.

1149
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,920
Ah, that's the one who's always hot and horny

1150
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,670
What

1151
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,220
Give me a good

1152
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,920
It turns out it isn't.

1153
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,670
It seems that I am the only one burning.

1154
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,070
No

1155
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,650
It's burning and it's burning well.

1156
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,570
You came really early. Very early.

1157
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,920
Wife, are you okay?

1158
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,500
Did you crawl over here?

1159
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,320
Did I go somewhere to play?

1160
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,070
Is the clothes hanging?

1161
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:32,720
Yeah, it's all done.

1162
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,800
White clothes and colored clothes

1163
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,950
Wash the towels separately.

1164
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,550
Yes

1165
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,750
Did you forget to add softener?

1166
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,300
Release

1167
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,250
Oh, kitchen waste.

1168
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:39,920
Is there any food waste thrown away?

1169
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,570
Lost, lost, lost

1170
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,220
I will check carefully if I have done it.

1171
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,050
Confirm what?

1172
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,920
Why are you so loud?

1173
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,020
Hyun Ji Hyun Ji is back home

1174
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,070
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1175
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,200
Oh Hyun-ji

1176
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,050
How come you are here?

1177
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,370
Walk slowly. Walk slowly.

1178
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,520
Why beat the child?

1179
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,000
You bunch of stinky boys

1180
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,850
If you beat up your classmates and bully others again

1181
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,850
I won't let you go.

1182
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,050
Uncle is a policeman

1183
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,450
I can see your faces clearly.

1184
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,350
No answer, right?

1185
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,300
Yes Yes

1186
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,570
I filmed them all.

1187
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,250

Please take a seat

1194
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,950
This is a video of Minwoo being bullied at school.

1195
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,720
Verbal violence is fundamental

1196
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,420
The violence is really serious.

1197
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,400
There are many witnesses

1198
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,120
Not only me, but many others

1199
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,300

What are you doing?

1217
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,470
Are you smoking?

1218
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,170
Go fast

1219
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,270
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello

1220
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,850
Pick up the cigarette butts before leaving.

1221
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,970
This isn't what we smoked.

1222
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,550
Tae-woo shuts his mouth

1223
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,300

1224
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,620
Concentrate on picking up

1225
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,900
Is our Chan-young tired?

1226
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,150
No

1227
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,150
Taemin, be more positive.

1228
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:35,900
yes

1229
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,770
Don't do it to this extent.

1230
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,320
Thank you

Have you found a job?

1234
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,100
It was my previous job that brought me back.

1235
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,750
I've decided to start working next week.

1236
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,870
Very good

1237
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,150
It's so nice

1238
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,070

1239
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,400
Thank you so much, everyone.

00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,600
Thank you. Thank you.

1241
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,620
It's so nice

1242
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,120
Please forgive me

1243
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,000
I don't know anything

1244
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,970
Didn't see anything really.

1245
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,170
Please forgive me

1246
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:33,900
Are you moving?

1247
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,750
What number is it?

00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,800
It's No. 4, 11th floor

1249
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,670
It's right above us.

1250
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,950
I thought it was too quiet because no one lived there.

1251
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,100
The previous resident was transferred to another place

1252
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,500
Gone a few months ago.

1253
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,350
This time the house was sold so I moved.

1254
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,420
It's been quiet and we're doing fine.

1255
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,300
I hope the person who moves here is someone you can get along with.

Sometimes I don't know I've moved.

1263
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,620
I still get some emails.

1264
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,050
Yeah, that should be it.

Oh, sister-in-law

Have you heard?

1275
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,350
The house you moved into

1276
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,320
I heard that this is the house where someone died.

1277
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,520
An elderly man living alone committed suicide

1278
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,050
That’s why the family sold it at a low price in a hurry.

1279
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,000
Who said it?

1280
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,100
Today I ran into someone who used to live there

1281
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,200
Friends who moved away later

1282
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,200
She said that in the first few months after you moved in

1283
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,470
Someone committed suicide by jumping from the balcony of that house.

1284
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,020
Ah, what should I do?

1285
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,520
So don't just buy it for cheap.

1286
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,670
What should I do? I feel so nervous.

1287
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,800

1288

00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,100
The guy who lived here before I moved in

1302
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,650
Did he really commit suicide?

1303
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,150
Oh, I'll just say it.

1304
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,670
There are no secrets in this world

1305
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:25,970
So what?

1306
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,120
Where people live, people will inevitably die.

1307
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,700
elder sister

1308
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,870
How painful must life be to make such a choice?

1309
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,550
You guys really don't care about anything, it's just as simple as saying it.

1310
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,370
Then sell the house and move away.

1311
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,650
If you feel uncomfortable, put it up for sale immediately

1312
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,220
Move away

1313
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,900
It's not that easy

1314
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,920
That's it.

1315
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,820
That was long before you moved in.

1316
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,500
It has nothing to do with you.

1317
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,000
That person is really kind.

1318
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,020
After the death of the only daughter

1319
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,820
I've been living alone

1320
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,670
It seemed to be three days before his death.

1321
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,200
When he said he was going to see his daughter, I thought he was going to the columbarium.

1322
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,370
Why drink in broad daylight?

1323
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,920
Is the supermarket owner no longer in business?

1324
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,000
Feed you.

1325
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,520
After drinking, I want to open up a little

1326
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,650
Now I should be reunited with my daughter.

1327
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,870
You're living a happy life, right?

1328
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,850
So you pray for that person too

1329
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,150
Live with a grateful heart

1330
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:29,970
yes

1331
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,220
As the saying goes, a blessing in disguise

1332
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,650
Thanks to that guy, I bought a cheap house.

1333
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,800
For me, it is a blessing

1334
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,450
That's right.

1335
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,450
Very positive attitude, very good

1336
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,520
When can I buy a house after choosing this and that?

1337
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,000
It's not like he died at home.

1338
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,900
That's right

1339
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,400
As expected, it's Kong Miri

1340
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,800
move place

1341
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,870
I always feel hairy.

1342
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,870
After all, it's a house where someone died.

1343
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,120
Everyone will die.

1344
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,970
In the past, people died at home and funerals were also held at home.

1345
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,350
That's a natural death.

1346
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,370
But didn't that guy jump off the balcony?

1347
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,770
So the aunts asked you to move?

1348
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,150
Now mom knows too

1349
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:18,700
He said we didn't even find out the details and he was furious.

1350
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,700
That's really fast.

1351
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,670
Your sisters have really big mouths.

1352
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,570
Everyone is doing this because they are worried about us.

1353
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,270
Just sell it quickly and move away

1354
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,550
You think that with the money we have,

1355
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,500
Can you find such a nice house?

1356
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,550
Besides, it wouldn't be easy to sell with such rumors.

1357
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:35,670
There's nothing I can do.

1358
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,250
We have to sell it quickly even at the original price.

1359
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,200
Deed tax agency fee

1360
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,220
Moving expenses and renovation expenses

1361
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,520
How much did these cost?

1362
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,050
Or do you plan to continue living here?

1363
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:47,100
There might be ghosts of suicides floating around here.

1364
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,770
What

1365
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,370
Some people say there is a house with suicide ghosts

1366
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,850
Suicide will happen again

1367
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,420
This place shouldn't...

1368
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,970
Stop giving me that bullshit.

1369
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,600
sorry

1370
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,450
You know I'm fragile.

1371
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:04,450
Too

1372
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,620
A tofu heart beaten by a junior high school student

1373
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,570
How strong can it be?

1374
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,120
No, that's because the kids are too young.

1375
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,850
If I punch him, someone might die.

1376
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,920
To protect minors

1377
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,470
Protect the ass

1378
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:15,970
If it weren't for Sister Qingzi

1379
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,250
It's not the collar of your T-shirt that's loose, it's your neck

1380
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,100
Do you think today's children are so simple?

1381
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,270
Taller than me

1382
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,170
Ouch

1383
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,770
To deal with those tough kids

1384
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,770
Are you just hiding under the covers and pretending to sleep?

1385
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,350
So

1386
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,900
My heart is pure to that extent.

1387
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,020
No wonder

1388
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,000
I don't care

1389
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,120
If you want to move, you have to move it yourself

1390
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,100
How can I move by myself?

1391
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,250
Of course we have to move together.

1392
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,600
I'm so nervous, let's move.

1393
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,850
Move with that guy.

1394
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,600
I was scared to death

1395
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,570
It's raining

1396
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,400
Go out and close the window

1397
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,050
hurry up

1398
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:49,750
don't want

1399
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
I'm going now

1400
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,400
It's raining really hard

My mom, my mom

1402
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,970
Why did it suddenly fall down?

1403
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,370
I have to go to the hardware store tomorrow morning.

1404
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:19,900
Very cold

1405
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,570
There were no slippers just now.

1406
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,700
What are you doing

1407
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,350
It's cold. Close the window and come in.

1408
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:10,820
It's me who died, not you

1409

This can't go on like this.
