It hurts so much, won't it be better if I go out?

185
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,530
Ouch, my stomach hurts.

186
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,620
Excuse me, I need to use the toilet

187
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,190
Aunt

188
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,620
I can't hold it anymore, auntie

189
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,920
Aunt

190
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,550
Auntie

191
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,080
I really can't hold it anymore

192
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,150
Please use the toilet

193
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,840
[Sister Ji Hyun: The plan to infiltrate the enemy camp was successful. I found a room that looked suspicious.]

194
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,360
She succeeded

195
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,370
It's OK. It's OK.

196
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,080
Hey, take a photo.

197
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,510
Hello

198
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,230
Hello

199
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,920
This is the parking lot

200
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,040
Are you the owner of the car with license plate number 5986?

201
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,820
Is there anything wrong?

202
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,190
Come out and have a look soon.

203
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,210
A car just hit your car and it seems like it's going to run away.

204
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,770
What did you say

205
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,450
What should I do? It seems like a real hit and run.

206
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,000
He smashed someone's car and ran away

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,810
This person is too bad.

208
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,730
I'll find a way to help you stop him, please come out quickly

209
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,770
sharp

210
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,140
Auntie, please come out before I open the door.

211
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,630
You have to finish pooping before you can go out. My stomach hurts.

212
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,380
You're driving me crazy

213
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,410
Auntie, I have to go out now.

214
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,190
You can go with peace of mind

215
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,080
I never touch other people's things.

216
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,940
I am the owner of Guangshan Supermarket

217
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,800
Ouch my stomach

218
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,280
Then I'll go quickly and come back soon. Don't move around.

219
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,620
OK

220
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,820
Even if you let me out, I can't go out

221
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,260
It may take a long time. Go quickly.

222
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,450
Damn, what happened?

223
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,550
Go fast

224
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,060
Oh, I'm really scared to death.

225
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,920
Great job, sis.

226
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,050
Oh, if you have the will, you can do anything.

227
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,620
Sisters, we don't have time.

228
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,380
It takes 8 minutes to go from here to the parking lot.

229
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,450
hateful

230
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,550
If the elevator is unobstructed, it will only take 6 minutes to run there.

231
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,280
We have to do it in 6 minutes.

232
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,010
good

233
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,840
That room over there is suspicious.

234
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,040
Is there anyone inside?

235
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,920
Hye-jeong Hye-jeong

236
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,310
That bastard wouldn't attack her.

237
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,610
You get out of the way

238
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,100
If you're in there, make some noise.

239
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,200
Okay?

240
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,620
Hye-jeong Hye-jeong

241
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,220
We wouldn't guess wrong, would we?

242
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,090
Hye-jung Are you Hye-jung?

243
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,720
If it's Huizhen, you should make some noise.

244
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,870
She may not be able to speak now.

245
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,820
The key must first find the key

246
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,330
Only 4 minutes left, hurry up

247
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,570
hateful

248
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,780
Really

249
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,170
Damn, what's going on?

250
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,870
Only 2 minutes left.

251
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,450
He should have realized he was cheated and come back now.

252
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,460
hateful

253
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,970
Where did he put the keys?

254
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,810
Did he take it with him?

255
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,070
Get out of the way

256
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,530
Damn it, why don't you come down?

257
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,830
Have you seen a dog nearby?

258
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,110
Didn't see

259
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,540
[Name of missing dog notice: Millie]

260
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,070
It's alright now.

261
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,460
Don't worry, it's all over.

262
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,450
I have attached the anti-theft link. I will go and have a look.

263
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,620
What are you doing, auntie?

264
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,480
Auntie, open the door

265
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,810
What are you doing in someone else's house?

266
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,240
fine

267
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,730
You asked me what I was doing, didn't you know it?

268
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,090
Open the door

269
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,770
Do you know that you are trespassing?

270
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,320
Of course I know that trespassing is wrong

271
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,640
That's not as serious as house arrest or beating someone up, right?

272
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,380
You don't know anything yet you dare to talk nonsense

273
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,910
Open the door, open the door, or I'll call the police.

274
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,810
I called the police and an ambulance.

275
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,630
It will arrive in a moment.

276
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,750
What

277
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,230
hateful

278
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,830
Who is your aunt?

279
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,000
Me? I am a resident of the 2nd residential area of Gwangsan Community Housing.

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,690
She's also a police officer's wife.

281
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,280
Are you the one who brought the garbage to me that day?

282
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,440
I have a good memory.

283
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,110
If you don't want to get hurt, get out of my way.

284
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,620
You are committing a crime of intimidation. I advise you not to do this.

285
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,760
Otherwise it will only increase your sentence.

286
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,130
Mind your own business and get out of my way

287
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,240
Blood

288
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,710
You also committed assault.

289
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,580
You will be sentenced to 5 years imprisonment

290
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,460
(Note: Approximately NT$210,000)
or a fine of less than 10 million

291
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,430
What are you going to do?

hateful

293
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,850
I told you it's useless to struggle

294
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,250
It's coming out. It's coming out.

295
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,680
Keiko parking lot parking lot

296
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,190

White car

298
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,800
A white car?

299
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,140
That guy is hiding next to the white car

300
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,480
Why are all the cars white? Which one is it?

301
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,220
The white car next to the grey car

302
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,240
White car next to grey car

303
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,930

305
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,610
Behind? Behind?

306
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,670
Do you want to go back later?

307
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,180
Damn, found it

308
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,270
Be careful

309
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,640
Hang up

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,480
You crazy guy

312
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,089
Why are you standing still?

313
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:11,740
stop

314
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,790
Qiu Qingzi, you also stop right there

315
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,470
Stop right there, you bastard!

316
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,670
Don't Run

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
Are you a policeman? I told you to stop.

320
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,069
I know, I know, don't worry about it, I will definitely catch him

321
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,780
Who is he?

322
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,420
That crazy guy at the convenience store.

323
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,560
Lu Kangzhi, go over there

324
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,170
Are you my boss? Damn it!

325

You actually ordered me like this

326
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,220
stop

327
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,040
It was you who called the police, right?

328
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,240
This way, please come this way

329
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,520
This side

330
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,510
Can you get up?

331
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,200

336
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,790
Where are the people?

337
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,480
Wow, it runs really fast.

338
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,610
Come out while I'm saying something nice

339
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,950

340
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,210
Hello

341
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,610
Damn you for scratching me

342
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,160
Come out while I'm saying something nice

343
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,860
Where did you go? Damn it.

344
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,890
You son of a bitch

In pocket

349
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,350
Why don't you look behind?

350
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,680
Qiu Qingzi is not as capable as before

351
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,690
We haven't worked on a case together for a while, right?

352
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,220
Are you still using these handcuffs?

353
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,290
This is a keepsake of our history.

354
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,610
Get out of the way

355
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,670
stand up

356
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,920
I don't know who taught you how to put on handcuffs so neatly

357
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,160
I'm really good at choosing a husband.

358
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,630
It's all over, let's go home

359
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,680
Don't leave a beautiful woman alone at home to cause trouble to me in the middle of the night

360
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,620
knew

361
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,270
Let's go

362
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,980
Go ahead

363
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,770
What are you looking at?

364
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,420
Miri, call immediately if you have any problem

365
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,150
good

366
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,720
Take the treatment well.

367
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,050
Thanks

368
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Oh, what's going on?

369
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,020
Hello, hello. Hello.

370
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,070
What happened?

371
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,540
It seems that a resident of the building has put a girl under house arrest.

372
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,480
House arrest?

373
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,010
right

374
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,480
How could someone put someone under house arrest in a building like this?

375
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,320
Excuse me, have you seen my dog?

376
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,360
Haven't found it yet? What should I do?

377
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,440
If I find it, I'll contact you right away.

378
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,300
OK, thanks

379
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,980
Millie, I miss you so much.

380
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,410
Where are you?

381
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,570
Where are my photos?

382
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,890
This is not my button.

383
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,990
Hello

384
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,660
That's right, Pomeranian yellow dog leash

385
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,600
Is my Millie with you?

386
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,330
Thanks

387
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,190
Ok, where are you?

388
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,170
Cheers Cheers

389
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,490
Great

390
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,610
Sister, have you finished drinking?

391
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,580
Of course we have to drink

392
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,000
Tanghulu is not a snack but a side dish for drinking

393
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,840
Sister, why did you bring this?

394
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,200
Don't worry, I'm a regular customer.

395
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,900
Look

396
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,640

397
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,480
Thanks

398
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,170
Sister, is there any store in our community that you are not a regular customer of?

399
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,570
Of course not

400
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,340
Dear, here is a blood sausage

401
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,850
Add more lungs and liver

402
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,740
I take the shrimp paste myself

403
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,020
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

404
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,340
Even tearing that guy into pieces won't make me feel better.

405
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,460
Hey, I heard that the part-time student had bruises all over his body.

406
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,820
Bruise and other injuries will disappear after a while.

407
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,040
The problem is that it may take some time to recover from the psychological trauma.

408
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,570
That is to say

409
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,370
By the way, is the wound from the scissors okay?

410
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,800
let me see

411
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,470
It's just a minor scratch. I've already applied some medicine.

412
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,350
Once Qingzi gets angry, no one can stop her.

413
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,840
She is worthy of being called the female Ma Dong-seok

414
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,380
That's right, sister, you are too brave.

415
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,750
He actually confronted a guy with a weapon.

416
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,600
If you continue to be a police officer, you will definitely be an excellent police officer

417
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,900
Why didn't you do it later?

418
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,450
Please, if both husband and wife become police officers

419
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,620
Who will cook and who will take care of the children?

420
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,790
What a pity

421
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,440
Today I am just in the trap set by Kong Meili

422
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,970
Just stretching my muscles

423
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,050
By the way, your acting was great today.

424
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,170
That's right

425
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,900
What is the Korean middle-aged and elderly beauty pageant?

426
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,870
That's a small matter for you.

427
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,430
(Note: South Korea's three major film awards)
You are even qualified to win the Blue Dragon Award for Best Actress

428

Of course I am Jun Ji-hyun

429
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,560
I am Jun Ji-hyun

430
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,590
Yes, sister, you are Jun Ji-hyun

431
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,670
By the way, why was that part-time student put under house arrest by that guy?

432
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,820
It seems like the girl wants to quit her job

433
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,230
The guy got her drunk under the pretext of saying goodbye

434
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,750
He said he was already in that room when he woke up.

435
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,680
She was drugged indeed.

436
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,610
That's not house arrest, it's protecting her.

437
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,870
Is it wrong for me to love her and protect her?

438
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,520
Ask Huizhen in person what I did wrong

439
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,930
gentlemen

440
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,510
Go and bring Hye-jung to me.

441
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,450
Please be quiet

442
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,380
I heard that he seemed gentle at first.

443
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,620
So she couldn't refuse his kindness.

444
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,690
But the boys misunderstood it as love

445
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,080
We are boyfriend and girlfriend

446
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,450
hateful

447
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,450
It's so noisy

448

sorry

449
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,930
Mr. Police

450
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,440
He has a twisted narcissistic mentality and always thinks he is superior to others.

451
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,220
Narcissistic personality disorder

452
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,340
So it develops to the end

453
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,780
Even monitoring the other party and not allowing them to see anyone except themselves

454
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,470
A paranoid

455
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:03,090
This kind of person will want to put others under house arrest if they don't do what they want.

456
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,030
By the way, Suxi didn't answer the phone today.

457
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,440
I wanted to buy her a drink.

458
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,350
It's working time now.

459
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,750
Making money is more important than drinking at someone else's expense.

460
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,360
Anyway, I really don't understand her.

461
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,430
Where is she going to spend the money she earns?

462
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,610
What is it used for?

463
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,340
I heard before

464
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,120
Su Hee is actually a billionaire

465
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,420
She lived frugally and saved money, didn't buy anything, and lived on the interest she saved.

466
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,680
I bought a house a long time ago and also bought a piece of land somewhere in the countryside.

467

What is the current situation?

469
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,780
Blood pressure and pulse returned to normal and the fever subsided.

470
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,510

I heard that my sister-in-law has done a great deed again today.

497
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,880
What happened to the incident in which residents of the second residential area of Gwangsan Community Housing reported to the police that a pervert was haunting the place?

498
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,630
The police station in charge has sent people to patrol

499
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,930

500

This wizard is really effective.

730
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,700
This is my home

731
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,460
How could you do this without consulting me?

732
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,420
What is your home?

733
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,290
This is the house our Seungho worked so hard to buy.

734
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,050
mom

735
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,410
I'm sorry...

736
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,110
Sometimes when things don't go well, I will go to fortune-telling.

737
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,890
But I don't need this

738
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,280
I went to church until high school.

739
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,330
Shut up

740
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,610
Sister-in-law, you can't be so disrespectful. Be quiet.

741
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,690
Why not go there?

742
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,450
Oh my god

743
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,820
What is she doing?

744
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,930
Oh my god

745
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,550
Mage...

746
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,970
There is a ghost wandering around this house.

747
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,400
Poor wronged souls wandering between the human world and the underworld

748
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,540
The Spirits Are Calling You

749
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,380
Stop harboring resentment and follow the gods.

750
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,010
The gods said they would help you get revenge

751
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:43,720
Oh, let go of your resentment and follow the gods.

752
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,610
Oh my god!

753
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,680
Follow the Spirit

754
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,600
Please follow the gods.

755
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,410
It's this woman. This woman.

756
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,930
Hiding in her body

757
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,450
Get out of here! The gods are very angry.

758
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:20,470
It hurts... This witch, get out, get out

759
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,260
I'm going out I'm going out

760
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,450
No, no

761
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,640
It's not my sister-in-law, it's another woman who wants to go out

762
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,850
it hurts...

763
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,160
What is the ritual?

764
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,120
yes

765
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,640
It is said that if the aura in the house is bad, the male owner may have bad luck.

766
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,260
The host is your husband

767
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,490
Is your husband cheating on you?

768
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,240
What

769
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,770
Don't believe it. Don't believe it.

770
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:46,920
Once you start to believe

771
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,140
It will never end. That is superstition.

772
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:49,730
Don't believe

773
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,550
Right?

774
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,860
But I still feel weird.

775
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,040
So you decided to do the ritual?

776
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,510
Where is the money?

777
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,320
(Note: Approximately NT$105,000)
At least 5 million won

778
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,670
(Note: Approximately NT$10,500)
I don't even have 500,000 won

779
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,490
That's right

780
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:03,020
My mother-in-law likes to eat fern very much.

781
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,180
So I made a big bowl of fern salad

782
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,030
Come to my house and get some before you go home.

783
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:06,480
Really

784
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,950
Mmm, my arm is about to break.

785
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,680
Fern must be delicious. Thank you, sister.

786
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,100
You're welcome

787
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,190
I don't eat bracken, give my share to Misato.

788
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,000
No wonder

789
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,350
My sister's supermarket doesn't sell bracken.

790
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,380
Yes

791
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,870
I like buying fresh food at my sister's supermarket.

792
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,270
But Miri

793
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,860
The younger brother of the Women's Association President is really a high-ranking official in the National Police Agency, right?

794
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,600
Really? How many times do I have to say this? Really?

795
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:38,060
Please ask someone to come. Do you want me to give you the telephone number of the plumber?

796
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,880
Do you think I don't know who to look for?

797
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,590
I called and they said they can't come until tomorrow morning.

798
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,740
What can I do?

799
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,420
You also know

800
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,930
The public toilet in our community is too far away

801
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,640
This is not the administrator's responsibility

802
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,320
I have to mow the lawn first.

803
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,610
Otherwise, what is the administrator's responsibility?

804
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,310
Since the last garbage incident, I have discovered a problem

805
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,160
The administrator of this community will only be paid on time

806
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,630
Too irresponsible.

807
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,840
If residents have problems, administrators should solve them.

808
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,120
Isn't it?

809
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,870
It's not easy to find this kind of job at your age.

810
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:20,120
Wouldn't it be nice to take care of each other for a long time?

811
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,510
Don't worry, I won't order people around for nothing.

812
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,780
Come

813
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,650
Please help me unclog the toilet

814
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,420
Please help me clean the toilet

815
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,990
This is the cleaning fee.

816
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,930
Sorry for bothering you

817
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,980
Oops, foul ball

818
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,700
Very good

819
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,750
Ouch...

820
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,170
I'm sorry for inviting you to come over.

821
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,130
What poor hospitality?

822
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,660
There is tea and fruit

823
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:59,210
It's already rich.

824
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,440
The tea smells so good. What kind of tea is this?

825
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,040
It is persimmon leaf tea

826
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,090
I picked it myself and dried it in the sun

827
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,900
I don't know if it tastes good.

828
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,880
Of course it tastes good

829
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,320
Of course it tastes good.

830
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,300
I heard that the quality of tea depends half on the tea maker's intention.

831
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,970
Oh, maybe it's the women's president's heart.

832
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,160
How to say it

833
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,190
The tea flavor is rich and layered, and it has a very stylish taste.

834
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,930
Yeah

835
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,710
I heard that you three rescued the work-study students who were under house arrest.

836
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,550
Such a dangerous thing

837
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,940
How can you solve this problem without the help of the police?

838
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,050
Oh, there are three of us...

839
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,110
Of course it would be impossible without the assistance of the police.

840
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:45,400
It was my husband who assisted and advised me.

841
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,890
So we can solve this problem

842
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,260
So that's it

843
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:54,930
But I heard that the police arrived at the scene only after rescuing the victim.

844
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,310
In fact, it was a necessary situation.

845
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,870
If we rashly let the police intervene

846
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,140
It may put the victim in danger

847
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:10,430
So we quietly asked my husband for help.

848
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,160
The matter was resolved smoothly.

849
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,630
Oh...you guys are so smart

850
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,800
Anyway, the three of you have saved our Guangshan community again.

851
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,560
Oh, we didn't do anything.

852
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,210
All thanks to the care and guidance of the Women's Association President.

853
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,840
Thanks to my care and guidance?

854
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,990
Oh, number 803 speaks so nicely

855
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,750
It is No. 806

856
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,050
Oh, good!

857
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,420
The resident representative's toilet has been cleared

858
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,290
Cleaning

859
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,310
I've cleaned it up, so I don't need to pay.

860
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,240
Please help me throw it away when you go out.

861
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,940
My waist is not good

862

863
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,380
OK, thanks

864
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,140
Qiu Qingzi, you are trying to get your husband promoted.

865
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,560
Distorting the facts?

866
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,200
Yes, sister, you've gone a little too far.

867
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,790
Forgive me

868
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,480
My husband must get a promotion this time.

869
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,950
After being squeezed out by the younger generation last time

870
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,730
They're all venting their anger on me.

871
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,620
It's obviously because I'm not good enough that I didn't get promoted.

872
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,670
Why take it out on your wife?

873
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:41,860
Feel sorry

874
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,890
It doesn't matter. He's not weak, he's just unlucky.

875
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,910
Usually people without ability will blame their luck.

877
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,180
Feel sorry

878
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,840
Really

881
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,460
No, not

882
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,210
I envy the elevator for its good fortune.

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,000
Why is it under repair again?

886
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,600
There's no choice but to take the stairs.

887
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,210
Ah, I can't stand it.

888
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,320

889
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,060
Come on sister, we're almost there

890

Wait for me

891
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,880
I really can't help you. I'll help you.

892

No, no, you carry me.

894
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,350
This is the administrator's hat.

895
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,960
Yeah, why is his hat here?

896
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,440
Wait a moment

Since the elevator is out of service, we can move down another day.

908
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,530

909
