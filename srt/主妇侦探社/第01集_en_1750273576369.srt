Oh, drink again.

Oh, it's starting again.

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,356
What? How dare you?
you're ranting like that. Hey, you…

15
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,108
We've been together too long, huh?

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,497
Goodbye!

17
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:23,809
Sorry, we're leaving soon.

18
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,919

00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:29,820
Leave!
Leave.

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,938
Wow, even the weather cooperates!

21
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:39,420
Perfect day for moving, huh?
That's right.

22
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,580
Wow, finally a day like this
also comes into Gong Mi-ri's life.

23
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,596
The day I ended
living in different rented houses,

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,100
and have their own house.

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,636
After 15 years of struggle,

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,415
finally i stay
in our own home!

27
00:01:56,466 --> 00:02:00,427

30
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:10,410
Great! We, the little family

31
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,727

32
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:15,684
Thank you very much!
Finally arrived.

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,215
Sorry, please do it as soon as possible, okay?

34
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,596
If it coincides with the time to go home from work,
it will be difficult to use the elevator.

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,060
Don't worry.

36
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,876
Let's get it all done
before the sun sets!

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,220
It's great, isn't it?

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,076
Dad, I'm going to school first.
See you later, Mom!

39
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,180
Hey, let Dad take you there.
No need. I know the way. Bye!

40
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:42,620
Here! Quickly help move first.
Yes. Come on.

41
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,140
Wow, everyone is here.
looks so relaxed.

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,060
The air feels different too.

43
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,956
My sweet home.

44
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,636
Hello. Are you guys moving to the 10th floor?
Yes, unit 1004.

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,340
Pleased to meet you.
Wow, I'm the one who's asking for your help.

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,460
This is my first experience
live in an apartment.

47
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,036
This is my first house
after 15 years of saving.

48
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,209
Really? Wow, congratulations.

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,620
Happy what?
I still have a lot of debt.

50
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,333
But I look around,

51
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,540
This complex is clean,
and the residents look friendly.

52
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,680
What?

53
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,214
Damn it!

54
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:49,535
The parking lot is spacious.
It must be very comfortable to park here.

55
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:53,790
The road is good, it fits perfectly
to take the dog for a walk.

56
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:57,569
Good, smart. Let's go home.
We drink probiotics, okay?

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,430
Here, the relationship between citizens
and the security guard is also very warm.

58
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:04,468
Damn. Is he crazy?
Is this to be eaten or thrown away?

59
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,074
And most importantly, the people here
care deeply about each other.

60
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,140
Pretending to be stylish, even though her husband
cheater.

61
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:16,969
Only the outside looks luxurious,
but the inside is rotten.

62
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,076
Rotten? What does that mean?

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,596
Just pretend not to know.

64
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,236
Anyway, they are good people.
It's great to move here.

65
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,228
Yes. Hope you enjoy it.

66
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,910
Why is the weather like this?

67
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,410
Wow, that's surprising.

68
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,009
Excuse me.
Yes.

69
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,156
Sorry. Please speed it up a bit, okay?

70
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,730
Why did it suddenly become cloudy like this?

71
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,156
Lightning too, wow…

72
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:47,362

EPISODE 1
GWANGSEON JUGONG BLOCK 3

74
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,904
One, two. Let's pick it up.

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,001
Yes, I think so.
just install it like that.

76
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:14,700
Ma'am, we're done.

77
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:17,449
For settlement, do you want to?
using card or cash?

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,800
Cash only. But, it seems
The corner of this table is a little bumped, huh.

79
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:25,460
Ah, that? It was like that from the start, Ma'am.

80
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:28,112
Mom may not realize it.
Oh, really?

81
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,380
There's a picture. It was smooth before, right?

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,956
And I also asked for extra...

83
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,594
...to wrap one by one
cutlery with bubble wrap,

84
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:39,980
Good grief.
But look at this. Well, it's cracked, right?

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,276
We have already packed the others
one by one with bubble wrap,

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,229
but it seems like this one is just missing.

87
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,636
And what is currently happening
you cover it with your hand,

88
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,196
flower pot behind it
when it was brought in it fell,

89
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,140
and the base seems to be broken.

90
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,756
Oh, that…
Yes, that one.

91
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,260
Who brought this?
carelessly like that?

92
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,516
I've said it many times...

93
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,980
...to be extra careful
with breakable items, right?

94
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,556
Sir…
Yes, ma'am?

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,845
You brought it yourself.

96
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:09,212
I brought it?
Yes.

97
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:10,836
But ma'am, it's like this.

98
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:13,916
Actually this much stuff
should be transported by two 2.5 ton trucks,

99
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,436
but we have tried to make it fit
in one truck 1 ton as estimated.

100
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,636
So, maybe it can be a little understandable?
Oh, I want that too.

101
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,956
But you guys were 20 minutes late, right?

102
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,316
Even though your ad says,
'If late, compensation 100,000.'.

103
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,280
This. It's here, right?

104
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,315
COMPENSATION 100,000 WON
IF THERE IS A DELAY

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,095
Even your boss emphasized it once
to me to be punctual and professional.

106
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,436
Wait. I'll look for the SMS first.
Okay, ma'am.

107
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,500
I will make a big decision today.

108
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,300
We will cut 50,000
from settlement and additional costs.

109
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,415
Wait a moment.
Yes.

110
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,916
If you give me the account number,
I'll transfer 50,000 later, okay?

111
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,420
Oh, no need, sir. Really.

112
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,725
Where?
Oh, thank you.

113
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:07,791
Okay.

114
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:15,420
The mother in this house is really tough, huh.

115
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,100
Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you. We'll take our leave now.

116
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,260
Thank You.

117
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:23,582
Be careful on the way, ok.
Thank You.

118
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,420
Yes thank you.

119
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,340
You think you're rich?
You think you're Elon Musk?

120
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,476
Face masks are stingy even for the wife,
but pretending to be a good person.

121
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,276
Today is a happy day.

122
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,420
Only 50,000.
After all, they have worked hard.

123
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:44,344
Hard work?

124
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:48,372
The person who suffers the most
in this world is me...

125
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,260
...who must live
with someone like you.

126
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,615
Come on, hurry up, lift the bookshelf over there.
Okay ma'am.

127
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,060
Oh, these people.
Just left alone.

128
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:04,889
Back again apparently?

129
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,060
Seung-ho! We're coming.

130
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,917
That's Mom.
Older brother.

131
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,660
Wow, they came too.

132
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,790
Why did they come on moving day?

133
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:28,518
Do you know which man that is?
The 134th.

134
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,260
Geez.
Then I said to him,

135
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,909
Brother, are you sure you can face me?

136
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,076
Oh, it's hot. Oh my.

137
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,260
And he said, 'I'm ready.'
But I left right away.

138
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:49,356
Don't let it burn!

139
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,020
Oh my gosh, that needs to be turned off.
Must be lifted!

140
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:56,413
I swear!
Oh…

141
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:57,917
My wife, won't you sit with me?

142
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:00,119
At least,
help fry the jeon.

143
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,836
Oh Amitabha,
Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

144
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,836
Is that all?

145
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,076
Loving Lord Jesus, please
grant peace to this family.

146
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,489
Amen.
Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

147
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,049
Is that really all there is to it?

148
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,716
God of Heaven and Earth, please just allow
good energy entering my sister's house.

149
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,996
Hey, Park Soo-ji, let it go.
You are really…

150
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,340
Why was it released?
Enough with Buddha and God.

151
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:20,401
Quickly take it off.

152
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,236
Evil spirit, begone.
Ouch. Quickly let everything go.

153
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,676
Oh, my goodness.
No one can keep his mouth shut.

154
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,796
This is your brother.

155
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,136
He said it would make the bad aura go away
and good luck comes into this house.

156
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:33,780
Look how sincere he is.
Is that so? Thank you, Park Soo-ji.

157
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:38,116
Oh, your son is really
have worked hard.

158
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,716
In difficult times like these,
still be able to buy a house.

159
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,916
From now on,
Do you come here often?

160
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,836
There are three rooms,
so you can stay overnight.

161
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,961
How about it? Want to stay the night?
May also.

162
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:48,076
Yes, agreed.
Yes.

163
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,636
Let's have a drink and stay overnight.
Seriously.

164
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,116
Let's cheers. Mi-ri, come here quickly.
We drink together.

165
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,796
Yes. I'll be there soon.

166
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,516
Come on, let's just get started.
That's right.

167
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
Yes.
Okay.

168
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,876
For Seung-ho who finally
managed to buy a house in Seoul.

169
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,836
Cheers.
Cheers.

170
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Thank You.
I will live happily.

171
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,116
I heard the price of this house
below market price.

172
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,356
You're in big bucks, huh?

173
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,876
He said it was for sale because
emergency state?

174
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,450
Not just a quick sale,
but it's an emergency sale.

175
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,596
Usually there is something unnatural.

176
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,020
Maybe this is the house
former house of the deceased?

177
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:19,196
Oh my. At your sister's moving party,
you talk like that?

178
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,380
How do you know…

179
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,160
Ouch.

180
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:24,036
Why?
I'm stressed because of you.

181
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Ouch…

182
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:27,036
Oh, I'm going to the bathroom.

183
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,836
Look, he's scared.
He's always been a coward, hasn't he?

184
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,060
Probably because
His wife's cooking was too salty.

185
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,769
Is my child's bowel disease getting worse?

186
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,036
His wife's cooking is salty?

187
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,700
From past to present,
it feels so bad.

188
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,380
But that's indeed his ability.

189
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,300
Oh my, this house needs a complete renovation.
The structure is very narrow.

190
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,796
Because it's an old house, huh? It seems so.
at most only 66 square meters.

191
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,703
The furniture arrangement is very unique.

192
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:57,927
The interior feels
a bit outdated.

193
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,780
Bro, does your wife like retro style?

194
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:03,215
No.

195
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,422
Wow, that looks delicious.

196
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,596
There are not many,
but please enjoy.

197
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,436
No, this is more than enough.

198
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,020
But Mi-ri, what kind of soup is this?
Crab soup.

199
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:21,476
Where is the crab?
Try searching again.

200
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,871
When I make crab soup,
but no crab?

201
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,500
Seriously, where are the crabs?

202
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,534
Did I smooth it too much…

203
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,956
Mother's teeth are not good anymore.

204
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,666
I'm afraid my teeth will fall out if
chewing, so I crushed it all at once.

205
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:40,029
That's good.

206
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,260
Sis, no galbi or bulgogi?

207
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,876
You know yourself, me and mother
both like meat.

208
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,435
Soo-ji.
Please understand. His name just moved.

209
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,955
This even goes into the piggy bank
We dismantled Hyun-ji's house completely.

210
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,526
That's why my son uses it
clothes with a collar that stretches like that.

211
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,780
Oh, Mom. This is a T-shirt full of history.

212
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,112
Right, honey?

213
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:09,082
BE THE REDS!

214
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,664
NINETEEN YEARS AGO

215
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:17,048
South Korea is great!
South Korea is great!

216
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,916
Dry snacks. Enjoy.

217
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,796
This is very dangerous. Dangerous.

218
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,396
Damn. Seriously.
Goal!

219
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,116
France scored first.

220
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,860
Why damage things?
If it's damaged, do you want compensation?

221
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,500
It sucks.

222
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,441
Oh, what else can I do?
We lost, can't you be angry?

223
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:34,540
You support France?

224
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:36,763
What are you doing? Such a mediocre face
instead of talking a lot?

225
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:38,716
The color of your poop is like a rainbow.

226
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Oh my, that's so annoying.
Yes.

227
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:44,630
Rainbow Pup Power! What do you want?

228
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,515
You're so rude…
You are also rude.

229
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,636
What's so rude?

230
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,196
And now Park Ji-sung enters.

231
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,636
Kick… Goal!

232
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,396
The equalizer.

233
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,836
A great goal from Park Ji-sung.

234
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,116
As expected from Park Ji-sung.

235
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,740
Red Devils call on South Korea…

236
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,876
South Korea is great!
South Korea is great!

237
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,036
The current situation is really hot!

238
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,775
Wow, your body is really nice, huh?

239
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,434
I am a former swimming athlete.

240
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,716
Lee Chun-soo. With the right foot.

241
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Kick… Goal!

242
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,801
Goal!

243
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:51,881
Goal!

244
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:56,234
Thanks to Lee Chun-soo, South Korea
managed to conquer France.

245
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,020
South Korea is great!
South Korea is great!

246
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,162
South Korea is great!
South Korea is great!

247
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,455
South Korea is great!
South Korea is great!

248
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,722
Just looking at the dish, you can tell.

249
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,793
My son's body used to be good,
now why are you so weak?

250
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:25,316
Mom, your child has been with you for a long time.
it is indeed weak inside.

251
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,236
When you are looking for a house
for newlyweds,

252
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,271
don't forget if they arrive
drain your savings.

253
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:33,916
The words that have been said
I've heard for 15 years.

254
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,783
If you forget, you are not human.

255
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,917
Get ready to go to hell, Mi-ri.

256
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,836
My brother is really pitiful.

257
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,946
You don't get any benefit
from your wife's family and your own wife.

258
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,060
His child is still small,
not yet able to serve.

259
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:48,369
Hey.
No.

260
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,564
When your family goes bankrupt
and have no money, we help.

261
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,180
Hey.

262
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,540
Ouch.
Are the crabs cooked enough?

263
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:02,963
Yes, if the crab is overcooked,
will be tough.

264
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:04,329
I mean, hard…

265
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,403
Why did you get married?
with such a fierce woman,

266
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:09,436
until we have to feel
not feeling good like this?

267
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,660
Why can't I eat?
just calmly for once?

268
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,069
Don't say that.

269
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,798
If it wasn't for Mi-ri,
we won't be able to buy this house.

270
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:17,596
You know, don't you?

271
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:20,666
Once we bought it, the price of this house
immediately increased by 100 million won.

272
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,700
It's not just your house that's going up,
all also go up.

273
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,660
Sis, that's what you call gaslighting .
No.

274
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,076
Are you happy now?
Yes.

275
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,350
Well, you've been gaslighted .

276
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,620
Mom, there's no meat here either.
This is just odeng. And this is pollock fish.

277
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:38,620
Do you know you're being gaslighted ?
Bro, come on.

278
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,436
I can only surrender
being gaslighted like that.

279
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,780
Where are you going?

280
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,652
Older brother?
Darling.

281
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,824
Was there a fire?

282
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
What's this?
What's this?

283
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,982
It's not a toy.

284
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:28,060
What are you doing? Why are you standing?
while holding a fire extinguisher?

285
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,482
Because I have difficulty digesting food,
So I exercise like this.

286
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:39,318
He's been exercising a lot lately.
Oh, this is still not enough.

287
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,700
I also bought some fruit,
so it can help digestion too.

288
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,322
Oh, Gong Mi-ri.
You give in too much.

289
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,780

After eating, he immediately left.

302

303
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:47,980
Is this really baby food?

304
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,080
Bigger.

I'm a senior housewife, you know!

If you sell food, you have to be generous.

308
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,556
It has to make customers think,
'Doesn't this make them lose out?'

309
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,904
Only then, people were moved.

310
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,860
This is just right,
so that the meat juice comes out.

311
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,596
Just taste the deliciousness of the meat.

312
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,436

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,436

Good.

330
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,076
Is this really pollock?

331
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,649
Her eyes are blurry like this,
means this is frozen fish.

332
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,796
This was frozen, then thawed.

333
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,876
This is fresh pollock fish.

334
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:09,820
Pollock in Gwangseon
Supermarkets are fresher.

335
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,130

Oh, Ji-hyun.

338
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,916
You left your shop,
then come here for promotion?

339
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,116
You could be sued later.

340
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,487
Why should it be sued?

341
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,105
Am I lying?

342
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:31,085
If so, at least hide it.
your character's shopping plastic.

343
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,156
Good grief.

344
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,802
Have you finished delivering the previous one?

345
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,876
Yes. Where to next?
Block 203, unit 204?

346
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,196
Yes. But be careful, okay?
Don't get injured.

347
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,859
This is easy. I'm not
a day or two by motorbike.

348
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,200
I'll go first.
Let's have lunch together later, okay?

349
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,255
All the girls stay here,
man out.

350
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,340
Fast!

351
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,011
Get out quickly, everyone!

352
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,207
Quick, get out everyone!

353
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:39,876
Mrs. glasses,
if you move just a little bit,

354
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,770
your head is the next target.

355
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:42,831
Yes.

356
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:44,058
You!

357
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,141
Lock the automatic doors and lower the curtains.

358
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:47,814
Fast!

359
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,940
Everyone, gather here.
Now!

360
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:55,534
Come on, quickly.

361
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:59,088
What is this?
How about this?

362
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,476
There must be one person here
who knows why i did this.

363
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,860
If he confesses,
others will be saved.

364
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:15,757
Otherwise, everyone will die.

365
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,740
This is a love affair.

366
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,948
Romance? Infidelity, you mean?
Yes.

367
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,940
Hey, if you don't want to sacrifice
innocent people,

368
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,203
better move forward now.

369
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,825
Hurry up, who is it?
Just get out.

370
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,270
Who slept with Kim Dong-seok,
get out right now.

371
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,980
Honey, it's me. Don't shoot.

372
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:46,220
Honey, what is this?

373
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,516
Sorry, everyone.
I'm the store manager here.

374
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,676
My wife is having serious delusions
and overcome with jealousy.

375
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,807
I will calm him down…
What? Calming?

376
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,815
You're a jerk at home.

377
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:02,716
You cheated, now you pretend
be a good husband?

378
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,820
Honey, I'm not cheating.

379
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:08,990
Where did you hear that from?
It was all just a misunderstanding.

380
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,476
Ladies, I'm sorry.
My wife is indeed unstable.

381
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,236
He calls me dozens of times a day
until I can't work.

382
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,605
Just look at her shoes.
Look at that.

383
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:19,929
Those are sandals and shoes!
Yeah, look!

384
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,196
Maybe he really is sick.
Oh, it's getting more complicated.

385
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,220
Honey, let's talk.
Put down your weapon first, okay?

386
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,556
Are you still trying to dodge?

387
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:33,852
I saw you cheating
with my own eyes.

388
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:37,164
You came here after from
Gwangseon Motel with him.

389
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:39,493
Gwangseon Motel?
Wow, really cheating, huh?

390
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:41,460
It's really bad.
You are crazy.

391
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,929
Oh my, do you not exercise enough?
Why is my thigh cramping like this?

392
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,996
What a jerk.

393
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,276
I have installed a tracker
in your car.

394
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,020
It doesn't feel satisfying, right?

395
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,956
I know you're at that motel.
at lunch time.

396
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,604
I followed you from there.

397
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:01,895
That is not me.
Can you still say it?

398
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,514
It's really not me.

399
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:07,676
Son of a bitch.
You still insist on lying?

400
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,020
Come on, just die.

401
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,460
Don't shoot. Don't…

402
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,436
Code Zero. Code Zero.

403
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,396
Armed incident at Wonderful Home Mart,
Road 85, Gwangsan Intersection.

404
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,036
Request immediate assistance.

405
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,796
This is Korea, not America,
but there was a shootout?

406
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,747
Wonderful Home Mart is
in your area, right?

407
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:36,235
Come on, quickly.

408
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:45,199
What is this? Who threw it?

409
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:48,632
You? Who? You, huh?

410
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:51,683
It was me. I threw it.
Who are you really? Do you want to die?

411
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:55,538
Even if you want to kill,
look for the evidence first. Evidence.

412
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,069
Only then, finish him off.

413
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,327
Correct.
Yes, that's right.

414
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:05,396
You're an ex-cop. Come on, do something.

415
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,925
The weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's real.

416
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,073
Didn't you say before?
can catch flying bullets?

417
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:14,386
That's a gun. This is a rifle.
Those old ladies over there, be quiet!

418
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:16,156
Proof? Who doesn't know?

419
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:19,836
But if he keeps dodging, what then?
can i know who the affair is?

420
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,036
Wait. Calm down.

421
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:26,507
Hey, why are you wearing so much makeup?
to the supermarket? Your skirt is so short.

422
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:30,725
I failed at dating. I just want to
shopping, then drinking alone at home.

423
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,876
I'm so sad,
don't be insulted even more.

424
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,780
How dare you grumble
in front of me?

425
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,356
Excuse me.

426
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,323
If this is how it is, we all
could be trapped until night.

427
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,413
Here's how?
Who was that?

428
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:46,335
You?

429
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:53,824
If I help you find it
his mistress,

430
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:55,900
can you stop?
What?

431
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:58,756
I mean, if you
kill your husband now,

432
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,556
his affair will never be revealed.

433
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,423
Wouldn't it make more sense to find
him first, then take revenge?

434
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:06,923
That makes sense.
Yes that's correct.

435
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:08,220
Crazy, cool too.

436
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,232
Listen to him.
Find out first.

437
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,300
If you lie.
You're the first to die.

438
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:26,580
Oh, that kid said
just went to buy fruit,

439
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,076
but why don't you go home?

440
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,116
Mom, it will be soon.
He's coming. Be patient, okay?

441
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,956
Now it's time to eat fruit,
but he is totally unreasonable.

442
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,156
Just doesn't make sense?
He is also insensitive.

443
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,556
It's insensitive sometimes
make life more peaceful.

444
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:40,980
Just look at our brother-in-law.

445
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,402
How cruel to leave
husband's family is like this.

446
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:46,075
There may be no one else
in this world who lives as peacefully as him,

447
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,436
without regard for others.

448
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,116
Why is he taking so long?

449
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,916
Brother, I didn't want to say it at first,

450
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,609
but because we are
talking about brother in law…

451
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,820
Yes, Park Soo-ji.

452
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:57,300
If you hesitate to speak,
better not talk.

453
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,796
And again, don't just sit around.
Stand up and help clean up.

454
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,436
Do not take it wrong.
I'm not sitting because I'm lazy.

455
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,450
We are waiting for the fruit,
that's why it hasn't been sorted out yet.

456
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,196
We thought he was buying fruit,
so we patiently wait for it.

457
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,780
Okay, I'll just call him.

458
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,153
Hey, what's that? What's that sound?

459
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:15,214
Excuse me.

460
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,180
This is my husband.
Can I pick up for a moment?

461
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,243
Unlucky.

462
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,402
Just pick it up.
Thank You.

463
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,436
Hello.

464
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,549
Honey, I miss you so much.
I feel like dying waiting for you.

465
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,660
Really?

466
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,076
Me too. I feel like
really going to die now.

467
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,636
What? What are you talking about? Where are you?

468
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,352
Why haven't you come home yet?
Give it to me.

469
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:44,152
My mother-in-law. Mom.
Ma'am, press this to make it louder.

470
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,676
Sorry. Sorry everyone.

471
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,636
Kid, where are you? What are you doing
Haven't come home yet? Come home quickly!

472
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,860
Sorry, ma'am. I can't go home now.
What? Can't go home?

473
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,330
No. Mom, give it to me.

474
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,120
Even though I don't know your reasons,

475
00:26:57,171 --> 00:27:01,296
but if mother in law speaks,
should have just said 'yes'.

476
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:02,770
Yes.

477
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,925
Mi-ri, what's that tone of voice?
Want to say, "Take it and get out of here?"

478
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,556
Bro, you are underestimating me.
your mother and all your sisters-in-law, okay?

479
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,620
Come on, be self-aware.

480
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:14,116
Before I realized it, I thought I was
have to save my life first.

481
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,996
What? You're going against your parents now?
Don't know manners?

482
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,956
If I had known this, maybe I would have
should have written a will earlier.

483
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,415
I think I will…

484
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,356
Hey, stop playing with words.
Find that girl right now.

485
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,816
Yes, good.

486
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:38,601
Good work.

487
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,036
How many hostages are inside?

488
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,556
If you count employees and customers,
looks like more than ten people.

489
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,716
Except for one person, all were women.

490
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,116
Is the identity of the perpetrator known?

491
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:50,076
Choi Yang-hee, woman in her 40s
who live in this neighborhood.

492
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,820
Hey, make sure
the identity of the perpetrator was not disclosed.

493
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:56,308
Do not allow civilians, especially
journalists, approaching within a radius of 50 meters.

494
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,589
Fellow civilians.
Please step back, everyone.

495
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,420
You said you were chasing your husband, right?

496
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,940
Are they in?
through a special employee route?

497
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:05,999
Yes, right.

498
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,701
ONE HOUR AGO

499
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:25,020
So, your husband's mistress
is a female employee in this shop.

500
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,356
People who won't be suspicious
when greeting coworkers...

501
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,390
...and enter through
employee only door.

502
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,796
That is true.

503
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,500
Hey. All the female employees left.
Forward, move forward quickly.

504
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,011
Honey, please stop.
I am completely innocent.

505
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:43,109
Wait a minute.

506
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,956
Who? You? You? You? You?

507
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,498
Please, I'm really not the culprit.

508
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:54,076
I just got married two weeks ago.

509
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,116
You?
I live a celibate life without marriage.

510
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,310
It's really not me.

511
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,820
You?
I'm engaged.

512
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,156
You?
Not me, really not.

513
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,756
Is that so? Then everyone must die.
You all have to die.

514
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,916
Wait. Stop. This is crazy.

515
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,356
Think about Jae-hoon first.

516
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,796
Hey, don't mention our child's name.
with your dirty mouth.

517
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,394
You have the heart to cheat
and now talking about Jae-hoon?

518
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:23,981
FIVE DAYS AGO

519
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:26,803
Jae-hoon, Dad will be waiting there, okay?

520
00:29:26,854 --> 00:29:28,916
Grip and enjoy the game.
Yes, Dad.

521
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,220
Okay, keep your spirits up, okay?
Everyone, have fun.

522
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:33,393
Yes. Dad is here.

523
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,740
Father.

524
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:11,900
Father.

525
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,950
Father.

526
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,070
Father.

527
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,790
Father.

528
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,030
Father.

529
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:21,407
Father.

530
00:30:29,405 --> 00:30:31,700
My child…

531
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,740
Oh, how come?

532
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:41,540
Mom, Dad left me.

533
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:43,729
No. It's not like that.

534
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,500
Dad can't possibly leave you,
Jae-hoon. No way.

535
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,460
You just left your child
and having an affair with another woman?

536
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,180
Are you still worthy of being called a father?

537
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,796
Oh my, what a big-time bastard.

538
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,876
The trash of society that even
Even dogs are reluctant to bite.

539
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,716
And he claims to be a father.

540
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,820
How could you leave your child?

541
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,796
What a jerk.
He is not human.

542
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,996
He's such a jerk.

543
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,507
You bastard. Come to your senses.

544
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,035
Get down! Get down everyone!

545
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,298
Everybody, don't move!

546
00:31:20,353 --> 00:31:23,705
If he has to die,
let me kill him!

547
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:28,853
Who is that bitch?
Get out! I said get out!

548
00:31:28,904 --> 00:31:31,447
Hey, why don't you come out too?

549
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:34,954
I?

550
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:38,608
Whether you are celibate or whatever,
I saw something earlier, you know!

551
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,501
He gave Bacchus
into the man's hand on the snack shelf.

552
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:47,743
He did it secretly too,
while throwing a sweet smile!

553
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:49,796
What?
Secretly?

554
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,060
Why is he like that?

555
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:52,244
That's because...

556
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,879
...next week there will be an evaluation
contract extension.

557
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:57,204
I just want to secure my position.

558
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,500
If not for that, why would I
approaching a married man?

559
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,707
Manager…
No wonder.

560
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:07,399
Suddenly you are not helping
hand out flyers again.

561
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,185
You're looking for points on your own, huh?

562
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:11,747
I didn't expect it at first,
but this is too much!

563
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:12,907
Everyone shut up!

564
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:16,321
I just want to kill you,
so you guys don't make a fuss?

565
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:23,903
There is only one woman who cheats,

566
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:26,567
but you want to kill
innocent person?

567
00:32:26,618 --> 00:32:28,980
Then what should I do?
I know!

568
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,468
I think I know who...

569
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:34,916
...his mistress.

570
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,218
Who? Where is he?

571
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,014
His mistress…

572
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,110
Not me.

573
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:53,705
…it's him!

574
00:32:59,158 --> 00:33:00,598
Mom, I'm home.

575
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:03,819
Grandma, Aunts, good afternoon.

576
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,836
But where is Mom?
Mother went to the supermarket to buy fruit.

577
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,537
Whether to buy fruit
or even plant fruit there.

578
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,848
Which room is mine?
That one. It's over there.

579
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,916
Attention, this is an announcement
from the management office.

580
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,036
There has been a hostage taking
in front of the apartment,

581
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,756
precisely at Wonderful Home Mart.

582
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,796
For residents who have families
the one in the supermarket...

583
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,036
...or can't be contacted yet,

584
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,029
please check immediately.

585
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,396
Dad. Don't tell me,
Mom was at the supermarket too?

586
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,436
Oh no!
Oh my, Mi-ri is there.

587
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,996
My wife!
How is this? What should we do?

588
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,380
What else? Of course.
we have to help him.

589
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,156
Not me. What the heck? Any proof?

590
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,700
What are you doing? Why are you accusing me?
random people like that?

591
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,649
Are you sure?

592
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,903
When your gun is pointed
to other women, he kept quiet.

593
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:02,130
But when directed at the woman,
he immediately stepped forward and protected her.

594
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:05,529
Is that so? Then everyone must die.
You all have to die.

595
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:09,690
Wait. Stop. This is crazy.

596
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,291
Think about Jae-hoon first.

597
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,520
What are you talking about?
I never did that.

598
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:19,440
It's not me. I really am.
not the person.

599
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,396
Can I borrow your phone for a moment?

600
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,860
Why should I give
my phone to you?

601
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,826
Shut up. Just do it.

602
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:33,568
This.

603
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:38,113
I have nothing to hide.
Please check everything.

604
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:38,980
Yes.

605
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:43,787
Just look. On my IG, there is not a single one.
photo of a man. That's the proof.

606
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,940
UPDATE 11 SEPTEMBER 2024

607
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,891
A GLASS OF WINE
SEPTEMBER 11, 2024

608
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:10,127
CHRISTMAS SONG 1988

609
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:15,197
CHRISTMAS SONG 1988

610
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:19,660
Excuse me, is it really your birthday?
your husband September 11, 1975?

611
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:20,620
Correct.

612
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:24,196
Why do you know?
my husband's birthday?

613
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,009
Your birthday is December 25, 1988, right?

614
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,516
What are you talking about?

615
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,648
Yeah, right? We were at that time.
having a Christmas party together. Remember?

616
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,020
Show your ID card. Right now.

617
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,116
Show me quickly.
Come on, show me.

618
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,502
You said you weren't having an affair.
Where is the proof?

619
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:41,722
Just give it.
Yes.

620
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:47,740
Oh my. That's right.

621
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,116
How do you know?

622
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,319
Usually in illicit relationships, they
like to put meaning into gifts…

623
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,729
Excuse me.

624
00:35:54,846 --> 00:35:56,121
I mean,

625
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:59,628
usually people insert
the meaning of the year of birth into the gift.

626
00:35:59,653 --> 00:36:04,610
Like the wine of 1975,
1988 vinyl release.

627
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:09,360
That is true.
Makes sense.

628
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:10,782
Crazy, this is true!

629
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,169
Geez.
It turns out to be him.

630
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,311
No. It's all just a coincidence.

631
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:17,241
So what about this photo?

632
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,156
That's for the diet. I'm on it.
prepare body profile.

633
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,740
Really? But you're not alone, right?

634
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,134
I was alone at that time. I swear!
I do not think so.

635
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:44,434
Looks like that's the store manager.
True, although it's a bit vague.

636
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:47,505
That's very clear.
Even though it's blurry, it's still visible.

637
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:50,340
That bastard.

638
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,940
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

639
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,000
Where is the clear evidence?

640
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:57,836
Ma'am, this is too much.

641
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,901
This is an invasion of privacy.
I will sue you.

642
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,214
Shut up!

643
00:37:02,495 --> 00:37:05,620
Wow, it's this clear,
still insisting, huh?

644
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,596
In that case, I give
more convincing evidence.

645
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,602
What's that?
What other evidence?

646
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:16,700
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee, this is the police.

647
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:22,076
We don't know what you want yet,
but we'll be getting inside soon.

648
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,436
Come talk to us first.

649
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,940
Please save me…

650
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Yes, we will save you.
Don't worry.

651
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,516
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee.
Please talk to us first.

652
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,996
What the heck is this? The hostages are not safe yet,
why did he just talk like that?

653
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,214
What are you waiting for?
Quickly stop him.

654
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,516
My husband,
I am in the supermarket.

655
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,476
Don't go in yet.
The situation is not safe yet. Wait a minute.

656
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,356
Wait a minute? Oh my. Why is he
not at home, instead here?

657
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,101
Still feels like a policeman apparently.

658
00:37:54,747 --> 00:37:55,757
There they are.

659
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:04,460
Here!

660
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,166
We received a request for assistance.

661
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,526
Don't waste any more time.
We will start the ambush operation.

662
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,300
Wait a moment!

663
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:12,460
Isn't it better to listen?
the hostage taker's motives and demands,

664
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:14,129
then try to negotiate first?

665
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:15,646
If we keep delaying,

666
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:19,518
then there are those who are shot or killed,
that would be a big problem.

667
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:23,596
We will start
by placing snipers.

668
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,126
Sniper?
Start placing snipers.

669
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:28,851
Okay. Prioritize the position with
clear view into the supermarket.

670
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,116
Then, I'll buy some time...

671
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,356
...in front of the main door of the supermarket
to negotiate.

672
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,114
Meanwhile, you guys get ready to go in.

673
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,762
Okay.
Yes.

674
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,060
Team one to the staff line,
Team two check the back door. Go!

675
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,196
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee.

676
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,476
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee,
do you hear me?

677
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,312
Nowadays, holding hostages and threatening people
with a weapon is a criminal act.

678
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:54,767
I will go in alone.

679
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,756
Come in, you say?
Oh my, that emotional man.

680
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,236
Once again I beg you,
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee.

681
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,630
This situation is very
dangerous for you too.

682
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:06,316
Please, just open the door of your heart a little bit.
and talk to us.

683
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,350
Mrs. Choi?

684
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:11,340
Stop calling my name.

685
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,682
I will kill him with my own hands
alone before the police pulled him out.

686
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,768
Wait!

687
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:26,533
Before being arrested, we should at least
find out about the affair first so you can feel relieved, right?

688
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:31,435
Yang-hee, put down the gun.
We almost found it.

689
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,211
Right. We beat up the mistress first.

690
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:40,972
That's right. I'll try.
hold the situation here.

691
00:39:41,023 --> 00:39:42,950
Correct.
Hold on a minute.

692
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:44,593
Yes.
They are right.

693
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:46,717
Good.

694
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:11,420
In a situation like this,
why is there applause?

695
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:24,994
One two three.

696
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,503
One more time. One, two, three.

697
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,356
Whether they hold the wall
from within or how.

698
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,134
He really knows how to stall for time.

699
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,196
He said you saw them come out
from the motel together, huh?

700
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,436
Yes. I've told you many times.
Wait a moment.

701
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:44,404
What?

702
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,156
What are you doing?

703
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,996
Your shampoos smell the same.
Something like...

704
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,310
...White Rose aroma
which is usually smelled from motels.

705
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:57,380
White Rose?

706
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,418
Wow, that must be Love Me Motel.

707
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:03,287
LOVE ME MOTEL

708
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:06,769
BATH SOAP AND SHAMPOO
WHITE ROSE

709
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,830
No.

710
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:12,396
I saw that bastard come out
from Gwangseon with my own eyes.

711
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,337
Yes, Love Me Motel and Gwangseon
using the same parking space.

712
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,929
I often go around delivering
food in this area, so you know.

713
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:25,774
Your husband's car, license plate number 3883
black sedan, right?

714
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,820
Yes, right.

715
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:32,124
No wonder. I do it very often.
see that car there.

716
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:38,143
Wow, it's him.
She's his mistress.

717
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,893
How embarrassing.
No shame.

718
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,459
So it's you.

719
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,996
Madam, it's really not me.

720
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,268
I'm not lacking to the point of having to
having an affair with a married man, right?

721
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,815
How can you prove it?
if I was the one who left the motel?

722
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,643
I wanted to keep quiet for the sake of politeness,

723
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,508
but now, i can't stay silent.

724
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,329
How can you prove it?
if I was the one who left the motel?

725
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,198
I wanted to keep quiet for the sake of politeness,

726
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:09,087
but now,
I can't stay silent.

727
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,060
Look at this.

728
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:21,046
Two hours ago, there was a transaction
between users...

729
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,380
...BeautyfulGirl and WonderfulMan
at Wonderful Home Mart.

730
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:28,638
Oh, so WonderfulMan is here.

731
00:42:30,332 --> 00:42:31,422
Got it!

732
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:33,636
It's him?
Wow, he…

733
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,980
Unexpected.

734
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:47,349
At first I thought, is it true?
second hand goods transaction that happy?

735
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:50,212
But why
the manager of a supermarket this big...

736
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:54,005
...surrounding all the aisles
while opening your Hongdang application?

737
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:57,532
Can you meet now?
I'm going to the fruit area, okay?

738
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,575
The comments seem normal,
hidden neatly.

739
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,460
But still.

740
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:07,540
Selling someone's husband as if it were used goods?

741
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,674
Especially during working hours?
Now it's a new trend, huh?

742
00:43:24,217 --> 00:43:27,076
Two days ago, the transaction
at BeautyfulGirl's apartment.

743
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:30,836
This morning's transaction at Gwangsan-dong 66.

744
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,806
That's the location of Gwangseon Motel, right?

745
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:33,903
Good grief.

746
00:43:33,954 --> 00:43:37,740
Tonight, transaction plan
in parking lot B3.

747
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,653
This weekend, a trip to Yangpyeong
for “remote donation.” Great, right?

748
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:42,714
Geez…

749
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:44,348
Wow, crazy. He's a buying and selling maniac.

750
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,836
There were 98 transactions with the same person.

751
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,294
Trust score 72.

752
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,956
I have never seen
that high.

753
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:57,292
Crazy, people like you,
Even if it's given for free, I don't want it.

754
00:43:57,378 --> 00:43:58,910
You guys!

755
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:01,011
You guys!
Ouch…

756
00:44:01,062 --> 00:44:02,816
Beat him up!
Teach him a lesson!

757
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:11,223
There. My wife is inside.
What is this actually about?

758
00:44:11,786 --> 00:44:12,849
What is going on over there?
Let us in!

759
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,500
Older brother!
Let me in!

760
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:16,603
Mother!

761
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,340
Honey, I'm really guilty.

762
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,676
Please, please forgive me.

763
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,084
Please save my life.
Forgive me.

764
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,710
Please forgive me.
The manager asked me to wait.

765
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:35,860
He said you guys are getting a divorce.

766
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:37,170
What?
Wow…

767
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:41,922
What? Hey, when did I say that?
Don't just talk.

768
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,580
Oh, you bastard.

769
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,701
I regret having
spend my life with you.

770
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,466
Just die!

771
00:44:51,517 --> 00:44:52,806
Help…

772
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,642
Where are you going?

773
00:44:56,658 --> 00:44:57,689
Help…

774
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,340
My wife!

775
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,383
Mi-ri!

776
00:45:13,398 --> 00:45:14,422
Get down!

777
00:45:14,473 --> 00:45:18,226
Get down!
Do not move!

778
00:45:18,277 --> 00:45:20,169
Do not move!
Remain still!

779
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,796
Choi Yang-hee, lower the weapon.

780
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,340
It is all over.
Quickly put down the weapon.

781
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,293
Take it down, Ms. Yang-hee.

782
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,436
Wait. Cease fire.
Everyone, cease fire.

783
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,109
What are you doing?
Don't.

784
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:36,064
Do not do it!
Don't…

785
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:38,607
What do I live for?

786
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:41,780
It is all over.

787
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:44,729
My son, Jae-hoon,

788
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:49,962
will live...

789
00:45:51,706 --> 00:45:54,085
...as the son of a criminal.

790
00:45:56,739 --> 00:46:00,496
His father was having an affair, his mother was a hostage taker.

791
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,838
I can't even
be a good parent.

792
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:14,821
My son does not deserve to carry this burden.

793
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:22,564
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry.

794
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,444
Do not do it!
Stop!

795
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:27,397
Don't, ma'am!
Stop!

796
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:28,458
Don't…
Put it down.

797
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:33,116
Your husband is wrong,
why did you have to die?

798
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,716
Mama Jae-hoon, please think about Jae-hoon.

799
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:38,793
Please, don't do that.

800
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,180
Catch him.

801
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,230
Finally free…
I'm grateful!

802
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:18,230
I'm here!
Come here!

803
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:21,429
Come here…
Here, honey.

804
00:47:24,038 --> 00:47:27,396
Wait. This is your phone, it fell earlier.

805
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,836
Looks like the message was sent.

806
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,149
What's this?

807
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,100
ONE BILLION WON

808
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,530
Get him. There are people injured?

809
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:37,597
FIVE MINUTES EARLIER

810
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,926
Weapons. Take the weapons first.

811
00:47:44,582 --> 00:47:48,689
Hey, you. Move quickly.
Are you a cop or what?

812
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,566
How to unlock the phone?

813
00:47:51,617 --> 00:47:54,152
This.
He uses the face unlock feature.

814
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,076
Get everything done!
Able to?

815
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,440
Oh, it's you,

816
00:47:57,659 --> 00:47:59,472
You're already the chairman, huh?
Yes, to be the chairman, ma'am!

817
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,057
Password… What is it?

818
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,354
What was the birth date of the home wrecker ?

819
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:08,645
December 25, 1988.

820
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:14,082
Geez.
Son of a bitch.

821
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:16,825
His wife lives a hard life,

822
00:48:18,643 --> 00:48:23,556
while she was shopping
luxury goods for his mistress.

823
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,035
Have one billion won,

824
00:48:25,086 --> 00:48:30,234
but only to support
his wife 300 thousand per month?

825
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:33,020
Just send them all.

826
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,156
Here it is, 04-750.

827
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,476
16, huh?

828
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,100
2547.

829
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,276
TRANSFER SUCCESSFUL

830
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,540
Yes!
Wow!

831
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:47,034
We will confiscate it as evidence.
How could that be?

832
00:48:47,573 --> 00:48:50,393
Money in your husband's account
I have moved it.

833
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,156
This world is cruel. At least,
we must have insurance.

834
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,836
Now the account is empty.
Completely empty.

835
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,060
Thank You.

836
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,354
Trash must be thrown in the trash.

837
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,076
It is impossible to collect it back
to be used again, right?

838
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,276
Make amends for your mistakes
and rise again with determination.

839
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,690
That is true revenge.

840
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,140
Think about your son, okay?

841
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:21,821
Brother, when are you coming out?

842
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,356
Father.

843
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,420
Darling.

844
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,080
Sorry, I'm late. Sorry.

845
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:36,396
Darling, I can't live without you.

846
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,756
Get up.

847
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,396
Take care of Hyun-ji and move on with your life.
without me well, yeah.

848
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,356
I can't. I can't live without you.

849
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,819
Excuse me, who are you?
Good grief.

850
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:50,580
Even your own wife
can't you recognize?

851
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,436
Oh, move aside for now.

852
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,700
Mother.
Oh, Sis Mi-ri. Thank goodness.

853
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,676
Look at these soft meat fibers.

854
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,916
Filled with natural meat flavors and essence,
Authentic LA ribs for only 99,000 won.

855
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,596
Wow, look at the meat.

856
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,636
Only 99 thousand won?
Cheap. Very cheap. Fun.

857
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,460
Order one.
Want to shop again?

858
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,620
Oh my. Say hello first
when entering the house.

859
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,051
Even greeting is useless.

860
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:20,379
You are too focused on meat
to the point of not hearing me.

861
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,876
Meat addiction is a disease, you know?
Yes, I have to eat.

862
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,836
Earlier at the supermarket,
My energy is drained.

863
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,756
No wonder. Fighting the hostage takers
with bare hands,

864
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,260
playing the police too.

865
00:50:31,605 --> 00:50:33,434
When did I play the police?

866
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:38,156
Aren't you the one blocking the entrance?
and said he wanted to confront the hostage taker?

867
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,940
The police can't get in, because Hulk is there.
who happens to be a police officer's wife.

868
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,180
Amazing. Three men pushed the door,
but it didn't move an inch.

869
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,713
Great.

870
00:50:49,752 --> 00:50:51,651
What can I do?
what if I'm that strong?

871
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,588
Duh, why is he acting like that?

872
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,820
Oh my gosh, Mom.

873
00:50:59,999 --> 00:51:02,159
My friends said, mom is there
at the supermarket hostage situation earlier?

874
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,351
It is said that the hostage taker had time to shoot?

875
00:51:04,402 --> 00:51:06,602
Hey, Mi-nyeo. You're such a rude brat.

876
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,676
If your mother comes home from a dangerous place,
you should ask,

877
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,464
"Is mom okay?"
or "Is anyone hurt?"

878
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:13,595
That's just being polite.

879
00:51:14,052 --> 00:51:15,492
But mom looks fine.

880
00:51:16,496 --> 00:51:19,116
Come on, tell me. How many shots were fired?

881
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,636
This afternoon, an incident occurred
armed hostage taking...

882
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,100
...at a supermarket in Gwangseon-dong.

883
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,956
According to the testimony of residents who came out
from the location just before the incident…

884
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,780
That's it! That's it, honey. Honey!

885
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:31,836
Watch on TV.

886
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,977
Gosh, he looks good
on camera. His face is thin.

887
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:36,836
Wow, it's in the news too.
Now you're a star.

888
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,270
What star?
Luckily I didn't get shot.

889
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:41,516
Why are you interfering?
in such a situation?

890
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,636
If I don't get involved,
maybe the situation could be worse.

891
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,236
You don't know which situation to be in
what do you take care of and what don't you?

892
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,220
Hey. You're a meddler too, you know?

893
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:55,196
Next news. A high school student
who was kidnapped on the way to school...

894
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,396
...found in a state
lifeless.

895
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,679
The police immediately carried out
further investigation.

896
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:03,476
Full report by reporter Jeong.
This world is really crazy.

897
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,526
…and has requested an autopsy
from the National Institute of Forensic Science…

898
00:52:06,577 --> 00:52:08,920
How about this?
…to investigate the cause of death.

899
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,740
Why not eat it?

900
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,900
I'll go into the room first.
Want to take a break?

901
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:15,968
Yes, take a rest.
Where do you want to go? Just here.

902
00:52:17,162 --> 00:52:19,521
Let him rest. Just rest.

903
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,756
You must be very surprised, right?

904
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,300
So scary. Absolutely terrifying.

905
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,140
Calm down everyone.

906
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,591
Oh, you guys keep chatting.

907
00:53:13,115 --> 00:53:16,660
Today, there is a new friend
who moved into our class.

908
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,140
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm Um Ji-eun.

909
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,676
Hurray.
Hello, Ji-eun.

910
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,573
Ji-eun, please sit in the right row.
at the very back, in that empty chair, yeah?

911
00:53:28,624 --> 00:53:29,660
Yes.

912
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:34,060
The basis of the Goryeo economy
relies on agriculture.

913
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:39,000
Land cleared for agricultural land...

914
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:44,020
...not taxed
within a certain period.

915
00:53:58,096 --> 00:54:00,460
YOU KNOW MR. HOLMES, RIGHT?

916
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,060
THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

917
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,500
All agricultural land is tax free.

918
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,160
Very beautiful.
The weather is also nice.

919
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:17,780
Here, give me your hand.

920
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,729
Ta-da!

921
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,060
What is this? It's so beautiful.
Beautiful, right?

922
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,900
I have one too.
Come on, look ahead.

923
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,088
Closer still.

924
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,740
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

925
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,162
Pour again.

926
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,411
Cheers!
Cheers!

927
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,060
Wow, this is delicious.

928
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:07,769
Are you the ones from the supermarket?

929
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:12,396
The Sherlock Holmes from earlier?
So you're from here, huh?

930
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,100
Yes, I just moved into unit 1004,
block 213 today.

931
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,599
Unit 1004?
Unit 1004?

932
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,580
Angel unit, huh?
Is there anyone in that house who…

933
00:55:25,352 --> 00:55:27,580
People who live there
previously moved, right?

934
00:55:29,215 --> 00:55:31,436
Enough, enough. This is the meeting.
which is predestined.

935
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,716
Let's have a drink together.

936
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,340
Here, sit down.

937
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,140
Cheers!
Cheers!

938
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,420
It never fails.

939
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:55,141
Wow, the way of eating is really cool.
No wonder you are so strong.

940
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:59,698
See for yourself, right? He's an ex-cop.

941
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:03,717
It used to be very famous
as a police officer who catches criminals.

942
00:56:03,742 --> 00:56:06,915
She is the female version of Ma Dong-seok.
Wow, you're so cool.

943
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,940
Gosh, why are you bringing up the past?
Geez.

944
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,164
But the way you searched for clues earlier,

945
00:56:16,215 --> 00:56:18,860
Sherlock Holmes can too
raise your hand after seeing you.

946
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,984
My dream was to become a detective.
No wonder.

947
00:56:24,035 --> 00:56:29,747
Wow, that's so cool. I even
have no ability whatsoever.

948
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:35,516
Why are you so humble?
You're the former insurance queen, right?

949
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:36,740
Insurance queen?

950
00:56:36,765 --> 00:56:40,295
He is good at counting
and know many people.

951
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:41,637
He worked in insurance for a long time,

952
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:43,865
so civil law, commercial law,
everyone knows it by heart.

953
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,396
He is like a lawyer
in this complex.

954
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,716
Oh, enough.

955
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,540
Police, detectives, lawyers.

956
00:56:51,689 --> 00:56:54,980
If the three of us join forces,
no one can fight us.

957
00:56:55,790 --> 00:57:01,325
Wait, what if
let's form a team?

958
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:05,780
Wow, agreed. What about the name?
Zoom-vengers? (Ahjumma-Avengers)

959
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,590
Zoom vengers?

960
00:57:09,284 --> 00:57:11,776
Zoom vengers?
Zoom vengers?

961
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,904
Oops, I drank too much.

962
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:18,965
Ouch.

963
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,596
But there is one important thing
that we don't have on this team yet.

964
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:25,940
What's that?
Resources.

965
00:57:26,866 --> 00:57:28,466
Resources?
Resources?

966
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,636
Wow, the smell of alcohol is really strong.

967
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,409
Oh, you came…

968
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,031
Moms, aren't you going home?
The family is waiting at home.

969
00:57:48,095 --> 00:57:51,260
Why?
Is there something stuck on my face?

970
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:55,770
Gosh, I like you.
You are so cool.

971
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:56,831
What?

972
00:57:59,306 --> 00:58:00,974
Agree?
Agree.

Wow!

980
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:40,090
In our apartment too
Turns out there are parking criminals.

981
00:58:40,343 --> 00:58:41,783
The whole neighborhood was abuzz with discussion.

982
00:58:41,808 --> 00:58:43,623
Isn't that like a crime?
the most serious of all crimes?

983
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:45,163
That's why you should live well.

984
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,623
What do you want?
All that remains is to teach a lesson.

985
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:49,237
I will not remain silent.

986
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:53,652
We have to send something hot
and tempting to his taste!

987
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:56,190
To be honest, it is true
did anyone die here?

988
00:58:56,443 --> 00:58:58,170
Someone died?

989
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,857
I think I know who did it.

990
00:58:59,882 --> 00:59:00,897
The name of the last mission is...

991
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,289
...mouse in the trap.

992
