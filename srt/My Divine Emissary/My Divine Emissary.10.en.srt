16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,860
[Episode 10]

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,080
Miss Cui is a virtuous lady.

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,400
I'm happy with that.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
Besides, Miss Cui

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,000
is the Noble Consort's cousin.

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,000
That's even more intimate.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
Prince, do you mean it?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,160
I shouldn't be here.

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,160
I should have been under the table.

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,960
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
I'm yawning.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,200
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,320
Your Highness.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,360
Emissary Xiao.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Miss Cui.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,520
Please, have a seat.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,800
Why are you still up this late?

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,000
Your Highness,

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
Prince Heqin helped me
by the stream that day.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,360
So, I made this handkerchief

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,680
to thank him.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,400
Miss Cui's orchid embroidery

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
is so lifelike.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,440
Oh, gosh!

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
Qingluo.

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,240
Your Majesty and I,

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,440
as well as Prince Heqin
grew up together.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,360
Now he's found the right girl.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,040
His Majesty and I are happy for him.

46
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,840
When you get married,

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,640
I'll give you a big present.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,320
In the storeroom,

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,920
there's a pair of bracelets
from the West,

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,000
with fine red coral.

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,200
It's the most perfect for newlyweds.

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,960
What are you doing?

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,200
You made yourself like a kitten.

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
Check it out.

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,240
I found this when I was passing by.

56
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
I think

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
someone must have left

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,520
the seeds here by mistake.

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,680
I just want to move it out

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,600
and plant it
in my own little herb garden.

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,800
Let me help you.

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,400
I knew you two were together.

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,920
I just went to greet the Queen Mother.

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,560
She's counting the tributes
from the West.

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,840
There's not much else to it.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,720
But

67
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
there's a pair of red coral bracelets

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,040
of particularly good color.

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,800
It's a pattern of twin lotus flowers
on one stalk.

70
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,520
I think it's perfect for you two.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,880
Qi Yan.

72
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,240
Don't be ridiculous.

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm not talking nonsense.

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,760
When you get married,

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,120
I'll ask the Queen Mother for it.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
There'll be one

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,320
for each of you then.

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,080
Wear it

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,840
together

80
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,080
and forever.

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,240
Is there something about red coral?

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,200
No.

83
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,840
It's just that I like it.

84
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,040
I thought I'd wear it on my wedding day.

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
But there's no chance of that.

86
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,680
But

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,400
it's good that I can help you.

88
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Wear it

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,160
together

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,920
and forever.

91
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm tired.

92
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm going back to rest.

93
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,280
I'll go and see how Her Grace is doing.

94
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,880
Alright.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,440
Thank you, Your Majesty and Her Grace.

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,920
Your Highness.

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
Are you alright?

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm fine.

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,760
Your Highness.

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Wan.

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,800
Do you like

102
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,240
Prince Heqin?

103
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,400
You heard me call him Huai An last time,

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,760
right?

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,560
Then why did you marry His Majesty?

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,560
Mengmeng.

107
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,920
Would you like to hear a little story?

108
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,880
I knew from a very young age

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
that the Cui family
would have a daughter

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,480
who would grow up to be

111
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
the empress of the palace.

112
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
At that time, everyone thought

113
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,600
it would be my sister.

114
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
My sister would marry His Majesty.

115
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
I would marry the Prince Heqin.

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,240
It's the best arrangement in the world.

117
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
But I never expected

118
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,040
just a few days before the wedding,

119
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,480
my sister died suddenly.

120
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,560
My father kept it a secret
from the public.

121
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,720
He let me secretly marry His Majesty
in my sister's place.

122
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,120
My happiness didn't matter in the face

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
of the rise and fall of my family.

124
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,680
Why didn't Prince Heqin stop it?

125
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,280
I was going to write to him,

126
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,360
hoping he'd take me away

127
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,600
in time for the wedding.

128
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
But I didn't expect

129
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,600
to hear from him first.

130
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,960
He told me not to wait for him.

131
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,600
And wish me luck in finding
a good husband.

132
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,280
He's forgotten about our deal.

133
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,120
Isn't this Wan?

134
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,080
Did you ask him yourself?

135
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,680
What if there had been
some kind of mistake?

136
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Mistake?

137
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
For example,
he didn't write that letter.

138
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,040
Impossible.

139
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
We grew up together.

140
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,160
His handwriting is not unknown to me.

141
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,560
Handwriting can be faked, too.

142
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,560
I think it's better
if you guys talk about it.

143
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
Or you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

144
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,080
That day when Prince Heqin
was choosing a wife,

145
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,640
I broke into his study

146
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
and saw your portrait.

147
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,520
If he didn't love you,

148
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
why would he hide your portrait?

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
My portrait?

150
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,160
Safe and sound

151
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,040
at zi hour!

152
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,960
It's zi hour.

153
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,760
I should get going.

154
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,960
Safe and sound

155
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,880
at zi hour!

156
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,720
By the way,

157
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,640
can you

158
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,080
do me a favor?

159
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,640
I asked you to make a proper disguise.

160
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,960
Why are you dressed as a girl?

161
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,720
Your disguise is just as good
as no disguise at all.

162
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,440
What did you say?

163
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,400
Nothing.

164
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,920
This is...

165
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,320
Emissary Xiao?

166
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
You're working pretty hard

167
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
on the disguise.

168
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,800
I mean,

169
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,280
your crossdressing is unparallel.

170
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,440
Lu Huan.

171
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,280
- Mengmeng is a girl.
- Huh?

172
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,040
An authentic one.

173
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,480
Why don't you get on the horse?

174
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,520
Just a minute.

175
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,640
What are we waiting for?

176
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,240
I can't...

177
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,960
Go.

178
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Your Majesty, take care.

179
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,320
I've arranged for guards to be there.

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,240
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
What are you so excited about?

182
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
I just found out she's a girl, too.

183
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Come on. Let's return.

184
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,280
Qingluo.

185
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,160
What is it?

186
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,080
Wan.

187
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,440
I can't sleep.

188
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,120
Will you take a walk with me?

189
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,520
Alright.

190
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,120
Then I'll call Shi Tao.

191
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Wan.

192
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,040
I want to talk to you alone.

193
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,000
Just the two of us, alright?

194
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,360
Qingluo.

195
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,480
Why don't we talk here?

196
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,400
Isn't it too remote to go further?

197
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,640
Qingluo.

198
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Qingluo.

199
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,320
What's going on?

200
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Don't be afraid.

201
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
Just talk to me.

202
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,080
Are you still thinking of Prince Heqin?

203
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,080
I...

204
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
I heard the conversation between

205
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,160
Emissary Xiao and you.

206
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Wan.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,040
Do you like

208
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,200
Prince Heqin?

209
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,280
You heard me call him Huai An last time,

210
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,760
right?

211
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,240
Wan.

212
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,560
You heard Prince Heqin say

213
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,200
he wants to marry me.

214
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,120
I've admired Prince Heqin

215
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
since I first met him.

216
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
Do you know how long I've waited

217
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,320
for this day?

218
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,640
Qingluo.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,080
This is between the two of you.

220
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,880
I have nothing to do with it.

221
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
How could it not be?

222
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
You've got His Majesty.

223
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,360
You're the Noble Consort.

224
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
How can you have
someone else in your heart?

225
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,800
Prince Heqin is free to marry

226
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,160
whomever he wishes.

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
If he likes you,

228
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,160
he'll sure marry you.

229
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,640
As long as you don't stop me,

230
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm the most suitable person

231
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,920
to be his wife.

232
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,160
The Empress Dowager will help me.

233
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,560
Wan.

234
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm begging you.

235
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,480
Forget the past.

236
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,760
Forget Prince Heqin.

237
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,800
Qingluo.

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,280
If you're done,

239
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,680
I'll be on my way.

240
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
Wan.

241
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,640
Just promise me.

242
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,360
Qingluo.

243
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,360
Wan.

244
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,720
Let go of me first.

245
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,520
Wan!

246
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,280
Wan!

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,080
I didn't push you.

248
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
I didn't push you!

249
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,720
[Lu County]

250
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,440
Minister Li.

251
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,760
Your Majesty.

252
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,640
Father.

253
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,360
Father.

254
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,280
[Li Ming]
I really miss you.

255
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,520
That's why I came here.

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,040
It's so that I can meet father again.

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,920
What are you thinking about?

258
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,640
Go and greet him.

259
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,800
I've heard so much about you,
Emissary Xiao.

260
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
I didn't realize

261
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,880
it was such a young girl.

262
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
The Minister Li
that Qi Yan has been talking about

263
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,120
looks exactly like father.

264
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,960
She's more than just Emissary Xiao.

265
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,680
You didn't know, Minister Li.

266
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
She also came up with the idea

267
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,360
for the underground aqueduct.

268
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,760
It's a blessing for Qi kingdom

269
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,280
to have such a talent
at His Majesty's side.

270
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
Do you really think so?

271
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,480
Do you think I'm talented?

272
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,360
Of course.

273
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,640
Emissary Xiao's underground aqueduct

274
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
is a brilliant idea.

275
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,400
That's very wise.

276
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,720
Then, Minister Li,

277
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,960
can we go and see the aqueduct now?

278
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,080
Your Majesty and Emissary Xiao,
please come with me.

279
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Alright.

280
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,960
Your Highness.

281
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,760
Your Highness.

282
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,040
How did you sleep last night?

283
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,600
Your Highness.

284
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,560
Your Highness.

285
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,880
Your Highness.

286
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,040
It's just as you predicted.

287
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
His Majesty has gone to Lu County.

288
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
Is everything in order?

289
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,840
Yes.

290
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
Our guys are heading to Lou County, too.

291
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,960
Prince Heqin!

292
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,760
Bad news!

293
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,960
Her Grace is missing!

294
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,840
What?

295
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,240
When did this happen?

296
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,520
Last night, Her Grace said

297
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,440
she wanted to go out with Ms. Qingluo.

298
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,200
She told me not to wait for her.

299
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
And today,

300
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,200
I found that the Her Grace
has disappeared.

301
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Who else knows about this?

302
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,040
Miss Qingluo said

303
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,800
she was separated from Her Grace
last night.

304
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,240
I wanted to go to His Majesty,

305
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,880
but the guards wouldn't let me in.

306
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,400
There's nothing else I can do.

307
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,920
This is a matter of honor
for the Noble Consort.

308
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
Don't let anyone know.

309
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,360
Zhui Ying.

310
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,360
You stay in the temple.

311
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,560
I'll go out and look for her.

312
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes.

313
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,520
His Majesty.

314
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,440
We're almost there.

315
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,920
Minister Li.

316
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,600
Don't call me "Your Majesty"
in Lu County.

317
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,920
Your Majesty is right.

318
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,560
Then, I shall call you "mister".

319
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Then you can call me Mengmeng.

320
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,800
My name is Li Mengmeng.

321
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,680
Why isn't Emissary Xiao's last name
Xiao?

322
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,920
"Xiao" is my courtesy name.

323
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,800
So,

324
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,200
we're a family.

325
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Your Majesty, please follow me.

326
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,840
So this is what a culvert looks like.

327
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,880
As expected.

328
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,920
Human wisdom is universal.

329
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,520
Minister Li.

330
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,240
How is the construction of the aqueduct
progressing today?

331
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,760
Mister.

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,720
Please come with me.

333
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,960
Mister.

334
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,200
The shaft has
been fully excavatedand reinforced.

335
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,560
The culvert leads here.

336
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
Digging up in this direction,

337
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,520
we can melt the snow
on top of the mountain

338
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,800
and melt it into water and flow down.

339
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,360
What is the reason for slow progress
mentioned in your letter?

340
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,680
The shaft has been dug,

341
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
but the culvert is only halfway done.

342
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
Because the culvert was dug underground

343
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
without seeing the light of day,

344
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,600
it was difficult for the craftsmen
to judge the direction.

345
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,280
Often, they're halfway through digging

346
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
before they realize they were digging
in the wrong direction.

347
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,720
If the culverts between the two shafts

348
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
are not connected
by the shortest distance,

349
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,360
much of the water

350
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,320
will be wasted in transport.

351
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,080
That's right.

352
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,120
So every time they dug
in the wrong direction,

353
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,520
the craftsmen have to make up
the channels

354
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
and dig again.

355
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,480
This will delay the process.

356
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,160
I'm afraid I won't be able to finish
on time.

357
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,080
Does that mean we have five days

358
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,160
from our deadline of next year's
first month?

359
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,040
It's less than five days.

360
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,600
It's all because of my delay.

361
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
Please punish me.

362
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,760
It's only been six months

363
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
since construction began.

364
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,280
Minister Li, you've worked hard.

365
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
But

366
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
if at the end of the day,

367
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,040
the drought in Lu County

368
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,480
still can't be alleviated.

369
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,440
Won't that be a joke for the people?

370
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,720
Doing real work

371
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,520
will not be afraid of rumors.

372
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,800
Minister Li.

373
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,480
Regardless of the deadline,

374
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,320
if the construction is completed,

375
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
are you confident

376
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,120
that you can restore irrigation
to the farmland in Lu County?

377
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,240
I am confident about it.

378
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,680
That's good.

379
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,120
The completion of this aqueduct

380
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
will solve the problems of Lu County.

381
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,920
If Lu County resumes irrigation

382
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,480
and diverts water to the canal,

383
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,160
we can solve the world's problems.

384
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,320
Those courtiers prayed to God for rain

385
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,040
to relieve the drought,

386
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,240
but they didn't know

387
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,360
that the only long-term solution

388
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,560
is human labor.

389
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,840
You are absolutely right.

390
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,400
With effort, one can achieve anything.

391
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,440
Minister Li.

392
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,760
You can work in peace.

393
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,120
I'll handle

394
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,320
the rest.

395
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,760
Yes.

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,160
Thanks for your concern, Your Highness.

401
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,640
I'm recovering well.

402
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,880
Let me take a look.

439
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,080
This is the fruit of the mountain.

440
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,640
When I fell from the mountain,

441
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,680
I was lucky to have this tree.

442
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm glad you're okay.

443
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,760

446
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,480
Let's go.

447
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,120
Come.

448
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,320
Careful.

449
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,640
Minister Li might not be father,

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,720
but he looks exactly like him.

451
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,600
I really wanted to spend
more time with him.

452
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,760
Wouldn't it be strange to go to him

453
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,040
all of a sudden?

454
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,720
To go.

455
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,440
Not to go.

456
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,880
To go.

457
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,840
Not to go?

458
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,640
Where are you going, Miss Mengmeng?

459
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,480
If you hesitate here,

460
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
I'm afraid this pool
will be filled with stones

461
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,760

463
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,360
Just call me Mengmeng.

464
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,360
That's how my parents called me.

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,280

466
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,000

467
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,760
Please say it.

468
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,920
Can I hug you?

469
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
I'm afraid that's not appropriate.

470
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,320
It's fine, Minister Li.

471
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,120
That's just the way it is back home.

472
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,560
I'm sorry I'm so ignorant.

473
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,280
I'll apologize to Miss Mengmeng.

474
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,240
It's fine.

475
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,920

476
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,880
Minister Li.

477
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
Do you believe in another world?

478
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,960
Although I've never seen it,

479
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,080
I believe anything is possible.

480
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,120
Minister Li.

481
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
In fact,

482
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,880
from the first time I saw you,

483
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,680
I wanted to tell you

484
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,480
that you look very much

485
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,080
like someone I knew before.

486
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,680
Someone very important.

487
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,680
I look like a very important person
in your hometown?

488
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,120
Who is that?

489
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,160
It's my father.

490
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,480
You look very,

491
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,480
very much like my father.

492
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,760
Miss Mengmeng came to Qi Kingdom alone,

493
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,760
your father must have missed you.

494
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,120
I missed him too.

495
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,080
But I can't see him anymore.

496
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,880
I'll never see him again.

497
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,920
Chancellor Cui.

498
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
The scouts said that

499
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,680
when Emissary Xiao took His Majesty
and the Empress Dowager

500
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,160
to the temple,

501
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,760
everyone was shut in the temple

502
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,160
to pray for blessing.

503
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,360
The spies found

504
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,520
His Majesty sneaking out of the temple

505
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,840
with a woman.

506
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,080
A woman?

507
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,520
Yes.

508
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,600
And that woman looks very much

509
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,880
like Emissary Xiao.

510
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,280
What are you saying?

511
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,560
You're saying that Emissary Xiao
is a woman?

512
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,120
Yes.

513
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,720
No wonder His Majesty
doesn't want to be with Wan.

514
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,920
So that's where it all started.

515
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,640
Who would have thought

516
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,920
that His Majesty would hide
a woman with him?

517
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
Where have they gone now?

518
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,000
Went to Lu County.

519
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,920
Lu County?

520
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,400
Yes.

521
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,960
Looks like they're digging a canal.

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
Digging a canal?

523
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,360
Yes.

524
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,560
There's no water in Lu County.

525
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
What's the point of digging a canal?

526
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,960
It doesn't matter.

527
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,200
While they're in Lu County,

528
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,880
take the men

529
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,320
and kill Emissary Xiao.

530
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,240
Remember.

531
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,280
It has to be done cleanly.

532
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,760
Yes.

533
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,720
Killing Emissary Xiao

534
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
is just a small warning to His Majesty.

535
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,520
People

536
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,040
are like this bonsai.

537
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
If you don't prune it,

538
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,600
then where

539
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,120
will the branches go?

540
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
Are you that reluctant to walk with me?

541
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
I...I'm not.

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,120
Don't keep accusing me of something.

543
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,240
Then why are you always sighing?

544
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,680
I was thinking

545
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,480
about the distance
from the capital to Lu County.

546
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,080
Where I come from,

547
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,480
it's only half a day for a round trip

548
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,520
on either the high speed train
or a plane.

549
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,840
But it's a long way to walk now.

550
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
I was so blessed

551
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,640
at the time, yet I didn't know
how to appreciate it.

552
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,320
Are high speed trains and planes

553
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,880
faster than horses?

554
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,800
Yeah.

555
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,640
Your hometown is so convenient.

556
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,120
One day,

557
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,320
you must show me.

558
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,640
I wish I could.

559
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,680
But I don't even know how to go back.

560
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,040
[Steamed Bun Shop]
Why is Lu County so quiet

561
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,080
at night?

562
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Not even a single vendor.

563
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,680
Lou County is suffering from drought,

564
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,480
and people still have problems
feeding themselves.

565
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,680
How would they have spare money
for business?

566
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,040
But with the drought in the capital

567
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,600
and in Lu County,

568
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,360
they're completely different stories

569
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,800
This is my responsibility

570
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,080
His Majesty.

571
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,600
Don't move.

572
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,840
What now?

573
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,800
Don't move!

574
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,960
You're getting bold now.

575
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,960
Of course not.

576
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
Please, Your Majesty.

577
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
Just wait a little longer.

578
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Here it is!

579
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,720
How was it?

580
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,760
Cool, right?

581
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
In this way,

582
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,480
you'll be by my side

583
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,120
even for my shadow.

584
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,280
If I'm with you every day,

585
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,600
I won't have a chance
to talk about love.

586
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,200
You're with me every day.

587
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
Do you still want to talk about love?

588
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,320
In your dreams.

589
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,120
Then you can't either.

590
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,440
Fine for me.

591
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,280
Promise?

592
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,160
It's getting cold.

593
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,360
Don't be ridiculous.

594
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,600
Let's go back now.

595
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,840

I figured out how to dig a culvert

599
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,200

The direction of the light

611
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,840
and the direction of the shadow
are in opposite directions

612
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Let's say

613
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,160
we put a light

614
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
in the centre of the culvert

615
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,080
under the shaft.

616
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,840
Digging forward with back to light,

617
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,960
as long as he is always facing
his own shadow,

618
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,600
then he is travelling

619
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
in a straight line.

620
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,960
That's a great idea.

621
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,920
Ms. Mengmeng is a real genius.

622
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,120
Minister Li.

623
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
How long will it take
to dig through the canal

624
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,600
without considering reworking
and re-excavating?

625
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,360
With today's manpower,

626
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,480
if we start now,

627
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,960
we'll be done by noon
the day after tomorrow.

628
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,040
But the workers
were just taking a break.

629
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,120
Forget it.

630
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
There's no rush.

631
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,240
Your Majesty has nothing
to worry about.

632
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,240
The workers

633
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,880
have been looking forward

634
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,200
to the results of the diversion canal
for a long time.

635
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm afraid they'll be even happier
than I am

636
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,960
to hear this news.

637
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,320
Yeah.

638
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,800
Victory is within reach.

639
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,360
Why don't we go for it?

640
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,640
Good.

641
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,600
Then I'm grateful to you, Minister Li.

642
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,840
Don't worry about it, Your Majesty.

643
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,320
I will live up to your expectations.

644
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,640
You're hungry, right?

645
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,760
It's almost done.

646
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,480
We'll go together

647
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,400
when we're full.

648
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,760
I thought abandoned me.

649
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,440
If you don't care about me,

650
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,120
why did you come to my rescue?

651
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,760
Abandoned you?

652
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,560
What makes you think that?

653
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,280
Isn't that so?

654
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,560
You ended our friendship from childhood

655
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,360
with just a letter.

656
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,200
Letter?

657
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,080
What letter?

658
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
When i was at the northern border,

659
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,680
I learnt about your marriage to Qi Yan,

660
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
I travelled non-stop

661
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,520
for five days.

662
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,600
How could I not care about you?

663
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,200
But I got your letter

664
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,520
a few days before the wedding.

665
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
You told me not to wait for you

666
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,200
and find another mate.

667
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,520
It was your handwriting.

668
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,640
I won't be mistaken.

669
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,600
It wasn't me.

670
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,720
Could it be

671
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,040
Qi Yan?

672
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,720
It wasn't him.

673
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,760
He didn't know it was me he was marrying

674
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,160
until the day of the wedding.

675
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,240
So it wasn't Qi Yan
who wanted to marry you.

676
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,760
No.

677
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,360
Qi Yan wanted to let me go,

678
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,640
but you didn't want me already.

679
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,880
I have nowhere to go

680
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,920
in this world.

681
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Dummy.

682
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,080
How could I not want you?

683
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,200
You fixed it?

684
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,720
Is it nice?

685
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,760
Wan is the prettiest.

686
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,080
Will you

687
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,480
come with me now?

688
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,840
I will.
