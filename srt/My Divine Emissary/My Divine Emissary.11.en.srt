Mengmeng.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,880
Where did everyone go
so early in the morning?

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,920
Didn't even say anything.

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
Why is it so hot today?

21
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,120
Let's finish up and eat.

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,320
Come on, lend a hand.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,600
- Alright.
- Here, here.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,160
Put it here, put it here.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,360
Be careful.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,640
Come on, carry this over.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
Take this.

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
Mister, you're here.

33
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,880
- Mister.
- Hold on.

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm busy right now.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Mister.

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,680
- Why are so early?
- Mister.

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,120
Drink some water.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,320
I'm not as energetic as Emissary Xiao.

She got up so early,
yet she's still full of vitality.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,160
Minister Li.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,640
Did I say something wrong just now?

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,480
I don't think so.

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,440
What's wrong?

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,440
I don't want to go back.

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,440
When I return to the capital,

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,040
I'll ask His Majesty to send me
to the Northern Frontier.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
I'll take you with me then.

48

Pinkie promise. We can't change
our minds for a hundred years.

Wan.

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,800
After moving these,

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,320
don't forget to move those
over there too, okay?

52
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,080
Do you hear me?

53
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,720
Mister,

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,120
did you not sleep well last night?

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,640
Do you still have the energy

56
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,680
to care about whether
I slept well or not?

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
You seem really irritated today.

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,320
Is it because you've
been overworked lately

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
and haven't had enough rest?

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,840
What's up with you now

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
following Minister Li around
like a shadow?

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,280
Wherever he goes, you go.

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
Whatever he says, you listen.

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,360
This is really unfair.

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,440
I follow Minister Li

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,480
because...

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,760
Minister Li looks so much like my dad.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,600
Dad?

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
That means father.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,560
When I was eight years old,

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,520
my dad passed away from illness.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
So, the day I saw Minister Li,

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,600
I felt really warm and loved.

74
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,920
Being with him

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,160
is like going back to my childhood

76
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,080
when my dad was still alive.

77
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,480
I didn't know about this.

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,920
But it's okay.

79
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,200
It's all in the past now.

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,160
Although

81
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
I know he's no longer by my side,

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,520
but

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,080
he must be somewhere

84
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,960
watching over me.

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,800
That's good enough.

86
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Definitely.

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,720
Oh, Mister.

88
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,480
Could you accompany me
to a go to a place?

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,480
Where to?

90
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,200
You'll find out if you come with me.

91
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
Give me a hand.

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Your Grace.

93
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,240
We found Miss Cui from the Cui family.

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,840
She admitted that it was an accident

95
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
that she pushed
the Noble Consort off the cliff.

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
Although it was her who injured Wan,

97
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,760
but she's Wan's cousin after all.

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,880
Send her to the abbey.

99
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes.

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,120
Besides,

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,160
His Majesty is currently
residing at the Lu County Office,

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,560
seems to be repairing the canal.

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,200
Repairing the canal?

104
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,840
Yes.

105
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
Who is the current
commissioner of Lu County?

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,360
Li Ming.

107
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,040
Even if Your Majesty doesn't want to
listen, I still must say it.

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,640
Has Your Majesty forgotten

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
about the canal excavation back then

110
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,760
when Qi Kingdom suffered
from severe drought,

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,280
and the canal
became a taboo in the court?

112
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,040
Do you also believe in these myths?

113
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,640
Clearing the canal can solve

114
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,000
the irrigation problems along the river.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,880
It can also establish a canal transport
that connects the entire Qi Kingdom.

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
Are you going to give up on the canal

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,320
just because of these rumors?

118
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,200
Regarding the canal,

119
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,360
I hope Your Majesty
won't bring it up again.

120
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
It has nothing to do with you.

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,560
I didn't understand the benefits
of the canal back then.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Now I misunderstand him as a slob.

123
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,240
It turns out His Majesty
hasn't changed at all.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,600
However, Your Grace,

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,080
we also found another group of people

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,560
tracking His Majesty in Lu County.

127
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,920
All of them are highly
skilled martial artists.

128
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,320
It's not easy
for our people to approach.

129
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,840
Are there others following His Majesty?

130
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,360
Yes.

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
I'm going to Lu County.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
You stay here and protect Wan.

133
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,360
Yes.

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,960
Minister Li works so hard.

135
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,520
His shoulders are seriously strained.

136
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,400
I want to gather some herbs

137
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,560
and make some ointment for him.

138
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,880
Do you know any useful herbs

139
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,480
for treating muscle injuries?

140
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,440
I was quite naughty when I was young.

141
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
I always got injured here and there.

142
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,360
That's why I still have
some knowledge about herbs.

143
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,840
Can you tell me
what these herbs look like?

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,280
I'll look for them with you.

145
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,480
Their leaves are

146
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,280
thin, sharp,

147
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,160
and green in color.

148
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,520
You...

149
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,840
Can you say something useful?

150
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,480
Your Majesty, do you know?

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,360
I just realized when I came here,

152
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,240
how beautiful the life
in my hometown was.

153
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,400
If you had back pain,

154
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,000
there were various ready-made ointments,

155
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,360
like Yunnan Ointment,

156
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
Shexiang Bone Strengthener,

157
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,840
and Shennong Analgesic Cream.

158
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,920
You could find everything there.

159
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,520
Besides, you could just
move your fingers,

160
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,200
and someone would deliver
the ointment to your doorstep.

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
Unlike here,

162
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,360
where you have to
gather the herbs yourself.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,680
Your hometown sounds awesome.

164
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,520
You must really want to go back, right?

165
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,320
Yes.

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,360
At first, I really wanted to.

167
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,840
Things here are
so different from my hometown.

168
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
But now?

169
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
Now...

170
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,760
Now,

171
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm starting to
get used to the life here.

172
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
Besides, I've also met Your Majesty,

173
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,160
and also Lu Huan,

174
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,880
Kong An,

175
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,360
and Wan's friends.

176
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
But still,

177
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,200
one day I'll have to go back.

178
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,600
But for now, I'm staying here together

179
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,960
with Your Majesty to repair the canal.

180
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,680
So...

181
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
What about after that?

182
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,520
After we've finished repairing...

183
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,800
That is it.

184
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,800
Slow down.

185
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,560
Be careful.

186
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,280
Watch out.

187
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,600
from zi hour onwards,

259

I really have to go.

263
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,040
But...

264
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,300
Oh, no!

265
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,720
Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,560

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,800
Don't worry.

268
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,200
His Majesty ordered us
to guard the door.

269
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,040
Why are you so calm?

270
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,920
That's the Empress Dowager.

271
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,200
Can you stop her?

272
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,720
Then what should we do?

273
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,560
Your figure is similar to His Majesty's.

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,280

275
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160

278
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,120
But what about my voice?

279
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,120
Don't you remember the trick
the emissary left us with?

280
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,960

Mother, I am here.

298

Mother, I am here.

299
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Who is so bold

300
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
trying to impersonate His Majesty?

301
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,880
It's not an impersonation.

302
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,440
This is a voice recording
on a cellphone.

303
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,560
Look.

304
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,720
If we go to Lu County,

305
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,280
and someone comes l
ooking for His Majesty,

306
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,480
His Majesty can choose not to respond.

307
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,280
However if

308
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,920
the Empress Dowager comes
looking for His Majesty,

309
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,640
His Majesty surely can't ignore her.

310
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,040
So,

311
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
we need to record
His Majesty's voice in advance.

312
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,440
This way we can surely
handle the Empress Dowager.

313
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,600
Mother, I am here.

314
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,360
Give it to me.

315
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,240
Stop playing.

316
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,280
The phone is running out of battery.

317
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,640
Even my power bank is running low.

318
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,480
Say one more sentence.

319
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,800
Mother, I feel much better now.

320
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,000
I've dispelled a lot of bad luck.

321
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,880
Yan.

322
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,080
Mother will continue to pray for you.

323
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,720
I hope you'll recover soon.

324
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Mother do not worry.

325
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,760
It's windy outside, you should leave.

326
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,000
There's no wind.

327
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,840
Didn't Emissary Xiao say

328
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,560
that she was going to

329
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,280
accompany Yan and perform rituals?

330
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,680
Are you hiding something from me?

331
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,880
Empress Dowager.

332
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,720
Emissary Xiao is here.

333
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,960
Empress Dowager.

334
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,960
The wind is growing.

335
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,200
Perhaps the emissary foresaw it coming

336
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,080
and informed His Majesty.

337
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,280
Alright then.

338
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,800
Since Emissary Xiao is with Yan,

339
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,320
I'm not going in.

340
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,400
However,

341
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,800
if there's anything wrong with Yan,

342
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,720
you must inform me immediately at once.

343
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,800
Yes.

344
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,120
Has the Empress Dowager left?

345
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,240
Kong An.

346
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,760
No.

347
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,040
I didn't do anything.

348
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,120
This...this thing was broken.

349
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,760
Then...

350
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,520
Well,

351
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,640
I didn't do anything anyway.

352
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
You two can talk.

353
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
Are you still a lady?

354
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
How can you be so casual with men?

355
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
I just saved your lives.

356
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,960
How could you say that to me?

357
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,480
Am I lady?

358
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Can't you tell?

359
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,320
You...

360
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,800
What are you doing?

361
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm your savior now.

362
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,600
Aren't you going to offer yourself to me

363
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
- to be even? Right?
- Okay.

364
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,800
What?

365
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
I was kidding.

366
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,080
I'm serious.

367
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,440
I should repay you.

368
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
I'm going to leave now.

369
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,040
The Empress Dowager might come back.

370
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
Why don't you stay here too?

371
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,960
It makes sense.

372
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,160
Okay.

373
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,920
Mister.

374
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,120
This block

375
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,680
is our final obstacle in the canal.

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,760
Once we break through here,

377
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,520
our mission is accomplished.

378
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,800
Great.

379
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,120
We can finally finish.

380
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,560
Run!

381
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,960
Qi Yan, watch out!

382
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,040
Minister Li.

383
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,720
Get them out of here quickly.

384
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,560
Leave it to me here.

385
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,200
Go.

386
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,960
Qi Su.

387
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,400
Qi Su.

388
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,240
Qi Su.

389
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,580
[Lu County Office]

390
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
How is he?

391
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,240
Fortunately, it didn't
hurt his vital areas.

392
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,280
So, his injury is not too serious.

393
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,680
But why isn't he awake yet?

394
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
I used some anesthesia

395
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
when I was treating his wounds just now.

396
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,200
Once the effects wear off,

397
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
he'll wake up naturally.

398
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,040
Thank you, physician.

399
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,440
And what about Minister Li's injury?

400
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,160
Is it serious?

401
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,360
He only has minor injuries.

402
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
After being bandaged and

403
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
resting for a few days,
he will recover.

404
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,160
Thank you.

405
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,520
Let's leave for now

406
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,520
and let him rest for a while.

407
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,080
Okay.

408
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,080
Please.

409
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,880
Please.

410
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,920
Minister Li.

411
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,520
I'll going to leave now.

412
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,080
Thank you.

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,640
Why did Prince Heqin come here?

414
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,440
I think he must have heard some news.

415
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,640
Father! Father!

416
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,360
Slow down!

417
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,800
Wanwan!

418
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,400
Father!

419
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,600
What's wrong with father?

420
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,840
Did you get hurt?

421
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,400
It's nothing. It's nothing.

422
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,040
I never thought Minister Li
had a daughter too.

423
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,840
This is Mister Qi.

424
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,840
And this is Mengmeng.

425
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,600
These are my wife and child.

426
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,800
I've been away from home these few days.

427
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,840
I just came back.

428
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
Sorry for being rude.

429
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,360
Mrs. Li, you're too polite.

430
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,080
Hello, Mrs. Li.

431
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
I'll follow my wife and my child

432
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,760
to the house first.

433
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,360
Okay.

434
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,640
Let's go.

435
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,320
Come.

436
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,080
Don't move when you're injured.

437
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,440
Where's Emissary Xiao?

438
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,040
Why do you ask?

439
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
Me being here isn't good enough for you?

440
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,760
How come Prince Heqin
is here in Lu County?

441
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
I received some information

442
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
that someone is monitoring
Your Majesty in Lu County.

443
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,240
That's why I came.

444
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,440
You received information?

445
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,240
So, are you also monitoring me?

446
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,080
Wan has told me everything.

447
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,000
I misunderstood Your Majesty before.

448
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,800
I didn't expect Chancellor Cui

449
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,240
to employ such despicable scheme

450
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,160
just to make Wan to give up.

451
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,960
But you!

452
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
If you had informed me
upon your return to the capital,

453
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,280
this wouldn't have happened.

454
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,800
If Your Majesty agreed to see me,

455
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,960
when I just returned to the capital,

456
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,040
then this wouldn't
have happened either, right?

457
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,240
This is all because
you're such a tattle-tale.

458
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,840
If you hadn't tattled back then,

459
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
the canal would have been
completed long ago.

460
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,520
It wasn't me.

461
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,600
Your Majesty was holding
the blueprints all day back then.

462
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Who wouldn't know Your Majesty
wanted to repair the canal?

463
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,440
Your Majesty,

464
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,080
once I recover from my injuries,

465
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,200
I want to take Wan
back to the Northern Frontier.

466
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,440
Just leave at soonest.

467
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,880
You're so cold.

468
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,360
Letting you two love birds
leave quickly to be together.

469
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,320
Isn't that nice?

470
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Alright, alright.

471
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,640
However,

472
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,640
I have one more thing to say

473
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,920
regarding Emissary Xiao.

474
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,080
Wan and I,

475
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,840
although we ended up
together by accident,

476
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
it's still a blessing.

477
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
If Your Majesty likes Emissary Xiao,

478
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,000
don't be afraid.

479
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,280
It's better to express
your feelings early.

480
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,760
Who...

481
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
Who said I'm afraid?

482
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,920
I was just planning to tell her.

483
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,640
Your Majesty.

484
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,000
What were you planning to do?

485
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,600
Plan to...

486
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
To go out for a walk.

487
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,640
Now

488
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm starting
to get used to the life here.

489
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,840
But still,

490
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,600
one day I'll have to go back.

491
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,400
If the canal is through,

492
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
is Mengmeng going to go back soon?

493
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,920
I must quickly confess
my feelings to her.

494
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,760
Guess who I am?

495
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,440
Besides you,

496
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,200
who else dares to cover my eyes?

497
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,920
I didn't see anything!

498
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,640
Mengmeng.

499
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,800
Actually, I...

500
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,640
I…

501
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,400
I think Your Majesty needs to rest.

502
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
I'll go to bed first.

503
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,360
Li Mengmeng.

504
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,040
You're always going to leave.

505
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
At this moment,

506
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
make sure

507
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,320
you're not swayed
by Qi Yan's handsomeness.

508
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,440
Mrs. Li.

509
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,560
Have you seen our daughter,

510
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,320
Wanwan?

511
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,280
Not at all.

512
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,200
We just came back from buying medicine.

513
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,320
We haven't seen her all morning.

514
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,080
She...

515
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,600
She just said
she wanted to play in the yard.

516
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,800
But I searched the yard thoroughly

517
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
and I didn't see her.

518
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,040
Mrs. Li, don't worry.

519
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
Let's go find her together.

520
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:49,840
Okay.

521
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,240
Let's go.

522
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,480
Wanwan!

523
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,040
Wanwan!

524
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,960
Wanwan!

525
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,680
Wanwan!

526
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,760
How is it?

527
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,000
Did you find Wanwan yet?

528
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,920
If something really happened to Wanwan,

529
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,120
I...

530
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
What should I do?

531
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,320
Wanwan will be fine.

532
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,720
Nothing will happen to her.

533
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,440
Let's keep looking.

534
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,360
Yes, Mrs. Li.

535
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,920
Maybe Wanwan went out
to play and lost track of time.

536
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
She shouldn't have gone far.

537
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,320
Shall we go check by the bridge?

538
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,200
Let's go.

539
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,280
It's alright. It's alright.

540
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,440
It's alright. It's alright.

541
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,320
Let's keep looking.

542
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,960
Wanwan!

543
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
Where did you go?

544
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,840
You really scared me.

545
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,760
Wanwan, where did you go?

546
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,000
Look how worried your mother is.

547
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
I wanted to buy
a stick of sugar-coated haws

548
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,440
for the uncle who's sick.

549
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,040
Thank you so much.

550
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,040
No worries.

551
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,280
We've found Wanwan,
that's the most important thing.

552
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,600
We're going to head back now.

553
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,200
Let's go.

554
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,240
Don't run away like that next time.

555
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,000
Wanwan has only been
missing for a while,

556
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,120
and her mother was
already so worried about her.

557
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,960
In this world,

558
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,680
there's no parent who

559
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,480
doesn't worry about their child.

560
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,160
I've been away from home for so long,

561
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
my mother must be very worried about me.

562
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
