00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,870
Don't run away,

192
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,910
come here.

193
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,790
Don't be shy.

194
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,990
Noble Consort,

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,310
come here.

196
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,030
Your Majesty,

197
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,870
so you wanted to pretend...

198
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,830
Your Majesty,

199
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,550
shall I help you?

200
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,870
What happens tonight

201
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,990
must not be told to anyone.

202
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,630
Your worries

203
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,990
won't come true.

204
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,030
No,

205
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,270
I still worry.

206
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,030
How's the conversation
between Wan and you?

207
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,350
Please rest assured, Empress Dowager.

208
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,550
Wan is very obedient.

209
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,070
She knows what to do.

210
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,910
But now that Prince Heqin
has returned to the palace.

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,830
We have to be more vigilant.

212
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,110
Yes.

213
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,190
What about the Emperor?

214
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,150
There's me for him.

215
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,230
Please rest assured.

216
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,550
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

217
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,550
Congratulations, Empress Dowager.

218
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,710
Congratulations, Empress Dowager.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,950
The Emperor and the Noble Consort
have slept together.

220
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,830
Why did they suddenly do it?

221
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,790
This is a huge occasion.

222
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,870
Your Majesty,

223
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,190
I feel like only
when we're bound together

224
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,510
I can believe

225
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,150
you won't do anything to Noble Consort.

226
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,070
I don't want to!

227
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,560
Your Majesty,

228
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,590
are you trying to deceive me?

229
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,550
Wake up.

230
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,830
I need to change clothes.

231
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,790
What?

232
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,710
Untie me!

233
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,510
Untie me!

234
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,310
Hurry up and untie me!

235
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,630
Okay...

236
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,630
Okay...

237
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,270
Come to Imperial Study Room
in the afternoon.

238
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,950
Understood.

239
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,590
Why does Eunuch Li act like a girl?

240
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,590
Let the Noble Consort sleep a bit more.

241
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,670
I'll go to the court first.

242
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

243
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,710
[Eunuch Quarters]

244
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,850
When will this urn be filled?

[Emissary Xiao]

246
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,270
The day I arrived,
it rained because of you.

247
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,230
Xiao, make it rain again.

248
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,150
How dare you!

[Sketch of the aqueduct project]

250
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,950
Sketch of the aqueduct project.

251
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,710
What's this?

252
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,390
What are you doing?

253
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,510
What are you doing?

254
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,350
I want to try using the method
from my hometown to pray for rain

255
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,190
and see if it works.

256
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,590
Forget it.

257
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,950
You also seem to care about the people.

258
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,710
I won't punish you.

259
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,230
So,

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,950
what are we learning today?

261
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,350
Let's get started.

262
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,350
Your Majesty,

263
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,390
Prince Heqin requests an audience.

264
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,510
Prince Heqin?

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,990
The charming

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,390
and elegant Prince Heqin?

267
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,110
Lu Huan.

268
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,520
Here.

269
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,270
Declining him.

270
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,030
Yes.

271
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,310
Prince Heqin,

272
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,990
His Majesty isn't feeling well today.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,630
Perhaps you should return.

274
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,030
Why won't His Majesty see me?

275
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,110
Uh...

276
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,430
Hey! Prince Heqin.

277
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,790
This is Imperial Study Room.

278
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,630
Please don't make it difficult for me.

279
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,390
Farewell to Prince Heqin.

280
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,910
Come back often when you have time.

281
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,910
Steward Lu,

282
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,590
Prince Heqin is here to see His Majesty.

283
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,310
Why won't His Majesty see him?

284
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,670
Eunuch Li,

285
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,350
you need to take a clear stance.

286
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,030
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

287
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,270
Eunuch Li,

288
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,710
come here.

289
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,670
Why do you think

290
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,150
I should see Prince Heqin?

291
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,630
He fights on the battlefield

292
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,510
for Qi Kingdom until his last breath.

293
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,030
You should see him.

294
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,910
Besides,

295
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,910
He is handsome.

296
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,390
Leave.

297
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,550
But we still have lessons.

298
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,310
Out you go.

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,590
Ok.

300
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,870
But Prince Heqin is really handsome.

301
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,510
Stop.

302
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,030
Deduct his wage.

303
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,030
On what grounds, Your Majesty?

304
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,990
Slandering the current monarch.

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,990
Yes.

306
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,550
Stand properly.

307
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,620
[Lihua Hall]

308
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,670
Did you hear?

309
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,750
Yesterday the Emperor
slept with the Noble Consort.

310
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,070
It's been three months
since she entered the palace.

311
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,950
She finally reached this day.

312
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,510
I heard the Emperor
found her too distant,

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,950
so he's been putting it off.

314
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,990
How dare you!

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,230
How dare you speak ill of Her Highness!

316
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,870
Her Highness, please forgive us.

317
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,550
Your Highness.

318
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,380
It's okay.

322
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,630
My father commanded me
to marry the Emperor.

323
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,150
I hope you'll return soon, it's urgent!

324
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,990
Your Wan.

326
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,200
Miss!

327
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,830
Prince Heqin sent a letter.

328
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,310
Is it about him coming back?

329
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,830
Dear Wan.

330
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,150
Three years on the border,

331
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,590
with uncertain return date.

332
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,110
I hope you find a good husband

333
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,390
and don't waste time waiting for me.

334
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,510
Huai'an.

335
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,190
This "An" character...

336
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,190
But I also think

337
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,030
the character "Shun" is beautiful too.

338
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,310
[Qi Shun]
Prince Heqin is here.

339
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,510

341
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,430
No formalities.

342
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,750
Huai'an,

343
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,390
come help me figure out

344
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,750
what name would be good

345
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,510
for the child
of Qiyan and Wan in the future.

346
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,570
[Qi Shun, Qi An]

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,110
Wishing you an early embrace
of your grandson.

348
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,390
I hope so.

349
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,190
They just slept yesterday.

350
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,910
So, it's unlikely to happen so soon.

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,030
But

352
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,350
their relationship

353
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,350
is really good now.

354
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,750
I'm even discussing with Granny Sun

355
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,110
whether to seize the moment...

356
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,830
Huai'an...

357
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,390
Huai'an...

358
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,830
What name do you think is good?

359
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,110
Empress Dowager,

360
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,630
what about the name Ze?

361
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,630
Ze?

362
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,230
Exactly.

363
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,630
Ze means

364
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,310
to nourish all things

365
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,270
and benefit the people.

366
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,790
Now that there's a severe drought.

367
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,750
I hope the child

368
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,190
can bring rain and blessings

369
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,670
to our country soon.

370
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,110
Ze.

371
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,190
Very good.

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,190
Very good indeed.

373
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,350
Your Majesty,

374
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,110
the Empress Dowager
requests an audience with Prince Heqin.

375
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,510
Prince Heqin intentionally took a detour
to the Lihua Hall

376
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,510
and met with the Noble Consort.

377
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,830
I really don't understand him anymore.

378
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,750
He was the one
who wrote the letter and abandoned Wan.

379
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,230
Now what is he doing?

380
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,550
I think

381
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,190
it's because
of their childhood friendship.

382
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,070
Your Highness,

383
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,670
you look so beautiful today.

384
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,950
No matter how beautiful I am,

385
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,590
I'm just a caged bird.

386
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,270
Your Highness,

387
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,790
everything will be fine

388
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,270
once you have a child.

389
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,230
Your Highness,

390
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,430
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,310
Pick up the hairpin for me.

392
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,990
I'm going out of the palace.

393
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,750
Yes.

394
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,650
[Huai'an, Wan]

395
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,630
Alright.

396
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,110
If you ever dare to betray me

397
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,590
or dare to marry someone else,

398
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,710
I'll have this tree chopped down.

399
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,630
Do you know

400
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,230
even if a tree is chopped down,
it can still survive?

401
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,190
What do you mean?

402
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,470
It means our bond,

403
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,030
once rooted,

404
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,950
cannot be severed.

405
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,070
Prince Heqin.

406
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,150
Your Highness.

407
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,870
The magnolia tree still looks so good.

408
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,390
Yes,

409
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,830
trees last longer than people.

410
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,950
Wan,

411
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,600
Shi Tao,

412
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,710
fetch the belongings of Prince Heqin

413
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,110
and return them to him.

414
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,710
Yes.

415
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,820
Your Majesty,

416
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,670
You have been
guarding the border tirelessly.

417
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,590
Now that I am married to the Emperor.

418
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,150
I'm returning your belongings.

419
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,030
From now on,

420
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,150

why bother giving it back to me?

435
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,230
The Emperor gets angry too easily.

436
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,110
I've already been punished for a while.

437
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,030
You're supposed
to like praying for rain, right?

438
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,350
Why haven't you started yet?

439
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,990
I have no idea how to pray for rain.

440
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,870
Whatever, I'll just say a few words.

441
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,030
Urgent as an imperial decree,

442
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,710
may the Rain King quickly appear.

443
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,190
Let dark clouds gather,

444
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,630
wild winds rage,

445
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,950
and heavy rain

446
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,510
pour down unstoppably.

447
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,230
May the world soon be blessed
with refreshing rain.

448
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,790
And may I return home soon
and live a peaceful life.

449
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,790
What are you saying?

450
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,470
May the world soon be blessed
with refreshing rain.

451
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,350
May...

452
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,230
May...

453
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,590
May our country's crops thrive,

454
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,790
and may there be peace forever.

455
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,370
One more time!

456
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,190
Urgent as an imperial decree,

457
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,870
may the Rain King quickly appear.

458
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,670
May the skies soon bless us
with refreshing rain,

459
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,950
and may our country's crops thrive,
and there be peace forever.

460
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,110
Your Majesty.

461
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,670
Uh...

462
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,550
Just tell me.

463
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,190
Yes.

464
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,710
Your Majesty.

465
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,120
About the fund in your private treasury,

466
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,110
there's not much left

467
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,510
after building the aqueducts.

468
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,750
And now, Minister Li

469
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,550
is urgently in need of money.

470
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,910
I've been thinking for a long time,

471
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,750
but I really can't think of a solution.

472
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,270
Inform everyone,

473
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,710
tonight I'll host a banquet
for all ministers

474
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,950
in the Renxin Hall
to appreciate the flowers.

475
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,910
Make sure all ministers are notified

476
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,310
not to come empty-handed.

477
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,870
Your wisdom shines, Your Majesty.

478
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,110
Up a bit.

479
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,430
Down a bit.

480
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,430
Too far down.

481
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,030
Your Majesty,

482
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,350
I've been arranging this

483
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,750
for almost two hours.

484
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,430
Could you please look carefully
before giving instructions?

485
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,310
How dare you.

486
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,470
Slap him!

487
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,190
I didn't contradict him.

488
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,750
I didn't.

489
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,190
I just gave

490
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,950
a small suggestion.

491
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,270
Is this okay?

492
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,110
That's fine.

493
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,230
