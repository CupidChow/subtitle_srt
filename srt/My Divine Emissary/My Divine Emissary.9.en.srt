to have a chat with someone.

There were no secrets between us.

84

from the Northern Frontier,

His Majesty was young

89
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,220
but only cared for the citizens.

If you really want to help His Majesty,

103

00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,740
Too lively.

192
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,580
Unsuitable.

193
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,020
Too plain.

194
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,060
No way.

195
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,180
There's no way Prince Heqin

196
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,780
will want to marry Zhang Yiran
after this dance.

197
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,140
I have never seen a dance
like that before.

198
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,220
What is this?

199
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,980
Whose daughter is this?

200
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
How insolent.

201
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,660
Yes.

202
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,540
Who is it?

203
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,900
It's the second daughter
of the Zhang family.

204
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,220
Why does she look familiar?

205
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,380
Li Mengmeng.

206
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,900
It's her.

207
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,380
Prince Heqin, do you

208
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,660
like Miss Zhang?

209
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,940
I think she is not bad.

210
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,660
But if she is to be a consort,

211
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,860
it's inappropriate for her

212
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,180
to dance something so improper.

213
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,620
Since you are selecting
on the Empress Dowager's behalf,

214
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,620
you have the right to decide.

215
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,700
No need to continue the selection.

216
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,540
I choose her.

217
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,340
- No way!
- No way!

218
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,900
This woman is not suitable.

219
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,780
Why?

220
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,780
Does Your Majesty know her?

221
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,420
No, I don't.

222
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,660
I only think her dance

223
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,020
is way too bold.

224
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,500
It's not suitable for a consort.

225
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,700
It's fine.

226
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,940
Something unusual is interesting.

227
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,500
Your Highness, what's wrong?

228
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,620
Your Highness.

229
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,820
Where did Miss Zhang go?

230
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,660
Perhaps she rushed off
due to an emergency.

231
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,380
Why was it over before my turn?

232
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,300
Wasn't the one dancing on stage

233
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,660
you, Miss Zhang?

234
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,180
I have not performed yet.

235
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,420
Guards!

236
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,180
Guards!

237
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,980
Someone has broken in
and impersonated Miss Zhang.

238
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,060
Find her now!

239
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,380
Guards!

240
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,460
Someone broke in

241
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,620
and impersonated Miss Zhang!

242
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,000
Sir,

243
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,940
we've searched this wing

244
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,620
and found nothing.

245
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,900
Search again!

246
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,640
Yes.

247
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,980
The two of you, follow me.

248
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,860
You two, keep a close watch
on the doors.

249
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,740
Yes.

250
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,580
Isn't this Wan?

251
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,340
What are you doing here?

252
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,860
Emissary Xiao, your outfit

253
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,940
isn't bad.

254
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,540
I didn't think you had this ambition.

255
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,300
You actually want to marry Prince Heqin.

256
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,900
Your...

257
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,660
Your Majesty,

258
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,220
what are you saying?

259
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,100
I don't understand.

260
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,260
Who's in the study?

261
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,900
Your Grace,

262
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,660
I heard sounds in the study.

263
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

264
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,860
All rise.

265
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,620
It has been years,

266
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,300
and you still prefer
the First Flush Longjing tea, Uncle.

267
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,660
Weren't you going
for a stroll in the garden?

268
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,300
Why are you in my study?

269
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,940
I was tired.

270
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,220
Can't I come here to rest?

271
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,140
Rest?

272
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,340
You sure have a knack
for finding rest spots.

273
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,540
I saw a woman in here from outside.

274
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,180
Did I interrupt you?

275
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,580
What woman?

276
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,820
No need to be nervous,

277
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,380
we can keep secrets

278
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,700
between family.

279
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,340
Prince Heqin, are you
overstepping yourself?

280
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,740
I wouldn't dare.

281
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,020
I just know

282
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,100
that we weirdly have the same tastes,

283
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,980
especially in women.

284
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,620
Is that so?

285
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Why didn't I know?

286
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,860
The dancing lady was named
by the Empress Dowager.

287
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,700
What do you think of giving her to me?

288
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,540
As long as you like her.

289
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,660
Still, don't go back
on your word halfway

290
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,620
and ruin the lady's future.

291
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,660
Thank you for the tea.

292
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,860
It's time for me to head back.

293
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,580
Who is it?

294
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,700
Emissary Xiao,

295
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,580
His Majesty has summoned you
to the Secret Research Pavilion.

296
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,020
The price must always be paid.

297
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,420
Why are you standing so far away?

298
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,380
Come here.

299
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,140
Your Majesty,

300
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,580
why did you call for me?

301
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,380
No matter what,

302
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,700
I'm willing to go through danger for you

303
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,780
with my arms...

304
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,220
Why were you
at Prince Heqin's residence?

305
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,220
Well...

306
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,660
I can't tell you.

307
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,460
Why?

308
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,860
Because I made a promise.

309
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,100
Is that person that important?

310
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm just keeping my word.

311
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,340
I think

312
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,580
you went to participate
in the concubine selection.

313
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,460
I...

314
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,500
Be honest.

315
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,700
Do you like Prince Heqin?

316
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,140
Petty!

317
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,140
Your Majesty,

318
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,420
this will be bad.

319
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,780
Don't take me as a joke.

320
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,340
Between Prince Heqin and me,

321
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
who will you pick?

322
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,380
I...

323
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,420
Who?

324
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,820
Careful.

325
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,780
Your Majesty.

326
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,540
Your Majesty.

327
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,780
Emissary Xiao.

328
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,060
You...

329
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,100
Put it on.

330
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,060
Who told you three to come in?

331
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,940
Get out.

332
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,140
Yes.

333
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,380
Wait. Don't go.

334
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,220
I'm telling you,

335
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,500
I won't let this question go.

336
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,060
Once you make up your mind,

337
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,220
answer me.

338
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,420
Come in.

339
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,820
Your Majesty.

340
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,580
Speak.

341
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,420
Why did the three of you

342
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,540
barge in just now?

343
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,180
Your Majesty,

344
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,100
Minister Li sent a message

345
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
saying there has been a problem
digging out the Qanat channel.

346
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
Works cannot end as scheduled.

347
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,940
What?

348
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,460
I have to go to Lu County.

349
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,020
You cannot, Your Majesty.

350
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,420
You are the ruler of a kingdom.

351
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,100
It's improper for you
to leave the palace.

352
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,740
There are eyes and ears everywhere.

353
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,940
If a schemer finds out,

354
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,540
they will cause trouble for you.

355
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,700
If you can't leave from the palace,

356
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,780
what about from somewhere else?

357
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,900
Do you have a plan?

358
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,980
How many days do you need, Your Majesty?

359
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,540
Three days.

360
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,420
What plan can you have?

361
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,820
Don't drag His Majesty down.

362
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,580
Don't forget.

363
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,140
I am Emissary Xiao.

364
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
You're here.

365
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,340
Let's dance.

366
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,980
Alright.

367
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Emissary Xiao,

368
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,260
why are you here today?

369
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,300
Your Highness,

370
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,700
I have found the way

371
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,220
to rid His Majesty of his cursed luck.

372
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,060
Is that so?

373
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,220
What is it?

374
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,580
I have found

375
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,340
a temple about 100 li to the northwest.

376
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,540
His Majesty will have to go with me

377
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,220
to mediate in seclusion for three days

378
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,220
to cleanse himself.

379
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,860
The cursed luck
will naturally dissipate then.

380
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,260
His Majesty and the Noble Consort
will be happy together

381
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,180
with children at their knees.

382
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,340
That's good.

383
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,380
Do as you suggested, Emissary Xiao.

384
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,340
Okay!

385
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,500
Remember.

386
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,060
Leave a few rooms empty.

387
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,420
I want to go too.

388
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,340
Oh, right.

389
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,460
I'll have the senior relatives
to come along.

390
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,300
The Emperor's matters are important.

391
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,940
Everyone should pray together

392
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,420
so that the Heaven
will hear me clearly.

393
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,180
That...

394
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,900
Cursed luck. Bad luck.

395
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,420
I order you to back off.

396
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,780
Just sacrifice a little, Your Majesty.

397
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,660
We can only sneak out

398
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,540
without worry if you sacrifice a little.

399
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,300
Stop.

400
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,420
Tell me what to do then?

401
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,740
What if Her Highness doesn't stay
in her room because of disbelief?

402
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,220
How will we sneak out then?

403
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,860
To get rid of cursed, dark luck,

404
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,540
you need something dark to get rid of.

405
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,460
That's why I can only

406
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,940
paint you completely black.

407
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,780
All the way until we get to the temple.

408
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,260
Your hand will not be black then.

409
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,940
Once we start praying,

410
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,580
your feet will not be black either.

411
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,660
Her Highness will then believe

412
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,980
I can get rid of cursed luck.

413
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,860
She will listen to my every word.

414
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,700
Isn't that right?

415
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,700
Can't I just draw a stroke here

416
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,220
and wipe it off later?

417
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,860
You have to make it convincing.

418
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,900
How dare you make a fool of me!

419
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,020
I am not.

420
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,940
I think it looks nice.

421
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,700
How dare you run!

422
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,500
I want to draw on you too.

423
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,980
Your Majesty!

424
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,900
Why did you turn me into a panda?

425
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,660
What is a panda?

426
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,740
Panda is a national treasure.

427
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,900
I am the national treasure.

428
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,820
Fine.

429
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,820
Then I'll turn you

430
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,180
into the real national treasure.

431
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,180
How dare you laugh at me!

432
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,980
Don't come closer.

433
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,900
Don't come closer.

434
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,860
You can't catch me.

435
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,620
Just you wait!

436
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,740
I'll have someone lock you up.

437
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,700
I will catch you.

438
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,020
You dare!

439
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Stop running!

440
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,780
I finally have my own carriage.

441
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,900
What's going on?

442
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,420
Your Majesty,

443
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,100
why give the Emissary

444
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,220
a broken carriage?

445
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,500
You'll know soon enough.

446
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,140
How dare you make a fool of me.

447
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,780
Are you okay?

448
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,380
I didn't think

449
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,340
I would get motion sickness.

450
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,740
Your Majesty,

451
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,380
can I ride

452
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,780
in your carriage?

453
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,580
It looks like Emissary Xiao
is not up to the task.

454
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,260
Do you want to ride in my carriage?

455
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,500
No way.

456
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,500
I don't like you.

457
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,980
How can you be like this?

458
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,300
He is just...

459
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,300
Under a lot of pressure.

460
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,060
Yes.

461
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,780
Your Majesty.

462
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,060
Speak.

463
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,180
Can we speak inside?

464
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,580
Let's speak out here.

465
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,820
Your Majesty.

466
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,860
Do you want to get on it badly?

467
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,660
Beg me.

468
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,060
Hurry.

469
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,580
Go on.

470
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,900
Go on.

471
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,380
Your Majesty,
the most magnificent and gracious,

472
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,820
can you please let me ride with you?

473
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,100
It's so big.

474
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,300
It's so wide.

475
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,300
Why was mine so bumpy?

476
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,740
I have to let you suffer

477
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,100
to understand how good I am to you.

478
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,780
Petty.

479
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,260
Are you insulting me?

480
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,860
It's a loving nickname.

481
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,340
Your Grace.

482
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,900
Miss Qingluo, right?

483
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,820
Yes.

484
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,980
You seem to love this horse, Your Grace.

485
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,980
It has been with me for years.

486
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,180
It must have been since you were 15

487
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,900
during a drill practice

488
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,620
when you and your steed

489
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,580
challenged three assistant commanders
of the Frontier.

490
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,500
Other than countless treasures,

491
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,900
you also won a great horse.

492
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,900
That's all in the past.

493
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,980
It's not worth mentioning.

494
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,540
Still, you were only

495
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,420
around 11 or 12 then.

496
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,980
You actually know all that.

497
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,860
Wan told me about it.

498
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,140
I've long heard of you.

499
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,580
While I was not out yet,

500
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,420
I always hear of your deeds.

501
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,660
Why won't it eat?

502
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,420
If I don't take it out for a few days,

503
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,380
it'll throw a tantrum and refuse to eat.

504
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,980
This horse

505
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,060
should be galloping all over the land.

506
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,140
Yet it's stuck
in a tiny place all day long.

507
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,180
Naturally, it'll be in a mad mood.

508
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,500
You're right, Wan.

509
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,580
Once we're married,

510
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,180
let's take it on a tour

511
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,900
of the kingdom's mountains and rivers,

512
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,540
galloping all over the land.

513
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Who said we're getting married?

514
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,180
Careful.

515
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
Thank you, Your Grace.

516
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,220
Qingluo and Prince Heqin
look good together.

517
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,500
As expected
of a lady Chancellor Cui likes.

518
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,340
Still, I didn't expect her

519
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,380
to suddenly fall ill
on the day of the selection.

520
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,420
However, it's a good thing.

521
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,460
There were too many people there.

522
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,700
It's easy to get lost in the crowd.

523
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,100
Having them spend time together alone

524
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,500
will make things more intimate.

525
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,460
You're right, Your Highness.

526
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,460
I specifically brought her along.

527
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,100
I hope she and Prince Heqin

528
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,860
won't disappoint me.

529
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

530
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

531
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,060
[Mahavira Hall]

532
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,220
Your Highness.

533
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,340
Your Majesty.

534
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,020
I will be hosting the ceremony today.

535
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,140
First,

536
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,180
there are five flowers
before each of you.

537
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,340
They are

538
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,660
a pomegranate blossom,

539
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,100
a crepe myrtle blossom,

540
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,060
a rose mallow

541
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,660
a albizia blossom,
and a jasmine blossom.

542
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
The soul of these five flowers

543
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,460
is the essence of heaven and earth.

544
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,260
Place them inside the incense burner

545
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,820
and the fragrance emitted could...

546
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,820
Could...

547
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,100
cleanse your noble bodies.

548
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,980
That way,

549
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,020
the Heaven can sense your sincerity.

550
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,820
From the hour of zi hour tonight,

551
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,220
no one may take a step
out of your rooms.

552
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,940
You must be in seclusion for three days.

553
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,620
Place the soul of these blossoms
in the incense burner

554
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,940
and savor their fragrance

555
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,500
while copying the scripture 666 times.

556
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,780
Emissary Xiao,

557
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,340
while we pray for Yan,

558
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,580
what about you?

559
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,700
I will naturally be with His Majesty

560
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,060
and recite to him
to expel the cursed luck.

561
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,940
Your Majesty,

562
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,300
what time is it?

563
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,860
It's not zi hour yet.

564
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,660
Why have I never heard you sing

565
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,820
the scripture
you taught everyone just now?

566
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,620
It's a simple alphabet song.

567
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,100
I can teach you when we have the time.

568
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,620
What about now?

569
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,580
What time is it?

570
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,220
You just asked me.

571
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,180
Goodness.

572
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,940
Time goes by so slowly.

573
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,820
Well, you just had to tell them

574
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,620
to start reciting at zi hour,

575
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,700
I just said it without thinking.

576
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,060
Also,

577
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,580
it's mainly because I forgot
when zi hour is.

578
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,580
We have been on the road
for the whole day.

579
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,420
We can use this as a break.

580
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,420
Your Grace,

581
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,460
the investigation is done.

582
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,180
His Majesty's silver goes to Lu County.

583
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,660
Other than His Majesty,

584
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,540
have the men
keep an eye on Lu County too.

585
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,060
It only takes half a day
to get there from here.

586
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,940
This is no simple trip.

587
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,820
Yes.

588
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,300
Your Majesty.

589
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,180
I prefer my bed cool.

590
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,260
You'll sleep on the bed.

591
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,300
You're a nice man, Your Majesty.

592
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,860
I told you, it's just too hot for me.

593
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,260
Do you know

594
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,580
that you're very much like someone?

595
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,220
Who?

596
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,140
A domineering CEO.

597
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,460
A domineering CEO?

598
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,500
Who is that?

599
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,700
He is a good man.

600
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,260
But he loves to act cold and aloof.

601
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,620
There's also the anger

602
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,340
and kabedons.

603
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,180
And stuff like giving orders.

604
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,940
Is he

605
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,740
a friend from your hometown?

606
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,900
In my hometown,

607
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,300
he's the man of every girl's dreams.

608
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,300
What?

609
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,860
Did you dream of him?

610
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,660
Have you

611
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,260
ever dreamed of me before?

612
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,180
All nightmares.

613
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,620
Yes, I have.

614
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,820
I would always dream

615
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,420
that you'll give me a lot of money

616
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,100
then give me a carriage

617
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,860
as big and grand as yours. Also...

618
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,060
It really is a dream.

619
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,500
Your Majesty,

620
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,060
they should be in seclusion now.

621
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,820
The eunuch at the door seems to be gone.

622
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,700
However,

623
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,580
shouldn't you
disguise yourself a little?

624
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,780
Why?

625
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,300
What if someone

626
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,100
discovers you while wearing that?

627
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,500
That's sensible.

628
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,420
Noble Consort, what are you holding?

629
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,420
Your Majesty,

630
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,460
the food here is bland

631
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,740
and small in portion.

632
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,220
I was a little hungry,

633
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,860
so came out for some food.

634
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,860
It's already dark.

635
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,260
I will...

636
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,700
Prince Heqin.

637
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,020
Why are you here this late at night?

638
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,020
The food here is bland

639
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,900
and small in portion.

640
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,580
I felt hungry.

641
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,380
Why are Your Majesty
and Emissary Xiao out here?

642
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,780
The moon is bright tonight.

643
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,100
His Majesty and I
are admiring the moon.

644
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,060
Do you want to join us?

645
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,060
It would be rude not to.

646
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,420
It's not bad to look at the dark sky.

647
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,100
Perhaps the moon

648
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,900
is tired of our stares

649
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,380
and will come out by itself.

650
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,500
Emissary Xiao, you've worked hard.

651
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,380
Please sit.

652
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

653
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,460
Prince Heqin, when do you plan
on getting married?

654
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,900
You took all the bamboos in the forest.

655
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,140
You really are a panda.

656
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,780
To ask that kind of question.

657
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,860
If your interest in governance

658
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,060
can be as great
as your interest in my wife,

659
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,340
it would be great.

660
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,860
I saw Your Grace and Qingluo

661
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,540
enjoying your chat today.

662
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,180
What a perfect match.

663
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,980
Always at war,

664
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,180
yet able to maintain a passionate heart.

665
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,260
How very rare.

666
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,260
I thought

667
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,860
you can only do great things
if you're cold-hearted.

668
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,660
The food is cold.

669
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,020
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

670
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,660
Your Highness,

671
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,580
eat up.

672
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,740
Aren't you hungry?

673
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,020
Didn't you say you were hungry?

674
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,740
Why aren't they eating?

675
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,300
Your Grace.

676
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,940
Strange.

677
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,580
Is he already asleep?

678
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,260
But the candle is still lit.

679
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,220
Still, I think

680
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,900
that Prince Heqin and Miss Cui

681
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,260
are quite the match.

682
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,020
However,

683
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,780
you can't hesitate like before

684
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,260
and waste the lady's time again.

685
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,420
Since Your Majesty and Your Highness

686
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,060
are happy with Miss Cui,

687
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
I will find a good day

688
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
and have it done.

689
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,780
I am afraid of unexpected accidents.

690
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,900
Prince Heqin.

691
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,100
Please speak, Emissary Xiao.

692
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,500
Marriage is a major event in one's life.

693
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,740
You must think it through.

694
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,420
Miss Cui is a virtuous lady.

695
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,820
I am happy with her.

696
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,900
Also, Miss Cui

697
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,340
is Noble Consort Wan's cousin.

698
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,380
That is another tie between us.

699
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,420
