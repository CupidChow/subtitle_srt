[Episode 4]

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,390
My clothes are now dirty.

18
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,320
Lu Huan,

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,840
deduct his pay.

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,460
Yes.

21
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,260
Deduct my pay?

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,080
I would rather you didn't catch me.

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,260
After returning to the capital,

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
the first banquet you host
for the other ministers

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,740
just had to be on the same day

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,050
as His Majesty's flower viewing.

27
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,930
What is there to admire about flowers?

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,930
Do you think he's doing it on purpose?

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,010
Is everything done?

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,780
All done.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,220
No one is likely
to go to His Majesty's event.

32
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,630
I go to him,

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,850
yet he avoids me.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,050
Thus, I want him to come to me.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,750
By the way,

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,600
I have something to tell you.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,200
Recently, a young eunuch

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,900
has been spotted by His Majesty's side.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,820
His Majesty dotes on him.

40
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,820
It is because of that eunuch

41
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,170
that a few of us were culled.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,630
I got it.

43
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,510
I'll have Zhui Ying look into it.

44

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,730
I will make Qi Yan pay the price,

so that you can openly
return to my side.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,180
Don't slack off.

48
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,260
Keep working.

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,400
Did I tell you to put it here?

50
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,780
Go.

51
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,020
I can't catch a break with any of you.

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,170
A banquet hosted by His Majesty
is just exhausting.

53
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,010
I can't do it.

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,530
I can't move another inch.

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,650
Eunuch Li?

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,540
Is he slacking off again?

we will keep your gifts with care

68
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,170
and hand it to His Majesty
at the banquet.

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,840
Thank you, Eunuch.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,960
His Majesty is hosting a banquet
on the same day as Prince Heqin.

71
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,150
What should we do?

72
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,110
It's fine.

73
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,690
His Majesty will always host a banquet.

74
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,800
He just want gifts.

75
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,210
Our gifts have been given.

76
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,240
We'll just excuse ourselves tonight.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,800

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,110

80

is all in Prince Heqin's hands.

81
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,600
We can't embarrass him.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,240
That is true.

83
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,570

that we won't be missed.

I also want to attend Prince Heqin's
welcoming banquet,

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,660
but there's work to do at night.

88
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,770
Whatever.

89
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,070

Have they all excused themselves?

Bring them out.

96
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,650
Open it.

97
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,070
Wait. This...

102
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:22,980
Yes.

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,750

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,900
If I know the answer,

108
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,360
will you count it
as making up for my mistake

109
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,350
and not deduct my wage?

110
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,240

Isn't this Vice Minister Dong?

119
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,680
We recall you excused yourself
due to diarrhea.

120
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,030
You recovered so quickly.

Didn't you excuse yourself

123
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,240
because your mother is sick?

124
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,440
Well?

125
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,820
Is it diarrhea as well?

Also, Minister Zhang.

Of course, I do.

135

I have been waiting
for Your Majesty this whole time.

136
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,750

We would also like to know

143
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,790
or fallen ill

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,960
yet still appear

145
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,700
at your residence.

146
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,100
Perhaps it is because Your Majesty

147
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,020
have lost the ministers' loyalty

148
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,690
due to lack of seriousness

149
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,020
and being disrespectful to them.

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,860
In that case,

151
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,200
does this mean the loyalty I lost

152
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,050
all went over to you, Prince Heqin?

153
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,180
I would not dare.

154
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,920
Don't be so nervous.

come.

162
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,390
It has been three years
since we last met.

163
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,770
We'll give you a toast.

164
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,990
Why are you so lifeless?

165
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,780
Weren't you quite lively just now?

166
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,180
Why don't we have Prince Heqin

167
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,860
act as the host

168
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,570
and put on a performance

169
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,260
to liven up the party?

170
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,930
I will do my best.

171
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,100
Great skills!

172
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,980
Great skills!

173
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,900
Amazing!

174
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,900
Great!

175
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,060
Prince Heqin is skilled.

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,880
How amazing!

177
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,900
Great!

178
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,060
What great swordsmanship!

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,420
What great skills!

180
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,020
Great!

181
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,230
Are you satisfied, Your Majesty?

182
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,000
You really are a great general of mine.

183
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,900
It is your turn now, Your Majesty.

184
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,750
I have been practicing my archery.

185
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,500
I have improved.

186
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,550
Would you grant me the honor,
Prince Heqin?

187
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,980
You have spent years in the battlefield.

188
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,270
You shouldn't be afraid
of my archery, right?

189
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,570
It's too dangerous.

190
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,360
No way.

191
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:26,990
Your Majesty,

192
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,250
Prince Heqin will be hurt.

193
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,880
You do it then.

194
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,960
Weren't you saying Prince Heqin
is stronger than me?

195
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,750
Time to show you who is stronger.

196
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,740
Great archery!

197
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,980
His Majesty is great at archery!

198
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,180
How accurate!

199
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,300
Extremely accurate!

200
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,580
Great!

201
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,740
Great!

202
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,980
Prince Heqin is amazing!

203
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,780
Very amazing, Prince Heqin!

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,190
You really are highly skilled,
Prince Heqin!

205
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,660
For three years,

206
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,860
you've secured the borders

207
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,970
and engaged in battles,

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,960
killing thousands.

209
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,570
While you have returned to the capital

210
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,220
without permission or summons,

211
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,920
as you have done well in battle,

212
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,520
We have a gift for you.

213
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,340
Lu Huan.

214
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,880
You are past the age of marriage,

215
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,950
yet you don't have a wife.

216
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,310
We have decided to give you

217
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,510
a Child-Giving Guanyin

218
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,040
May you find a good match

219
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,450
and grow a family soon.

220
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

221
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,290
We will return to admire the flowers.

222
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,780
You guys have fun.

223
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,420
Farewell, Your Majesty.

224
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,790
Start counting.

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,900
There is quite a lot.

226
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,980
There is more than last month.

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,310
It looks like Prince Heqin's ruckus

228
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,720
wasn't such a loss.

229
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,240
Last month?

230
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,490
Do you host a banquet every month?

231
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,990
Not really.

232
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,150
Sometimes, it's two times a month.

233
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,020
Sometimes, it's three.

234
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,820
Are you short on money, Your Majesty?

235
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,680
Don't ask about what you shouldn't know.

236
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,400
How nice to be an emperor.

237
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,900
At my hometown,

238
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,820
we only receive this many gifts

239
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,790
during birthdays, weddings,

240
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,170
and celebrations of new births.

241
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,170
Lu Huan,

242
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,760
make sure to count all the money.

243
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,900
Yes.

244
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,470
Kong An,

245
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,210
send the money to Minister Li.

246
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
The aqueduct repair must not be delayed.

247
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,430
Yes.

248
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,010
We will take a walk.

249
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,020
Why must you always speak up?

250
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,720
Did I say something wrong again?

251
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
Today is His Majesty's birthday.

252
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,290
Huh?

253
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,850
Why not celebrate it then?

254
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,760
His Majesty doesn't like
celebrating his birthday.

255
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,570
You...

256
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,830
You can't catch me.

257
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,540
Your Majesty.

258
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,940
Slow down, Your Majesty.

259
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,820
You can't catch me.

260
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,260
Slow down, Your Majesty.

261
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,620
Yan.

262
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,020
It's my birthday today.

263
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,500
Play with me, please?

264
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,420
Yan,

265
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,760
just look at the time.

266
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,600
Why are you still wearing this?

267
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,500
Get His Majesty changed.

268
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,570
I don't want to get changed.

269
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,580
I still want to play.

270
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,280
Also, I don't like
celebrating my birthday.

271
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,810
Every time,

272
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,460
I will be sitting alone up top.

273
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,140
I can't do this. I can't do that.

274
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,860
Your Majesty,

275
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
have you forgotten the etiquette

276
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,780
taught by the Imperial Mentor?

277
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,870
You are no longer the crown prince.

278
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,940
You are the ruler of a kingdom.

279
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,490
You must act with propriety.

280
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,330
Do you understand?

281
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,720
I listen to you all the time.

282
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,460
What is the point

283
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,780
of being an emperor?

284
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,680
How can you say that?

285
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,420
You are the ruler of a kingdom.

286
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,420
How can you be selfish?

287
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,080
Your Majesty, where are you?

288
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,640
Where did His Majesty go?

289
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,080
I even prepared a birthday gift for him.

290
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,800
Where did His Majesty go?

291
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,080

Also,

317
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,740
the wishes can't come true.

318
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,740
It's just a trick to fool kids.

366

who celebrated my birthday

367
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,680
had passed away.

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,800
What did you see?

380
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,460
A draft of aqueduct works.

381
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,460
It looks very much like the image

382
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,500
in my geography books.

383
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,150
Geography books?

384
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,980
Still, it's not really the same.

385
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,430
My books depict underground aqueducts.

386
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,960
Underground aqueducts?

387
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,530
How is that different?

388
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,870
Aqueducts built underground

389
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,520
can prevent water loss in the journey.

390
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,410
The place is very dry.

391
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,800
If built as shown in the drawing,

392
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,170
the water will quickly evaporate.

393
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,710
That will make irrigation impossible.

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
If the canals are underground,

395
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,130
we can make use
of the mountain's natural slope

396
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,130
to direct the ice and snow
from the mountain

397
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,640
from underground back to the surface.

398
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,640
How is that depicted in your drawings?

399
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,490
Tell him to put his sword away.

400
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,750
How do I draw a qanat again?

401
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,340
Why do I falter at the last minute?

402
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,760
My stomach suddenly hurts.

403
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,290
We can give you one more day.

404
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,400
If you still can't draw it out,

405
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,200
we will cut your...

406
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,340
Every day, you want to execute me.

407
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,930
I'm on edge all day.

408
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,670
I might as well just die.

409
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,360
We aren't done speaking.

410
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,140
We will cut your wage.

411
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,830
If I draw it well,

412
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,440
will I be very handsomely rewarded?

413
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,810
Of course.

414
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,550
Pinky promise it.

415
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,250
Make a pinky promise,
keep it all your life.

416
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,460
Your Majesty,

417
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,590
what is it?

418
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,590
There is sand in my eyes.

419
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:10,680
Come.

420
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,720
Let me see.

421
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,740
How...

422
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,050
How dare you, you slave!

423
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,740
What are you doing to His Majesty?

424
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,820
Your Majesty,

425
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,390
apologies for the delay.

426
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,940
Is your mouth okay?

427
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,080
There was something in my eyes.

428
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,320
Thank goodness Eunuch Li was here.

429
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,650
We are tired.

430
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,010
Let's return.

431
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,640
Yes.

432
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,990
Thank you, Eunuch Li,

433
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,850
for celebrating my birthday today.

434
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,570
Your Grace,

435
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,350
I have not found any information

436
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,700
on the young eunuch
by His Majesty's side.

437
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,200
You found nothing?

438
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,050
Yes.

439
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,020
However, his actions are very strange.

440
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,700
He will always walk around

441
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,350
with a wash basin late at night.

442
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,240
Your Grace,

443
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,480
Minister Gu is here.

444
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,980
Send him in.

445
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,250
I have something to tell you.

446
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,680
I found out from our informant

447
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,480
that the Empress Dowager
is going to arrange a match for you.

448
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,000
What do you plan to do?

449
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,240
The Empress Dowager

450
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,640
is trying to test my love for Wan.

451
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,440
If I don't agree to it,

452
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,970
she will think

453
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,200
that I still love Wan.

454
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,430
She will be wary of me.

455
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,130
Then, Wan...

456
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,800
I know what I'm doing.

457
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,100
[Eunuch Quarters]

458
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,230
Why is the water

459
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,730
getting lower and lower?

460
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,900
What is this place?

461
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,900
Why would people steal water?

462
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,730
Should I give it a try?

463
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,140
Perhaps I can go back
even if there's not a lot of it.

464
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,350
No.

465
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,570
Once more.

466
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,180
I must succeed this time.

467
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,780
Eunuch Li,

468
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,920
are you bathing this late at night.

469
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,330
Bai Lian.

470
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,470
Qi Su.

471
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,070
Prince Heqin.

472
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,350
I...

473
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,950
Xu hour.

474
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,110
It is a dry night.

475
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,320
Be careful of fire.

476
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,170
Greetings, Prince Heqin.

477
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,170
Is Your Grace here at this hour

478
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,010
because you need something?

479
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,010
Shall I fetch Steward Huang?

480
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:57,570
No need.

481
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,080
I saw a cat sneak in here.

482
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,130
It was very cute,

483
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,180
so I followed it.

484
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,430
You may leave.

485
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,520
Yes.

486
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,440
Come out.

487
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,500
Thank you, Prince Heqin.

488
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,960
I won't tell anyone else,

489
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,510
but there are many eyes in the palace.

490
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,090
You must be careful.

491
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,130
Shoot.

492
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,640
I was discovered by Prince Heqin.

493
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,080
Still, he agreed to keep it a secret.

494
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,350
How very kind of him.

495
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:39,750
Your Grace,

496
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,860
that person is just an ordinary eunuch

497
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,990
by His Majesty's side.

498
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,100
Why check him out yourself?

499
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,560
She's a woman.

500
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,770
How can she be an ordinary eunuch?

501
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,300
A woman?

502
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,460
Since you found out,

503
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,370
why didn't you expose her?

504
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,680
She is currently important to Qi Yan.

505
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,540
Perhaps we can obtain information

506
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,920
on Qi Yan from her in the future.

507
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,720
Keep an eye on her.

508
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,240
Yes.

509
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,640
We can give you one more day.

510
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,640
If you still can't draw it out,

511
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,430
we will cut your wage.

512
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,340
Vertical access. Qanat channel.
Qanat outlet.

513
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,210
Whatever.

514
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,900
I'll just draw a rough draft.

515
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,210
I'll think about it
after I pass this test.

516
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,600
The Emperor has arrived.

517
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,460
All hail Our Majesty, long live,
long live, long live!

518
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,320
All rise.

519
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

520
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,700
Your Majesty,

521
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,730
the drought has caused famine

522
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,660
to spread across lands
such as Lu and Guan Counties.

523
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,390
The refugees created

524
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,390
have gone as far as the borders.

525
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,430
The food shortage must be resolved soon.

526
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,830
Your Majesty,

527
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,830
Lu County's situation is the worst.

528
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,240
Why not send Prince Heqin there
for observation

529
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,400
and calm the citizens?

530
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,200
We will naturally have a solution
for the food shortage.

531
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,200
No need to say any further.

532
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,790
May we know what solution
Your Majesty has in mind?

533
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,680
Minister Gu,

534
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,410
must His Majesty report to you

535
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,860
about everything he does?

536
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,280
I wouldn't dare.

537
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,480
However, right now,

538
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,760
there is discontent among the citizens.

539
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,050
Their lives are hard.

540
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,050
This cannot drag on any longer.

541
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,090
The citizens
are the country's foundation.

542
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,040
If we lose their loyalty,

543
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,220
the kingdom will be lost.

544
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:35,750
Prince Heqin...

545
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,380
Insolence!

546
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,440
Judging by what you say,

547
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,680
my throne

548
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,890
should be given to Prince Heqin.

549
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,300
Please have mercy.

550
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,000
We will have a resolution

551
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,380
on the Lu County famine

552
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,000
in one month's time.

553
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,380
I am tired.

554
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,880
You may leave.

555
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,450
Court dismissed.

556
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,920
His Majesty

557
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,440
is becoming more absurd.

558
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,200
He doesn't act like an emperor anymore.

559
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,370
He is just fooling around.

560
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,840
Let's see what happens in a month.

561
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Where is Eunuch Li?

562
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,380
Your Majesty,

563
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,940
Eunuch Li must be slacking off again.

564
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,940
I'll get him.

565
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,020
Your Majesty.

566
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,680
Lu Huan,

567
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,650
wait outside.

568
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,930
Your Majesty,

569
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,660
Eunuch Li

570
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,670
has impure desires for you.

571
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,520
When did I ever?

572
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:46,940
Look.

573
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,650
He dares act without propriety.

574
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,150
Leave.

575
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,240
Yes.

576
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,530
Your Majesty,

577
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,740
I have completed

578
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,970
what I promised you.

579
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,610
We have never seen
such a way canals could be built.

580
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,480
Is this from your hometown as well?

581
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,000
However,

582
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,000
there are no numbers on here.

583
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,870
That...

584
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,760
That is because the blueprint
will be very complicated then.

585
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,760
I don't specialize in this.

586
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,760
Please ask Scholar Zhen

587
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,840
to complete the draft.

588
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,440
Yes.

589
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,590
The blueprint...

590
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,110
I'm up so early,

591
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,620
yet I don't get an afternoon nap.

592
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,420
It's illogical.

593
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,240
If you can't wake up,

594
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,850
just tell His Majesty.

595
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,450
He is not that kind.

596
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,250
It's him.

597
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,630
Are they looking at me or you?

598
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,940
Of course, it's you.

599
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,780
Why me?

600
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,620
Don't you know?

601
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,140
Know what?

602
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,550
There is so much gossip in the palace.

603
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,370
It won't be good for me
to tell you, the star of it all.

604
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,920
Tell me.

605
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,080
In the past,

606
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,400
His Majesty refused to do it
with Consort Wan.

607
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,650
After some time,

608
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,180
people are saying

609
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,630
that His Majesty likes men.

610
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,460
And?

611
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,550
Last night,

612
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,550
a few eunuchs

613
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,950
saw you and His Majesty
in the Imperial Garden...

614
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,950
What were you doing?

615
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:49,860
Look.

616
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,740
Who is His Majesty with?

617
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,670
It's Eunuch Li.

618
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,250
How can it be?

619
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,720
I'm a girl.

620
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,690
I know that.

621
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,830
Does His Majesty know?

622
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,000
If he doesn't know,

623
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,760
could it be he really likes men?

624
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,720
Why else would His Majesty's harem
be so empty?

625
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,040
Even on the night he spent
with Consort Wan,

626
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,200
I hear

627
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,950
he used a drug.

628
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,500
Look.

629
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,140
[Why Must the Emperor Marry Me?]

630
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,900
Why Must the Emperor Marry Me?

631
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,310
What is this trash you always read?

632
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,800
Don't look down on it.

633
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
This book is very popular.

634
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,320
This book writes

635
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,680
that an emperor fell in love
with a eunuch,

636
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,590
but the eunuch
is actually a girl in disguise.

637
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,560
What then?

638
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,760
Then, when the Empress Dowager
found out,

639
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,180
she believed it was treason
to lie to the Emperor,

640
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,320
so the eunuch was killed.

641
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,540
No way.

642
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,990
This palace is too dangerous.

643
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,560
I must find some water to go home.
