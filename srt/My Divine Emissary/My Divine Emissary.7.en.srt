Do you know what "Lingchi" is?

to cut the flesh from your body.

Besides, he probably
hasn't been sleeping well.

would anger the heaven.

This matter is because of me.

177
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,760
I failed to protect those around me.

178
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,120

It might be able to cure
the Empress Dowager's illness.

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,800
What is it?

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,320
The Empress Dowager
punished Emissary Xiao

192
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,120
because she found out

193
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,440
Your Majesty didn't want
to merge with me.

194
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,400
Your Majesty...

195
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Please stop.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,920
I couldn't do that because...

197
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,280
It was my decision without your consent.

198
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,360
Please forgive me.

199
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm tired.

200
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,120
I'll go back and rest first.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,960
It's because we'll both
end up regretting it.

202
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
I'm so miserable.

203
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,440
When people go time-travel,

204
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,160
they usually become
a princess or an empress.

205
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,680
But me?

206
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,720
From a divine emissary to an eunuch,

207
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,720
now I'm a demon.

208
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
I wonder how the Empress Dowager
is doing now.

209
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,080
You can do it!

210
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,160
Are you alright?

211
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,680
I'm fine, I'm fine.

212
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,200
You sprained your ankle.

213
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,280
Don't move.

214
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,920
I can't.

215
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,200
I have to stand up.

216
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,880
I still need to deliver these clothes

217
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,400
to the Noble Consort.

218
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
If I'm late,

219
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll be punished.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,520
Aren't you working
in the imperial kitchen?

221
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Yeah.

222
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,640
This is a last-minute order.

223
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,400
That's why I'm in a hurry.

224
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Guard Kong,

225
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,120
help me up.

226
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,240
I can do it.

227
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,800
If worst comes to worst,

228
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,440
I'll break this leg.

229
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,800
I can take it.

230
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,240
Let me help you deliver them.

231
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,520
You guard the door.

232
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,400
Do not let anyone in.

233
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,920
Guard Kong,

234
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,600
you're such a good person.

235
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,990
Eunuch Li.

236
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,560
Eunuch Li.

237
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,720
Why are you still hiding here?

238
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,680
Zhou Quan?

239
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,880
What are you doing here?

240
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,400
I heard that the Empress Dowager
fainted because of you.

241
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,440
So you've heard about it too.

242
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,840
It's not just me.

243
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,360
The whole palace knows.

244
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,840
If you can't cure
the Empress Dowager's illness

245
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,680
within three days,

246
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,000
you'll be beheaded.

247
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,650
What...?

248
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,120
What's going on?

249
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,040
It must be that Chancellor Cui

250
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
trying to take this
opportunity to kill me.

251
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,400
How would I know how to cure illnesses?

252
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm not my mom.

253
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,520
Anyway, I rushed over to find you

254
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,880
when I heard the news.

255
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Let's go. Run away and save yourself.

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,880
Ow, it hurts.

257
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,360
Someone's coming.

258
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,960
How come you're standing?

259
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Your foot doesn't hurt anymore?

260
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,200
It does.

261
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,280
It hurts a lot.

262
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,440
But you were gone for so long.

263
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
I was worried that you'd be punished
by the Empress Dowager.

264
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,120
No.

265
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Guard Kong,

266
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
can you do me another favor?

267
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,600
What is it?

268
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,760
Can you please walk me back?

269
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,320
I sprained my ankle.

270
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
I can't walk on my own.

271
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,800
But...

272
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,720
I should've been more considerate.

274
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,800
I'll go back on my own.

275
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,920
Forget it.

276
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,600
I'll walk you back first.

277
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,280
Are you alright with your injuries?

278
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm fine.

279
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,600
Escaping is more important.

280
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,080
Let's go, hurry.

281
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,080
I've got my clothes for you

282
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
in this package.

283
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,280
Remember to change
when you leave the palace.

284
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,320
Thank you.

285
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,680
Why are you carrying this?

286
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,760
In case someone finds out I've escaped

287
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
and tries to catch me,

288
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,640
these shoes will help me run faster.

289
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,480
The shoes from your
hometown are so amazing.

290
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,360
Can they even speed you up?

291
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,920
That's right.

292
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,920
I hope I have a chance
to visit your hometown.

293
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,680
I bet there are many

294
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
great things to bring back.

295
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,320
Thank you for today.

296
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,520
What's the matter?

297
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,520
Do you look down on me?

298
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,640
Even if we're blood siblings
we still need to settle things clearly.

299
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,480
That was business before.

300
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm now just helping you out.

301
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,960
Asking to be paid for helping people?

302
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,120
Wouldn't I be too stingy?

303
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,120
Well, I'll accept it for now.

304
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
When I get really rich in the future,

305
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,240
I'll keep you.

306
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,200
No need.

307
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,080
Maybe next time,

308
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,760
I'll get to borrow these shoes from you.

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,800
Sure thing!

310
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,080
I'm going to leave first. Take care.

311
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,640
Be careful.

312
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
How's Eunuch Li?

313
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,440
Guard Kong went to find out just now.

314
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,480
Eunuch Li has already left the palace.

315
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,120
She's quite smart.

316
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,720
Kong An.

317
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Follow her out of the palace

318
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,440
and protect her discreetly.

319
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,160
Your Majesty.

320
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
What should we do
about the Empress Dowager's illness?

321
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,680
Post imperial notices

322
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
and invite renowned physicians.

323
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Come and have a look.

324
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,920
It'll be absolutely fine.

325
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Goodbye.

326
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,240
Please.

327
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,560
Here you are.

328
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,600
What would you like, Miss?

329
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,840
Waiter,

330
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,560
give me a bowl of dry-tossed noodles

331
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
with an extra poached egg.

332
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,560
Alright.

333
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,200
Please wait.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,040
If the Empress Dowager's illness
doesn't improve soon,

335
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,840
the Emperor's days
might not be easy either.

336
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
That's just his incompetence.

337
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,520
He lives an extravagant life.

338
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
He's oppressive and incompetent.

339
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,920
Now there are rumors

340
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,760
that the late Emperor
was cursed to death by him back then.

341
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,560
Now it's the Empress Dowager's turn.

342
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Hard to believe!

343
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,360
Why not?

344
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,600
Just look at his miserable face.

345
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,960
Did you have dinner with the Emperor

346
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,920
or did you sleep with him?

347
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,640
How do you know he's so doomed?

348
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,880
What's it to you?

349
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,200
Openly insulting others

350
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
or fabricating facts to slander them.

351
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,120
That's serious offence,

352
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,480
probably imprisonment
of less than three years.

353
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,360
Do you know that?

354
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,440
Is she alright?

355
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,280
Speak like a normal person.

356
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,760
If you keep doing this,

357
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,680
I'll have the Emperor arrest all of you.

358
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Come on, come on!

359
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,280
Go ahead.

360
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
Hurry and have the emperor arrest me.

361
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,080
Come on, come on,

362
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,800
Quickly.

363
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,800
Come on, come on.

364
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,800
I have a bad temper.

365
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,240
Prince Heqin,

366
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
you're not here to arrest me, are you?

367
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,600
Prince Heqin.

368
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
Greetings to Prince Heqin.

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,680
Lanterns.

370
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,640
Come have a look.

371
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,240
Lanterns.

372
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
These were all made yesterday.

373
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,440
It felt so good just now.

374
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
Even though the last time in the prison,

375
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,680
the prince have saved me twice already.

376
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,520
Thank you.

377
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,160
Emissary Xiao, you're being polite.

378
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,000
Come take a look.

379
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,080
Mint for cooling,

380
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
white kudzu for treating dampness,

381
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,000
and these herbal pillows,

382
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,920
for invigorating the blood

383
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,120
and brightening the mind.

384
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,840
What are your plans for the future?

385
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,560
Emissary Xiao.

386
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,040
Emissary?

387
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,320
Actually,

388
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,840
I'm not an emissary,

389
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,640
nor do I want to be one.

390
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
I just want to go home immediately,

391
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,360
watch some movies while eating snacks,

392
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,200
and watch dramas non-stop all day.

393
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,280
Watch movies,

394
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
eat snacks,

395
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,400
watch dramas?

396
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,920
Are these

397
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,560
activities from your hometown?

398
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,990
Yeah.

399
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
My hometown is very different from here.

400
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,560
Life there is very comfortable.

401
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,160
But in the palace,

402
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
as the emperor's concubine,

403
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,560
you can also live comfortably.

404
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,200
So, have you really decided to leave?

405
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,680
Doesn't matter if it's a monk,

406
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,200
an emissary, or a concubine,

407
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,880
none of them is what I want.

408
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,960
You're truly special.

409
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,760
Special?

410
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
I guess I'm just specially
good at avoiding things.

411
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,960
I'll tell you the truth.

412
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,920
I sneaked out of the palace.

413
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,360
I can't cure the empress
dowager's illness at all.

414
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,160
Although everyone sees me

415
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,920
as an extremely smart divine emissary.

416
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,720
But back home,

417
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm just a useless student.

418
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,840
When faced with problems,
I only know how to run away.

419
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
Would you like to see this, miss?

420
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,520
Look.

421
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,920
Just like it,

422
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,520
always hiding on its own.

423
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
So pathetic.

424
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,960
I believe growing up
doesn't mean getting stronger.

425
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,480
It's about learning how to be weak.

426
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,280
If on the battlefield,

427
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,200
you know the enemy is strong,

428
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,440
and your chances of winning are slim,

429
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
yet you're still charging in,

430
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
you're only going to end up losing.

431
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,200
Some sacrifices

432
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
are completely unnecessary,

433
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,440
aren't they?

434
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,560
Are you saying this just to comfort me?

435
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,200
Actually,

436
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,640
everyone wants to

437
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,400
run away at some point.

438
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
Don't demand too much from yourself.

439
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,240
When you've figured things out
and you're ready,

440
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,880
then you can face them.

441
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,040
Everyone needs breathing space.

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,400
In accordance with the will
of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

443
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
we are broadly inviting
renowned physicians,

444
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
anyone who can cure the Empress Dowager

445
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,090
will be rewarded
with a hundred taels of silver.

446
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,620
Let's go,

447
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,730
let's go have a look.

448
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,940
A hundred taels? Wow!

449
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,200
The Empress Dowager
has been awake for a day

450
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,560
but still feels dizzy.

451
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,640
Headache persists.

452
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,720
Difficult to stand.

453
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,600
Headache again?

454
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,440
Is it cervical spondylosis?

455
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
I told you to exercise more regularly.

456
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,720
Wait.

457
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Let me do some moxibustion for you,

458
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,880
then massage it. It'll be fine.

459
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,320
Could it be cervical spondylosis?

460
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,560
You see.

461
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,480
These imperial invitations
are posted everywhere.

462
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,320
But so far,

463
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
no one has come forward to accept it.

464
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,160
The Empress Dowager's illness
might not be curable.

465
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
I heard that even the divine emissary
have run away overnight.

466
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,080
Really?

467
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,960
Yes.

468
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,080
What divine emissary?

469
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,000
I think he's just a fraud.

470
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,640
What was the Emperor thinking?

471
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,560
How could he be fooled

472
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,120
by such awful tricks.

473
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,880
You know,

474
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,080
if anything happens
to the Empress Dowager,

475
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,920
judging by the Emperor's

476
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,360
incompetent looks,

477
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,920
I'm afraid the Qi Kingdom is in trouble.

478
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,640
Drag her out and execute her.

479
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,920
Let go of me!

480
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,280
Hurry!

481
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm innocent!

482
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,760
It's not me!

483
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,920
Let go of me!

484
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,800
She's my people!

485
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,160
Your Majesty!

486
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,360
Who dares to touch her?

487
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,200
Don't be afraid.

488
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,480
I'm here.

489
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
From now on without my permission,

490
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,670
no one

491
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,920
is allowed to touch her!

492
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,280
You're real, Your Majesty.

493
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,160
Why did she accept
the imperial invitation?

494
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,840
Someone accepted it.

495
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,040
If she accepts the imperial invitation,

496
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,360
then there's hope.

497
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
It's my incompetence.

498
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,480
I couldn't find a remedy
to cure the Empress Dowager.

499
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,120
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

500
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,270
Your Majesty.

501
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,460
Your Majesty.

502
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,160
Someone has accepted the invitation.

503
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,000
You...

504
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,680
Don't you have

505
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,720
anything to explain to me?

506
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,600
The Empress Dowager

507
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,560
fainted because of me
in the first place,

508
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
and...

509
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,280
And what?

510
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,040
And Your Majesty have saved me before.

511
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,160
So I cannot abandon Your Majesty.

512
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,920
But aren't you worried
of not being able to cure her illness?

513
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
You'll be executed, you know?

514
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,260
I'm worried.

515
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,040
Very worried.

516
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,080
Extremely worried.

517
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,040
But...

518
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,920
I believe Your Majesty will protect me.

519
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,680
Right?

520
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,320
Anyway,

521
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,200
I don't have much time
and have important tasks to do now.

522
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,440
I need to discuss
with the imperial physician

523
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,640
about the Empress Dowager's illness.

524
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,080
Also,

525
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,200
where is the library?

526
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,440
Library?

527
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,160
The book depository?

528
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,900
[The Book Depository]

529
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,240
According to the imperial physician,

530
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,040
the Empress Dowager does indeed
have cervical spondylosis.

531
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,320
And she also has symptoms
of vomiting and diarrhea.

532
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,280
Mom mentioned before

533
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,600
that this seems to be symptoms
of cold and deficiency.

534
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,080
I need to check the medical books again

535
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,160
to see if there are any
treatment methods.

536
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,440
Ginger.

537
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,720
Its taste is slightly warm and pungent.

538
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,800
Enters the lung, spleen,
stomach meridians.

539
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,720
It help expels wind and coldness
warm the middle and prevent vomiting.

540
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,080
Warm the middle and prevent vomiting?

541
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
So, should I

542
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,280
add some ginger
to the moxibustion stick?

543
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,360
Who's there?

544
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
What are you hiding for?

545
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,960
Why are you hiding?

546
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,240
Emissary Xiao?

547
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,920
- Don't tell anyone.
- Don't tell anyone.

548
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,800
Your Highness.

549
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,480
Have you been under a lot
of pressure lately?

550
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
How did you know?

551
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,240
No, I haven't.

552
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,840
Although she's not Lin Duo,

553
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,520
but eating excessively when stressed

554
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,600
as a relief habit,

555
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,800
it's really the same.

556
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,480
Luckily,

557
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,640
you didn't hurt your tendons or bones.

558
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,560
It's okay.

559
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,960
Your Highness,

560
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,000
I feel like

561
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,960
you're like a good friend of mine.

562
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,720
I also feel that you are very familiar.

563
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,840
By the way,

564
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,560
are you really a divine emissary?

565
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,600
Actually, in my hometown,

566
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm just an ordinary girl.

567
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,120
Then your hometown

568
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,280
must be a really good place

569
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,000
to have such a personality like you.

570
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,680
Compared to where you are,

571
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,800
indeed it's nice.

572
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
In our place,

573
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,360
girls can

574
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,400
wear short skirts freely,

575
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,920
and cut their hair short casually.

576
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,440
Cut hair short?

577
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,600
They can also choose
the person they like.

578
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,280
If it doesn't work out,

579
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,560
they can separate anytime.

580
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,360
They can also do what they like to do,

581
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,160
regardless of gender.

582
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,480
Do what they like to do?

583
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,840
That's great.

584
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,600
Your Highness.

585
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,870
So,

586
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,400
do you like the Emperor?

587
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,960
I'm the Noble Consort,

588
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
so naturally I have to like him.

589
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,560
You either like him or you don't.

590
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,000
What do you mean "you have to like"?

591
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,880
Huai'an,

592
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,960
don't leave.

593
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,240
Last time you were drunk,

594
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,200
you kept calling out for Huai'an.

595
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,480
Is Huai'an His Majesty's nickname?

596
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
This matter,

597
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,640
you must not tell anyone.

598
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,000
Now everything

599
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,760
is in our hands.

600
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,720
Shouldn't we consider

601
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
the next plan.

602
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,720
I have my plans.

603
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
I've slowly gained

604
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,120
the trust of

605
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,680
the little eunuch.

606
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,960
We might be able to start from her.

607
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,240
I want to personally

608
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,920
destroy he loves most.

609
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,920
Let him feel the pain of losing someone.

610
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,200
Dang, dang, dang!

611
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,160
Your Majesty,

612
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,880
I've figured out of a way
to cure the Empress Dowager's illness.

613
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:02,760
Is this...

614
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Is this a portrait of me?

615
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,880
This is a human anatomy chart.

617
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,200
Human Anatomy Chart.

618
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,280
Your Majesty,
you don't even know what this is?

619
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,520
This is the stomach.

620
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,680
Here are the intestines.

621
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,720
What's this?

622
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,480
This is the heart.

623
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Place your hand here, Your Majesty.

624
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,040
Do you feel it beating?

625
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,200
No.

626
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,760
No beats.

627
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,800
Your Majesty.

628
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,240
The heart is slightly
left from the center.

629
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,200
Your Majesty wear
such thick clothing everyday,

630
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,760
of course you don't feel anything.

631
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,920
But when you meet someone you like,

632
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,280
you feel it right here,
pounding, pounding crazily.

633
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,420
So...

634
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
what's this?

635
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,520
This is the cervical vertebra.

636
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,520
Your Majesty,

637
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,760
try feeling it.

638
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,480
Does it feel a little uncomfortable?

639
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,320
Indeed it does.

640
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,200
You ancient people,

641
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,040
sleeping with such high pillows,

642
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,920
plus heavy hair ornaments,

643
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,760
surely you're going to have neck issues.

644
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,240
Here, take a look.

645
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,240
The nerves of the cervical vertebrae
are connected to the head.

646
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,600
If the cervical vertebra
is uncomfortable,

647
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,920
there's insufficient blood
supply to the head,

648
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,840
that could lead to dizziness
and nausea for the Empress Dowager.

649
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,640
So,

650
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,160
do you have a way to cure it?

651
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,040
Chronic illnesses can't
easily be cured in a short time.

652
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But I reckon we can give these a try,

653
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,520
cupping and moxibustion.

654
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,480
It think it's worth a try.

655
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,480
Your Majesty,

656
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,840
do you have any glass around here?

657
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,160
Glass?

658
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,720
Forget it.

659
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,840
If you don't have glass,
you should at least have bamboo, right?

660
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,040
We've got bamboo.

661
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,520
Just this piece, eh?

662
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,960
Alright.

663
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,920
Take it slow.

664
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,920
Come on, come on.

665
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,360
There we go.

666
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,000
Let me give it a try.

667
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Help me pass this to Emissary Xiao.

668
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,280
Please thank the Empress Dowager for me.

669
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,730
Yes.

670
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,880
Your Majesty.

671
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,050
My tools are all set.

672
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,050
Look at those dark circles
under your eyes.

673
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,040
It's alright.

674
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,710
Let's try it first.

675
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,470
I brought some food for you.

676
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,240
You need to eat to have energy.

677
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,030
Delicious!

678
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,030
How good is it?

679
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,490
Really good!

680
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,480
Give it a taste.

681
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,730
When you meet someone you like,

682
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,380
you feel it right here,

683
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,270
pounding,

684
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,460
pounding crazily.

685
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,730
How could I have
this feeling for this woman?

686
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,480
Impossible.

687
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,850
Can't be.

688
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,880
Impossible.

689
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,080
Don't you like it?

690
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,370
Your Majesty.

691
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,160
What's wrong?

692
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,160
