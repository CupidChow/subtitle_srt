00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,320
Where are you from, Sirs?

192
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,000
We're here for business from Su City.

193
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,760
Recently,

194
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,040
noble young men
from all over have come here.

195
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,480
They come from the north and the south.

196
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm no stranger to it.

197
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,080
Why did all those nobles

198
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,240
come all the way here?

199
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,600
They're here
for the daughter of the Sai family.

200
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,280
The Sai family?

201
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,000
You mean from the Sai Family Escort?

202
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,040
Yes, that's right.

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
You must be here
to propose as well, right?

204
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,640
If you're chosen as a son-in-law
by the Sai family,

205
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,200
you'll be half as powerful as a prince.

206
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,280
Still, Sai Xue,
the Sai family's daughter,

207
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,520
is infamous
for being unruly and willful.

208
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
She has already scared off many suitors.

209
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
Propose what?

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
We are passing by for business.

211
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,760
How about this?

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
Bring us a few of the local dishes.

213
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,760
Alright.

214
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,480
Give us a moment.

215
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,120
The food will be served soon.

216
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,160
Young Master,

217
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
the Sai family has arranged

218
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,160
for a meeting with the creator of the
washing equipment at this tea house.

219
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,760
Why isn't anyone here?

220
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,840
No rush.

221
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Since I've thrown out my lure,

222
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
the fish will bite.

223
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,200
Look closely, everyone.

224
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
Look.

225
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,000
Miss,

226
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,280
why don't
we go to the second floor room today?

227
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,720
What can I see in second floor room?

228
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,400
Have you forgotten

229
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
the goal of my trip here?

230
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,800
Don't blink.

231
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,560
Whoa!

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
I'll show you another.

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,280
What are they doing?

234
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
I think it's a magic show.

235
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,640
Come.

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,880
Let's have a look.

237
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,200
Let me show you another.

238
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,360
Amazing.

239
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,080
Miss,

240
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,640
it's actually very simple.

241
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,400
If you want to do it, you can.

242
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,840
Miss, you sound like
you know a few tricks.

243
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,560
Mengmeng,

244
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,800
show him a trick.

245
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,640
Come on.

246
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,240
- Whoa!
- Amazing!

247
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,080
That's good.

248
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,920
She really knows one.

249
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,720
Good.

250
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,580
The purse.

251
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
My purse is missing.

252
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,700
Halt!

253
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,240
Leave the purse behind.

254
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,480
My purse.

255
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,200
It really was him.

263
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,080
Miss, I...

264
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,440
Since you've met,

265
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll head back to the warehouse.

266
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,020
Miss,

267
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,720
a big client came to the store today.

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,720
But he said before he put in an order,

269
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,120
he wanted to meet

270
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,160
the creator of the washing equipment.

271
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Are you the client Fu mentioned?

272
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,360
Let's go.

273
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
What is with you?

274
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
You said you are here
for a business deal.

275
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,720
Then without saying a word,

276
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,040
you want to drag my maid away.

277
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
Your maid?

278
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,520
It's written down in ink.

279
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Don't believe me? You can ask her.

280
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,360
I want your maid.

281
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,720
You're quite arrogant.

282
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,580
Let's go.

283
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,200
Hurry.

284
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,440
That man is quite interesting.

285
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Everyone, listen up.

286
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,880
Anyone who can

287
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
capture the man in white

288
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
and bring him to the Sai Family Escort

289
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,360
will be awarded 50 taels.

290
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,040
Fifty taels?

291
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,940
[Safe Travels]

292
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,040
Stop!

293
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,840
Mister,

294
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,080
someone is chasing us.

295
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,040
Halt!

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,400
Stop running!

297
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,120
Halt!

298
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,040
Stop right there!

299
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,760
Miss,

300
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,960
it's that carriage.

301
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,120
Yang City is my territory.

302
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,200
As I said,

303
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,720
whatever I want,

304
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,600
it cannot...

305
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,880
Where are they?

306
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,560
Of course, they're gone.

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,680
Who are you?

308
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Whoever. It's not important.

309
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,200
How is it not important?

310
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Am I not important?

311
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,700
Insolence!

312
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
Stop yakking!

313
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,240
Continue the chase.

314
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,480
Yang City

315
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,520
is more interesting than they say.

316
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,960
Smart move, Mister.

317
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,520
We easily got rid of them.

318
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,560
Mengmeng,

319
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,960
where did you go?

320
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,440
I thought you...

321
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,640
You don't understand

322
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,400
how much he has suffered

323
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,520
to search for you.

324
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,200
He didn't eat or drink.

325
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,640
He couldn't sleep at all every night.

326
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,480
Look at how much weight he had lost.

327
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,400
Miss, don't you want to go home?

328
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
Then,

329
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
when can I go home?

330
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
Your home

331
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,320
is very far away.

332
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,120
Originally, you were close to home.

333
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,200
Originally?

334
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,320
What about now?

335
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,040
Right now,

336
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,920
you will be tied down by love.

337
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,560
Love?

338
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,400
Love will not only

339
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,960
be an obstacle to your way home,

340
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,480
but also cause you and another person

341
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,960
to suffer greatly.

342
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,200
Suffer greatly?

343
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,320
We have to be separated sooner or later.

344
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Why not make use of this chance?

345
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
That way, our pain

346
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
will be lessened.

347
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,080
Mister,

348
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,240
please have some self-respect.

349
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
It's our first meeting.

350
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,160
You are being very rude.

351
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
First meeting?

352
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,320
Is it not?

353
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,520
What?

354
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,720
Do you know me?

355
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,760
If that is all,

356
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,400
I have to head back to my lady.

357
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,120
Mengmeng,

358
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,680
what are you saying?

359
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,920
Mister!

360
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,960
This is kidnapping.

361
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,640
Do you know that?

362
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,760
Mengmeng,

363
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,640
do you really not remember me?

364
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
I don't even know you.

365
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Is there anything else?

366
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,160
If that's all, I'm leaving.

367
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
Mister, they've caught up to us.

368
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,840
Your Majesty,

369
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,080
we'll lure them away.

370
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,420
Let's go.

371
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,120
Let's go.

372
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,480
Let's go.

373
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,840
They're over there. After them!

374
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,840
Stop running!

375
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,300
Hurry!

376
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,960
After them!

377
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,640
Run!

378
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,880
You dragged my maid away
from under my nose.

379
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Miss.

380
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,280
What?

381
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,280
Are you trying to attract my attention?

382
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,840
What do you want?

383
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,840
I want you to be my husband.

384
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,080
- What?
- What?

385
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,360
I don't care which family you're from,

386
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,960
but if you marry in,

387
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,400
half of the Sai family will be yours.

388
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,440
Don't even think about it.

389
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
That is not up to you.

390
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,280
There's nothing I can't get,

391
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,840
just what I don't want.

392
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm already engaged.

393
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,920
What?

394
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,720
It's to her.

395
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,320
Are you engaged to her?

396
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,880
That's right.

397
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,160
Is this true?

398
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,200
Miss,

399
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,040
he's lying.

400
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,880
Save me.

401
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,080
She has only forgotten about me.

402
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,560
We are from Su City's

403
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
renowned merchant families.

404
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,880
Last month,

405
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
an accident happened back home.

406
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,960
And she went missing.

407
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,160
I am here in Yang City

408
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
to look for her.

409
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,800
However, she said she ran away

410
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,400
because she didn't want to get married.

411
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,040
She lied.

412
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,720
Mengmeng.

413
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,400
I don't remember anything.

414
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,840
If you will give us your approval,

415
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,080
I have a military supplies order.

416
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,040
When the time comes,

417
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
I might be one escort team short.

418
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,600
You are a good negotiator.

419
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,800
But Mengmeng

420
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,160
belongs to the Sai Residence.

421
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,640
I can't let her

422
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,760
be taken away by just anyone.

423
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,960
What do you say?

424
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,440
You're right, Miss Sai.

425
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,640
How about this?

426
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,560
You'll follow me to my residence.

427
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,120
We'll plan for the long-term.

428
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,600
How about it?

429
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,680
Mister.

430
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
It just happens I want to head there too

431
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,280
to investigate
the disaster relief supplies.

432
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
I leave it to you, Miss Sai.

433
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,520
This way.

434
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,960
Back to the residence.

435
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,940
Let's go.

436
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,800
Over there.

437
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,600
I'm sorry, Young Master.

438
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,560
We failed in our task

439
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,760
and allowed another
to take the spotlight.

440
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,120
I heard the Sai family's daughter

441
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,600
has invited that man
to the Sai Residence.

442
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do you have an idea in mind,
Young Master?

443
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,400
You don't need to follow me
for the next few days.

444
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,960
Dismissed.

445
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,740
That...

446
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,420
[Sai Family Escort]

447
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,480
Just what on earth

448
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
is all this nonsense?

449
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,760
How can Eunuch Li have forgotten us?

450
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Also, when did His Majesty

451
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,040
get engaged to her?

452
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,920
We will have to hang her up

453
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,200
and beat her for three whole days.

454
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,040
It's not that bad.

455
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,520
Why are you so calm?

456
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,800
His Majesty likes her.

457
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,520
His Majesty likes her?

458
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,640
Wait. Why did I not see it?

459
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,000
True, love is a weakness of mine.

460
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,080
Wait, but I didn't see
any hint of it at all.

461
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,280
Wait for me.

462
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,840
I'm not the last one to know, right?

463
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,160
This way, Mister.

464
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,160
What is your name?

465
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
My surname is Yan.

466
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,320
Mister Yan.

467
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,120
These two are...

468
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,080
They're my attendants.

469
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,960
Lingdang,

470
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,880
serve the tea.

471
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,400
Yes.

472
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,360
This is good quality
First Flush Longjing tea.

473
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Have a taste.

474
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,680
It is good tea,

475
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,960
but you probably have it wrong.

476
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,760
This is Second Flush Longjing tea.

477
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
How can it be?

478
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,400
Rain is sparse in early spring

479
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,680
and the leaves are younger.

480
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,120
Tea made with them are mellow and sweet

481
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,720
with only a mildly bitter taste.

482
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
My apologies.

483
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
The servants must have made a mistake.

484
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,920
Still, you know tea well.

485
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,080
You must be from a great family.

486
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,040
Only due to my father's connections.

487
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,840
About the deal you mentioned before...

488
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,520
No need to rush, Miss Sai.

489
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,240
How about this?

490
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,840
My father will be returning
in a few days.

491
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,400
If we have the deal settled then,

492
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
it is up to Mengmeng

493
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,440
if she wants to stay or go.

494
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,560
Really?

495
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,520
What?

496
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,440
Do you not want that?

497
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,080
I do.

498
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,640
What do you think, Mister?

499
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,560
No problem.

500
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,080
It's getting late.

501
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,480
I've arranged a few rooms for you.

502
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,680
Please rest well.

503
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,560
Mister Yan,

504
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,440
we're here.

505
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,120
Stop.

506
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,800
Aren't you going to clean up my room?

507
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,760
You have them, don't you?

508
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,600
If you don't want to,

509
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll have to tell Miss Sai.

510
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,640
You...

511
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,520
Miss,

512
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
do you really plan to make a deal

513
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,440
with him?

514
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,840
Of course.

515
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,600
Do you still want

516
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,240
to marry Mister Yan?

517
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,480
He is tough,

518
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,280
but I can give it a go.

519
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,960
Miss,

520
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,160
there is a man outside
asking to see you.

521
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,040
A man?

522
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,440
We meet again.

523
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,560
Leave us.

524
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,320
Who are you?

525
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
It is the second time

526
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,080
you asked me that.

527
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,320
Look at my face.

528
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,760
Do you think I'm a stranger?

529
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,720
Do you not recognize me?

530
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,640
See him out.

531
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,600
Since you don't recognize me,

532
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,240
then it looks like this jade

533
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,800
- isn't yours.
- My jade. You...

534
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,720
If you want it back,

535
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
agree to my simple conditions.

536
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,160
No one has ever threatened me before.

537
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,200
Who is this man?

538
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,360
No wonder everyone here

539
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,840
cowers when they hear your name.

540
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,680
You really are a bully.

541
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,560
You talk too much.

542
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,000
I might just sew your lips together.

543
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
I mean to say we can work together.

544
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,600
Just think about it.

545
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,440
Our goals are aligned.

546
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,080
You want the man.

547
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,080
I want your maid.

548
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,840
How meaningless.

549
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,280
Do you not want

550
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
to put up a fight?

551
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,200
In this world,

552
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,240
there aren't many men

553
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,640
you like.

554
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,360
You have to seize your chance.

555
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,240
How do you want to do this?

556
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,520
Mister,

557
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,440
the bed is ready.

558
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,520
I'll take my leave.

559
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,520
What are you doing?

560
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,760
Did you create the washing equipment

561
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,840
in the Sai family's emporium?

562
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,400
Why do you suddenly ask that?

563
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,120
If you want to make a deal,

564
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,440
please talk to Miss Sai.

565
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,560
Before you left, you left behind

566
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,600
this draft for a washing equipment.

567
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,560
Why do you remember how
to make a washing equipment

568
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,920
and your own name,

569
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,440
but not remember me?

570
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,680
Mister,

571
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,920
you've got the wrong person.

572
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,200
Are you trying to avoid me?

573
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,960
Mister,

574
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,680
you over-think it.

575
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,600
Mengmeng.

576
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,120
We meet again, pretty lady.

577
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,720
Weren't you at the tea house?

578
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,240
Why are you here?

579
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,560
I naturally came here for you.

580
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,600
After all,
you exposed my secrets in public.

581
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,200
When it comes to magic,

582
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,440
I have never lost.

583
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,160
Still, your trick today

584
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,320
had me at a loss

585
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
the entire day.

586
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,480
I want to prove myself

587
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,760
and challenge you.

588
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,480
What do you want?

589
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,020
I understand.

590
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
Is the key to the flower

591
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,080
around your chest?

592
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,040
Ouch!

593
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,960
What are you doing?

594
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,920
I just want to talk to the pretty lady.

595
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,880
Do you need to be so vicious?

596
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,800
Just what do you want?

597
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,480
Sai Xue asked me
to call you over for a meal.

598
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
This is Mister Li,

599
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,520
also a guest at Sai Residence.

600
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,840
I didn't think
I would cause a misunderstanding

601
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,760
by not mentioning him to you earlier.

602
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,480
Mengmeng,

603
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,160
you must be hungry too.

604
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,360
Sit down and eat with us.

605
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,960
Mengmeng,

606
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,680
sit.

607
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,280
You two sit too.

608
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,320
Yes.

609
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,640
I especially prepared a few

610
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,160
of Yang City's specialty dishes.

611
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,680
Crab roe dumplings,

612
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,760
osmanthus and lotus root,

613
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
and sweet and sour ribs.

614
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,360
Try some.

615
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,720
Mengmeng,

616
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
sweet and sour ribs
in Yang City are the best.

617
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,080
Eat while they're hot.

618
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,920
Ribs are hard to digest.

619
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,560
Start with some lotus root.

620
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Why should you decide

621
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,560
what she eats first?

622
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,400
Because I understand her.

623
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
Did you not see?

624
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,920
She was staring at the ribs

625
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,880
the entire time.

626
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,640
Is that so?

627
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,480
See?

628
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,360
You don't understand her at all.

629
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
You just act according

630
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,160
to your own whims.

631
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,360
It's none of your business.

632
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,960
Here, Mengmeng.

633
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,660
Eat while it's hot.

634
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,720
Stop fighting.

635
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,320
I...

636
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,760
I can serve myself.

637
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,200
This is the signature dish
of the chef here.

638
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,840
A soup made with lotus root,
peanuts and pork ribs.

639
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,160
Try it while it's hot.

640
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
I'll help you.

641
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,600
Hot!

642
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,760
Here.

643
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,480
A tattoo belonging
to the royalty of Ximi.

644
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
Do you need some cream?

645
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,200
I'm fine.

646
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,960
It's nothing.

647
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,600
Let's keep eating.

648
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,240
It's nothing.

649
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,400
Mister Yan, try some as well.

650
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,720
Peanuts.

651
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,920
Okay.

652
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,800
Don't...!

653
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Why not?

654
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,480
I...

655
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,680
I think it's too hot.

656
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
Why not let it cool down?

657
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm not afraid of hot soup.

658
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,560
Mister.

659
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,520
Well?

660
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,560
Are you still dizzy?

661
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,280
Why did you have red rashes?

662
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,640
He's allergic to peanuts.

663
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,400
Why did you eat them then?

664
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
Luckily, he only drank the soup.

665
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,160
I'll have Fu get you a physician.

666
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,080
Don't bother.

667
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,000
I will be fine

668
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,880
after some rest.

669
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,960
In that case, rest well.

670
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,040
Call me if you need anything.

671
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Thank you.

672
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,760
Mister,

673
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,000
I'll go buy you some cream.

674
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,880
Hurry then.

675
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,600
Wait a while.

676
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,360
What to wait for?

677
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,240
It's clear
that hurting yourself doesn't work.

678
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,040
Perhaps Miss Li really has amnesia.

679
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,360
How do I give this cream to him?

680
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
Just what do I do?

681
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,840
I wonder if it's serious.

682
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,440
Mengmeng,

683
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,480
what are you doing?

684
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,360
Miss,

685
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,680
Mister Yan
likely has an allergic reaction.

686
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,680
Try this cream on him.

687
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,000
How did you know it was an allergy?

688
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,080
I...

689
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,440
I guessed.

690
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,520
Mengmeng,

691
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,200
are you hiding something from me?

692
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll give him the cream

693
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,920
and ask you again later.

694
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,680
Alright.

695
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,600
He should be fine with the cream.

696
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,560
Why are you back, Miss Sai?

697
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,040
This is cream for allergic reactions.

698
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,000
Put some on.

699
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,720
Thank you, Miss Sai.

700
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,680
I'll leave you to rest.

701
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,280
Your Majesty,

702
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
if you ask me,

703
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,280
the ungrateful girl

704
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,320
has forgotten all

705
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,440
about you.

706
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,120
Perhaps Miss Li has troubles of her own.

707
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,320
Troubles?

708
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
What trouble can she have?

709
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,720
Young Master has suffered a lot

710
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,880
just for her.

711
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,680
As for her,

712
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,800
she just turns a blind eye.

713
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,040
She won't even check on him.

714
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,200
I think

715
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,760
she and that Mister Li

716
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,720
are getting on quite well.

717
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,880
Perhaps she has already...

718
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,640
Enough.

719
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,080
Why are you angry at me?

720
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,600
Don't say any more.

721
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,040
I wonder how he is now.

722
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,240
Is he seriously sick?

723
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,440
But he's way too childish.

724
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,160
He actually tried
to test me using that trick.

725
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,800
Does he not care about his health?

726
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,000
Mister,

727
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,760
the investigation is done.

728
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,760
Sai Family Escort
is the best escort service in Yang City.

729
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,320
They don't just work with and are close

730
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,240
to merchants,

731
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,440
but they also work with the officials.

732
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,000
Look into Li Tao.

733
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,480
Why do you want to investigate him?

734
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,400
He has the tattoo of Ximi royalty.

735
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,440
Ximi royalty?

736
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,800
The current Ximi king only has two sons.

737
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
Judging by their ages,

738
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,680
he should be the second prince.

739
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
He is intentionally cozying
up to Mengmeng.

740
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm afraid Mengmeng could be hurt.

741
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
Get to the bottom of it soon.

742
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,640
Yes.

743
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,480
Mengmeng.

744
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,160
Just what unspoken troubles
are you facing

745
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,400
that make you pretend not to know me?

746
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,040
Is this just to reject me?

747
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,880
How did you know

748
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,000
if you love someone else,

749
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,320
I won't wish you well?

750
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,200
Your Majesty,

751
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,400
I'm sorry.

752
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,520
If doing this makes you hate me,

753
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,440
I'll keep the act up.

754
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,640
When I saw you,

755
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,840
I wanted to rush up to you

756
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,120
and hug you.

757
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,120
When you're sick,

758
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,320
I want to take care of you myself

759
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,400
and apply the ointments.

760
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,560
Although I can't repay you

761
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
for you have done for me,

762
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,480
but I can't be selfish.

763
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,360
Promise me.

764
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,120
Don't ever be hurt again

765
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,040
over someone who will have to leave.

766
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,120
Mengmeng,

767
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,040
I just knew you would come.

768
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,080
Mister,

769
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,960
you have the wrong person.

770
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,880
How can I have the wrong person?

771
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,320
Your Majesty.

772
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,000
Your Majesty.

773
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,320
Your Majesty.

774
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,520
What are you doing?

775
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,960
I...

776
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,360
I was afraid you would catch a cold.

777
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
So, I wanted to help you to bed.

778
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,120
This cape

779
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,360
isn't yours, right?

780
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,640
It's not. When I walked in,

781
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,200
it was already on you.

782
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,240
Could it be that she was actually here?

783
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,600
Who?

784
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,960
Mister Yan.

785
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,200
You are finally awake, Mister Yan.

786
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,640
Do you need something, Miss Sai?

787
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,440
Nothing much.

788
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
I saw that you slept

789
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,000
at the desk all night,

790
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,600
so I prepared some ginger soup

791
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,240
in case you catch a cold.

792
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,320
This cape...

793
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,040
It's mine.

794
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,720
Miss Sai was worried

795
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,920
that you wouldn't sleep well,

796
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,280
- so she checked on you at yin hour.
- Lingdang.

797
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,640
Thank you, Miss Sai.

798
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,760
Please have a seat.

799
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,280
Miss Sai, you are here

800
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,280
not just because of the soup, right?

801
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,200
You are right.

802
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,360
I am here

803
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,040
mainly about the Lantern Festival.

804
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,920
The Lantern Festival?

805
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,120
Lantern Festival
is an important day in Yang City.

806
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,080
On this day,

807
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,560
the young men and women here

808
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,640
will gather on the streets

809
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,240
to admire the moon and floral lanterns.

810
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,280
Mister Yan...

811
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,160
I am still recovering
from my allergic reaction.

812
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,760
So, I won't be joining the crowd.

813
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,120
We are on the same train of thought.

814
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,320
I was worried about your health

815
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,200
and wanted to put up some lanterns here

816
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,160
for you as my sole guest.

817
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,720
Sole guest?

818
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,960
Then,

819
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,160
what about Mister Li?

820
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,280
Li Tao prefers the crowd.

821
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,120
Mengmeng will accompany him
to the Lantern Festival.

822
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,080
I suddenly feel much better.

823
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,680
Miss Sai, your cream is amazing.

824
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,280
In just one night,

825
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,440
I have completely recovered.

826
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,840
Really?

827
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,840
I don't know what cream it is either.

828
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,640
When Mengmeng returns,

829
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,040
I'll have her prepare more

830
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,240
in case of the worst.

831
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,360
You mean, the cream was Mengmeng's?

832
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,680
Yes.

833
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,680
Miss Sai,

834
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,600
