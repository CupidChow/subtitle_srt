00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,680
Qi Yan,

190
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,920
is your wound okay?

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,720
Don't worry.

192
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,840
Mengmeng,

193
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
I will protect you.

194
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,200
Qi Yan.

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Qi Yan.

196
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm fine.

197
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,280
Let's go.

198
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,720
Qi Yan.

199
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,920
Qi Yan.

200
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,220
[Laifu Inn]

201
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
It really is an inn.

202
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
We're saved.

203
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,640
We're saved.

204
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,280
Qi Yan.

205
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,040
Qi Yan.

206
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,040
There is an inn here.

207
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,560
Hang on just a little longer.

208
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,640
Is anyone here?

209
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,920
Is anyone here?

210
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,200
Is anyone here?

211
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,280
You're up.

212
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,680
Where are we?

213
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
Stay here. Don't move.

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,840
I'll look for candles.

215
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Qi Yan.

216
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,280
Qi Yan.

217
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
I...

218
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,280
I just want to clean your wound.

219
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,080
Does it hurt a lot?

220
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,120
It's fine.

221
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,800
I won't die from this.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,080
Don't say that.

223
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,120
I won't let you cry too.

224
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,920
I haven't found clean water.

225
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
The medicine is what we had with us.

226
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,360
Just bear with it for today.

227
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,720
I'll start searching tomorrow.

228
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
You're bleeding.

229
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,840
I'm not.

230
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,320
It's your blood.

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,680
Really?

232
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,560
With you in my arms,

233
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
I don't hurt anymore.

234
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,160
Are you going back to Ximi tomorrow?

235
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,280
What is it?

236
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,120
Can't bear to see me leave?

237
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,840
Why would I?

238
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
I'm just curious

239
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,920
about what Ximi is like.

240
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,640
I have never been to Ximi.

241
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Ximi

242
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,560
has the bluest skies,

243
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,840
the strongest wines,

244
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,800
the most passionate citizens,

245
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
and the most unforgettable scenery.

246
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,480
Why don't you go back
with me as my guest?

247
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,160
Forget about being a guest.

248
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,520
However,

249
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,800
I can consider

250
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,640
expanding Sai Family Escort to Ximi.

251
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,120
Okay.

252
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
I'll be waiting.

253
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,560
Make way!

254
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,040
Make way!

255
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,000
What's going on?

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Pay attention!

257
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,800
An arrest warrant
from the Imperial Court.

258
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,000

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,440
and assist us in arresting them

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,960

261

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,800
and assist us in arresting them

263
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,400
will be awarded 100 taels.

264

[Warrant]
Look carefully

265
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,120
at these two.

266
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,880
Isn't that...?

267
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,840
Those who assist us in arresting them

268
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,400
will be awarded 100 taels.

269
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,000

Qi Yan.

273
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,000
Wake up.

274
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,000
Help us!

275
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,600
What is that noise?

276
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm afraid it's another beggar.

277
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
You must ignore them, Miss Cui.

278
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,640
Help us!

279
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,240
He needs help.

280
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,080
Miss, let me do it.

281
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,640
Miss.

282
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,560
Miss Cui.

283
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
- Help me!
- Miss Sai and Mister Li just left.

284
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,280
Before they left, they ordered us

285
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,880
not to leave unless we need to.

286
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,080

Sir!

290
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
No way.

291
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,200
Lingdang,

292
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
we can't let someone die
without helping.

293
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,680
Miss.

294
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,360
Let me do it.

295
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,040
You guys...

296
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,920
Why are...?

297
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,440
You...

298
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,240
Pardon us, Miss.

299
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,560
Have you seen these people?

300
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,000
Have you seen these people?

301
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,600
Take a close look.

302
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,120
Report as soon as you find something.

303
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Have you seen these people?

304
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,560
Thank goodness.

305
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,280
I see officials.

306
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,920
I can get help from officials.

307
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,960
Look closely.

308
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,280
I still have to cook later.

309
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,200
It's me.

310
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,320
Li Tao?

311
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,200
Why are you here?

312
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,920
If not for me,

313
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,960
you would have been arrested.

314
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,200
The entire nation is hunting you down.

315
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,920
Why would they?

316
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,800
No way, Li Tao.

317
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,120
We have to hurry back.

318
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Qi Yan is injured.

319
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,840
Don't panic.

320
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll go with you.

321
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,520
The wound is finally not inflamed.

322
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,200
It's all thanks to you.

323
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,520
It's nothing.

324
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,440
Still, what's going on?

325
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,800
Why do people want you dead?

326
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,600
Is there a need to say?

327
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
Even a fool could think of it.

328
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,120
It must be Cui Anshi, that old fox.

329
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,840
Cui Anshi is going through all this.

330
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,800
He will not

331
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,160
let us easily return

332
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,040
to the capital.

333
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,560
Right now, the whole place is covered

334
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,640
with soldiers looking for you.

335
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,000
I heard

336
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,200
even the capital gates
have extra guards.

337
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,360
You two

338
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,080
should stay here for a while.

339
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,560
Do you know

340
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,640
who the city gate's guards are?

341
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,440
My men say there are two groups.

342
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,000
It looks
like the Cui family's private army

343
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,280
has entered the capital.

344
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,760
I wonder if Prince Heqin

345
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,320
has clear information
on their command structure.

346
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,040
Either way, no matter what,

347
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
they outnumber us.

348
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,000
What should we do?

349
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,720
Kong An and Lu Huan are missing.

350
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,640
We have to contact Prince Heqin soon.

351
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,840
On the way here,

352
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,200
I left markings for Sai Xue.

353
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,000
Once she's here,

354
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
we can plan together.

355
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,280
Okay.

356
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,120
Thank you.

357
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,560
Why are you still up?

358
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,480
How can I sleep if you're not?

359
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,480
Did you know?

360
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
In my hometown, people there

361
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
have many strange illnesses.

362
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,680
What illnesses?

363
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,200
For example, long-term insomnia,

364
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,480
inability to focus,

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,400
nightmares and hair-pulling.

366
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,280
In the end,

367
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
it all boils down to one cause.

368
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,680
It's because

369
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,160
they have a sickness of the heart.

370
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,520
How does one

371
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
cure this sickness?

372
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,120
Blank out.

373
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,520
Lie down.

374
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,200
First, give it up.

375
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,240
Then, start again.

376
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,520
It sounds like a great cure.

377
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,200
My way of relaxing

378
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,600
isn't easy to learn.

379
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,840
Father.

380
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
I'm not your father.

381
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,960
You are not my daughter.

382
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,120
If the pirates hadn't kidnapped you,

383
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
you will most likely

384
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,240
be past the border
with Qi Su now, right?

385
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,160
At that time,

386
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,800
did you even think of me?

387
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,080
Father.

388
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,760
You knew I was kidnapped by pirates?

389
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,920
Then,

390
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,040
you didn't send someone to rescue me.

391
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,920
What do you think?

392
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,840
Why didn't you
send someone to rescue me?

393
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,840
One who only cares about herself

394
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
and ignores her family

395
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,080
is an insult to my family's glory.

396
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,280
What use is there in saving you?

397
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,120
Father,

398
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,280
am I really your daughter?

399
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,800
I was kidnapped,

400
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,840
and barely stayed alive.

401
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
You don't even care
that I was in danger.

402
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,560
Why is it in your heart,

403
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,520
you only care about power?

404
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,880
Whether it's my sister

405
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
or me,

406
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,880
we are just your pawns,

407
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,600
aren't we?

408
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,800
You have never

409
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
considered our feelings.

410
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,200
Lock her up.

411
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,160
Without my permission,

412
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,480
no one is to see her.

413
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,960
Yes.

414
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Cui Anshi tells everyone

415
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,240
you returned to the palace

416
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
and placed the Empress Dowager
under house arrest.

417
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,200
The entire city is under his control.

418
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,600
He's searching everywhere

419
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,720
for you and Emissary Xiao

420
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,840
with the excuse of an arrest warrant.

421
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,440
You must be careful.

422
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,760
I'll return once I am safe.

423
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,120
Also,

424
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,080
I have investigated the allies

425
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
and military powers of Cui Anshi.

426
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,800
He's using Cui Anzu, his brother

427
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,560
and Governor of Wan City, as an excuse

428
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,920
to keep a private army.

429
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
There are over 20,000 men.

430
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,760
The disaster relief supplies
he embezzled

431
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
was used to feed this army.

432
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
All the banks across the country

433
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,800
are tools for money laundering.

434
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,780
[Tools for money laundering]

435
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,600
Your Grace.

436
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,800
A secret message from His Majesty.

437
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,040
On the way back.

438
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,160
How is condition?

439
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,080
Your Grace,

440
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,200
Chancellor Cui's man seeks an audience.

441
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,240
Let him in.

442
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,760
Yes.

443
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Greetings, Prince Heqin.

444
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,280
Speak.

445
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,320
Perhaps you don't know,

446
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
but a rumor somewhere

447
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,400
said His Majesty killed
the Noble Consort during his journey.

448
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,120
What do you mean?

449
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,600
Coincidentally,

450
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,200
I was in Yang City a few days ago.

451
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
Take a guess

452
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,440
who I saw.

453
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,840
Is there a misunderstanding

454
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,200
between His Majesty and you?

455
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,320
Perhaps you're working together
to fool Chancellor Cui.

456
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,200
Chancellor Cui has asked
I passed on a message.

457
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,480
While we don't know
what you and His Majesty

458
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,600
are up to.

459
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,320
But please think carefully

460
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,280
before you do anything.

461
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,600
Is it all worth the life

462
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,160
of the Noble Consort?

463
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,720
What are you going to do to Wan?

464
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,240
Pardon me, Your Grace.

465
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,080
That

466
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,640
depends on your performance.

467
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,560
This way, Sirs.

468
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,760
Follow me.

469
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,560
Sirs.

470
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,840
We have been walking for a long time.

471
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,880
Just how far is that place?

472
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,520
Sirs,

473
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,920
it's not far ahead.

474
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,960
There is an inn in the woods.

475
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,600
People would often pass by
and rest there.

476
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,680
Later on, because of the famine,

477
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,800
fewer people pass by here,

478
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,840
so the inn closed down.

479
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,080
But last night,

480
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,320
when I was collecting firewood,

481
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,840
I found there was light in that inn.

482
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,400
No matter what,

483
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,640
let's check it out first.

484
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,320
Let's go.

485
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,680
Let's go.

486
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Follow closely.

487
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,720
Miss Sai sure is late.

488
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,320
Let's leave.

489
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,240
The soldiers are coming here for them.

490
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,880
That fast?

491
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,080
Your Majesty.

492
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,200
Sai Xue,

493
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,920
you're here.

494
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
The soldiers are here.

495
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,200
There's no time.

496
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,880
Hide.

497
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,680
Sirs,

498
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,920
this is the place.

499
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
Is anyone here?

500
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,520
Come out!

501
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,320
Search it!

502
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,960
Sirs,

503
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,120
come over here!

504
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,200
- Sirs.
- What is it?

505
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
I told you there is someone here.

506
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,400
What is it, Sirs?

507
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,320
These aren't the criminals wanted

508
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,000
by the court.

509
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,440
This...

510
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,400
You'll have to act out a show with me.

511
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,080
Sirs,

512
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
are you looking for criminals?

513
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,880
What criminals?

514
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,360
Are you two the only ones here?

515
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,600
Yes.

516
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,080
It's just the two of us here.

517
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,040
But that room

518
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,600
has signs of someone else
sleeping there.

519
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,600
How do you explain that?

520
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,440
Well...

521
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,840
Be honest.

522
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,240
It's a serious crime to hide criminals.

523
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,400
We did not.

524
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,960
Sirs,

525
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,040
it's like this.

526
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,480
The two of us snuck out to elope.

527
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,480
Tao,

528
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm scared.

529
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,480
Sirs,

530
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,320
did some villains come here?

531
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,520
Sirs,

532
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,720
my name is Li Tao.

533
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,440
Xue and I are from Yang City.

534
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,280
We're childhood sweethearts.

535
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,360
However,

536
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,800
the lady of Yang City Sai Family Escort

537
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,720
took a liking to me.

538
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,760
She insisted I marry her.

539
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,520
Sai Family Escort is very powerful
in Yang City.

540
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
I could not hold off for long,

541
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,280
but Xue and I aren't willing to give up.

542
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,760
We escaped and ran here.

543
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,520
The inn looked abandoned,

544
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
so we thought to stay here.

545
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,560
We used to sleep in separate rooms.

546
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,120
But last night,

547
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,280
we couldn't control ourselves.

548
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,360
Alright.

549
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
Since it's just a misunderstanding,

550
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
we'll leave it.

551
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,400
If

552
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,400
[Warrant]
you see these two,

553
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,760
you must report them.

554
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,800
Yes, Sirs.

555
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,700
- Yes.
- We will.

556
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,260
Let's go.

557
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,480
Take care.

558
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,000
They should be gone now.

559
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,480
Why didn't you find out more

560
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,760
before making us come all the way here?

561
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,200
We finally found you.

562
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,840
Li...

563
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,640
Li...

564
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,440
What's going on?

565
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,400
Didn't you say
it was just the two of you?

566
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,840
Sirs,

567
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,680
they...

568
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,520
They are from Sai Family Escort.

569
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,040
They have been after us this whole time.

570
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
Don't waste your energy.

571
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,640
I won't head back with you

572
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
to marry into the Sai family.

573
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,480
I love Xue.

574
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,640
You brat!

575
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,720
Just who do you think

576
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,800
the lady of Sai family is?

577
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,280
You should be honored

578
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
that she likes you.

579
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,960
- Otherwise, I...
- They're going to hit me!

580
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,440
I am not!

581
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,800
Do you even care about the law?

582
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,640
We are here,

583
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,760
yet you dare throw your weight around.

584
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
I...

585
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,120
Sirs,

586
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
this is a family matter.

587
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,240
We are not the same family.

588
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,560
How is it a family matter?

589
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,640
Today, before all

590
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,280
of these heroic officials,

591
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,480
don't even think about doing anything.

592
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,840
They will surely help me,

593
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,280
right?

594
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,600
Right.

595
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,880
Fine.

596
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,800
Just you wait.

597
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,160
Let's go.

598
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,400
Let's go.

599
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,520
I'll be waiting.

600
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,640
Enough. Let's go.

601
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm here to bring the lady her food.

602
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,480
Lian,

603
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,160
where are you going?

604
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,720
Did you deliver the food to the lady?

605
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I did.

606
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,040
Why are you acting weird today?

607
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,520
I don't feel well.

608
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,480
I would like to take the day off.

609
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,360
Take the day off?

610
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,760
Raise your head for me.

611
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,040
I have been infected
with the recent cold.

612
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm afraid of infecting you.

613
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,880
Alright.

614
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,040
Go back and rest.

615
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,480
Don't infect the Master and Miss.

616
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,520
Yes.

617
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,600
Sir,

618
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,640
the soldiers Master Anzu brought

619
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,080
have occupied every city gate.

620
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,720
Once His Majesty returns,

621
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,400
we can execute our plan.

622
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,240
Once His Majesty is dead,

623
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,440
the throne will be yours.

624
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,560
Remember,

625
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,240
we must be very careful this time.

626
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,120
Nothing must go wrong.

627
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,840
Yes.

628
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,600
This is bad.

629
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,400
I must tell Huai'an.

630
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,960
Why is it you?

631
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,960
Where is the lady?

632
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,000
Go on.

633
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,120
Where are you going?

634
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,480
The Master asked me
to buy some vegetables.

635
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,160
Where is your token?

636
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,040
Over here.

637
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,720
Go on.

638
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,680
Where are you going?

639
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,600
My father fell ill.

640
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,640
I would like to head home to visit him.

641
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,480
Where is your token?

642
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,420
Halt!

643
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,000
Let go!

644
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,440
Father,

645
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,320
I'm begging you.

646
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,720
Please stop!

647
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,200
His Majesty and I grew up together.

648
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,960
He is your nephew.

649
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,000
How can you do this, Father?

650
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,960
Tie her up.

651
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,920
Keep a closer eye on her.

652
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,600
If she escapes again,

653
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,560
you will all die.

654
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,200
Yes.

655
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Father.

656
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,120
Father.

657
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,280
Father.

658
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,800
Why hasn't Steward Lu
and Guard Kong returned yet?

659
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,320
Come in.

660
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,520
The soldiers are all gone.

661
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,700
Your Majesty.

662
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,080
Everything is ready.

663
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,520
Well?

664
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,440
Does this mean we can return?

665
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,160
But how are you going to get back?

666
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,200
The soldiers are
searching all the way out here.

667
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
The city guards will be worse.

668
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,840
I have a plan.

669
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,600
Why are you looking at me?

670
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,840
I've done all I can
by helping you until now.

671
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm going back to Ximi.
