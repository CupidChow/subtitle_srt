Take advantage of the chaos

194
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,200
and kill that Emissary Xiao.

195
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,840
Yes.

196
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,200
Hyah!

197
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,300
Hyah!

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,600
Minister Li, stay hidden for now.

199
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
Your family will be taken care of.

200
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,320
Please be careful on your journey.

201
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,680
I am ashamed.

202
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
I'm sorry to worry Your Majesty.

203
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,960
It's a pity we couldn't fulfil
the late Emperor's wish.

204
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,840
You've done very well.

205
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,000
Once the farmland
along the river is irrigated

206
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,520
and the watercourse is open to traffic,

207
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,720
the people

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,920
will understand

209
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
our intention of opening the canal.

210
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
What about the watercourse?

211
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,880
I'll let Zhen Xu to handle it.

212
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,240
Don't worry.

213
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,080
Alright.

214
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,920
Then I'll be on my way.

215
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,080
Hyah!

216
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,740
Hyah!

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,360
Minister Li is fine now.

218
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,520
But how can I go back?

219
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,200
What's on your mind?

220
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,240
Your Majesty.

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,240
Are you trying to run away again?

222
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,360
Did you came to Lu County
to save Minister Li?

223
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,280
I just happened

224
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,920
to come across him.

225
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I see.

226
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,720
Why don't I take you home?

227
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,000
So that I can know how to find you.

228
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,040
But now,

229
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,240
I don't even know how to get back.

230
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,400
Then you should stay.

231
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,600
But I've got to get back.

232
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,560
But...

233
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Is your hometown really that great?

234
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,240
I'll give you the same position

235
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,120
that you have in your place.

236
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,920
At my place, I'm nothing.

237
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,520
I just a study slacker.

238
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,160
Then I can make you
a first-rate study slacker.

239
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,440
His Majesty's gift is really special.

240
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,720
But I still want to go home.

241
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,880
I appreciate your gesture.

242
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,400
You've already rejected me once,

243
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,840
but I'm still asking the same question.

244
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,680
What are we going to do?

245
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,040
Minister Li has escaped.

246
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
It doesn't matter anymore.

247
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
Kill the emissary.

248
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
All we want is Emissary Xiao's life.

249
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
Give her to us

250
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,000
and the rest of you
can get out of here alive.

251
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,320
I am here!

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Who dare to lay hand on her?

253
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,200
Your Majesty.

254
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,080
Don't worry about this.

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,360
Aren't you going to kill me?

256
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Come!

257
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,400
No!

258
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,880

259
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,360
Your Majesty!

260
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Don't pursue any further.

261
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,280
The emissary has thrown herself
into the river.

262
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,160
The current's too strong

263
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,240
for her to survive.

264
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,760
Withdraw!

265
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,120

266
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,960

Your Majesty!

270
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,360
Your Majesty!

271
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,360
How can you fail

272
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,920
to arrest

273
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,400
a minor official?

274
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,680
It was my fault.

275
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,160
It's just that the construction
of the canal

276
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,560
did Lu County a lot of good.

277
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,760
When Li Ming escaped,

278
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,000
the local people pleaded for him.

279
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,120
Have you forgotten
about the late Emperor?

280
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,160
Back then, the late Emperor
was so determined

281
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,720
to dig a canal despite
the opposition of all the officials

282
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,000
that he ruined the kingdom's backbone.

283
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,080
It caused a severe drought
in Qi Kingdom

284
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,240
and the people were complaining.

285
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,080
Because of this,

286
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,880
the late Emperor became ill

287
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
and left me.

288
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,800
Your Highness.

289
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
Please take care of your body.

290
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,880
There are things that I'm fine

291
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,880
with letting Yan get away with.

292
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,000
But

293
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,520
if anyone encourages Yan
to repair the canal,

294
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,960
they will be my enemy.

295
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,360
I'll bring them to justice.

296
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,000
Your Highness.

297
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,240
Didn't I tell you to find His Majesty?

298
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,920
Where is His Majesty?

299
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Your Highness,

300
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,920
Steward Lu said

301
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,400
His Majesty was feeling unwell today

302
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,320
and he's resting.

303
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,840

307
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,880
Why are you looking for me?

308
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,960
The canal is a taboo for our kingdom.

309
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,560
Have you forgotten

310
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,440
how your father died?

311
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,600
Queen Mother.

312
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,760
Father's funeral has nothing to do
with the canal.

313
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,960
The opening of this canal

314
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
is a good thing for the country
and the people.

315
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,920
I really don't understand

316
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,880
why Queen Mother

317
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
is so opposed to it.

318
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720
It's an ominous sign

319
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,200
that it touched the kingdom's backbone.

320
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,160
Is it true that I'm just a playful

321
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,440
and ridiculous emperor

322
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,920
in Mother's heart?

323
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,840
Does everything I do

324
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,960
seem wrong to you?

325
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,240
If that's the case,

326
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm fine with not being the Emperor!

327
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,160

The construction of the aqueduct
has been decreed.

Nothing more needs to be said
about the canal.

330
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,360
I think Queen Mother is tired today.

331
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,360
I'll take my leave.

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600

you by my side.

339
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,360
It was all my fault.

I failed to protect you.

Emissary might be...

382
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,000
What might it be?

383
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,800
She might be out of her luck.

384
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,400
Do your job.

385
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,520
Go and find her!

386
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,640
Yes.

387
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,960
Your Majesty.

388
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,640
Emissary is blessed.

389
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,080
She'll be fine.

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
- Alright.
- Slowly.

395
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,560
Watch it.

396
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,760
It's all valuable items.

397
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,040
It's all the way from the capital.

398
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,920
Move it over there.

399
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,240

Watch it.

402
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,600
Quickly.

403
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Stay on your feet.

404
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,680
Come.

405
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,520
A bag?

406
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,660
This is...

407
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,480
My Lady.

408
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
The kitchen has brought you

409
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,760
a hundred-year-old ginseng

410
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,800
for your soup.

411
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,200
At least have a sip.

412
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,400
I have no appetite.

413
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
There are only these few gentlemen
in Yang City.

414
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,760
They're all ugly and useless.

415
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,720
Do they still want to marry me?

416
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,680
Keep dreaming.

417
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,880
Hey, you!

418
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
Who are you!

419
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,320
Why were you in my lady's room?

420
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
My Lady, take a look.

421
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,640
- This bag...
- That's my bag!

422
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,880
Where's the belt tag?

423
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,480
Belt tag?

424
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,400
Where did you get that belt tag from?

425
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,920
Do you know that the belt tag
belongs to His Majesty?

426
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,280
I...

427
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,560
I picked it up.

428
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,440
Give it back to me.

429
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
You picked it up?

430
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,320
I've sent it to the authorities.

431
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,320
You don't have to look for it.

432
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,000
You're here in the right time.

433
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,040
This beggar came into my room
and stole my food.

434
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,440
Send her to the authorities as well.

435
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,040
Wait a minute!

436
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,520
I was just so hungry.

437
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,760
I didn't wait for anyone to show up.

438
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
I meant to pay.

439
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,800
Calculate the cost then.

440
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,280

441
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,840
Calculate it for her.

442
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,280

Abalone is 20 taels.

446
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,240
Squid is 150 taels.

447
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,840
Flower crab is 90 taels.

448
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,160
Deep sea squid is 190 taels.

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,920
The total is 550 taels.

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,720
This is a shady shop.

451
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,680
What shady shop?

452
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
This is a soup specially made

453
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,200

454
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,240

457
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,720
I can do anything.

459
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,920
I wasn't always like this.

460
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,720
My family forced me to get married,

461
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,600
but I didn't want to.

462
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,200
So, I broke them off

463
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,160
and ended up on the streets.

476
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,280
there were worse days
than in the palace.

The assassins have been identified.

481
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,680
It's Chancellor Cui's man.

482
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,560
Your Majesty.

483
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,640
Yang City has just sent news

484
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,400
that the relief food sent to capital

485
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
was robbed by pirates.

486
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,040
Every year, merchants in Qi Kingdom

487
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
lose a great deal of money in shipping.

488
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,360
Now the pirates

489
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
have the audacity

490
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,920
to take advantage of our relief food.

491
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,960
The court allocates so much money
every year

492
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,520
for you to destroy the pirates.

493
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,440
Why is it still ineffective,

494
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,560
Minister Gu?

495
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,440
Your Majesty.

496
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,960
The ocean

497
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,520
is vast.

498
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,320
Our soldiers have been practicing
water combat.

499
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,560
But we're still not as strong

500
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,680
as the pirates who grew up on the sea.

501
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,200
Especially that pirate leader, Ma Kun.

502
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,840
This man is extremely deceitful.

503
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,440
I'm afraid

504
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,080
that if you want to kill the pirates

505
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,760
without harming the merchant ships...

506
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,800
What about it?

507
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,360
So should my kingdom's sea lanes

508
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,800
always be at the mercy of others?

509
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

510
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,600
Your Majesty, please calm down.

511
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,000
I think the reason

512
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,000
why pirates are so rampant

513
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,320
is that although Qi Kingdom
has a vast territory,

514
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,960
there are only sea
and land commercial routes

515
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,760
from the south to the north.

516
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Land transport is slow.

517
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
Merchants can only take the risk

518
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,840
of going by sea in order not
to be late.

519
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,240
If we can develop the watercourse,

520
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
we may be able to solve
the piracy dilemma.

521
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,720
Your Majesty.

522
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,480
I don't think it's a good idea.

523
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,440
This canal is ominous.

524
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,840
If something goes wrong,
it'll hurt the country's luck.

525
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,520
If you don't think it's a good idea,

526
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,560
why don't you

527
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,920
kill the pirates?

528
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,520
This...

529
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,360
I'm over 50 years old now.

530
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,480
Since Chancellor Cui doesn't have a way
to exterminate the pirates,

531
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,280
let's do as Minister Zhen says

532
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,400
and open the canal and watercourse
with all efforts.

533
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,480
In addition, Minister Gu,

534
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,680
immediately ordered
the elimination of pirates.

535
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,400
Failure is not an option.

536
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,680
At Your Majesty's command.

537
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
I've been thinking about something

538
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,560
for a long time.

539
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,920
The sages say

540
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,240
a clear head comes from an open mind.

541
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,400
I've decided to select officials
from all ministries

542
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
to set up the Secret Research Pavilion.

543
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,160
From now on, all matters of government

544
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,280
will be discussed and decided
by the Secret Research Pavilion.

545
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,000
Your Majesty!

546
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,920
The stakes are high!

547
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,760
Please think twice!

548
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,760
Your Majesty.

549
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,320
I think

550
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,520
that a single opinion

551
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
is not as good as many opinions.

552
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,040
That's a great move.

553
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,680
This is going to disrupt the court!

554
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,240
Your Majesty.

555
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,600
Please consider carefully!

556
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,560
Your Majesty, lease consider carefully!

557
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,560
Majority rules over minority.

558
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,240
It's settled.

559
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,280
Dismiss the morning audience!

560
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,720
Long live Your Majesty!

561
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,440
Setting up Secret Research Pavilion

562
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,600
for the court?

563
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,160
I think

564
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,720
it's just an attempt

565
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,960
to reduce my power!

566
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,640
Your Honor.

567
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,080
It's important for you to be healthy.

568
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,800
The bird is growing up.
