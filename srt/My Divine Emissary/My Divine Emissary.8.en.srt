[My Divine Emissary]

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,740
[Episode 8]

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,990
Steward Lu,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,950
let us begin.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,310
It appears that Emissary Xiao
is feeling unwell.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,910
Should we reschedule it?

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,110
No, no.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,110
The situation is urgent.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,990
Steward Lu, you need not worry.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,550
It will all be over in a flash.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,590
Are you

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,270
capable of completing this task?

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,390
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,630
Emissary Xiao prescription

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,150
is unheard of.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,270
Do you want to endanger

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,510
this old servant?

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,910
Trust him.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,030
Steward Lu,

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,310
take it off.

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,910
This...

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,670
He must also undress?

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,590
Of course!

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,270
Cupping and moxibustion

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,270
work best when applied directly
to the skin.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,830
Take it off.

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,510
Let me do it!

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,630
Your Majesty!

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,390
Yes!

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,230
Take it off.

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,310
Quickly!

46
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,350
Your Majesty.

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,870
Now I'm your doctor.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,350
Undressing before a physician

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,590
is normal.

50
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,630
Nothing to be ashamed of.

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,630
Take it off.

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,430
Quickly!

53
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,910
Likewise, I'll be your physician.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,470
How's that?

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,790
Are you ashamed?

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,070
The Empress Dowager's sickness
needs immediate treatment.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,230
Please lie down now.

58
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,470
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,310
you should handle it yourself.

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,270
Why is that a blush on your cheeks?

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,190
Are you feeling bashful?

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,390
Nothing to be ashamed of.

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,270
I

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,110
feel a bit warm.

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,510
That's right.

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,950
Just wait and see.

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,910
I'm telling you,

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,230
the Emperor gave this medicine.

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,150
The effect will surely be the best.

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,310
Then I'll try it too.

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,350
What is this?

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,310
His Majesty's healing ointment.

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,550
Thank you.

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,870
Goodbye.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,710
Goodbye.

76
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,310
It's not my problem.

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,030
Here it is back.

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,030
I saw all.

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,670
Hand over the money.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,590
What money?

81
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,830
What you saw doesn't matter.

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,270
You!

83
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,470
Forget it!

84
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,590
Don't let me see you again next time.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,870
Stop!

86
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,710
This is the healing ointment I gave you.

87
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,510
How could you sell it?

88
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,550
I thought it was mine.

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,790
I'm so sorry.

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,990
I mistook it.

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,110
Here you go.

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,950
Goodbye.

93
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,150
Selling items
is prohibited in the palace.

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,630
Your actions are

95
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,150
a clear violation of the law.

96
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,030
Don't come!

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,430
If you get closer, I'll scream!

98
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,110
I accuse you kidnapped me.

99
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,310
So be it.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,390
Guard Kong...

101
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,430
could you be forgiving?

102
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,870
I lost my father at a young age

103
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,910
and my family is poor.

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,790
I'll distrust you.

105
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,910
You illegally helped
Eunuch Li leave the palace

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,590
and lie to me.

107
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,070
Trusting you again is difficult.

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,630
I didn't lie to you.

109
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,750
You misunderstand me.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,710
Aren't I pitiful?

111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,110
You!

112
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,470
Leave.

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,830
Guard Kong,

114
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,750
thanks!

115
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,590
How?

116
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,950
Your Majesty!

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,190
Your body!

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,510
His Majesty is frail.

119
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,510
His body is drenched.

120
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,350
So I'm not responsible.

121
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,790
My body!

122
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,070
Quickly arrest
and bring Eunuch Li to me!

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,670
Yes!

124
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,310
Stop!

125
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,550
Come back!

126
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,950
Eunuch Li!

127
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,670
Your Majesty, I apologize.

128
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,470
Rest for now.

129
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,550
You got fever.

130
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,670
The imperial physician
said you overworked

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,470
and need more rest.

132
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,630
Your Majesty,

133
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,710
the red marks on your body

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,990
will fade away in a few days.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,910
Please trust me.

136
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,350
I trust you.

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,430
I already feel

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,590
much better now.

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,070
I'll entrust
the Empress Dowager's illness to you.

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,150
Really?

141
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,030
Uhm!

142
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,350
Great!

143
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,950
Your Majesty, you're clueless!

144
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,430
You can't even high-five.

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,790
Then Your Majesty should rest early too.

146
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,230
I'll take my leave now.

147
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,030
Goodnight, Your Majesty.

148
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,990
I would appreciate
your assistance later.

149
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,150
The Empress Dowager's condition
has improved.

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,790
She's asleep.

151
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,390
Everyone can relax.

152
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,590
Bold servant!

153
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,230
What more have you done
to Empress Dowager?

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,910
What's going on?

155
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,430
What causes those red swelling marks

156
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,470
on the Empress Dowager's back?

157
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,430
It's nothing serious.

158
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,670
In a few days...

159
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,350
How dare!

160
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,550
You dare harm the Empress Dowager
with witchcraft.

161
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,110
Guards!

162
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,790
Put this person in prison immediately.

163
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,190
Who dare to lay hand on her?

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,550
Empress Dowager's backmarks

165
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,910
I have them too.

166
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,230
This reaction is normal.

167
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,110
Your Majesty,

168
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,710
this person must have plotted against

169
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,870
the Empress Dowager with witchcraft.

170
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,030
Without immediate action,

171
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,230
it will cause calamity.

172
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,830
What are you waiting for?

173
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,950
Take him away!

174
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,150
Yan.

175
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,550
Yan.

176
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,310
Queen Mother!

177
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,470
Queen Mother, do you feel any better?

178
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,830
Yan,

179
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,790
my headache has improved a lot.

180
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,750
Wan,

181
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,710
I must sincerely thank you.

182
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,310
The Empress Dowager,

183
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,630
this time,

184
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,870
Emissary Xiao invented moxibustion.

185
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,350
I've already tried it on myself,

186
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,590
and it works well.

187
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,910
The Empress Dowager,

188
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,150
my hometown's ancestors

189
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,990
invented moxibustion.

190
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,950
Without Consort Wan

191
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,110
and imperial physicians' skill,

192
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,470
I couldn't have done it alone.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,150
This palace

194
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,510
has even more

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,430
better healers than Wan.

196
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,870
The Empress Dowager

197
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,310
needs long-term care.

198
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,870
The Noble Consort and I

199
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,430
will often help you with moxibustion.

200
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,710
Indeed, Emissary Xiao is capable.

201
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,630
I will never be at peace

202
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,590
if this Divine Emissary still here.

203
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,590
Remember this!

204
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,550
I won't spare

205
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,390
those who prevent

206
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,790
your empress hood.

207
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,750
Father!

208
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,510
This is unrelated to Emissary Xiao.

209
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,110
How is he not involved?

210
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,150
He may have enchanted you too.

211
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,550
Ever since he appeared,

212
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,310
The Emperor has changed.

213
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,510
All these negative energies,

214
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,310
obviously his fault.

215
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,950
It's to bewitch His Majesty.

216
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,310
Your marriage to His Majesty

217
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,790
needs immediate consideration.

218
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,630
The Cui family's future

219
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,190
depends entirely on you.

220
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,750
I beg you to stop being stubborn.

221
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,550
I understands.

222
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,950
In our place,

223
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,630
girls can wear short skirts freely,

224
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,150
and cut their hair short casually.

225
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,710
Cut short hair?

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,750
They can also choose
the person they like.

227
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,190
They can also do what they like to do,

228
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,550
Do what they like to do?

229
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,910
[Qingyan Palace]

230
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,750
Quickly follow me.

231
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,230
Your Majesty, please slow down.

232
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,870
I'm fatigued after cupping therapy.

233
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,870
Your Majesty,

234
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,430
are all these for me?

235
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,190
Sit.

236
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,030
Your Majesty, you eat first.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,670
I told you.

238
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,390
This all for you.

239
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,190
His Majesty gave you
these special presents.

240
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,550
Your Majesty,

241
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,230
I'll go check
if the bird's nest soup is ready.

242
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,150
Go check.

243
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,190
Yes!

244
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,150
I present this gift to you.

245
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,350
That's

246
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,670
not necessary.

247
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,590
You like vases,

248
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,950
so here's another.

249
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,070
Do you like it?

250
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,430
I like it.

251
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,430
I like it.

252
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,990
Actually,

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
you are much more useful

254
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,510
than I imagined.

255
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,910
Your Majesty,

256
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,350
You are the only one
who has praised my usefulness.

257
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,110
Really?

258
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,830
Yes.

259
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,030
Do people from your hometown

260
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,910
not always think smart?

261
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,030
Queen Mother.

262
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,230
Along with cupping and moxibustion,

263
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,990
neck exercises are crucial.

264
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,190
Approaching the problem from two angles

265
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,430
yields double the result
with half the work.

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,350
One, two, three, four,

267
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,430
five, six, seven, eight.

268
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,110
One, two, three,

269
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,270
five, six, seven.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,990
One, two, three, four,

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,190
five, six, seven, eight.

272
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,280
Two, two.

273
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,030
Come, Empress Dowager.

274
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,710
Emissary Xiao,

275
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,590
why are we dancing in the square

276
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,670
instead of the palace?

277
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,750
Naturally, square dancing

278
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,670
should be done in a square.

279
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,230
So that's how it is.

280
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,950
One, two, three, four,

281
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,910
five, six, seven, eight.

282
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,860
Two, two, three, four,

283
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,150
five, six, seven, eight.

284
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,350
Three, two, three, four,

285
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,550
That's ridiculous!

286
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,590
Four, two, three, four,

287
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,510
five, six, seven, eight.

288
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,590
Five, two, three, four,

289
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,630
five, six, seven, eight.

290
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,630
Six, two, three, four,

291
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,430
five, six, seven, eight.

292
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,930
♪Fight for love now♪

293
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,050
♪While the time♪

294
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,050
♪Is just right♪

295
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,790
Yan,

296
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,270
Emissary Xiao is truly extraordinary.

297
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,990
She...

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,710
indeed!

299
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,990
He made me a buckwheat pillow.

300
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,390
There were certain items

301
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,350
among them

302
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,870
that I had never encountered before.

303
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,750
Those should be items from her hometown.

304
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,510
His hometown?

305
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,070
His hometown is very impressive!

306
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,550
I also think so.

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,430
But it's said
that in a very distant place.

308
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,750
Until Emissary Xiao finds a way back,

309
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,790
I shall accompany Queen Mother

310
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,350
on a journey of learning and visitation.

311
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,550
Yan.

312
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,950
Eunuch Quarters
should not house Emissary Xiao

313
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,790
indefinitely.

314
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,270
Please schedule
his Lingtai Pavilion move.

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,310
Queen mother's planning is appreciated,

316
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,910
but I respectfully disagree.

317
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,710
Why?

318
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,470
Since Emissary Xiao
arrived in the palace,

319
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,030
she has been my constant companion.

320
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,430
Her blessings and prayers
have brought me

321
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,310
comfort and direction
during difficult times.

322
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,910
Without her,

323
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,670
I'd struggle

324
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,990
to adjust.

325
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,950
As a Divine Emissary,

326
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,950
he should live at the Lingtai Pavilion.

327
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,110
Furthermore,

328
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,790
given Emissary Xiao's
considerable abilities,

329
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,390
he should serve the Qi family

330
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,310
and contribute to Qi Kingdom.

331
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,430
Granny.

332
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,950
Convey my imperial decree,

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,070
telling Emissary Xiao to move
to the Lingtai Pavilion immediately.

334
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,030
Yes!

335
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,430
I'm so tired.

336
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,510
I have to treat the Empress Dowager

337
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,430
and accompany her to her exercise.

338
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,550
I must discuss medical expertise
with imperial physician.

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,710
I think

340
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,990
His Majesty controls me mentally.

341
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,350
He first commends
my obedience and usefulness.

342
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,710
Then he makes me
work for him obediently.

343
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,870
I can't even get any work done.

344
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,390
Will it be ages for me
to be able to go back?

345
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,230
Zhou Quan.

346
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,310
Thanks for last time.

347
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,270
You're welcome.

348
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,870
When you go to Lingtai Pavilion,

349
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,990
don't forget about me.

350
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,510
Lingtai Pavilion?

351
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,710
What place is that?

352
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,830
You should know in a few days.

353
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,350
This is just a rumor.

354
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,470
Anyway,

355
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,310
don't forget me when you're rich.

356
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,350
Of course.

357
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,110
I'm so pitiful.

358
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,550
I can't be rich

359
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,750
on my own.

360
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,710
What's wrong with you?

361
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,870
Why are you so unhappy?

362
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,430
It's because of Guard Kong.

363
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,390
I sold in the palace a few days ago.

364
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,830
He caught me.

365
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,830
Now I'm afraid to sell.

366
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,590
I earn much less than before.

367
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,110
Why?

368
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,750
Does the palace prohibit sales?

369
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,550
Of course.

370
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,390
It's the rule.

371
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,310
Poor Prince's He Qin headband.

372
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,230
I had fixed a price

373
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,190
with a palace granny.

374
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,750
Now I'm afraid to give it to her.

375
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,870
I'm afraid of being caught

376
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,990
by Guard Kong.

377
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,550
Prince's He Qin items

378
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,550
sell well, right?

379
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,350
This headband is different.

380
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,430
We who live outside the palace

381
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,470
can't afford it.

382
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,830
Look...

383
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,260
[Huai' an]

384
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,550
Huai' an?

385
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,430
This is His Majesty's headband.

386
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,310
What?

387
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,310
Huai An is Prince Heqin's nickname.

388
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,230
You were drunk last time

389
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,070
and kept calling Huai An, Huai An.

390
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,830
Huai An is His Majesty's
nickname, right?

391
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,550
You must never

392
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,630
tell anyone about this.

393
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,510
Oh, my goodness!

394
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,430
Huai An is actually Prince Heqin!

395
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,070
Wan actually likes Prince Heqin!

396
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,470
Oh my God!

397
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,350
The uncle falls in love
with his nephew's wife.

398
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,150
This plot is so exciting!

399
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,190
Ah, that feels much better.

400
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,110
It seems I have truly improved.

401
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,910
Wan,

402
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,390
you have worked so hard

403
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,430
these past few days.

404
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,750
Your health is my first priority.

405
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,830
It is my honor to serve you.

406
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,750
Wan, you are truly a kind girl.

407
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,510
My thoughts

408
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,390
have been consumed by Yan and Wan.

409
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,270
If they could have an imperial son,

410
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,630
my ailment would be cured.

411
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,110
I remembered something

412
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,590
that needs Wan's help.

413
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,150
Please instruct me, Queen Mother.

414
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,030
Prince Heqin

415
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,710
is the late Emperor's youngest brother.

416
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,990
He is a few years older than Qi Yan

417
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,030
and still unmarried.

418
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,350
I've

419
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,670
always worried about this.

420
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,590
If this issue remains unresolved,

421
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,670
I fear I shall face my ancestors

422
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,950
with shame upon my passing.

423
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,390
Queen Mother's longevity
and prosperity are assured.

424
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,070
However, Prince Heqin
has vowed to choose

425
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,230
a consort shortly.

426
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,030
A consort?

427
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,830
Yes.

428
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,070
But I feel that my age prevents me

429
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,350
from handling this matter effectively.

430
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,550
Thus, I request that Wan replace me

431
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,390
in choosing Prince He Qin's consort.

432
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,190
But my status

433
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,110
is unsuitable for Prince

434
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,230
consort selection.

435
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,030
What is unsuitable about it?

436
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,670
Furthermore,

437
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,350
Prince Heqin had no objections

438
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,950
after I discussed this with him.

439
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,830
I will follow your instructions.

440
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,150
[Eunuch Quarters]

441
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,390
Emissary Xiao's good work healing
the Empress Dowager,

442
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,390
by the decree of the Empress Dowager,

443
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,510
awarding him 100 gold taels.

444
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,150
The Emperor will keep the gold,

445
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,270
also live at Lingtai Pavilion
from now on.

446
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,710
This is the decree.

447
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,910
I appreciate
the Empress Dowager's kindness.

448
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,310
Zhou Quan's information seems correct.

449
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,230
Regarding living at Lingtai Pavilion,

450
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,590
how could His Majesty

451
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,710
not have told me?

452
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,790
What's the big deal?

453
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,750
You're a Divine Emissary now.

454
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,270
It's natural to live

455
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,230
at Lingtai Pavilion.

456
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,390
After moving,

457
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,630
can I still see
His Majesty and you often?

458
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,830
You...

459
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,870
Just take care of yourself.

460
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,790
Please don't bother His Majesty.

461
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,950
Also, when you go to Lingtai Pavilion,

462
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,070
behave yourself.

463
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,350
Never blow up

464
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,830
about Secret Research Pavilion.

465
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,750
Otherwise,

466
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,670
you may ask for big trouble.

467
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,750
I understand.

468
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,670
By the way,

469
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,470
in the Lingtai Pavilion,

470
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,110
you can bring one trustworthy attendant.

471
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,510
Choose someone yourself.

472
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:45,990
Alright.

473
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,670
Farewell, Steward Lu.

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,390
Why did you choose me?

475
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,030
I thought you said
to keep old acquaintances if I got rich.

476
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,950
You're so dependable

477
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,630
and kind-gearted.

478
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,870
Emissary Xiao.

479
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,510
However, we must set some rules.

480
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,030
You need authorization
to take Lingtai Pavilion items.

481
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,870
What do you take me for?

482
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,830
I neither steal nor rob.

483
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,790
The latest gossip is most beneficial.

484
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,230
Selling quickest are

485
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,230
novels bought outside the palace.

486
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,670
Other things sold here are

487
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,270
all discarded items from the palace.

488
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,150
Any misunderstandings about me?

489
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,030
Perhaps... previously,

490
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,070
there was a slight misunderstanding.

491
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,430
Let's go.

492
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,630
Li...

493
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,950
Your Majesty.

494
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,110
Emissary Xiao
went to Lingtai Pavilion today.

495
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,830
I know.

496
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,790
Leaving without

497
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,590
saying goodbye is improper.

498
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,110
I suppose he was in a hurry.

499
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,550
Don't want to disturb Your Majesty.

500
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,430
As if she hadn't bothered me enough.

501
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,390
Indeed.

502
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,950
In a time,

503
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,830
Secret Research Pavilion was quiet.

504
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,950
I almost find it strange.

505
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,030
Tell me,

506
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,350
how is she faring at Lingtai Pavilion?

507
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,230
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

508
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,230
Emissary Xiao

509
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,830
is well taken care of.

510
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,510
This is

511
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,750
the treatment I deserve.

512
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,990
It's spacious

513
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,990
and bright.

514
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,790
Who is it?

515
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,470
It's me, Jing.

516
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,670
Come in.

517
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,910
Divine Emissary,

518
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,470
I have brought you some snacks.

519
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,630
Place on table.

520
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,310
His Majesty visited today?

521
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,790
His Majesty?

522
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,430
No, he hasn't.

523
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,790
Then that is all.

524
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,430
You may go.

525
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,150
How did you get here?

526
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,470
Have you forgotten me so soon,
Your Majesty?

527
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,670
It appears you've prioritized career,

528
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,750
money, and comfort.

529
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,230
Are you angry, Your Majesty?

530
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,830
Not at all.

531
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,910
There's no place
more comfortable than this.

532
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,950
Your Majesty...

533
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,790
It's meatball soup.

534
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,750
It smells so good.

535
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,870
Can I have a taste?

536
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,070
Here, take it.

537
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,670
What's wrong with you?

538
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,190
Why is your face so red?

539
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,910
Do you get a fever?

540
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,390
Dreaming?

541
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,510
Yes.

542
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,430
A nightmare?

543
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,510
Lu Huan.

544
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,910
Come with me to Lingtai Pavilion.

545
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,270
Why does Your Majesty
want to go to Lingtai Pavilion?

546
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,070
For going to Lingtai Pavilion...

547
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,790
do I need a reason?

548
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,150
No, not really.

549
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,350
It's just that...

550
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,190
Is Your Majesty
going to see Emissary Xiao?

551
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,150
Emissary Xiao's chicken is here.

552
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,510
I'm going to deliver it to her.

553
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,710
Please calculate my fortune,
Divine Emissary.

554
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,030
Alright, let me take a look.

555
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,150
Your love life seems to be quite bumpy.

556
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,390
And you tend to daydream a lot.

557
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,470
For example, you often think about
marrying a prince.

558
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,990
Divine Emissary, please don't say that.

559
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,790
Let me see again.

560
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,550
Which of the palace maids.

561
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,710
won't marry Prince Heqin?

562
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,990
Do you trust others too much

563
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,510
in romantic relationships?

564
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,990
That seems to be true.

565
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,590
Then what should I do?

566
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,350
I think you should

567
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,350
pay more attention to

568
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,230
what they do,

569
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,270
instead of always
listening to what they say.

570
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,590
What do you think?

571
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,320
That's right!

Indeed!

574
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,350
Yes!

575
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,670
Please calculate my fortune,
Divine Emissary.

576
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,050
Okay.

577
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,670
Does the high priest also find

578
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,910
Emissary Xiao's words reasonable?

579
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,350
Your Majesty,

580
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,350
I just arrived as well.

581
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,670
Your Majesty has arrived.

582
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,230
Greetings, Your Majesty.

583
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,350
Your Majesty.

584
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,990
All of you can go.

585
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,270
Yes.

586
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,350
Go quickly.

587
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,510
High priest...

588
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,670
are you not leaving?

589
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,310
I will take my leave.

590
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,710
I will take my leave.

591
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,030
Your Majesty,

592
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,070
have you come to see me?

593
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,270
I came to give you this.

594
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,030
Fortunately, I brought a power bank.

595
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,750
I thought

596
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,350
you came here specially to see me.

597
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,430
But I noticed
that you were so into your game

598
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,350
that you forgot me.

599
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,590
This...

600
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,550
This is because of my work.

Everyone asks me to read their fortunes.

602
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,390
Refusing is hard as the Divine Emissary.

603
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,990
However, Your Majesty,
I still think of you.

604
