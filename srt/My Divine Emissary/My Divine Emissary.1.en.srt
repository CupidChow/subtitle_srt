00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,100
Indeed.

189
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,660
It's actually raining!

190
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,420
It's heavens blessing!

191
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,860
It's finally raining!

192
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,700
We've been waiting for a long time.

193
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,540
Hurry up and fix it!

194
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,540
Hurry up!

195
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,980
Why did the rain stop?

196
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,420
It only rained for a while.

197
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,940
Could it be another drought?

198
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,980
What should we do?

199
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,180
Why did the rain stop?

200
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,380
High Priest,

201
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,300
this should be considered
a successful rainmaking ritual, right?

202
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,380
I still have many things to do.

203
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,660
I will just go back first.

204
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,780
Your Majesty.

205
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,500
Please let me try again, Your Majesty.

206
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,500
Emperor wants to leave.

207
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,820
Yan!

208
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,260
There are an a assassin!

209
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Protect His Majesty!

210
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,620
Quickly!

211
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,420
♪You're the legend of the future♪

212
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,180
♪A guest from tomorrow♪

213
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,940
♪The stars we once gazed♪

214
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,380
♪Gazing at the moon you once saw♪

215
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,180
♪You are the thread that binds me♪

216
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,700
♪Through the years, unbreakable♪

217
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,620
Outrageous!

218
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,940
Mister!

219
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,660
Let's talk things out calmly.

220
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,020
Carrying restricted weapons is illegal.

221
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,940
What are you waiting for?

222
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,700
Get this audacious rogue
out of my sight!

223
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,820
Behead her immediately!

224
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,980
- Yes!
- Yes!

225
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,700
Wait a moment!

226
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,020
Who exactly are you?

227
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,820
Who sent you?

228
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,660
If you confess truthfully,

229
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,380
I might spare your life!

230
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:28,860
Speak!

231
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,380
This place is identical

232
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,940
to the world I saw in the water.

233
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,700
Did I travel through time?

234
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,900
I...

235
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,020
Are you the Emperor?

236
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,380
Could you come over here and talk to me?

237
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,740
I just came here

238
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,620
on a whim.

239
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,700
Could you send me back home?

240
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,980
Nonsense!

241
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
How dare you mock me?

242
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,180
I didn't mean any harm!

243
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,980
I must have taken the wrong turn.

244
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,860
You guys should get busy.

245
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,660
I'll be leaving now.

246
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,060
Who are you?

247
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,580
I...

248
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,180
I'm just a student
at Four Virtues School.

249
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,220
A high priest?

250
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,860
Lu Huan!

251
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,460
Yes!

252
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,140
Your Majesty

253
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,140
I'm here.

254
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,820
I'm here.

255
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,940
This person claims to be a eunuch.

256
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,900
Do you recognize him?

257
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,180
Give me some explanation.

258
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,940
Mister Lu,

259
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,460
it's best that you're here.

260
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,820
Why do you dress like this?

261
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,540
What are you doing here?

262
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,260
Your Majesty,

263
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,220
I don't know him.

264
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,260
Bold assassin!

265
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,580
How dare you speak nonsense?

266
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,540
Your Majesty!

267
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,660
I swear with my life,

268
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,220
I have never seen this person before.

269
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,300
Mister Lu,

270
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm Li Mengmeng.

271
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,020
Speak!

272
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,460
Who are you?

273
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,660
This isn't a movie.

274
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,860
Did I travel through time?

275
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,420
They're not going to kill me, are they?

276
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,660
Merciful heavens! Please send us rain.

277
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,020
Spread blessings across the land.
Safeguard all living beings.

278
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,500
Capture him!

279
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,900
- Quickly!
- Wait!

280
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,860
Everyone, capture him!

281
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,460
I am a divine emissary

282
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,500
sent by the heavens to grant you rain.

283
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
How dare you show such disrespect!

284
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,660
He claims to be a divine emissary.

285
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,060
Is this a deity descending from heavens?

286
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,380
I am Xiao, the divine emissary!

287
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,340
Please bring us rain, oh mighty one!

288
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,380
I'm doomed!

289
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,100
Am I really going to die here?

290
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,380
I am Xiao, the divine emissary!

291
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,780
Please bring us rain, oh mighty one!

292
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,300
It's thundering!

293
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,980
It's thundering!

294
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,780
It's going to rain!

295
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,500
That's right!

296
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,660
We're saved!

297
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,060
It's raining!

298
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,900
It's actually raining!

299
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,780
It's raining!

300
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,660
It's really raining!

301
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,660
This...

302
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,340
A blessing upon our land!

303
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,380
This is indeed rain.

304
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,980
The heavens have answered our prayers.

305
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,420
This is wonderful!

306
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,980
This is truly remarkable!

307
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,540
Why don't you all quickly kneel down

308
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,740
and close your eyes?

309
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:57,980
Kneel down quickly!

310
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,860
Oh, divine emissary!

311
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,780
Pray with all your heart and sincerity,

312
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,900
so that the heavens

313
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,740
may perceive your earnestness.

314
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,780
Now's my chance!

315
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,740
I must escape this perilous place
without delay.

316
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,820
Why has the rain stopped again?

317
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,100
What's happening?

318
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Divine emissary?

319
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,180
Where did the divine emissary go?

320
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,900
Your Majesty,

321
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,620
although the rain just now was fleeting,

322
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,660
it may be a good omen.

323
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,420
A small amount of help
is not enough to solve a big problem.

324
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,060
Your Majesty, do not fret.

325
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,660
This rainmaking ritual
will surely succeed.

326
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,660
Also today, the sudden appearance

327
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,940
of that so-called divine emissary,

328
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,780
perhaps it truly was sent by the heavens

329
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,460
to aid us.

330
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,420
What divine emissary?

331
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,900
I highly doubt it.

332
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,380
If mere prayers could bring us rain,

333
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,820
then there would be no need

334
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,540
for these monthly rain ceremonies.

335
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,380
Yes!

336
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,060
For now,

337
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Our only hope now lies in

338
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,660
the success of our secret plan.

339
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,860
Otherwise, within three months,

340
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,100
the entire capital will lack of water.

341
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,940
That's right.

342
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,340
By the way,

343
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,820
Speaking of the divine emissary,

344
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,140
I fear he may be a spy
sent by Cui Anshi.

345
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,420
To be cautious,

346
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,820
those caught shall

347
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,460
face instant death.

348
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,580
Yes!

349
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
This is bad.

350
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,180
I must quickly think of a solution.

351
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,220
Where's the jar?

352
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,860
This is disastrous.

353
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,620
It's not broken.

354
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,780
There's no internet!

355
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,740
What dynasty is this?

356
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,940
Tang?

357
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,380
Song?

358
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,780
Yuan Ming?

359
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,180
Qing?

360
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,420
It doesn't look like any of them!

361
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,740
Greetings, Guard Kong.

362
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,700
Have you seen a strange-looking person?

363
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,060
In response to Guard Kong.

364
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
I have never seen it before.

365
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,100
If you do see one,

366
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,860
report it immediately.

367
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,580
Yes!

368
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,020
So it turns out that the one

369
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,780
who won't survive more than
three minutes in a TV show is me.

370
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,300
No way!

371
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,700
I have to escape!

372
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,340
So many ministerial clothes!

373
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,580
I have an idea.

374
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,700
Sir!

375
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,540
Sir!

376
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,660
The court meeting almost starts.

377
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,980
Why are you still here?

378
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,620
I...

379
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,660
just went to relieve myself.

380
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,100
To relieve myself.

381
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,780
I see.

382
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,020
I shall lead the way for you.

383
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
No need!

384
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,380
I can go by myself.

385
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,260
Sir,

386
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,060
the hall is that way.

387
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,380
I knelt for too long just now.

388
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,140
I'm dizzy...

389
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,020
I'm dizzy.

390
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,980
Oh, I made a mistake.

391
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,140
Sir,

392
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,780
it's court meeting.

393
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,700
We have actually summoned

394
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,620
a divine emissary.

395
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,260
The divine emissary's robe
is very strange.

396
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,580
Unfortunately, we were too far away

397
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,060
to see the divine emissary's face.

398
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,180
Why did the divine emissary

399
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,900
only appear for a moment?

400
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,820
I'm afraid he went back to heaven.

401
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,700
[Wanshou Hall]

402
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,980
Esteemed ministers,

403
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,780
if any of you have information
about the divine emissary

404
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,900
who appeared at today's
rain-praying ceremony,

405
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,300
I shall reward you handsomely.

406
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,620
We shall obey.

407
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,180
A severe drought has gripped
our northern regions for a long time.

408
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,140
Finally, today brings a glimmer of hope.

409
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,740
Do any of you

410
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,940
have other matters to discuss?

411
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,020
Your Majesty,

412
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,980
the arrival of the divine emissary

413
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,060
brings auspicious tidings to Qi Kingdom.

414
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,660
I implore Your Majesty to seize
this heavenly opportunity

415
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,940
and unite with the Noble Consort soon

416
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,780
to ensure Qi lineage continuation.

417
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,300
Your foresight is indeed remarkable.

418
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,060
As a third-generation

419
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,020
- Qi Kingdom?
-  high priest, I vouch for this.

420
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,380
This doesn't seem like
the Chunqiu Warring States period.

421
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,640
Therefore, I have found myself

422
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,780
in a dynasty
that does not exist in history.

423
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,300
Then why not calculate

424
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,100
when the divine emissary

425
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,780
who appeared today will reappear?

426
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,700
I await your good news.

427
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,980
Who is it?

428
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,460
Your Majesty, please spare me!

429
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,100
You seem to

430
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,660
have been eating well lately.

431
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,940
That's all for today.

432
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
The court is dismissed.

433
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,860
Long live our Emperor!
May your reign be long and prosperous!

434
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,140
[Wanshou Hall]

435
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,380
Today's court session has concluded.

436
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,780
It's gone.

437
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,700
Not this room?

438
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,740
Your Majesty.

439
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,420
What did you say was in the package

440
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,380
from the divine emissary?

441
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,420
It's heavy.

442
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,820
Why don't you open it and have a look.

443
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,500
No, I think not.

444
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,620
What if there's a hidden weapon inside?

445
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,100
Then...

446
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,580
Then you should talk less.

447
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,940
Hurry up and help me dress.

448
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,660
Emissary Xiao?

449
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,820
Be cautious, Your Majesty!

450
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,100
Is it some kind of hidden weapon?

451
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,220
How could Guard Kong

452
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,820
simply leave such a dangerous package
and depart?

453
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,220
Your Majesty, be wary!

454
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,300
Your Majesty.

455
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,860
This...

456
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,100
[Good morning]

457
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,460
This...

458
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,380
No!

459
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,740
It's you!

460
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,020
What a coincidence.

461
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,700
A man

462
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,100
as frail as you,

463
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,500
doesn't seem to be sent
to assassinate me.

464
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,620
Could you please

465
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,740
put down the sword first?

466
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,020
Honestly confess,

467
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,380
who sent you to disrupt

468
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,620
the rainmaking ritual?

469
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,180
Cui Anshi?

470
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,820
Gu Cheng?

471
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,140
Or perhaps my distant uncle
who stationed at the border?

472
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,300
Can't we

473
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,820
have a civilized conversation?

474
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,820
Can you please hand this over?

475
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,940
Or do you want to shed some blood
before confessing?

476
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,740
I speak!

477
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,740
I truly don't know anyone named Gu Cheng

478
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,940
or Cui Anshi.

479
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,980
Let alone someone

480
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,900
as distant as Huang Shu

481
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,780
Lv Shu, or Xiao Hong Shu.

482
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,340
I'm just

483
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,180
an ordinary student.

484
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,460
Where do you come from then?

485
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,420
Me?

486
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,660

I come from the future!

488
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,700
From the future?

489
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,180
Then...

490
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,300
why were you sneaking around my palace?

491
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,700
I lost my phone.

492
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,140
I was searching for it.

493
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,140
Is this...chicken?

This...

496
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,100
this is a chicken.

497
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,100
A chicken from my hometown!

498
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,620
An electronic chicken!

499
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,700
You may...

500
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,900
rise!

501
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,900
How dare you

502
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,820
show such disrespect to His Majesty!

503
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,580
Kneel down!

504
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,300
No one has ever dared
to treat me like this before.

505
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,940
I'm sorry.

506
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,860
I didn't mean to.

507
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,980
Your Majesty,

508
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,180
the noise made by the chicken just now

509
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,700
was probably a distress signal

510
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,180
to its accomplices.

511
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,340
It might be wise
to eliminate this threat now

512
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,740
to prevent future problems.

513
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,180
Then, dispose of him as you like.

514
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,540
Wait!

515
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,500

ratios, and arithmetic sequences.

I can travel anywhere
in the world without fear.

to the willow tree?

of the circular city?

This is bad!

544
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,420
I can't even understand the question.

545
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,540
Is this a math test

546
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,740
or a language test?

547
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,820
Your Majesty,

at the age of 18.

550
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,100

551
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,300
to solve this problem just now.

understand the question.

00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,420
don't even know the Pythagorean theorem.

568
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,660
How about this!

569
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,500
I'll give you another question

570
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,260
to see if you can solve it.

571
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,300
Please enlighten me!

572
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,420
Your Majesty,

573
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,300
perhaps this person
may be useful if kept alive.

574
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,300
Let's not kill him immediately.

575
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
I take my leave.

576
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,860
As a High Priest,

577
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,460
you still insist on studying.

578
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,460
I shall reward you.

579
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,140
This...

580
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,780
This is gold!

581
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,500
Take it!

582
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,220
How can I

583
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,380
accept such kindness?

584
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,820
Not only do you receive a reward,

585
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,340
but I'll also give you a new name.

586
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,540
It won't be "little table"
or "little stool", will it?

587
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,580
I don't want that.

588
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,060
Just call me Li Mengmeng.

589
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,020
Li Mengmeng?

590
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,140
That's actually not a bad name.

591
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,620
From today on,

592
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,860
stay by my side

593
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,780
- and teach me about your hometown.
- Huh?

594
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,020
You said you knew a lot

595
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,060
about your hometown.

596
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,820
Were you lying to me?

597
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,460
Of course not!

598
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,900
It's just that there's so much knowledge

599
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,220
from my hometown.

600
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,300
I don't know

601
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,460
where to start teaching from.

602
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,540
[8, 6, 4, 9, 3]

603
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,980
Alright!

604
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,780
Since you're so eager to learn

605
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,220
and improve yourself,

606
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,780
I'll reluctantly agree.

607
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,700
Prepare to be enlightened

608
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,540
by the knowledge from my hometown!

Minister Gu.

616
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,060
A mysterious person has been
in the imperial study recently.

617
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,220
On their first day in the study,

618
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,020
immediately impressed Your Majesty.

619
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,100
Now, it appears they are indulging
Your Majesty

620
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,700
in cockfighting.

621
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,980
Cockfighting?

622
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,140
Given the intensity of disaster,

623
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
such leisurely activities
by Your Majesty

624
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,460
harm the nation and its people.

625
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,180
Plan how to remove

626
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,140
the young eunuch from the palace.

627
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,740
Yes!

628
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,980
The multiplication table of nine.

629
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,260
Recite it!

630
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,180
One times one equals one.

631
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,700
One times one equals one.

632
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,020
One times two equals two.

633
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,860
One times three equals three.

634
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,140
One times four equals four.

635
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,020
One times five equals five.

636
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,580
One times six equals six.

637
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,260
One times seven equals seven.

638
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,820
One times eight equals eight.

639
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,620
Your Majesty,

640
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,820
are you truly considering

641
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,980
keeping Eunuch Li by your side?

642
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,500
His origins are unclear

643
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,700
and his behavior is peculiar.

644
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,020
I'm afraid...

645
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,060
Do you fear that he might be an agent

646
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,820
planted by others to monitor me?

647
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,260
After all, for so many years,

648
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,900
Prince He and Prime Minister Cui

649
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,220
have been constantly
watching your every move.

650
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,500
You do not want them
to know how painstakingly

651
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,180
you have hidden your plans.

652
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,580
What if this man divulges
this information?

653
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,500
Then would all your

654
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,820
years of effort be in vain?

655
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,620
He seems quite special,

656
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,100
unlike the usual spies.

657
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,260
I am curious to see what new tricks

658
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,900
