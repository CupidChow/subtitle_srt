00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,660
[Tongyun Inn]

190
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
This is the map of the Sai Residence.

191
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,040
It is really bustling today.

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,160
If it weren't for Master's orders,

193
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,520
I'd really want to go out
and have some fun.

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,640
We're here in Yang City
not to play around.

195
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
If you mess up the main task
just because of some fun,

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,800
Master will be unhappy with you.

197
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,080
You will be punished.

198
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,720
Did Master forget to close the window
when he left?

199
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,920
Mengmeng.

200
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
I can't help but feel that

201
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
your lantern looks better than mine.

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,200
Oh, please.

203
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,720
Both your lantern and mine

204
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,760
were made by me.

205
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,480
But I just feel like

206
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,840
yours is better than mine.

207
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,080
Is it because...

208
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,920
Because of what?

209
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,440
Because you're holding it.

210
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,640
Stop with the cheesy lines.

211
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,040
What lines?

212
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,400
By the way,

213
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,720
why did you say you like me?

214
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,840
Is there a reason
why you need to like someone?

215
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,320
If there is,

216
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,280
then it's not genuine.

217
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,960
It seems calculated.

218
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Hold on,

219
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,760
fold it here...

220
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,080
Careful.

221
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
Likin' someone...

222
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,160
- Here.
- Don't you really need reasons for it?

223
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,920
Do I need to?

224
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,440
Don't you need to?

225
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,640
Do I?

226
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,880
Oh, forget it! I won't argue with you.

227
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,120
But...

228
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
I've got someone in mind already.

229
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,720
Okay.

230
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,120
No biggie.

231
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,840
I like you, though.

232
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
It's my thing.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,880
It doesn't concern anyone else.

234
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,520
Even if you don't feel the same,

235
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,640
won't stop me from being good to you.

236
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,200
Right?

237
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,640
Besides,

238
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,600
sooner or later,
you'll come around to liking me.

239
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,520
Enough.

240
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Give it back to me.

241
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,720
I won't.

242
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,120
Give it back to me.

243
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,800
I don't want to.

244
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,520
Give it back to me.

245
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,880
Give it back to me.

246
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,440
No.

247
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,920
Give it to me.

248
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,840
No, I don't want to.

249
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,560
No.

250
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,560
Give it back to me.

251
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,360
So,

252
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,240
why don't we make a wish with this?

253
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,200
I envy Mengmeng

254
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,480
for having such a devoted gentleman

255
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,440
following her

256
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,560
and protecting her.

257
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Actually,

258
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,280
she's done a lot for me too.

259
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,960
You just don't understand.

260
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,360
Then...

261
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,280
Let's put more effort into this.

262
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,600
It's fireworks.

263
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,800
Let's go and have a look.

264
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,360
Come on, Mengmeng!

265
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Let's go and watch the fireworks.

266
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,680
Hurry up.

267
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,400

There's no reason for you to treat us.

340
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,240
You're all my guests.

341
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,080
Let's go.

342
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,080
I'll treat you all.

343
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Just drinking is boring.

344
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,560
How about we play a game?

345
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,560
A game?

346
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,400
What game do you have in mind, Miss Sai?

347
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,400
There's a popular game
in Yang City lately

348
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,160
called Truth or Honesty.

349
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,640
Truth or Honesty?

350
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,200
It's basically two people
playing rock-paper-scissors.

351
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,360
Whoever loses

352
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,800
has to answer a question
from the other person.

353
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,760
If they can't answer,

354
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,040
they have to drink.

355
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,040
Isn't it just Truth or Dare?

356
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,480
Have you played it, Mengmeng?

357
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,960
Come on.

358
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,040
It's okay.

359
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,080
If you don't want to drink,

360
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,920
I'll drink for you.

361
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,640
This sounds fun.

362
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,160
I'll go first.

363
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,480
Rock, paper, scissors,

364
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,080
shoot!

365
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,320
I won.

366
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm willing to accept the loss.

367
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,240
Ask away.

368
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,040
Can I ask anything?

369
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,520
Of course.

370
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm an open book.

371
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,640
Where's the Sai Residence's treasure?

372
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,440
Again.

373
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,320
Come on.

374
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,960
Rock, paper, scissors,

375
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,680
shoot!

376
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,520
I won again.

377
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,880
Ask away.

378
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
What are you,

379
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,160
a Ximi person, doing in Yang City?

380
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,320
Some things are better left unsaid.

381
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,000
Is there anything you can't share?

382
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
Don't play dumb.

383
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
I said I can't say it.

384
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,640
Why are you forcing me?

385
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,400
I won't let you drink. Speak.

386
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,440
Do you have some secret purpose?

387
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,520
I'm here to find a wife.

388
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,640
Find a wife.

389
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,520
To find a wife?

390
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,800
Do you have to
come to Yang City to find a wife?

391
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,760
I don't believe it.

392
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,280
Believe it or not.

393
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,680
You...

394
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,520
Another round!

395
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,800
Hold on. Hold on.

396
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,760
I'm done playing with you.

397
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,200
I want to play with Mengmeng.

398
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,360
I can't do it anymore.

399
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

400
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,040
I'll play with you.

401
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,320
Let's play.

402
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,800
Rock, paper, scissors,

403
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,480
shoot!

404
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,560
I won.

405
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm not that interested in you either.

406
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,840
Let me think about what to ask you.

407
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,600
I want to ask, I want to ask...

408
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,680
Mister Yan.

409
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,520
Since you mentioned
you have an engagement with Mengmeng,

410
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,480
why don't you tell us

411
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,720
about your relationship?

412
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,800
Two months ago,

413
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,360
she spent time with me on my birthday.

414
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,520
I remember that day vividly.

415
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,360
I mentioned I wanted the moon,

416
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
[Mengmeng gifted it to Yan.]

417
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
then she gifted it to me.

418
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
That was when I realized

419
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
that having feelings for someone,

420
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,240
the heart
would started pounding uncontrollably.

421
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
And uncontrollably

422
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,600
wanted to be with her.

423
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,960
But one day,

424
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,040
she suddenly said goodbye

425
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,840
because she had to return home.

426
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,160
However, I missed her terribly.

427
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,960
So, I kept searching for her.

428
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,400
Finally I found her in Yang City.

429
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,440
Mengmeng.

430
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,640
Is Yang City your hometown?

431
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,720
My hometown is beyond the moon.

432
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,840
Mengmeng.

433
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,720
Do you want to go back home

434
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,280
but fear making me angry,

435
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,720
so you pretended not to recognize me?

436
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,960
Mengmeng.

437
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,600
I won't give you

438
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,720
another chance to leave me.

439
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,040
Even if we face difficulties
in the future,

440
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,720
we'll face them together.

441
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,480
Even if one day

442
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,840
you really want to go back home,

443
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,640
I will find you.

444
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,880
I...

445
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,280
Don't feel well?

446
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
Just let me vomit.

447
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,800
Don't come near me.

448
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,400
Mengmeng.

449
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,880
Your Majesty,

450
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
we've found a clue.

451
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,200
Come with me.

452
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,040
What have you discovered?

453
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,520
I went to his previous residence

454
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,280
and found this blueprint.

455
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,960
Indeed, something fishy is going on.

456
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,240
This is the Sai Residence.

457
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,000
But I don't know where this is.

458
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,840
Keep an eye on him.

459
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,320
Perhaps, he can help us uncover the truth
about the disaster relief grains.

460
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,440
Understood.

461
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
Qi Yan.

462
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Where are you?

463
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,840
Where could he be?

464
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Did you see Mister Yan?

465
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,440
He seemed to
have gone in that direction.

466
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
Over there.

467
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,600
It's so dark.

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,880
Let me guide you.

469
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Thank you.

470
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,600
You're very kind.

471
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
He seems unfamiliar.

472
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,440
Why is it getting darker here?

473
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,000
I just saw Mister Yan

474
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,040
heading that way.

475
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,120
He seemed to be right ahead.

476
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,360
I'll head back first.

477
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,360
You search around.

478
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,080
Alright.

479
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,280
Your Highness,

480
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,760
are you sure about this?

481
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,960
Mengmeng.

482
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,120
Qi Yan.

483
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,680
I finally found you.

484
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,440
Mengmeng.

485
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,680
Your Majesty.

486
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,520
It seems safe here.

487
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,880
Are you alright?

488
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm fine.

489
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,880
Your Majesty.

490
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,440
I like you.

491
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,200
You...

492
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
Did you hear me?

493
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm serious.

494
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,120
I like you.

495
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,960
Like you very, very much.

496
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,080
Extremely much.

497
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,080
Alright.

498
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,720
I know.

499
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
And...

500
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,440
And before, I'm sorry.

501
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,080
Sorry for what?

502
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,800
I always felt like

503
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,560
I didn't belong here.

504
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,760
So

505
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I thought

506
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,720
we would eventually separate.

507
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,000
But now I understand.

508
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,720
As long as
we can be together for one day,

509
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,800
I'll cherish every moment.

510
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,640
Alright.

511
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,880
Why do you like me?

512
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
Probably just out of habit.

513
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
Whenever you're not around,

514
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,400
I feel particularly irritable.

515
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,160
No wonder Li Tao said

516
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,760
you didn't need a reason
to like someone.

517
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,480
If you can tell the reason,

518
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,840
it's all just a scheme.

519
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,280
And you?

520
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,120
Why do you like me?

521
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,160
Because every time I need you,

522
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,080
you're there for me.

523
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,240
Your Majesty.

524
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,880
Your Majesty, are you in there?

525
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,480
These mosquitoes outside are too much.

526
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,240
If you're not in a hurry,

527
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,080
let's go to the room and talk.

528
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,680
Did he hear us, didn't he?

529
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,240
Hurry up

530
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,200
and get us out of here.

531
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,920
Yes.

532
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,520
What did I just say?

533
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,160
He is waitting for me to rescue him.

534
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,640
Why are you still making me wait?

535
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
It'll be done soon, Your Majesty.

536
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,520
Your Majesty, I'm here.

537
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,080
I told you to rescue us.

538
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,960
Why did you come down?

539
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,360
Your Majesty, I...

540
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,880
Your Majesty,

541
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,600
please wait.

542
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,000
I'll lower the rope.

543
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,600
Kong An.

544
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,000
Let me check.

545
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,920
Your Majesty.

546
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
This is clearly a dry well.

547
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,720
Why are there
so many things stored here?

548
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,200
So much rice.

549
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,960
The Sai family is indeed wealthy.

550
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,760
Despite the shortage of food everywhere,

551
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,480
they still have so much.

552
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,720
But why hide the rice here?

553
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,920
Aren't they afraid of it getting damp?

554
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
They're not worried about dampness.

555
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,480
But rather,

556
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,040
they fear someone discovering it.

557
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,920
The relief grain from the court

558
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,760
is being escorted
by the Sai Family Escort.

559
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,360
This is the relief grain.

560
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,280
Hey, keep your voice down.

561
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,560
The bottom of this well
is still very dry.

562
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,120
There isn't even any moss.

563
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,400
It means the well cover
is usually closed.

564
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,240
So,

565
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,200
the little guy
who led Mengmeng here just now

566
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,680
intentionally set up a trap

567
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,080
to lure us down here.

568
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,520
Second Prince.

569
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,640
I didn't do well.

570
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,720
I was recognized by that Mister Yan.

571
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,760
Get up.

572
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Yes, Your Highness.

573
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
It's not your fault.

574
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,680
You should

575
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,120
avoid appearing
in front of them in the future.

576
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,080
They should have discovered

577
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,760
the relief grain by now.

578
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
No merchant would remain indifferent

579
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,320
to such a large quantity of grain.

580
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,120
Master Sai will arrive
in Yang City soon,

581
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,360
and our plan
can be implemented immediately.

582
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
If it weren't
for Master Sai's vacillation,

583
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,120
Second Prince,

584
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
you wouldn't need to
go through so much trouble.

585
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,120
Second Prince,

586
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,640
I brought the money.

587
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,320
Where's the goods?

588
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,400
It's not enough.

589
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,120
What's the meaning of this?

590
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,200
Didn't we agree on the price earlier?

591
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,760
Such a large quantity of grain

592
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,240
isn't just what you Ximi people want.

593
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
I went to great lengths

594
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,800
to secure this grain

595
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,880
for Second Prince.

596
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,320
How much more do you want?

597
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,760
Add another fifty percent.

598
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,240
Let's go.

599
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,160
Second Prince,
take your time to consider.

600
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,240
[Sai Residence]

601
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,000
The Sai Residence is indeed not simple.

602
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,200
Kong An, search carefully again.

603
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,040
Yes.

604
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,440
The map in the Second Prince's room

605
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,800
probably marks that well.

606
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,160
Who is the Second Prince?

607
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,440
It's Li Tao.

608
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,080
What?

609
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,240
Li Tao is the Ximi Second Prince?

610
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,240
Miss,

611
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,880
are you trying to lure them all here?

612
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,200
Are you awake now?

613
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,640
Still feeling dizzy?

614
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,440
A little.

615
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,080
No more drinking so much in the future.

616
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,160
Got it.

617
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,600
You just said
Li Tao is the Second Prince.

618
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,440
What is he doing here?

619
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,520
I was wondering about that too.

620
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,120
How could a member
of the Ximi royal family

621
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,720
be in the Sai Residence?

622
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,760
It wasn't until today
when we saw that batch of relief grain

623
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,480
that everything made sense.

624
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,760
He discovered the relief grain.

625
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,640
Why would he deliberately lead us here?

626
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,160
Could it be that
he found out your true identity

627
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,280
and intends to report you?

628
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,920
His real purpose

629
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,440
is only that batch of relief grain.

630
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm just a pawn

631
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,960
in his plan.

632
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,360
Ever since the drought in the north,

633
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,160
grain and rice have only been allowed
to be sold by the government.

634
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,760
The south isn't short of grain.

635
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,240
Moreover,
this batch of relief grain is enormous.

636
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,800
It's been quite some time

637
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,280
since it was stolen.

638
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,040
Yet it's still in the Sai Residence.

639
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,640
This shows
that they don't want to distribute it

640
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,080
but rather make a big business deal.

641
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,720
The Sai Residence embezzles relief grain

642
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,480
to do business with the Ximi.

643
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,800
But since it's for business,

644
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,800
why did Li Tao

645
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,720
sneak into the Sai Residence?

646
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,120
Perhaps the deal
hasn't been negotiated yet,

647
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,600
so he had to sneak in

648
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,480
and force the Ximi Second Prince
to handle it personally.

649
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Now Li Tao knows the location

650
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,520
of this batch of relief grain.

651
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,880
But the quantity is huge.

652
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,400
He has no way

653
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,080
to move the grain

654
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,960
without alerting the Sai Residence.

655
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,040
So, he needs to find a scapegoat

656
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,760
to actively discover this grain.

657
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,120
And then he can do business
with the Sai Family..

658
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,880
I see.

659
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,800
The mantis stalks the cicada,

660
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,160
unaware of the oriole behind.

661
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,200
He wants you to move the grain first,

662
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
then he'll snatch it

663
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,520
from you.

664
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,040
He's too cunning.

665
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,040
But he

666
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,280
didn't consider

667
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,520
Your Majesty's identity.

668
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,800
What should we do now?

669
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,800
Mister Sai will be returning
to the residence soon.

670
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,520
Should we wait for him
to return before taking action?

671
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,280
Come.

672
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
We can

673
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,720
wait for the right moment

674
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,000
and use this method to deal with it.

675
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,000
Like this.

676
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,500
[Yang City]

677
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,740
[Safe Travels]

678
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,600
Hey, buddies!

679
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,360
[Sai Residence]
Quick, tidy this up!

680
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,240
Everyone, go back
to your wives and children.

681
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,920
Alright!

682
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,320
Mister Sai.

683
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,000
Come on!

684
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,680
Mister Sai.

685
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,880
[Sai Residence]

686
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Mister Zhang.

687
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,520
Did you manage
to find buyers for that batch of grain?

688
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,480
What grain?

689
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,520
Mister Sai, stop pretending.

690
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,680
Everyone in Yang City knows

691
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,240
you have a batch of grain

692
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,720
and you're looking for buyers.

693
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,240
The whole Yang City knows?

694
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,800
Indeed.

695
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,040
I came early

696
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,920
to make sure no one else grabs it first.

697
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,920
Mister Zhang,

698
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,720
are you kidding me?

699
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,000
It's illegal to trade grain privately.

700
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,920
Perhaps someone spread rumors.

701
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
My family indeed has grain.

702
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,240
But it's only enough for us

703
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,320
and our brothers to use.

704
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,400
Really?

705
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,600
Mister Zhang,

706
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,080
we have a long-standing friendship.

707
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
Can't I lie to you?

708
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,560
As soon as I got wind of this,

709
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
I was thinking about

710
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,480
how to distribute this grain.

711
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,800
So, it was just a misunderstanding.

712
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,760
Mister Zhang, since you're here,

713
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,280
please come on in

714
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
for a rest.

715
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,480
No need.

716
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,280
You've had a tough journey.

717
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
I won't bother you.

718
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,920
I'll take my leave then.

719
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,480
Take care.

720
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Farewell.

721
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,880
Old Master.

722
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,560
There's news about grain
at our Sai Residence.

723
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,520
What's going on?

724
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,600
Since last night,

725
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,800
rumors have been
circulating in Yang City.

726
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,520
Some of the prominent families

727
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,600
have been inquiring openly
or discreetly.

728
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Have you found out

729
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,240
where the news came from?

730
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,720
Please forgive me, Master.

731
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,040
We haven't found out yet.

732
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,600
It's been several hours

733
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,400
since last night

734
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,560
and you still haven't found out.

735
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,120
Trading grain is a big deal.

736
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,800
Are you suggesting

737
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,560
you want our Sai Residence
to be searched?

738
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,160
I...

739
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,520
Master, it's my fault.

740
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,520
Dad,

741
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,560
you're back!

742
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,440
Why is Fu kneeling?

743
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,000
Did something happen?

744
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,960
I ordered you to report

745
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,520
as soon as there's news.

746
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,400
Get out.

747
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,060
Yes.

748
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,680
Dad,

749
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,040
you've been away
on this escort mission for so long.

750
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,080
Did you bring any gifts for me?

751
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,440
How could I forget

752
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,960
the gifts?

753
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
The gifts are all in the carriage.

754
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,880
After a while,
once they're done cleaning up,

755
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
someone will come by to deliver it.

756
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,680
I knew you are the best to me!

757
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,960
By the way,

758
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,080
about the portrait
I gave you of the young men,

759
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,160
did you find anyone you love?

760
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,080
Oh, right, Dad.

761
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,720
We've had some guests

762
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,800
at our residence these past few days.

763
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,760
Why haven't I seen them?

764
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,680
You'll see them tonight.

765
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,320
Eat more. Eat more.

766
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,040
Here, have some.

767
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
Isn't Mister Li supposed to be here too?

768
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Why haven't I seen him?

769
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,600
He's busy.

770
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,560
Don't worry about him.

771
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,360
Let's eat first.

772
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,360
I heard

773
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,080
 that Mister Yan
is from the Su City Chamber of Commerce.

774
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
You are really promising.

775
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,320
Mister Sai, you're too kind.

776
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,080
I am just sheltered
by my ancestors' prestige,

777
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,360
unlike you

778
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,720
who built such a vast Sai Commerce

779
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,880
from scratch.

780
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,080
I heard that

781
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,760
you have a military supply order

782
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,400
from the border.

783
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,480
I remember last winter

784
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,400
when I escorted the goods to the border

785
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,200
and encountered a sandstorm.

786
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,640
It was almost impossible to return.

787
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,720
You seem to have remembered wrong.

788
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,960
Last winter, there was turmoil
on the border,

789
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,480
and the court
closed the commercial routes.

790
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,760
Our business suffered because of it.

791
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,640
I'm getting old.

792
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
It's easy to mix things up.

793
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
No, no.

794
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,760
This time,

795
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,440
I brought some fabric back.

796
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,360
Sai Xue,

797
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,880
take Miss Li

798
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
to see if there's anything she likes,

799
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,000
make a few outfits.

800
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,080
Consider it my apology

801
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,000
to Mister Yan and Miss Li.

802
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,040
Got it, Dad.

803
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,440
Mengmeng, let's go.

804
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,440
Oh, right.

805
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,560
Did you return the indenture to Miss Li?

806
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,160
I almost forgot.

807
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,040
I'll have Lingdang do it.

808
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,480
Let's go.

809
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,920
Looks like I've spoiled
my daughter too much

810
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,400
and neglected Miss Li.

811
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,720
Mister Yan,
I'll take a drink as my punishment.

812
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,240
Mister Sai, you're too kind.

813
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,280
Mister Yan, are you planning to

814
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,720
take Miss Li back to Su City?

815
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,320
There's no rush for that.

816
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,520
I still want to discuss a grain trade

817
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,560
with you.

818
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,840
So Mister Yan,

819
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,960
you've heard about that
ridiculous rumor too.

820
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,920
I wonder

821
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,960
who's spreading such nonsense.

822
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,360
Your Majesty has ordered that

823
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,320
only the government

824
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,480
can handle grain transactions.

825
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,600
This seems like
a setup to frame my family.

826
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
True or not,

827
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,600
I don't know.

828
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,400
But what I do know is that

829
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,160
dealing with this grain
is like handling a sticky candy.

830
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,840
It's precious,

831
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,840
but it can be hard

832
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,200
to manage and clean up

833
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,560
once it's in your hands.

834
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,400
In Yang City,

835
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,440
there are plenty of merchants

836
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,640
eager to buy grain.

837
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,360
If I did have grain,

838
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,240
Mister Yan, what advantage
do you think you'd have?

839
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,760
I don't have

840
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,240
any special advantages.

841
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,680
Just one thing,

842
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,680
I'm not short of money.

843
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,840
If indeed you have grain, Mr. Sai,

844
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,920
I'm willing to buy it

845
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,880
at a price three times
higher than the market rate.

846
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,880
Mister Yan, you're quite generous.

847
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,760
If I truly had grain,

848
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,200
then I'd definitely seek out you

849
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,440
to make this deal happen.

850
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,200
I am waitting for good news from you.

851
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,400
Mister Li.

852
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,480
Where's Miss Sai?

853
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,040
She's in her room
picking fabrics with Miss Li.

854
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,720
She asked me to bring Miss Li's package.

855
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,320
Lingdang.

856
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,360
Mister Sai wants you.

857
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
Okay, I'll go.

858
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,280
Please do me a favor, Mr. Li.

859
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,960
Please return this package to Miss Li.

860
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,320
Let's go.

861
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,000
Indenture?

862
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,480
