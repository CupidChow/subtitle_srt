00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,920
you're awake.

193
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
Dad,

194
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
is the drama over?

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,360
Not yet.

196
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,880
Sorry, Dad.

197
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,160
The drama made me so sleepy.

198
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,560
I couldn't help falling asleep
as soon as they started singing.

199
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,520
It's okay.

200
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,840
Daddy will take you home to sleep.

201
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,080
Next time, I will definitely
finish watching it with Daddy.

202
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,160
I won't sleep.

203
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,720
You promise?

204
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,320
- Pinky promise.
- Pinky promise for a hundred years.

205
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,220
Bravo!

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,760
Nope.

207
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,720
I surely won't fall asleep.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600
I definitely, definitely
won't sleep this time.

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,440
I must finish watching with him.

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,520
Why are you here?

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah, why are you here?

212
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,000
Stay down.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,680
You're blocking me.

214
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,400
Mengmeng.

215
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,440
Didn't you say you didn't want to come?

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
How come you came without telling me?

217
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
You watched dramas with other man.

218
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
Would you care to explain?

219
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,600
You're sitting in my seat. Get up.

220
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Does it have your name written on it?

221
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,480
First come, first served.

222
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
This is Minister Li's seat.

223
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
Greetings to both masters.

224
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,960
Minister Li.

225
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,680
- Sir, you have a seat.
- Please, have a seat.

226
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,200
I'll sit in the back.

227
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,920
You sit, you sit.

228
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
Minister Li, ignore them. Please sit.

229
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
Well, then, thank you.

230
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,280
Since Mengmeng has said so,

231
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,480
I'll sit in the back then.

232
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,320
It's alright, Minister Li.

233
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,960
Please enjoy.

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,920
Master Li,

235
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,720
please.

236
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,040
You...

237
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Are you trying to mess
with me on purpose?

238
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,040
I don't even take you seriously.

239
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,600
Why would I do that?

240
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,440
Is that so?

241
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
Then why do I smell a strong scent

242
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,600
of jealousy every day?

243
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,640
Keep it down, keep it down.

244
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,560
What's with the noise?

245
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Exactly, what's with the noise?

246
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,720
Why all this fuss is about?

247
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,160
Where did these rude men come from?

248
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
If you're not watching
the show, get out.

249
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,160
Out!

250
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,600
It's all your fault.

251
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,680
Has she...

252
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
been influenced by Sai Xue lately?

253
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,560
Why is she so mean?

254
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,360
I think she's quite cute.

255
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm really sorry.

256
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I still couldn't let you

257
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,680
finish watching the drama.

258
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,160
Some things,

259
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,920
are destined not to be perfect.

260
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,320
Don't dwell too much on the outcome,

261
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,080
the journey is more important.

262
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,440
As long as there are beautiful moments
along the way,

263
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,520
that's good enough.

264
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,760
It's like us
watching the show together today.

265
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,320
Minister Li.

266
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,360
What kind of person
do you hope Wanwan will become

267
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,600
when she grows up?

268
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
As long as Wanwan

269
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
can grow up safely and happily,

270
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,720
that's all I ask for.

271
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,440
Alright.

272
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,120
Wait.

273
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,280
Let's go.

274
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,280
I...

275
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,960
Run!

276
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,680
Go!

277
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,600
Be careful.

278
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,600
Miss Li.

279
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,840
Dad.

280
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,760
Are you...Are you hurt?

281
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,240
I'm fine.

282
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,360
How about you?

283
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,680
Does it hurt?

284
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm fine. I'm fine.

285
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm fine.

286
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,920
Wanwan.

287
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,720
Don't cry.

288
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,960
Dad.

289
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
Dad.

290
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,320
Dad.

291
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,080
Dad.

292
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,260
[Qi Kingdom Bestowed Minister,
Tomb of Li Ming]

293
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,820
[Qi Kingdom Bestowed Minister,
Tomb of Li Ming]

294
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,880
Mengmeng.

295
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,600
Don't be too sad.

296
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,160
You two should go back first.

297
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,520
I want to stay here
alone for a little longer.

298
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,440
If it weren't for me,

299
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,400
Minister Li wouldn't have
gotten into trouble.

300
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
It wasn't your fault.

301
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,640
Don't worry.

302
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,560
I will definitely make these people pay.

303
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,880
Your Majesty.

304
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,600
We've looked into it.

305
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,600
They were Chancellor Cui's people.

306
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,080
Chancellor Cui is outrageous.

307
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,880
To have the audacity
to come and assassinate Your Majesty.

308
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,400
He must have been
waiting for a long time.

309
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,240
Chancellor Cui failed this time,

310
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
he will definitely try again.

311
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
You must protect Wan and Mengmeng.

312
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,800
Yes.

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,360
Has Mengmeng eaten today?

314
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
She only ate a little
and then had someone return it.

315
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
Do you want to eat some noodles?

316
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,600
You haven't eaten anything all day.

317
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,600
I don't want to eat.

318
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,040
How about some osmanthus cake?

319
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm not really hungry.

320
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,800
Here you go.

321
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,280
It's so beautiful.

322
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,320
If you like it, I'll buy you
a bouquet every day.

323
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,960
That's great.

324
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880

No.

349
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
You got caught in the rain.

350
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,520
You'll get a cold if you don't drink it.

351
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,760
Just leave it here.

352
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,720
I'll drink it later.

353
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,760
It'll be cold soon.

354
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
I...I'm afraid it might be too hot.

355
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,520
Let me feed you.

356
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,280
Chancellor.

357
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,200
The men we sent out didn't succeed.

358
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,360
A bunch of useless people.

359
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,680
However,

360
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,880
Li Ming is dead.

361
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,640
Li Ming is dead?

362
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

363
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,840
What's the use of killing him?

364
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,760
Where are they now?

365
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,920
Still in Yang City.

366
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,280
Do we need to send more people?

367
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,200
What do you think?

368
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,760
Chancellor.

369
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,080
Prince Heqin is here.

370
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,640
I can't believe he's still alive.

371
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,720
What about Wan?

372
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,560
Quick.

373
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,560
Let him in.

374
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,040
Yes.

375
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,600
Your Grace.

376
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,480
No need to be so formal.

377
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,860
Please sit.

378
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,080
Your Grace,

379
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,040
please have a seat.

380
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,840
I wonder what's the purpose

381
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
of Your Grace's visit

382
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,760
to my residence today.

383
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
I came here today

384
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,760
to negotiate a deal with chancellor.

385
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,320
A deal?

386
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm not sure what I can really do

387
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,800
for Your Grace?

388
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,800
You can leave first.

389
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,440
I want to...

390
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,720
be the Emperor of Qi Kingdom.

391
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,760
Your Grace must be kidding me.

392
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
I'll just pretend as if Your Grace

393
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,800
has never been to my residence before.

394
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,320
Besides I've never heard

395
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,840
Your Grace say anything like this.

396
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,600
Your Grace,

397
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,840
please leave.

398
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,040
Chancellor, you don't
need to pretend anymore.

399
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,120
Your goals and mine are the same.

400
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,680
I can give you a hand.

401
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,840
Are you slandering me for treason?

402
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,320
Your Grace.

403
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,320
Joking about things like this
that can get you killed

404
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,520
is definitely not allowed.

405
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you know

406
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,200
that Wan is already
dead in the pirate's lair?

407
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Wan?

408
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,080
Wasn't she with His Majesty

409
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,880
in the summer palace?

410
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,160
It's all because of Qi Yan.

411
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,560
He wasn't even in the summer palace.

412
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,080
He left Wan in the summer palace

413
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,160
and that's how she was
captured by the pirates.

414
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,640
So,

415
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,680
it was the pirates who killed Wan?

416
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,280
These people are ruthless.

417
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,200
No.

418
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,080
It wasn't the pirates.

419
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,480
It was Qi Yan who killed Wan.

420
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,640
He knew the pirates had taken Wan.

421
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,080
Instead of rescuing her,

422
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,480
he sent someone to kill her

423
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,840
for his own reputation.

424
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,000
I must avenge

425
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,800
this blood feud!

426
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,680
Please, chancellor.

427
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
Assist me.

428
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,760
Wan...

429
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,480
I lost Ying before.

430
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,680
Now I've lost Wan.

431
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,960
Why is my life so miserable?

432
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
To be honest,

433
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,000
I was planning to take Wan
with me and leave before.

434
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
But now...

435
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
I really owe Wan too much.

436
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm truly grateful

437
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,160
for your devotion to my little girl.

438
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
I'm in such deep pain right now.

439
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,560
My mind is blank with grief.

440
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,920
May Your Grace allow me
some time to recover

441
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,000
and think carefully before
reporting back to you.

442
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,560
Please, Your Grace.

443
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
Chancellor Cui.

444
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
Please accept my condolences.

445
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,840
Wan...

446
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,960
Wan...

447
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
His Majesty has been away
in the summer palace for so long.

448
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,680
He's back finally.

449
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,000
However,

450
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,920
why is the palanquin so tightly covered?

451
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,360
I heard His Majesty
caught an illness outside the palace.

452
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,600
It's contagious.

453
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,960
Do you want to be dead?

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,200
It seems like chancellor has acted.

455
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,160
I only had one daughter.

456
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,800
This feud must be repaid.

457
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,000
Please rest assured, Your Grace.

458
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,200
I will do my utmost

459
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,480
to assist you.

460
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,760
Thank you, Chancellor.

461
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,200
Chancellor.

462
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,000
Doesn't it seem too easy

463
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,240
to win over Prince Heqin?

464
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,000
No matter what he's up to,

465
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,280
let's just wait and see.

466
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,280
Let him deal with His Majesty.

467
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,080
As for us, we'll be
the fisherman who profits.

468
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,240
Yes.

469
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,840
Chancellor is really thoughtful.

470
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,000
Freshly baked pastries!

471
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,880
Come and taste! Take a look!

472
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Here!

473
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,880
Take a look!

474
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,040
Free samples!

475
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,640
Also, packaged ones!

476
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,180
Come and take a look!

477
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,040
[Pastries]

478
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,880
Come, Master!

479
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
Take a look!

480
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,960
You can give it to a friend as a gift.

481
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,440
Are you buying for someone?

482
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
It's for a girl you like, right?

483
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,200
What flavor does she like?

484
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,760
Sweet or sour?

485
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,640
Sweet.

486
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Try this one.

487
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,280
How is it?

488
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,560
I'll take a packet of these.

489
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,280
Okay.

490
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,320
Two packets!

491
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,280
Sure!

492
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,800
I'll wrap them up for you right away.

493
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,360
His Majesty is back.

494
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,600
Surely Kong An is back too.

495
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,880
I wonder what he'll bring me.

496
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,240
Once I've delivered
the talismans to the Empress,

497
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,480
I can go find Kong An.

498
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,440
Your Highness.

499
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,560
Your Highness.

500
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,720
How is His Majesty's illness?

501
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
I was stopped when I'd just arrived

502
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,160
at His Majesty's chamber.

503
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,040
Who stopped you?

504
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
It was the Imperial Guards.

505
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,880
Why did the Imperial Guards stop you?

506
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
Reporting to the Your Highness,

507
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,120
Chancellor Cui requests a meeting.

508
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,160
Brother.

509
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,600
Why are the Imperial Guards
guarding Yan's chamber?

510
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,800
You may leave.

511
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,440
Yes.

512
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,800
That's because His Majesty
isn't actually in the palace.

513
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,760
His Majesty's return
to the palace due to an illness

514
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,760
was just a scheme I arranged.

515
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,760
So where is Yan now?

516
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,120
He secretly went to Yang City
from the summer palace.

517
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,160
Moreover,

518
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
he won't be coming back.

519
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,000
What do you mean?

520
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,600
He has leverage over me.

521
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,080
If he were to return,

522
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,080
the Cui family would be
completely finished.

523
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,040
Brother.

524
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,400
You've lost your mind.

525
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,920
He's the backbone of our Cui family.

526
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,160
You've watched him grow up.

527
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,360
No matter what you've done,

528
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,800
I can help you persuade him.

529
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,880
Will he listen to you?

530
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,000
Besides,

531
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,040
can you really blame this on me

532
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,200
for this situation?

533
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,160
Who in this world doesn't know

534
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,480
that half of Qi's territory

535
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,120
was conquered by our Cui family.

536
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,560
Even the former Emperor said

537
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,880
that the Empress of the Qi family

538
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,400
must be the Cui family's

539
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,160
daughter.

540
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,320
However,

541
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,280
look at how he treats Wan now.

542
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,280
That's why,

543
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,120
I'm running out of

544
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,280
patience with this person.

545
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,360
Brother,

546
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,320
please tell me where Yan is.

547
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
For the sake of the nation
and the people,

548
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
please spare him!

549
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,280
Brother.

550
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,840
Who is there?

551
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,560
You stay here.

552
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,960
Take your time to think it through.

553
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,440
Brother.

554
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,360
Chancellor.

555
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,680
Who just came?

556
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
It was a palace maid
from the Lingtai Pavilion.

557
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,840
She said she came to deliver
talismans to the Empress.

558
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,400
She also said that the talismans
for today must not be delayed.

559
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
So I let her in.

560
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,920
Where is she?

561
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,600
She just left.

562
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,680
Then why don't you
hurry and go after her?

563
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,280
Yes.

564
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,800
Wait.

565
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,320
Remember, don't leave anyone alive.

566
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,200
Yes.

567
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,840
