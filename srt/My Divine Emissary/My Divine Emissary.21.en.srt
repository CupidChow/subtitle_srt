Hurry up and step back!

173
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,800
Forgive us, Emissary.

174
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
Does this mean I'm disappearing?

175
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,680
Although I should be grateful
for the timely rain,

176
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,280
but this time,

177
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,120
I'd completely disappeared.

178
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,520
What does that mean?

179
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
Can I go back?

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,400
Or will I disappear forever?

181
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,560
It's been so long.

182
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,880
I should be happy to go back.

183
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,840
However,

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,320
if I really

185
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,240
suddenly disappear from this world,

186
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,360
what is Qi Yan going to do?

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
Will he hate me?

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,560
What about Kong An?

193
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,160
Is he alright?

194
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,400
I've never seen him like this,

195
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
moping around all day.

196
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,320
It just shows how important
Zhou Quan was to him.

197
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,400
Perhaps Zhou Quan just went on a trip

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,280
and would be back soon.

199
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,280
We will definitely see her again.

200
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,000
Of course.

201
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,120
We definitely will.

202
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,640
Do you know how I felt the other day

203
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,520
when you collapsed in my arms?

204
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,040
What did you feel?

205
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,880
I felt like the sky was falling,

206
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,760
crushing me so hard
till I couldn't breathe.

207
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,240
I couldn't even believe
that you were going to leave me.

208
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
Later,

209
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,640
Qi Su locked me in the room.

210
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,560
Even though my heart was still beating,

211
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
but my soul

212
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,200
had already left with you.

213
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,240
Don't be silly.

214
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm fine now, am I not?

215
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,240
Qi Yan.

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Do you know

217
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
maybe I'm going to disappear too?

218
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,160
If I disappear,

219
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,280
what's going to happen to you?

220
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Will you suffer in pain like Kong An?

221
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Mengmeng.

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,440
No matter what will happen
in the future,

223
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,560
I hope you always remember

224
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,280
that I will love you forever.

225
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,280
Toasting with tea

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,360
to celebrate Wan's freedom.

227
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,920
Your Majesty's
sending us off personally.

228
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,000
This way,

229
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,480
isn't the rumor of me
being exiled to the border

230
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,600
going to collapse on itself?

231
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,000
Who spread such rumor?

232
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's so inaccurate.

233
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,280
Obviously, it is you
who didn't want to see me,

234
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,640
and deliberately ran away
as far as possible.

235
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,920
Didn't you say you wanted to
come and send them off?

236
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,400
Why have you been

237
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,480
so quiet since you came?

238
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,080
Are you too sad to part with me?

239
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,360
You talk too much!

240
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,680
Mengmeng.

241
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,400
We're not gone forever.

242
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,440
I'll write letters to you regularly.

243
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,080
We'll meet again someday.

244
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,280
Li Tao.

245
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,840
What's this?

246
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,280
The underground aqueduct blueprints?

247
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,920
I thought you stingy fellow

248
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,720
wouldn't give it to me.

249
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,600
Why did you suddenly change your mind

250
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,840
and give it to me?

251
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,280
Actually, I wasn't planning
to hide it anyway.

252
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,560
This underground aqueduct blueprints
will benefit the people.

253
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,640
I just don't want the people of Ximi

254
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,120
to suffer from drought.

255
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,720
On behalf of the people of Ximi,
thank you.

256
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,400
No need for formalities.

257
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,840
As long as you

258
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,640
don't come to Qi Kingdom ever again.

259
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,320
That's not possible.

260
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,960
During this stay to Qi Kingdom,

261
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,560
I really learned a lot.

262
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,840
Once the aqueduct is completed,

263
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,520
I'll be back.

264
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,080
Next time you come,

265
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,000
Mengmeng and I will be married.

266
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,280
Alright.

267
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,520
No matter how hard it is,
parting is inevitable.

268
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,480
Let's go.

269
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,320
Wan.

270
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,160
Do we really have to part?

271
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,480
I can't be without you.

272
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,080
Mengmeng.

273
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,880
We'll meet many people

274
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,440
in our life.

275
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
Most of them

276
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,520
will only be with us for a while.

277
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,560
So, we should cherish them even more,
shouldn't we?

278
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,600
But we only have two hands.

279
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,000
Just two hands.

280
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,320
How can we hold onto

281
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,880
everything we want?

282
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,000
Perhaps sometimes

283
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,400
being brave to face farewells

284
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,440
and saying goodbye gracefully

285
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,360
is also a good choice.

286
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,560

Take care.

291

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,880
If only...

310
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,119
I could stay by your side forever.

311
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,920
Your Majesty.

312
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,160
Cui Anshi, Cui Anzu, Cui Anyu,

313
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,960
have all confessed.

314
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,720
The officials involved in the rebellion

315
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,760
have been arrested.

316
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,000
Furthermore,

317
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
a large number of rare calligraphy,
paintings, and antiques

318
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
were found in the private treasury
of the Cui family.

319
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,400
After investigation,

320
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,360
many were gifts from court officials.

321
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
It implicates a wide range of people.

322
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,080
Cui Anshi has wielded
immense power for many years,

323
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,000
and his influence is deeply rooted.

324
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,360
There's no need to
delve further into this matter.

325
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,320
As for those involved in the rebellion,

326
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,480
they can be dealt with
according to the law.

327
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,040
Alright.

328
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,680
Has Mengmeng had her meal today?

329
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,840
Your Majesty,

330
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
the people from Lingtai Pavilion
came over today

331
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,320
and said she only ate a little.

332
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,760
Let's go and have a look.

333
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,560
Yes.

334
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,760
The Emissary has been like this

335
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,000
for half a month already.

336
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,560
She's all worn out.

337
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,720
She came to the Qi Kingdom alone,

338
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
and Zhou Quan was one
of her only friends.

339
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,560
She is gone now.

340
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
Wan is also not in the palace.

341
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,720
She must feel very lonely.

342
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,000
She mentioned before
that she missed home.

343
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,720
She must be longing
for her hometown right now.

344
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,160
You should think of a way soon

345
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
to cheer Mengmeng up.

346
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,560
Well...

347
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,240
Your Majesty.

348
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,280
As you know,

349
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,120
the Emissary's hometown
is so extraordinary.

350
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,040
What new things hasn't she seen before?

351
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,040
Over here...

352
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,560
Perhaps what she wants
isn't something new

353
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,400
but a familiar feeling.

354
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,200
If we could make this place

355
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
just like her hometown,

356
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,880
Mengmeng would surely be very happy.

357
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,200
Your Majesty.

358
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,840
Your Majesty.

359
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,400
Do we have the instant noodles
that you mentioned here?

360
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,880
This looks somewhat like it.

361
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,880
What about the soup?

362
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,080
The soup is already prepared.

363
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,320
Bring in the soup!

364
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,160
Your Majesty.

365
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,760
These are made
with the finest ingredients

366
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
by the imperial kitchen.

367
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,680
Add this and this to that.

368
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,800
Then it should be about right.

369
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,200
Yes.

370
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,840
Your Majesty.

371
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
What about the other soups?

372
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,080
Can you finish it?

373
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,760
Thank you. Your Majesty.

374
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,280
Come on.

375
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,680
Guess what I've prepared for you.

376
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,400
Sit.

377
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,800
What is this?

378
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,200
It's so mysterious.

379
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,080
Doesn't this look like

380
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,160
the instant noodles from your hometown?

381
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Well...

382
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
This is even better than
the "Buddha's Temptation" from my hometown

383
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,240
Buddha's Temptation?

384
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,200
How is it made?

385
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,080
Let me know.

386
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,840
I'll ask the imperial kitchen
to make it.

387
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,120
No. It's fine.

388
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,960
This is really good enough.

389
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,760
Come on.

390
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,720
Go ahead and taste it.

391
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,440
Come on, taste it.

392
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,720
Delicious.

393
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,440
I...

394
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
have some other surprises for you.

395
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,240
Come on.

396
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,800
They're about to start.

397
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,160
Look.

398
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,800
Isn't this the classic scene

399
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,680
I told them before?

400
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,720
They even made the pistol

401
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,280
that I drew last time.

402
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
You're pretty smooth.

403
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,160
I underwent professional training
before entering the palace.

404
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,160
You temple folks are so interesting,

405
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
always choose to meet on the rooftop.

406
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,240
Temple folks?

407
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,640
I'm not like you.

408
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,360
I used to be a temple folk too.

409
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,520
Did you bring what I asked for?

410
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,200
You might not have brought

411
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
what I asked for either.

412
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,320
What?

413
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,520
Coming up here for a sunbathe?

414
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,960
Give me a chance.

415
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,200
How so?

416
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,800
They're acting so seriously.

417
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
Look at Steward Lu's beard.

418
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,160
I had no choice before,

419
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,080
but now I want to be a good person.

420
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,360
Alright.

421
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,920
Go ask His Majesty.

422
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,920
See if he allows you
to be a good person.

423
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,760
Are you asking me to risk my life?

424
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,920
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,440
Because I am...

426
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,720
the palace steward.

427
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Steward Lu, I really couldn't resist.

428
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,480
You know what?

429
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Based on Steward Lu's acting skills,

430
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,120
if he was in my hometown,

431
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,040
he'd definitely
be an award-winning actor.

432
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,280
Faster.

433
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,680
Change the scene.

434
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,520
Yes.

435
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,920
There's more?

436
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,000
Mengmeng.

437
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
Let me tell you some good news.

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,640
Minister Li's watercourse plan

439
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,280
has been completed
in the Suzhou section.

440
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,160
Really?

441
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,120
He'd definitely be very happy

442
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,400
if he knew it.

443
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,000
Thank you for today.

444
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,600
I'm very happy today.

445
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,800
I watched TV,

446
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,880
ate instant noodles,

447
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
and had popcorn.

448
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
It feels like

449
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,200
being at home.

450
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,280
Mengmeng.

451
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,240
Do you still remember this?

452
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,840
In the past,

453
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,480
I never thought about
what my future empress

454
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,400
would be like.

455
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,880
But now I know.

456
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,320
My future wife

457
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,760
has a round face,

458
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
a round nose,

459
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,200
and eyes like crescent moons.

460
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,640
When she smiles,

461
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,600
her eyes turn into slits.

462
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,520
She's petite,

463
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
but quite strong.

464
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,280
She's always full of ideas

465
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,960
and always has surprises for me.

466
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,720
Mengmeng.

467
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,320
Marry me.

468
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,800
Mother has already
arranged our marriage.

469
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,760
This is my request

470
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,520
and also a royal decree.

471
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
But...

472
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,640
What if one day I have to leave?

473
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,160
What if something unexpected
happens to me

474
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,960
or I fall ill?

475
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,000
Stop talking nonsense!

476
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,720
I don't care what the future holds.

477
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,000
If there's only one day,

478
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,120
you'll be my wife for one day.

479
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,640
If there are two days,

480
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,640
you'll be my wife for two days.

481
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,360
As long as I'm here,

482
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,720
as long as you're still here,

483
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,840
we'll be together every day.

484
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,920
[Wanshou Hall]

485
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,960
By the grace of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees:

486
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,040
[Imperial Decree]
Chancellor Cui Anshi neglected his duties,

487
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,440
abused his power for personal gain,

488
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,000
embezzled disaster relief supplies,

489
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
raised private armies,

490
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,560
and plotted rebellion,

491
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,600
showing great disrespect
to the ancestral temples and altars.

492
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,800
The mastermind, Chancellor Cui Anshi,

493
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
the leader of the Imperial Guards,
Cui Anyu,

494
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,880
along with thirteen others,
are sentenced to death.

495
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,800
All assets within their households will
be confiscated for the national treasury.

496
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,240
Their families will be demoted
to commoners

497
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,560
and prohibited from serving as officials
in the palace for three generations.

498
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,080
Thirty-seven others involved
in the rebellion

499
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,360
will have their official status stripped

500
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,720
and be exiled to Lingnan.

501
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,200
End of reading.

502
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,440
Your Majesty's wisdom shines brightly.

503
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
There is another matter
to announce today.

504
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,920
Lu Huan.

505
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,960
Yes.

506
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,360
By the grace of the heavens,
the Emperor decrees:

507
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,960
The Emissary, Li Mengmeng,

508
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,200
who is intelligent and astute,

509
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
speaks and acts
with propriety and moderation,

510
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,920
and possesses a great character,

511
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,480
She shall be conferred the title
of the Empress Consort.

512
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,040
End of reading.

513
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,400
But...

514
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,280
This might not be appropriate.

515
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,160
Your Majesty.

516
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,480
Since the founding of Qi Kingdom,

517
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,840
the Empress Consorts have always come
from noble families,

518
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,080
exemplifying dignity and humility,

519
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,520
upholding ceremonial propriety.

520
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,560
This Emissary, she disguised as a man,

521
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,080
first as an eunuch,

522
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,160
then as a man,
entering the Lingtai Pavilion.

523
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,440
She has reckless demeanor.

524
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,080
If she becomes
the Empress of the kingdom,

525
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,000
it would be a disgrace
to our traditions.

526
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,400
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

527
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

528
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,440
Traditions?

529
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,160
If it weren't for her,

530
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,480
the aqueduct would not have been built,

531
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,040
and countless people
would have suffered from drought.

532
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
If it weren't for her,

533
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,000
on the day of the sacrifice,

534
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,400
I would have perished in the fire.

535
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,440
Besides, this is the dowry from mother.

536
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,040
I have already recognized her as...

537
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,240
my only wife in this life.

538
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,880
Lu Huan.

539
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,600
Yes.

540
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,320
Convey the decree.

541
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,840
Complete the enthronement ceremony
within three days.

542
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,520
Yes.

543
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,240
Well...

544
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Your Majesty...

545
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,400
As the noble ruler of our kingdom,

546
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,520
marriage is not just a personal matter,

547
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,720
but also a national affair.

548
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
How can we act recklessly?

549
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,240
In all my years,

550
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,640
everything I've done

551
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,920
has been bound
by the nation's laws and rules.

552
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Except for this time,

553
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,480
I want to be stubborn for once.

554
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,240
Your Majesty...

555
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,360
If you truly like the Emissary,

556
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,480
you can take her into the harem,

557
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,600
but her status must not be elevated.

558
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,800
It must not, Your Majesty.

559
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,360
If you insist on this,

560
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,520
I would feel ashamed
before our ancestors.

561
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,160
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

562
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,080
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

563
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,600
My mind is made up.

564
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,080
Your Majesty!

565
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,320
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

566
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,560
Your Majesty...

567
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,000
The morning audience is dismissed.

568
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,360
Your Majesty!

569
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,980
[Qingyan Palace]

570
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,140
[Qingyan Hall]

571
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,000
Minister Sun.

572
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,840
What's going on?

573
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,680
Summon the imperial physician, now!

574
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,920
Your Majesty.

575
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,160
Your Majesty.

576
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,600
Your Majesty.

577
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,040
What's happening outside?

578
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,080
Minister Sun fainted just now,

579
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,560
but the imperial physician
has treated him in time.

580
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
He's fine now.

581
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,840
Have the imperial physician center
send people to take turns watching him.

582
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,040
Also, prepare meals
from the Imperial Kitchen.

583
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,640
Yes.

584
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,560
Did you convey the orders
to the Lingtai Pavilion?

585
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,880
I don't want Mengmeng
to be bothered before the wedding.

586
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,920
I have already instructed them.

587
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,880
Don't let Miss Mengmeng know about this.

588
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,840
But if she insists on seeing you,

589
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,720
we'll tell her that

590
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,760
Husband and wife are not allowed
to meet three days before the wedding.

591
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,800
