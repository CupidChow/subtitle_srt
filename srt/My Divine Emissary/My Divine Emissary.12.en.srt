16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,860
[Episode 12]

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,140
Your Majesty,

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,420
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,780
Empress Dowager.

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,580
How is His Majesty?

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,580
Reporting to the Empress Dowager,

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,540
the divine emissary instructed

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,340
that this is the final moment

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,700
to ward off evil spirits
using scriptures for His Majesty

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,780
thus, they cannot be interrupted.

27
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,980
Empress Dowager.

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,860
Empress Dowager.

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,820
How dare you!

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,100
This concerns His Majesty's health,

31
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,420
please think twice, Empress Dowager.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,540
You've repeatedly
stopped me from entering.

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,500
Are you hiding something from me?

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,740
Empress Dowager.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,460
Empress Dowager.

36
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,500
Where is His Majesty?

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,740
Reporting to the Empress Dowager,

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,620
His Majesty is reciting sutras.

39
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,900
He is fine.

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,820
Your head keep wobbling before me,

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
it's blocking my sight

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,820
and it's giving me a headache.

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,340
Lu Huan,

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,500
move aside.

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,820
Yes.

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,260
Yan,

47
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,060
how are you feeling?

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,980
Mother,

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,340
I'm fine.

50
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,220
But why are you so anxious?

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,700
There was a fire outside just now.

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,620
How can I be at ease?

53
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,540
But knowing that you're fine,

54
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,140
I'm relieved now.

55
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,980
Continue reciting your sutras.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,780
I'll take my leave now.

57
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,460
What a close call today.

58
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,020
It's all thanks
to Steward Lu's cleverness today.

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,100
It's because Your Majesty is blessed
by the heavens.

60
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,940
Bootlicker.

61
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,460
You too!

62
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,820
Everyone has worked hard.

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,860
Now that the Lu County's aqueduct work
is completed.

64
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,700
I would like to thank you all properly.

65
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,740
Come,

66
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,620
have a seat!

67
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,260
I'll have a drink with all of you.

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,100
- This...
- Come and sit.

69
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,300
- Sit, sit.
- This doesn't seem appropriate.

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,060
Your Majesty,

72
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,660
you're suddenly so gentle.

73
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,780
We're not used to it.

74
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,020
Am I usually not gentle?

75
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,340
What nonsense!

76
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,980
As long as

77
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
Your Majesty thinks that we are useful,

78
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,500
that's all that matters.

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,940
Let's skip all the pleasantries.

80
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,260
Come, cheers.

81
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,060
Cheers.

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,700
Let's eat.

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,540
Err...

84
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,900
Emissary Xiao,

85
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,420
your 'chicken'

86
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,820
seems to have died all of a sudden.

87
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,940
Let me have a look.

88
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,300
It's nothing.

89
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,980
You may have accidentally
pressed the lock button.

90
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Thank heaven it's nothing.

91
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,500
Emissary Xiao.

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,220
What other tricks
do you have on your sleeve

93
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,420
that I don't know?

94
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,860
I can also recite poetry.

95
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,220
The moon is up tonight and we have wine.

96
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,820
How about

97
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,660
you recite an impromptu poem for us

98
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,180
to cheer us up?

99
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,980
Among the flowers, from a pot of wine;

100
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,100
I drink without a companion of mine.

101
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,220
I raise my cup to invite the moon;

102
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,900
the moon...

103
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,820
I should have studied harder.

104
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,900
With a cup in hand,
I ask of the blue sky.

105
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,340
Hang on!

106
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,060
You raise a cup to invite the moon.

107
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,820
Why did it become asking about the sky?

108
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,020
Err...

109
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,900
Whether the moon
will accept my invitation or not,

110
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,220
it still has to ask the sky.

111
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,620
This doesn't count.

112
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,140
- Doesn't count.
- Recite another one.

113
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,420
A light rain fell
with the strong wind blowing last night,

114
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,700
a good night's sleep failed
to rid me of my drunkenness.

115
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,940
Our country was hit
by drought for several months.

116
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,100
There was no rain.

117
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:58,980
So, this doesn't count either.

118
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,900
One more.

119
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,380
In the corner of a wall,
some plum branches grow,

120
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,780
that bloom alone in the cold winter.

121
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,860
It's the wrong season.

122
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,020
Another one!

123
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,620
I can't do it anymore.

124
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,340
Another one.

125
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,620
No, no.

126
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,540
[Ruining Palace]
Today, in addition to celebrate

127
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,700
me being cured by Emissary Xiao,

128
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,300
I have one more thing to announce.

129
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,380
Your Majesty,

130
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,740
these are the green seedlings
that were just sent from Lu County.

131
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,860
Are seedlings growing in dry land?

132
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,340
Does the aqueduct really bring water?

133
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,220
Seems like the drought issue
can be solved.

134
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,660
It has not been raining
in the Lu County for months.

135
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,820
Thus, no grass was growing.

136
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,700
But the aqueduct has managed to divert
the mountain spring into a river,

137
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,540
and now even the crops are growing.

138
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
The people will never
need to worry about water shortage.

139
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,020
I hereby congratulate Your Majesty.

140
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,860
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

141
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,460
Praise to Your Majesty.

142
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,780
The aqueduct is truly a masterpiece.

143
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,140
My beloved ministers, please sit.

144
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

145
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,060
The aqueduct built in Lu County

146
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,300
has exceptional irrigation effects.

147
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,820
I plan to execute this nationwide.

148
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,020
The role of Vice Minister of Public Work
has been left vacant for a while.

149
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,940
Zhen Xu,

150
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,060
you know a lot about the aqueducts,

151
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,460
you shall report
to the Ministry of Public Work tomorrow

152
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,140
and you'll be in charge of executing

153

the aqueduct project nationwide.

154
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,100

Come,

after you count to one?

187
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,820

00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,300
and need our help?

378
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,340
Steward Lu,

379
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,460
what an outrageous statement!

380
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,300
I don't have any request.

381
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,020
Really?

382
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,180
But I hope that

383
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,940
you'll think of me

384
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,660
whenever you use the stuff
that I gave you all.

385
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,140
We meet every day.

386
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,980
What is there to forget?

387
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,100
It's too heavy.

388
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,060
So heavy.

389
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,140
Rest assured,

390
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,380
even without these gifts,

391
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,420
we're sure to remember you.

392
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,060
What's the commotion about?

393
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,340

394
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,020
Report to Your Majesty,

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,540
Emissary Xiao is giving us all gifts.

396
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,980
Where's mine?

397
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,420
Your Majesty don't lack anything.

398
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,060
I haven't thought of what to give yet.

399
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,060
Your Majesty,

400
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,700
I wish to take a photo with all of you.

401
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,700
Let's take it together.

402
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,300
Come, come.

403
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,140
Stand still, everyone.

Emissary Xiao

412
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,340
must be preparing

413
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,060
a mysterious gift only for you.

414
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,740
Do you think so?

415
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,140
I'm sure of it.

416
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,140
Tell me,

417
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,060
what kind of gift do you think

418
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,340
she'll prepare for me?

419
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,780
Emissary Xiao always
has such whimsical ideas.

420
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,900
I really can't figure it out.

421
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,460
Go and see what Emissary Xiao is doing.

422
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,620
If you have any news,
tell me immediately.

423
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,620
Yes.

Emissary Xiao

428
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,100
is coming this way!

429
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,940
Alright.

430
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,540
Your Majesty,

431
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,460
do you want me to go check again?

432
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,260
Yes.

Your...Your Majesty.

438

Emissary Xiao went
and looked for the Noble Consort.

439
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,260
Try the taro bubble tea I made.

440
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,820
Taro bubble tea?

441
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,020
Give it a try.

442
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,140
How is it?

443
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,820
It's delicious.

444
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,900
Why do I suddenly feel

445
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,940
so full of strength?

446
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,860
This drink

447
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,780
is known as a lifesaver in my hometown.

448
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,420
Mengmeng,

449
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,740
where exactly is your home?

450
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,260
My home...

451
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,180
Come with me.

[Lihua Hall]

453
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,340
My home

454
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,140
is at a far, far away place.

455
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,820
You see,

456
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,220
the stars in the sky

457
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,900
are sparkling brightly.

458
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,300
But did you know that

459
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,220
these stars

460
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,660
may have been shining since

461
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,260
ten, hundred,
or even thousands of years ago.

462
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm

463
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,180
like someone who lived on the stars.

464
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,660
Although we're looking
at the same stars,

465
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,060
but
there are many, many years between us.

466
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,580
What does that mean?

467
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,220
Is your home in the sky?

468
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,700
No.

469
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
It's only a metaphor.

470
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,860
Mengmeng,

471
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,980
I may not understand what you mean.

472
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,460
But I know,

473
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,380
you're leaving us,

474
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:17,980
aren't you?

475
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,500
Can you keep it a secret for me?

476
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,020
I can't bear for you to leave.

477
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,220
Neither can I.

478
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,380
I'll miss this place too.

479
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,900
At least here,

480
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,060
I feel like I'm useful.

481
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,900
But when I return home,

482
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,620
I'm nothing

483
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,740
compared to those people.

484
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,420
How could that be?

485
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,140
You're so smart.

486
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,340
You know about medicinal skills,

487
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,540
you can dance,

488
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,220
and you could make so many delicacies.

489
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Such as

490
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,620
the tea...

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,300
Bubble tea.

492
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,820
Yes, bubble tea.

493
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,980
How is it that you're useless?

494
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,460
You treat me the best.

495
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,700
Come!

496
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,820
Let's have another drink.

497
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,340

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,580
said she's going back to the stars.

501
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,260
No wonder

502
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
she gave us a bunch of weird stuff.

503
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,340
It turns out she's saying her goodbyes.

504
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,980
I hope that

505
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,580
you'll think of me

506

whenever you use the stuff
that I gave you all.

to leave secretly without telling me?

Your Majesty kept me by your side
