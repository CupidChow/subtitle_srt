00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,760

But I was too afraid of failing,

170
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,360
thus I became more
and more resistant to it.

171
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,680
I thought that

172
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,080
if I avoided these matters,

173
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,720
they would not exist.

174
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,320
But later on, I found out

175
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,920
that it only made the matter worse.

176
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,320

[One Year Ago]

393
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,360
All these years,

394
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,840
I kept having the same dream.

395
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,080
Everything that happened in the dream
seems so realistic.

396
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,800
I've repeatedly looked for

397
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,640
traces of her existence in reality.

398
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,800
Now that I have written
it all in a novel.

399
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,320
I believe she'll see it.

400
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,160
Because to us,

401
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,000
it's not just a good dream.

402
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,280
I've ordered for you.

403
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,320
Thank you.

404
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm so hungry.

405
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,080
Let's take a look
at their signature dish.

406
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,240
Grilled peanut butter toast.

407

Black pepper pasta.

408

What do you want to have?

409
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,640
I'm not hungry.

410
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,920
If that's the case,

411
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,520
I'll order
a grilled peanut butter toast.

412
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,800
It's you who said you're not gonna eat.

413
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,200
Don't blame me, your uncle,

414
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,080
for not being considerate
of your peanut allergy.

415
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,120
You're only older than me by 2 months.

416
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,840
It's all about seniority.

417
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm still your uncle
even though it's a 2-month gap.

418
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,640
Are you still writing about that dream?

419
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,360
Do you think all novel writers

420
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,640
like to dream?

421
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,040
Just like you.

422
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,480
After a night's sleep,

of suppressing memory formation

is only active

427
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
when you're dreaming in your sleep.

428
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,200
In other words,

429
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,160
when a person is dreaming,

430
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,880
the brain
will suppress memory from forming.

431
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,760
Thus, most of the dreams
will be forgotten.

432
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,120
Then why do you always remember this?

433
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,680
This dream

434
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,480
is different.

435
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,960

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,080

I've never seen you before.

Yet, you look the same in my dream.

450
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,920
Is this a coincidence?

451
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,440
Welcome.

To get to know you again in this world.

455
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,080
But I don't think you'd recognize me.

456
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
Maybe it's because of the date,

457
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,960
that kept repeating in the dream,

458
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,840
it's not arriving yet.

Has the girl of your dreams

It's time you let it go.

468
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,800
Maybe it was just a dream.

469
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,680
At least it was a sweet dream.

Besides, your novels are published.

471

It's time for you to give up.

that Spring Garden
actually exists at Wutong West Road?

474
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,480
And she really did appear
at the Four Virtues Academy?

475
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
Maybe you saw

476
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,280
the Spring Garden ads somewhere?

477
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
And she happened to look familiar.

478
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,480
I've experienced this before.

479
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
Some people may look familiar,

Her every move, every frown,
and every smile,

483
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,800
is the same in my dream.

Even if she doesn't recognize me now,

I'll find a way to get to know her.

486
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,680
Even so,

487
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,400
you shouldn't

488
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,480
follow her around every day

489
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,880

Moreover,

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,960
you've published your novel.

494
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,440

she will come to you.

But since she didn't show up,

500
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,040
