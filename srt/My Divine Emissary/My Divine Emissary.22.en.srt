Tomorrow is His Majesty

For sure, tomorrow will be like today.

As your wedding day is tomorrow,

it is best to refrain from going out.

25

As far as I know, Qi Kingdom tradition

Emissary Xiao asked to rest for a while.

179

So, we had the maids withdraw.

180

We saw the auspicious time
was approaching.

181
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,760
So, we came to knock on the door.

I have no idea how to find you.

385
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,960
I understand.

You worry about rain getting me wet.

I can't stay inside all the time.

I also do not want to be

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,200
so cautious every time it rains.

391
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,960
We should enjoy every moment, right?

392

Don't you think so?

I'll play whatever you want.

After much effort,
I finally taught you how to play cards.

has to run outside

"I am a fool" three times.

No.

That's strange.

Why aren't you playing any cards?

417

Are you letting me win on purpose?

How could we?

419
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,400
Of course not.
