The event ran late yesterday.

190
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

191
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,920
I'll bring it to you right away.

192
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,760

What's up?

199
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,360

I just

203
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,800
simply like this character. That's all.

204
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,440

Hey, Mom.

212
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,720
Do you have a package to pick up?

213
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,120
A package?

214
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
No, I don't.

215
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
Weren't you on a business trip?

216
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,000
A critical patient
came in last night at the hospital.

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
I got so busy I forgot to tell you.

218
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
The meeting switched to online.

219
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,440
Mom! Mom!

220
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,120
I'm coming down now.

221
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,240
Let's pick up the package together.

222
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,560
It's okay, no need.

223
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,280
It's not heavy.

224
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,320
It's fine.

225
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm hanging up now.

226
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,840
Quick, quick!

227
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,560
My mom's back.

228
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,520
She is downstairs.

229
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,880
Madam, let me help you.

230
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,640
Thank you.

231
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,840
- Thank you.
- Here.

232
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Madam, which floor are you on?

233
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm on the seventh floor too.

234
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,120
Alright.

235
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Stop being mad.

236
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,520
I'm already in the elevator.

237
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,600
Hurry up and open the door for me.

238
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
Is your girlfriend mad?

239
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,240
Girls all have their moods.

240
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,120
Just cheer her up.

241
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,680
Don't forget
to schedule some time with your mom.

242
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,720
Got it. Let's go.

243
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,000
You're such a handsome young man

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
and so polite too.

245
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,560
I wonder which girl

246
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,080
is lucky enough to have you.

247
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,640
- Mengmeng.
- Mom.

248
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,200
Bai Lian.

249
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,800
Boyfriend?

250
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,000
He...

251
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,120
He came to deliver something for me.

252
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,760
Hand it over to me.

253
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Bye.

254
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,920
- Bye.
- What's with the goodbye?

255
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,840
We're at the doorstep.

256
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,800
Come on in.

257
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,280
Come on,
quickly entertain our guest, Mengmeng.

258
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Don't be silly.

259
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,560
Please, come inside and have a seat.

260
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,400
Madam,

261
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,640
- I am busy now.
- Hurry, hurry.

262
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:49,960
Hold this.

263
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,880
He seems busy.

264
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,640
Hold this.

265
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,440
Not busy at all.

266
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,000
You're in my home,
what's there to be busy about?

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,880
Come on, quick.

268
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,520
Come, have a seat.

269
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,600
What's going on?

270
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,240
I don't know.

271
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,560
My mom just suddenly came back.

272
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,720
So,

273
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,440
where's Qi Yan?

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
I didn't know you were coming,

275
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
so I didn't prepare anything.

276
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,880
It's a bit sudden.

277
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,360
Here.

278
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,200
Have a peach.

279
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,480
Thank you, Madam.

280
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,000
You're called Bai Lian, right?

281
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,880
Yes.

282
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,560
Actually, you don't need
to go through all this trouble.

283
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
I just came to drop something off.

284
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,600
Yeah, Mom.

285
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
You don't need to keep him.

286
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,800
He has a lot of jobs to do.

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,360
He's busy.

288
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
- Don't bother me.
- Right.

289
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,240
Your name sounds familiar.

290
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,800
You look familiar too.

291
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,600
I remember now.

292
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,440
I remember now.

293
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,080
You wait.

294
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,280
- What...
- Mom.

295
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,200
Mom, where are you going?

296
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,760
Mom, stop.

297
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,440
No need.

298
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,320
No need, no need.

299
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,960
No need.

300
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,680
Let me tell you.

301
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,720
He looks exactly like that male star

302
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,280
you liked in high school.

303
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,640
Exactly.

304
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,680
There are pictures in your room.

305
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,320
I'll go look for them.

306
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
What are you doing?

307
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
I remember
you were obsessed with idols back then.

308
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,880
Now you're shy?

309
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,880
Now you're shy.

310
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,000
- Now you're shy.
- Madam.

311
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,040
No need, really.

312
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,760
Not a big deal.

313
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,400
I must find it for you.

314
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
Too alike.

315
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
Step aside.

316
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,280
Where was it?

317
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,560
Where was it?

318
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,120
I remember it was here.

319
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,440
Found it.

320
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,359
Found it, found it.

321
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,359
Mom, Mom.

322
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,440
- Let me take a good look at you.
- What's up?

323
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,040
Mom.

324
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,200
What are you looking at?

325
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,640
Mom.

326
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
You're so beautiful today.

327
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,040
Oh my goodness.

328
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
No fever, right? Everything is okay.

329
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,240
Mom, let me tell you.

330
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,079
The phone...

331
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,200
This picture's unclear.

332
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,839
Let's look at another one.

333
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,960
Clear, clear. It's this one.

334
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,880
You're here.

335
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,000
You are...

336
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,920
Madam. This is my nephew.

337
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,440
Nephew?

338
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,480
So, you're here
to see Mengmeng and Bai Lian, right?

339
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
Right.

340
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,200
I still need to drop him off at school.

341
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,079
I'm leaving first.

342
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:42,560
Mom.

343
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,720
Working.

344
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,880
Why are you working on the weekend?

345
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Besides, you're all grown up now.

346
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,560
You can take a cab to school.

347
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,600
Come, come.

348
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,640
Look at the pictures.

349
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,880
Come. Look.

350
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,720
Doesn't he look like you?

351
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,240
Come on.

352
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,280
Here you go.

353
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,440
Have a peach.

354
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,640
- Thanks, thanks.
- Madam.

355
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
Actually, it's not that urgent.

356
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,520
Not urgent?

357
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,040
Fine. Sit down please.

358
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,000
Your nephew's all grown up now.

359
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,360
Actually,

360
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,160
he's two months younger than me.

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,760
I'm the elder one.

362
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,800
Two months?

363
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,120
Right.

364
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,120
Madam.

365
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
So, doesn't that mean
he should call Mengmeng Aunt?

366
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,040
Come on, come on.

367
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Let's not talk about that.

368
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,680
Come on.

369
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,320
Take a look.

370
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,680
Doesn't he look like you?

371
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,480
Handsome.

372
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,780
-Doesn't he really look like you?
- So handsome.

373
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,640
Really looks like you.

374
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,400
I'm telling you.

375
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,080
Isn't it?

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Madam.

377
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,680
Actually, this is me.

378
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,800
What? Are you a big star?

379
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,200
What big star?

380
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm just acting

381
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,880
and singing.

382
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh my goodness.

383
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,400
So amazing.

384
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,320
Amazing.

385
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,080
So amazing.

386
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,600
I said you're so handsome.

387
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
Turns out you're a big star!

388
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,120
Bai Lian.

389
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,480
Where are you from?

390
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
Who else is there in your family?

391
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
My family consists of my parents and me.

392
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,920
We're a family of three.

393
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
I am from Lingbei.

394
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,320
Being an only child is so great!

395
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
-Madam, I...
-We only have Mengmeng at home too.

396
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,640
Is it tough being a celebrity?

397
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,360
It's alright,

398
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,160
not too tough.

399
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,520
I don't believe it.

400
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,600
Look at how slim you are.

401
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,200
Have dinner here.

402
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,440
I will make some soup for you.

403
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,120
Madam.

404
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,560
You don't have to bother.

405
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,080
I have to head back to the office later.

406
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,960
Madam, I love drinking soup.

407
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,120
Do you really have to go?

408
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,200
You know what?

409
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,240
This soup tastes amazing.

410
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,040
You'll regret it if you don't try it.

411
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,120
Madam.

412
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,520
I do love soup.

413
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,080
Mom.

414
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
Actually,

415
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,880
Qi Yan is my boyfriend.

416
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,720
It must be my manager

417
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,840
urging me to return to the company.

418
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
I have to leave now.

419
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
Qi Yan, right?

420
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,680
Where are you from?

421
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,040
Who else is there in your family?

422
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,160
I...

423
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,880
Mom.

424
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
If you keep asking like this,

425
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
you might as well ask them

426
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,560
to show you
their household registration.

427
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,440
Did you bring your
household registration with you?

428
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,120
I know you are just joking.

429
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,040
You're really funny.

430
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,200
You know what?

431
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,440
Maybe from now on,

432
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,600
I don't have to just drop you off
at the building entrance every time.

433
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,680
I can walk you right to your front door.

434
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,080
After all,

435
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
I'm now officially your boyfriend.

436
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,320
I have to remind you.

437
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,720
Don't think
just because my mom likes you,

438
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,920
you can do as you please.

439
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
If not, then what else?

440
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Mom.

441
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,160
It's okay.

442
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,000
You two carry on.

443
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,920
How about we pause for a bit

444
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,280
and grab dinner?

445
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,440
Mom, you didn't even knock.

446
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,280
And you didn't close the door.

447
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,040
My mom had asked us to have dinner.

448
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,200
It's fine.

449
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,440
That's so nice.

450
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,160
I'd love to stay here forever.

451
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,040
That won't do.

452
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,320
I want to

453
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,560
grow old together with you.

454
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,000
Be careful not to step on the crab.

455
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,600
That's not it.

456
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,840
Fairies don't grow old.

457
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,960
Fairies?

458
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,880
It's group activity.

459
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
What's going on with you two?

460
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
Exactly.

461
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
You two, stop being so clingy.

462
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,040
Everything's prepared. Let's go.

463
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,880
What do we have?

464
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,280
You'll find out in a moment.

465
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,840
You see,

466
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,600
every time there's food,
she is off like a shot!

467
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,920
This.

468
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,240
Food.

469
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,320
Is this ready to eat?

470
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,280
Yeah, it's cooked.

471
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
What are you grilling?

472
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,920
Beef skewers.

473
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,200
No oil was added.

474
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,480
They're almost done.

475
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
About to be cooked.

476
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,080
Turn them over. Turn them over.

477
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,520
That one.

478
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,440
Here you go.

479
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,480
Tastes good.

480
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,480
Try it.

481
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,440
Is it good?

482
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
- Especially fragrant.
- All these familiar faces

483
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,560
and everything that seems like
it truly happened...

484
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,840
- Here you go.
- It often makes me wonder

485
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,200
if everything in Qi Kingdom

486
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,720
is real.

487
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,480
Try this one.

488
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,840
The Internal Research Pavilion
in my dream.

489
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
- Have some.
- Yang City,

490
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,040
Lu County,

491
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,960
and...

492
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,360
Dad.

493
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,240
Smells so good.

494
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
It's like everything happened yesterday.

495
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,680
Which world

496
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,800
is truly real?

497
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,400
I want a cola.

498
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,000
I want cumin.

499
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,640
If you ask me to choose...

500
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,160
Try it.

501
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,160
Hey. What's up?

502
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,800
Why are you zoning out here alone?

503
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,860
Here, Cola.

504
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,240
Let's go, have some meat.

505
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,960
Hey, it's Cola!

506
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,080
So obedient.

507
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,160
Indeed, very obedient.

508
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,840
Too cute, isn't it?

509
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,760
Just as cute as you.

510
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
I want to pat the dog's fur.

511
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
What are you doing?

512
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,840
I think I would choose now.

513
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,160
Because,

514
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,840
- at least at this moment,
- Come one.

515
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,680
- everyone is by my side.
- Cola.

516
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,640
Food's ready.

517
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,760
Here you go.

518
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
- Have more.
- Thank you.

519
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,320
Thanks.

520
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,040
- Have a sip.
- Try this.

521
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,560
Okay.

522
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,800
It's Li Tao.

523
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,080
Hi, Li Tao!

524
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,760
Hi!

525
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,480
Hi, Li Tao!

526
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,760
Hello!

527
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,760
Hi, Li Tao!

528
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,560
Hello!

529
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,200
Where's Lu Huan?

530
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,440
You know,

531
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,320
if you get too caught up in filming
and can't make it back, that's alright.

532
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,280
But hey, it's my birthday.

533
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,200
Why are you calling Sai Xue?

534
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,200
Got a special trick up your sleeve.

535
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Come on, come on!

536
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,320
I have to go film now.

537
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,280
I'll change first

538
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,360
and we'll make plans later.

539
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,480
- Alright.
- Bye.

540
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,440
Bye, Li Tao.

541
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,120
What's going on with those two?

542
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,360
Don't look at me. I know nothing.

543
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,160
What about the birthday cake?

544
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,720
Don't you need a cake for your birthday?

545
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,280
Right.

546
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,320
Where's the cake?
