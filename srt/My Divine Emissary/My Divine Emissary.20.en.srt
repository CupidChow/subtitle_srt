Chancellor Cui,

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,680
has His Majesty awakened?

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,000
Imperial physician Xu,
why are you sighing?

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,880
What is His Majesty's condition?

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,520
Say something.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,160
Exactly.

Say something.

please don't talk nonsense.

Nonsense!

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,640
His Majesty is blessed by the heaven,

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,440
he will recover.

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Yes.

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680

the capital borders are upfront.

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,400

had disrupted the water shipping.

from the disaster relief provisions.

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Yes.

It is I.

117
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,240
I've heard so much about
the famous Prince Heqin.

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,960

It's fine.

122

Just that in Ximi,

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,120
I heard that the Qi Kingdom
is a country of etiquette.

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,640
Hence, I've asked my father
to send me here,

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
so that I could catch a glimpse of

126
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
the customs in the Qi Kingdom.

127
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,800
But instead, I was treated like a thief.

128
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,680
I am quite disappointed.

129
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
What have you all done?

130
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,280

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
there are rebels
lurking around the capital today.

132

All that leaves and enters the capital

133
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,800
must be checked one by one.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Have you finished checking everything?

135
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,720
We're done.

136
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,960
This way, Your Highness.

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,600
Thankfully,
Prince Heqin arrived in time today.

138
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
I was in cold sweat.

139
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,000
It seems that the title
of the second prince of Ximi

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
means nothing.

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,120
It's your soldiers who lack manners.

142
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

143
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,920
It's indeed hard work.

144

both of them

146
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,640
would have been caught plenty of times.

Your Highness, it's about time
you return to the posthouse.

148
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,840
There was such a big commotion

at the city gate today,

150
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm sure someone
would be watching over the posthouse.

151
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,000
You're right.

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,200
I'll take my leave now.

153
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,640
Remember to thank me properly.

154
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,240
Yes, yes.

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,360
We'll not forget you.

156
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,200
I'll send him off.

157
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,760
You guys can have a chat.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,280
Let's go.

159
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
You are dismissed.

160
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Yes.

161
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,160
What's the situation in the capital now?

162
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,520
Tomorrow

163
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,480
Cui Anshi will announce
that the Emperor is dead

164
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,400
and shall govern the country
on behalf of the Empress Dowager.

165
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
The palace

166
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,840
is being controlled
by Cui Anshi's imperial guards.

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
Cui Anshi's 20,000 troops

168
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,360
have been stationed outside the capital.

169
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,200
20,000 troops?

170
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,720
Seems like Chancellor Cui

171
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
has been coveting the throne
for a long time.

172
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,840
Cui Anshi lied
that Your Majesty is seriously ill.

173
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,800
And the imperial guards
are kept in the dark.

174
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
If Your Majesty

175
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,840
were to appear in the palace now,

176
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
together with my men

177
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,560
the situation in the palace
can be reversed.

178
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
This is our only chance.

179
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,560
How about the Huwei Camp?

180
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,960
Cui Anshi holds the warrant
from the Empress Dowager,

181
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
and with the pretext
of suppressing the rebels

182
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,840
have moved the Huwei Camp out
of the capital.

183
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
How is the Empress Dowager?

184
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,000
The Empress Dowager was placed
under house arrest by Cui Anshi.

185
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,760
But don't worry,

186
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
the Empress Dowager is useful to him.

187

188
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,000
Your Majesty.

189
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,600
Your Majesty. What happened to you?

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,160
The drink is poisoned.

191
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you doing?

192
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm sorry.

193

Go, quickly!

Let me see.

202
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
Let me take a look.

203
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,080
- Let me take a look!
- Leave, quickly!

204
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
I can cure you no matter what!

205
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,040
You must stay alive.

206

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,880
Save him!

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,280
Someone, please save him!

214
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,280
Why!

215
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,800
Qi Yan!

216
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,720
Miss,

217
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
your dinner is here.

218
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,000

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,680
Miss.

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,560
Your Grace.

221
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,760
You are all dismissed.

222
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,640
Yes.

223
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,480
I'll send His Majesty's body

224
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
to the palace tomorrow.

225
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,200
Once the matter is settled tomorrow,

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll return to you your freedom.

227
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,520

I saw it with my own eyes.

280
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,520
His Majesty was pierced

00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,640
and he bled to death.

around His Majesty react?

283
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
A lady was crying very sadly.

I don't know where she is from,

285
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,680
but Prince Heqin
is very courteous to her.

286
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,080
It must be the Emissary.

287
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,000
In that case,

288
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,200
His Majesty is really dead.

289
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520

and report to Chancellor Cui.

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,360

294
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,120
the person has reported back
from Chancellor Cui's manor.

295
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
He said, Chancellor Cui

296
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,320
will personally bring His Majesty
back to the palace

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,480
and will announce to the public

298
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,560
that the Emperor is dead.

299
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,120
He still refused to let Wan go?

300
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
Chancellor Cui said that

301
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,360
once the matter is settled,

302
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,880
he'll send Miss Cui to the manor.

303
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,800
Stop there, Chancellor Cui.

304
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,840
- Don't be rash, Chancellor Cui.
- Chancellor.

305
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,300
- Stop there, Chancellor Cui.
- You can't do this, Chancellor.

306
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,320
How dare you.

307
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,520
- Don't make things difficult for us.
- Whoever gets in the Chancellor's way

308
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,680
- shall be prosecuted on the spot.
- Please stop.

310
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,880

Chancellor Cui?

311
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,360
Chancellor,

312
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,800
I saw His Majesty meet
with Prince Heqin yesterday.

313
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,520
Prince Heqin then drugged His Majesty

314
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,720
and killed him.

315
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,800
Chancellor Cui turn your back on me?

316
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,320
Prince Heqin.

317
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,480
I do not know
what are you talking about.

318
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,160
As for whether Prince Heqin
is plotting treason,

319
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,440
we'll know once we search his manor.

342
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,880

has assassinated the Emperor.

343

Everyone that is in Prince Heqin's manor

344

345
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,080

352
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,360

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,120

356
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,640

Why am I here?

372

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,800
He got me to lure you back
to the capital with a letter

377
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,920
and to kill you.

378
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,880
So you've plotted this entire scenario?

379
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,560
Could you not have told me beforehand?

380
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,680
This manor is swarmed with

381
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,760
Cui Anshi's spies.

382
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
To be sure,

383
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,320
I can only take the risk.

384
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,920
So what's your plan now?

386
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,480
The palace is now filled with
Cui Anshi's troops.

387
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,640
If we barge in,

388
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,320
we will not win,

389
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,520
by just depending on my current troops
in the capital.

390
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,000
The best way is

391
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,160
we follow on with the plan.

392
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,840
Your Majesty will fake death
and be sent into the palace by Cui Anshi.

393
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,640
Once Your Majesty is awake,

394
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,040
you can then command
the deceived imperial guards

395
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,120
to capture Cui Anshi.

396
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,320
Bringing order back from chaos.

397
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,280
Thus,

398
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,360
Cui Anshi's troops will have no leader

399
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,640
and we no longer need
to worry about them.

400
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,040
[Order]
Pass this token to Kong An

401
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
and get him to quickly mobilize troops
from the Huwei Camp.

402
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,000
The troops of the Huwei Camp
were moved out of the capital.

403
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
It is estimated that they
can only arrive at the palace gate

404
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,720
tomorrow morning.

405
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,240
With the help of the Huwei Camp,

406
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,160
we'll have a higher chance
of winning tomorrow.

407
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,440
But

408
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,320
to deceive Cui Anshi tomorrow,

409
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Your Majesty can only enter
the palace alone.

410
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,720
- I'm worried...
- I have no other choice.

411
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,200
Tomorrow, Cui Anshi

412
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,280
will bring his troops

413
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,320
into the palace.

414
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,520
I will first head to Cui Manor
to save Wan

415
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,720
then, I'll meet up with Kong An
at the palace gate.

416
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,440
Let's set it at tomorrow afternoon then.

417
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
You all shall lead your troops
into the palace

418
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
to meet with me

419
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
and together we shall
capture Cui Anshi, the traitor.

420
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
This is a breath-holding pill.

421
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,160
You'll fall into a coma

422
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
within 4 hours of consuming it.

423
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,840
You will have no pulse and no breathing.

424
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,840
Remember,

425
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,920
take the pill

426
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
only after Cui Anshi takes you away.

427
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,680
Plus your injuries,

428
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,640
we should be able to deceive Chui Anshi.

429
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,360
Follow the original plan.

430
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,960
Yes.

431
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,120
High priest.

432
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,560
High priest.

433
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,400
It's me.

434
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,080
Emissary Xiao.

435
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
Emissary Xiao?

436
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,760
High priest,

437
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,920
bring me along into the palace.

438
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,040
If I don't go,

439
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,120
His Majesty will be in danger.

440
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,720
Shut your mouth

441
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,040
and stop with the nonsense.

442
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,480
His Majesty's star shines brightly,

443
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,800
how can he be dead?

444
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
We're running out of time.

445
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Let's talk as we walk.

446
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's go.

447
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
You...

448
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,560
Qi Yan,

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,560
if you can hear me,

450
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,640
I want to tell you

451
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,920
I do.

452
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,640
I do too.

453
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,120
Foolish little girl,

454
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
I'm not dead.

455
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,840
My hands are still warm.

456
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,320
I...

457
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,880
Am I dreaming?

458
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,040
I'm not dreaming.

459
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,840
I'm just worried if anyone found out.

460
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,480
Then my plan with Prince Heqin

461
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
would be of waste.

462
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,920
But I saw that you're sad,

463
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
so how could I not tell you?

464
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,320
His Majesty suffered from lung disease
before he died.

465
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,680
We need to quickly

466
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,880
cremate His Majesty's
remains and coffin.

467
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,760
Call upon the High Priest

468
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,560
to hold the funeral ceremony
of His Majesty.

469
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
It's almost afternoon,

470
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,160
why is His Majesty not out yet?

471
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm not sure.

472
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,600
Both of you are finally here.

473
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,560
Stop.

474
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,160
What's the situation in the palace?

475
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,000
Cui Anshi that old fox

476
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
claimed that His Majesty
has contracted the epidemic

477
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,000
and his coffin will be cremated today.

478
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,640
Your Grace,

479
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,320
how is Wan?

480
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,560
Miss Cui has settled down.

481
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,160
That's good.

482
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,480
Then don't wait any longer

483
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
and go save His Majesty.

484
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,520
It's not time yet.

485
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,280
His Majesty's medicinal effect
has not worn off yet.

486
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,280
Wait a bit more.

487
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,560
High priest,

488
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
it's been 4 hours.

489
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,920
When exactly is the auspicious time?

490
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,240
The Emperor's funeral

491
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,640
is related to the Qi Kingdom's fortune.

492
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
It's not time yet.

493
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,240
Be patient, Chancellor Cui.

494
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,960
It seems to me that the High Priest

495
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
is confused as his age catches up.

496
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,880
No need to wait any longer.

497
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,200
Start the fire.

498
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,800
Yes.

499
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
No.

500
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,720
Emissary Xiao?

501
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
She's a girl?

502
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,280
The Emissary is a female?

503
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,440
I've been looking for you for days

504
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000
and here you are.

505
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,480
Everyone!

506
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
This witch hides behind His Majesty

507
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,120
and she must be up to no good.

508
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,560
Guards!

509
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,960
- She's a witch.
- Send her to the prison

510
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,760
to be interrogated in the future.

511
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,840
- Yes.
- No.

512
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,200
I can resurrect His Majesty.

513
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,000
I can resurrect His Majesty.

514
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,280
Do you all not wish for His Majesty

515
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,520
to be resurrected?

516
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,640
Everyone!

517
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,880
Don't listen to this witch
as she's trying to confuse you.

518
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,800
What are you waiting for?

519
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,720
Set it on fire!

520
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,560
No!

521
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,840
It's not time yet!

522
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
You cannot set it on fire!

523
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't believe it!

524
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,760
Chancellor Cui!

525
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,600
No!

526
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,440
- Let me go!
- Chancellor Cui!

527
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,520
You cannot do it!

528
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,320
Let me go!

529
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,880
Your Majesty.

530
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,840
No!

531
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,760
Chancellor Cui!

532
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Let me go!

533
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,160
Your Majesty!

534
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,680
Your Majesty!

535
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,960
Your Majesty!

536
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,400
- Let go of me!
- It is the auspicious time!

537
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
- Kneel!
- Let go!

538
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,080
Your Majesty!

539
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,240
Your Majesty!

540
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,840
- Mengmeng!
- Let go of me!

541
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,840
- Sending the late emperor!
- Your Majesty.

542
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,320
The first kowtow.

543
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,200
His Majesty is not dead.

544
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,200
- Rise up.
- You all colluded for treason

545
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
and anger the heaven.

546
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,000
The second kowtow.

547
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,800
You will all pay for it!

548
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,800
It's raining.

549
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,240
It really is raining.

550
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,680
Is what the Emissary said true?

551
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,080
It can't be. It's really raining.

552
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
It's time.

553
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,400
Charge!

554
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,840
Charge!

555
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,760
Kill!

556
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,440
Kill!

557
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,680
Charge!

558
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,480
The Emissary has appeared!

559
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,800
Quickly dismiss yourself.

560
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,200
Forgive us, Emissary.

561
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,000
Am I disappearing?

562
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,240
Quick!

563
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,640
Quickly open the coffin!

564
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,760
Hurry!

565
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,200
Your Majesty!

566
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,000
His Majesty is really alive!

567
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,680
His Majesty is alive!

568
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,540
Your Majesty!

569
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,360
Your Majesty!

570
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,680
Your Majesty!

571
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,760
Everyone!

572
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
This is the witch's magic!

573
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,080
She turned His Majesty into a monster.

574
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,320
He is not the Emperor!

575
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,280
Guards!

576
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,320
Capture them all!

577
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,440
Who dares to capture me?

578
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
I just took some medicine

579
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,920
and pretended to be dead lying
in the coffin.

580
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,840
It's not because of magic.

581
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,520
But you, Chancellor Cui.

582
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,560
You tried every possible means
to kill me.

583
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,600
Your intention for treason is clear.

584
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,000
Guards!

585
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,760
If any of you can take down this monster

586
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,480
and this witch,

587
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,960
wait till my work is done

588
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,560
you'll be given the title
of marquis and ministers.

589
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,640
Capture them.

590
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,280
Protect His Majesty.

591
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,520
Kill them!

592
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,320
What's happening?

593
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,240
Stop!

594
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
Cui Anshi's crime of treason

595
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,360
is punishable.

596
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
But I know,

597
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,680
you joined him in this uprising

598
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,200
because of the severe drought
and lack of provisions.

599
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,680
But do you know

600
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,600
where Cui Anshi's provision came from?

601
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,560
The imperial court will allocate
some disaster relief provisions

602
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,400
to affected areas monthly.

603
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,280
Cui Anshi embezzled
and profited from it.

604
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,120
These are disaster relief provisions!

605
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,440
Your Majesty,

606
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
don't forget.

607
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,720
Who was it that made you the Emperor?

608
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
Fine.

609
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,080
Since you are unkind to me today,

610
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,960
don't blame me for being not righteous.

611
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,940
Your Majesty.

612
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,480
What is he doing?

613
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,440
Your Majesty!

614
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,320
What a treasonous act!

615
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,120
He waved his sword at His Majesty.

616
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,280
Delusional regicide.

617
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,960
Take him away.

618
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,640
What happened today,

619
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,680
even though
Cui Anshi's crimes are heinous,

620
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,040
but I'm at fault too.

621
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,840
My mistake lies in employing people
without careful consideration,

622
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,320
without knowing the hardship
of the people.

623
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,280
Thus,

624
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm asking everyone to give me a chance.

625
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,560
I will make sure the people
of the Qi Kingdom

626
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,880
will have enough food

627
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,840
and a place to live.

628
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,200
Praise His Majesty,

629
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,120
may heaven protect the Qi Kingdom.

630
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,880
Praise His Majesty,

631
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,800
may heaven protect the Qi Kingdom.

632
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Praise His Majesty,

633
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,320
may heaven protect the Qi Kingdom.
