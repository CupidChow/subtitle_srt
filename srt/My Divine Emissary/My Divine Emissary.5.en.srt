about the aqueduct

and to avoid any complications,

193
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,750
we need to build it in half a month

194

and solve the drought in Lu County.

376
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,990
Naturally, I think
His Majesty will win.

377
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,710
Prince Heqin!

378
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,150
Prince Heqin is so handsome!

379
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,990
Prince Heqin!

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,230
Where's Eunuch Li?

381
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,750
I didn't see him in the morning.

382
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,870
I'm afraid he's been
slacking off again.

383
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,110
I'll go and find him.

384
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,590
Forget about it.

385
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,310
That won't be necessary.

386
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,320
Yes.

387
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,350
Then I'll wait for you to change.

388
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,030
Eunuch Li.

389
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,310
Who do you think will win?

390
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,910
Well, it's certainly...

391
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,990
I'll leave a little surprise.

392
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,550
Hold it for me.

393
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,310
Prince Heqin is very diligent.

394
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,030
Even got Eunuch Li to practice
with you here.

395
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,390
Your Majesty is overly thinking.

396
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,470
Eunuch Li and I just met here

397
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,030
and exchanged pleasantries.

398
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,510
Not leaving yet?

399
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,520
Your Majesty.

400
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,470
I can explain.

401
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,910
Didn't you say it was your life's honor

402
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,320
to serve me?

403
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,110
You've found a new honor so soon.

404
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,630
No.

405
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,510
Your Majesty.

406
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,350
You've really got it all wrong.

407
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,110
I believe His Majesty will win.

408
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,150
Naturally, I won't lose

409
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,310
His Majesty will prevail!

410
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,070
Prince Heqin will prevail!

411
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,430
I want to cheer for Prince Heqin too.

412
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,950
Prince Heqin will prevail!

413
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,710

Louder.

422
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,510
His Majesty will prevail!

423
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,870
White will go first.

424
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,350

There's no need to hurry,
Chancellor Cui.

430
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,910
It's only the first goal.

431
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,910
Well, we'll see what happens.

432
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,430

My eyes were blurred.

437
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,350
Make your position clear, Eunuch Li.

438
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,990
Clear.

458
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,790
I've lost all my money.

459
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,310
If I betted on His Majesty,
I'd have made a fortune.

460
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,190
I've lost my wage.

461
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,710
I should have bet on His Majesty.

462
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,990
Not on Prince Heqin.

463
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,710
I've lost my wage too.

464
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,350

465
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,630
How is His Majesty's injury?

466
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,190
Prime minister,

467
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,350
His Majesty is fine.

468
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,470
Just need to rest a little.

469
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,310
I told you it's fine

470
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,270
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

He...

473
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,390
Is your injury alright?

474
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,630
Thanks for your concern, Your Highness.

475
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,350
I'm recovering well.

476
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,710
Let me take a look.

477
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,790
If Your Highness
has nothing else to say,

478
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,390
I'll take my leave.

Let's see what's going on.

482
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:35,990
Wait a minute.

483
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,110
You're my lucky star.

484
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,950
That's right, Zhou Quan.

485
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,150
How did my money accidentally ended up

486
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,190
in a win for His Majesty?

487
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,710

Hands off after your bets!

490
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,590
Didn't you ask me
to place a gold ingot

491
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,550
for Prince Heqin?

492
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,550
It rolled over

493
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,750
to His Majesty's side.

494
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,790
You took advantage of it.

495
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,910
So that's how it is.

496
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,630

I'm in trouble now.

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,710
I placed a bet on Prince Heqin.

500
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,110
I've lost all my money.

501
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,510
It was a mistake for me too.

I was going to cheer

503
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,750
for Prince Heqin.

504
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,070
Then it seems your love for His Majesty

505
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,750
is less than your love for silver.
