as long as one person believes it,

193
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,520
did steal it.

194
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,960
As for the Sai family's dry well,

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,280
it was built as a shelter

196
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,600
to prevent disasters.

197
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,960
Where did the disaster relief supplies
come from?

198
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,640
If Your Majesty doubts,

199
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I will take you to see it.

200
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,760
Your Majesty,

201
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,640
as stated,
only the first floor has supplies.

202
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,360
The bottom is filled with
disaster relief supplies.

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
Your Majesty, please be wise.

204
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,040
Who are you?

205
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,360
Don't move!

206
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,080
What are you doing?

207
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,040
What are you doing?

208
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,080
Second Prince?

209
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,360
Second Prince, what does this mean?

210
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,600
Is Master Sai unaware?

211
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,520
Miss Sai invited me

212
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,000
to be your guest.

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,160
So, you are the infamous Mister Li?

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
Your aren't that foolish, Master Sai.

215
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,320
Second Prince, what do you want?

216
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,080
I'm here to discuss business, of course.

217
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Second Prince, you hesitate too much.

218
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,760
That deal...

219
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,240
I already have an agreement
with someone else.

220
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,120
Someone else?

221
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,800
The others you mentioned...

222
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,520
could that be Qi's Emperor?

223
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,240
No, no!

224
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,120
He's now called Mister Yan.

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

226
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,800
You can only sell me supplies

227
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,600
at a low price presently...

228
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,520
There is no other choice.

229
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,520
If you give him the grain,

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,680
guess what will happen
to the Sai family?

231
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,200
Either the family is executed

232
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,920
or their home is raided.

233
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
That supplies...

234
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm keeping it for someone.

235
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,200
Is that so?

236
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,880
Then let me guess.

237
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,720
Once this is exposed,

238
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,160
will your superior protect you

239
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,800
or make you as a scapegoat?

240
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,160
Oh, and one more thing.

241
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
A dry well
where you hide the supplies...

242
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
Mister Yan

243
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,520
already paid a visit.

244
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,600
Think about your precious daughter.

245
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
Right now, no one

246
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,960
but me can help you.

247
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
Nonsense!

248
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,360
We all saw it!

249
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,800
Down there were only supplies.

250
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,040
Master Sai is now

251
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,200
denying everything?

252
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,760
Someone must have revealed

253
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,280
my identity beforehand.

254
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,320
It appears the mastermind

255
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,000
is smarter than I anticipated.

256
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,760
If we had known earlier,

257
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Your Majesty should have sent Kong An
and myself monitor Sai Residence.

258
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,240
They probably took advantage

259
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,280
of our rural journey

260
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,000
to steal the supplies.

261
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
What are we going to do now?

262
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
Without the supplies,

263
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
even if you are the Emperor,

264
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,280
you have no proof.

265
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,200
Kong An!

266
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,880
Have you completed

267
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,640
the task I gave you?

268
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
Your Majesty,

269
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
as told, I did everything.

270
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,800
What did you do?

271
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,720
You will find out when it gets dark.

272
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,160
Second Prince.

273
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,040
This was a truly brilliant move.

274
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
With half the money

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
we had for food,

276
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,320
we were able to get all of it.

277
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,320
I planned to get something for free,

278
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
but I never expected

279
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,720
the Qi's Emperor to visit Yang City.

280
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,120
Fortunately, we still got the supplies.

281
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,400
Hope the drought ends soon,

282
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,320
so Second Prince

283
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,640
can stop suffering.

284
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,480
What's wrong?

285
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,320
Second Prince,

286
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,360
my stomach hurts.

287
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,880
I need to relieve myself.

288
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,960
Go ahead.

289
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
Everyone else, take a break here.

290
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,320
Oh, no!

291
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,720
It's bad news, Second Prince!

292
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,400
What's happened now?

293
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,480
Hurry!

294
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,760
Tell them to put out the fire!

295
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,200
Quick!

296
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,320
Tell them to put out the fire!

297
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,280
Hurry! Hurry up!

298
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Fluorescent powder!

299
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,840
We've been tricked!

300
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,920
Audacious thieves!

301
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,120
You stole disaster relief supplies!

302
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,240
Seize them!

303
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,440
Kill them!

304
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,920
Your Majesty.

305
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,760
They are moving this way.

306
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Qi Yan.

307
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,960
You're so smart!

308
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,560
However,

309
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,840
since they touched

310
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,000
this supplies shipment,

311
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,240
they won't hand it over quietly.

312
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,760
Let's keep going.

313
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
It's Li Tao!

314
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,480
Why are the soldiers here too?

315
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,520
[Qi]
His Majesty has arrived!

316
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,880
Your Majesty!

317
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,560
Why are you here?

318
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,680
Report to Your Majesty.

319
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,080
Minister Qian of Yang City

320
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,200
ordered us here.

321
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,800
Minister Qian heard

322
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,080
someone left the city with supplies.

323
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,440
He claims this shipment contains

324
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,840
stolen disaster relief supplies.

325
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,760
Arrest them all!

326
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,360
Run! Hurry!

327
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,280
Your Majesty.

328
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,920
They're indeed
the stolen disaster relief supplies

329
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,160
and the fluorescent powder

330
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
have been traced
to the Sai family's residence.

331
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,160
Undoubtedly, the Sai family can deny it.

332
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,600
Since Minister Qian has already followed

333
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,840
the trail this far,

334
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,120
we should join him
and find out what is going on.

335
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,660
[Yang City Goverment]

336
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,880
I didn't know Your Majesty
was in Yang City.

337
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Apologies for the poor welcome.

338
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,920
[Qi Min Hall]
Your Majesty, pardon my negligence.

339
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,920
Rise.

340
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

341
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,560
Speak.

342
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,240
What is going on here?

343
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,640
Report to Your Majesty.

344
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,880
I heard that many supplies

345
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,680
were escorted out of the city recently.

346
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,960
And just a few days ago,

347
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,000
rumors circulated
that the Sai residence hoarded supplies.

348
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,200
Your Majesty, please see through this.

349
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,240
I am being falsely accused!

350
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,240
The Sai residence's backyard
yielded this fluorescent powder

351
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
and it extends all the way
to the street.

352
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,440
Do you still have the nerve
to claim innocence?

353
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,040
Father!

354
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,280
Let me in!

355
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Outrageous!

356
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
No noise is allowed around the Emperor.

357
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,600
Take her away.

358
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,400
Wait a moment.

359
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,800
Sai Xue.

360
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Let's talk ourside.

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Mengmeng!

362
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
What is going on here?

363
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,960
People said my father allegedly stole
disaster relief supplies.

364
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,120
How is that possible?

365
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,640
I know it's hard to accept right now,

366
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,840
but it's true.

367
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
What will happen to my father?

368
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,520
We don't know yet.

369
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,480
Mengmeng, please.

370
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,480
Can you help me

371
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
beg His Majesty for mercy?

372
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,000
There must be some misunderstanding.

373
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,880
I will do my best.

374
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,400
Sai Haiming,
you have quite the audacity.

375
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,240
You dare to touch
the court's disaster relief supplies.

376
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,560
Quickly confess truthfully.

377
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,320
Originally, these disaster
relief supplies

378
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,520
were meant for the Ximi people.

379
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,600
However, price prevented them

380
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,160
from accepting.

381
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
I considered selling

382
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,480
these supplies to Your Majesty.

383
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,400
But the Ximi's Second Prince

384
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
sought me out again.

385
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,640
He revealed Your Majesty's identify

386
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,720
and persuaded me
to sell him the grain cheaply.

387
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
So you mustered up the courage

388
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,760
to plan to sell the supplies

389
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,440
and then deny all involvement, correct?

390
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,920
This wasn't my idea.

391
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,600
I was instructed
by Jin Qianpao to do so.

392
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,960
Jin Qianpao?

393
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't even know his true identity.

394
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,040
All I know is that everyone
calls him Jin Qianpao.

395
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,160
Before, he had many
official business dealings

396
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,040
and wanted to work together.

397
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,920
Some of their dealings
were questionable.

398
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,240
This disaster relief supplies concern

399
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,040
was also his order.

400
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Otherwise,

401
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,760
he would reveal

402
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
my past actions.

403
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,720
Do you know where he is now?

404
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,240
I don't know.

405
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,680
We agreed to

406
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,600
deliver Ximi's money

407
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,240
tomorrow afternoon

408
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,880
in a quiet grove outside the city.

409
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,200
Bold Sai Haiming,

410
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,160
how dare you lies to His Majesty.

411
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,800
Your insight is keen.

412
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,320
Every word I say is true.

413
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,760
I would never deceive His Majesty.

414
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,480
I will believe you this once.

415
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,280
Tomorrow, follow my instructions.

416
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,360
Understood.

417
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,200
What's wrong?

418
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,400
Why aren't you asleep?

419
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
Is there anything on your mind? Tell me.

420
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
Sai Xue wants to join us tomorrow.

421
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,840
She asked me to ask you if it's okay.

422
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,680
On disaster relief supplies,
Sai Xue is clueless.

423
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,320
Otherwise, she wouldn't let Li Tao

424
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,120
into Sai Residence.

425
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
So,

426
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,240
if she wants to go, let her go.

427
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,720
With her around,

428
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,960
even Sai Haiming
would have to be cautious

429
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,280
about stirring up trouble.

430
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,640
I feel sorry for Sai Xue.

431
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,160
She has such a father.

432
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
I used to envy her.

433
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,320
The young lady is rich and lovely

434
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,240
who has all she wants.

435
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,040
She even chased me down

436
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
the street with a whip.

437
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,480
Obviously, she has all she wants.

438
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,480
So, you're saying she wants

439
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,840
to propose marriage to you?

440
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,440
What else?

441
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,800
I think

442
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,280
her acts are a temporary

443
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
fascination with your looks.

444
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,960
What about you?

445
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,680
Do you believe I'm handsome

446
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,360
and your attention is fleeting?

447
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,480
I don't know if you've

448
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,720
ever heard of this saying:

449
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,520
Attraction starts with looks,
then talent,

450
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,800
then character.

451
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
Appearance?

452
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,840
It's your handsome face that does it.

453
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,080
In my opinion,

454
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,800
you are attracted to appearance,

455
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,280
money,

456
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
and finally, money.

457
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,240
Wait a minute...

458
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,800
Your Majesty,

459
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,720

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,000
have good soundproofing?

461
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,920
Look, the wind was strong outside,

462
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,720
but closing the window

463
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
silences it.

464
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,800
This is better than

465
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800

466
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,200

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,480
Go down and find him.

576
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,960
Must find him alive.

577
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,320
If he's dead, find his body.

578
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,200
Yes!

579
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,620
Halt!

580
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,720
Where is your pass?

581
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,360
Officer, look here.

582
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,300
What's inside the carriage?

583
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,540
It's our master and his wife.

584
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,980
Sir.

585
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,420
My parent-in-law is seriously ill.

586
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,500
We're rushing back in a hurry.

587
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,420
It's so late,

588
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,900
you've worked hard.

589
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,760
Alright,

590
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
please move quickly.

591
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,180
Do not underestimate the royal guards.

592
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,960
You were shot with lethal dart poison.

593
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,600
Ordinary healing ointment

594
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,120
won't save you.

595
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,600
Never mind.

596
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,720
I will find the cure
once arrive in Yang City.

597
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Royal family poison was on your arrows.

598
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,320
Physician in Yang City
cannot save you either.

599
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,600
I can help you.

600
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,280
Don't fool me!

601
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Let's go.

602
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,700
Giddy up!

603
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
Go!

604
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,220
How dare!

605
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,660
Horse riding is prohibited
in front of the City gates.

606
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,540
Weren't you aware?

607
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,420
Greetings, Prince Heqin.

608
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,300
Did a woman enter just now?

609
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,080
Yes, there is one.

610
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,000
What does she look like?

611
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,340
Apologies, Prince Heqin.

612
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,820
That woman sat in a carriage.

613
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,660
Her spouse stated no one should see her.

614
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,300
They went which way?

615
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,900
Southeast.

616
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,220
They headed southeast.

617
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,660
Go!

618
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,820
Go!

619
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,860
Chancellor Cui.

620
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,820
Ma Kun, you scoundrel!

621
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,700
If it weren't for me

622
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,700
protecting you all these years,

623
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,020
Imperial guards would have

624
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,820
exterminated your group long ago.

625
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,660
However, you kidnapped my daughter

626
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,940
and blackmailed me!

627
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,260
Even investigated my accounts.

628
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,500
Seriously, you seek for death!

629
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,180
Chancellor Cui,

630
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,500
there is something

631
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
you should know.

632
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,980
What is it?

633
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,580
Speak quickly!

634
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,940
Our men saw Prince Heqin's forces

635
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,940
near the imperial palace.

636
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,840
Prince Heqin has asked the court

637
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,460
to let him return
to his border dominion.

638
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,660
And Wan has also gone to the palace.

639
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,220
It seems she plans

640
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,420
to elope with Prince Heqin!

641
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,100
What should we do now?

642
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,140
We have no choice but to let her go.

643
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,820
She disregards the Cui family's honor.

644
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,660
Let her be.

645
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,420
However, we must move immediately

646
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,620
to stop these pirates from spreading

647
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,140
the disaster relief supplies
embezzlement news.

648
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,300
Take a few men with you

649
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,980
and eliminate them immediately.

650
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,460
Do not leave any witnesses.

651
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,100
Yes, Sir.

652
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,100
Boss.

653
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,060
- Over here.
- Good.

654
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,740
It's already this time.

655
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,580
Cui Anshi should have

656
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,380
got the letter by now.

657
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,060
We would not be hiding

658
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,060
and fleeing the court

659
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,440
if he hadn't withheld

660
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,840
disaster relief supplies

661
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
and wrongly accused us of kidnapping.

662
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,400
Now,

663
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,120
we've lost so many brothers.

664
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,800
His daughter is in our hands.

665
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,600
I doubt he'd ignore

666
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,160
his daughter's life.

667
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,960
You go,

668
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,720
find the medicine
Cui Wan mentioned for me.

669
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,520
Yes.

670
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,480
Take care, Boss.

671
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,580
[Kangji Pharmacy]

672
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,960
Your Grace,

673
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,400
that night, we searched

674
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,600
all Yang City pharmacies.

675
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,200
This is the last one.

676
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,240
It appears

677
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,600
that no pharmacy

678
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,120
has treated arrow wounds.

679
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,920
Your Grace,

680
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,040
I own a little pharmacy

681
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,440
and would never do anything illegal.

682
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,240
Shopkeeper!

683
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,440
Shopkeeper!

684
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,160
Shopkeeper!

685
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,840
Go check.

686
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,440
Yes.

687
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,960
Wait.

688
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,440
Don't be afraid,

689
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
I won't hurt you.

690
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,240
Keep it under wraps.

691
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,160
I apologize

692
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,440
for the wait, Sir.

693
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,200
Are you buying medicine?

694
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,400
Cut the crap.

695
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,360
Do you have bamboo grass here?

696
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
Bamboo grass?

697
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,920
Wan, are you done?

698
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,400
Please allow a moment.

699
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,040
Herbal wound treatments
require crushing.

700
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,160
It's just a game.

701
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,280
Why so serious?

702
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,040
Do you really think you're a physician?

703
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Why are you crying again?

704
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,880
Qi Yan, Wan.

705
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,520
Huai An.

706
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,360
Just in time.

707
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,080
Look at Wan.

708
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,640
She's playing physician
with dog's tail grass again.

709
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,680
This is bamboo grass.

710
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,120
It's clearly dog's tail grass.

711
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,000
Wan.

712
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,240
What can this bamboo grass cure?

713
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,200
Huai An!

714
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Only you would play

715
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
this kind of pretend game with her.

716
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,960
It's just a common dog's tail grass

717
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,000
and you even gave it a fancy name.

718
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,560
Forget it,

719
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,360
I'm done playing with you.

720
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,000
I'll help you.

721
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,920
This...

722
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,240
It must be that wild cat.

723
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,720
It knocked over
my medicine basket again.

724
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,640
Please wait a moment.

725
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
I'll be right back.

726
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,200
Hurry up!

727
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,160
This is my target.

728
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,600
Tell him that bamboo grass

729
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
is very precious

730
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,240
and requires a lot of money to exchange.

731
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,320
And he

732
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,080
must pay for

733
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,480
the medicine upfront.

734
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,440
But Your Grace,

735
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,360
I've never heard of a herb called

736
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,720
bamboo grass.

737
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
This is bamboo gras.

738
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,440
It's not dog's tail grass?

739
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay,

740
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,520
I'll go get it right away.

741
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,480
Your Grace,

742
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,680
you sure you want to go alone?

743
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,400
They dare hide among people!

744
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,400
They must have calculated

745
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
that we would be wary of Wan's status.

746
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
If we approach them,

747
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,640
they will circulate reports

748
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,400
Noble Consort being seized by pirates,

749
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,160
ruining her image.

750
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,400
For her sake,

751
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
I cannot risk it.

752
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,840
Here is the prepared

753
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,720
bamboo grass as indicated.

754
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,160
Additionally,

755
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,840
this neutralizes arrow venom.

756
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,120
However, Your Highness,

757
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
going alone

758
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,080
is a perilous move.

759
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,480
Please be careful.

760
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,680
If I do not emerge within an hour,

761
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,440
lead the troops and storm the compound.

762
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,640
As you command.

763
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,840
Boss.

764
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,520
I've found the bamboo grass.

765
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,520
What's the matter?

766
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,760
Nothing.

767
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,280
I'll go get it.

768
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Wait.

769
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,920
You go.

770
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,040
Yes.

771
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,880
Boss.

772
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,240
Tell me.

773
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,800
This bamboo grass...

774
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,120
what does it look like?

775
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
The bamboo grass has a straight stalk.

776
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,160
The leaf tongue is short.

777
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,920
The edges have dense, fine hairs.

778
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,120
The leaves are flat and straight.

779
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,400
They are brownish-yellow.

780
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,880
But to use it as medicine,

781
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,040
it must be ground into a powder.

782
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Since there's nothing wrong
with this medicine,

783
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,320
shouldn't you pay for it now?

784
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,040
