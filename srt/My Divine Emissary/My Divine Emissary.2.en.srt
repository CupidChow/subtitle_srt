00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,350
have been bullying him more than ever.

190
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,710
Bullying him?

191
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,110
Yes.

192
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,310
Judging by Eunuch Li's reactions,

193
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,390
he doesn't seem like
a professionally trained spy.

194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,630
Keep observing.

195
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,670
You bold servant!

196
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,990
How dare you intrude
into the Imperial Study Room?

197
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,390
Your Majesty.

198
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,590
You...explain yourself.

199
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,110
How did you end up here?

200
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,910
I...

201
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,910
Yesterday, I really missed Your Majesty.

202
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,230
I couldn't sleep just thinking of you.

203
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,270
But as soon as I came over today,

204
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,230
I fell asleep.

205
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,110
Is that so?

206
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,310
Are you hungry?

207
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,310
His Majesty likes
First Flush Longjing tea.

208
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,590
He dislikes peanuts.

209
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,030
He likes kickball.

210
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,230
He hates seeing people cry.

211
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,270
Hate seeing people cry?

212
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,470
To be specific, it's not hate.

213
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,430
It's fear.

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,990
Whenever someone cries,

215
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,550
His Majesty softens and compromises.

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,150
This is a big secret.

217
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,430
I usually don't tell anyone.

218
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,070
Life is so unfair!

219
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,430
I can't sleep or eat enough
in the quarters.

220
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,910
Now even His Majesty wants to bully me.

221
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,990
You grown man...what are you crying for?

222
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,550
I'm not a grown man.

223
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,230
Still half, half of a man, right?

224
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,990
I want to go home.

225
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,870
What do you want?

226
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,910
I'll make it up to you.

227
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,470
Anything I want?

228
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,390
Anything.

229
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,340
I...

230
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,190
I want...

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,510
The urn that I came with.

232
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,310
Urn?

233
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,150
Urn?

234
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,550
Easy peasy.

235
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,990
He's over here.

236
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,830
Here.

237
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,110
What's wrong?

238
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,110
The Empress Dowager has
strictly forbidden

239
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,110
all sorceries and witchcrafts
in the palace.

240
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,990
Yet Eunuch Li dared to hide contraband.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,630
Come on.

242
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,390
Take him to the Empress Dowager's palace
and await her judgment.

243
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,950
Take him away.

244
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

245
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,340
Let's go.

246
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,270
That's not contraband.

247
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,240
Let's go.

248
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,110
It's just a doll of mine.

249
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,830
Just be honest.

250
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,390
It's not contraband.

251
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,680
Go.

252
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,150
That ain't contraband.

253
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,990
Hurry up.

254
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,930
Go.

255
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,320
Move.

256
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,910
Let go of me.

257
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,510
- Move faster.
- Let go of me.

258
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,550
Hurry up, don't dawdle.

259
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,190
Let go of me.

260
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,070
What's all this noise?

261
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,190
Chancellor Cui.

262
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,600
Sir.

263
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,390
Making loud noise within the palace?

264
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,270
Where are your manners?

265
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,560
Chancellor Cui.

266
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,910
This person was practicing witchcraft
within the palace.

267
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,230
I was just about to report it
to the Empress Dowager .

268
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,070
I did not.

269
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,550
Still argueing?

270
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,630
Chancellor Cui.

271
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,470
Chancellor Cui, look.

272
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,870
This doll is mine.

273
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,030
But the needles on it aren't mine.

274
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,190
Please investigate it, Chancellor.

275
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,020
I'm innocent.

276
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,870
Are you innocent?

277
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,550
Last night,

278
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,750
I clearly saw you in the corner
playing with this doll.

279
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,670
I saw it too.

280
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,030
Me too.

281
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,150
Me too, me too.

282
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,630
You're lying!

283
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,190
Alright.

284
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,950
Just a mere palace eunuch.

285
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,390
Why bother the empress dowager?

286
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,710
Just take him out and beat him to death.

287
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,300
Yes.

288
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,950
Take him away.

289
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,470
Let's go.

290
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,160
Go.

291
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,660
Go.

292
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,550
Let go of me.

293
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,510
I'm innocent.

294
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:08,920
Hurry up.

295
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,230
It wasn't me. Let go of me.

296
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,910
Your Majesty.

297
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,150
He's neither Minister Gu's people

298
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,670
nor Chancellor Cui's.

299
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,510
So...

300
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,770
Let's go.

301
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,510
Come here.

302
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:17,750
Move.

303
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm truly innocent.

304
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,990
Come here.

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,750
Hold on.

306
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,710
Greetings to Your Majesty.

307
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,510
He's my people.

308
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,350
Your Majesty, help!

309
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,270
Who dares to touch him?

310
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,070
Your Majesty!

311
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,190
Your Majesty!

312
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,870
That doll is mine.

313
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,230
But the needles and spells on it

314
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,390
are absolutely not mine.

315
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,150
I swear.

316
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,550
Hand it over.

317
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,590
Your Majesty.

318
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,430
He's just a low-ranking palace eunuch.

319
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,910
Why bother Your Majesty?

320
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,030
Moreover, this witchcraft matter

321
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,870
is a serious taboo within the palace.

322
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,790
And it concerns Your Majesty's safety.

323
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,430
I suggest just taking them all out

324
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,910
and beating them to death.

325
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,870
Your Majesty, spare us!

326
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,350
Your Majesty, spare us!

327
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,250
Uncle!

328
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,990
This Eunuch Li has been
very clever and obedient

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,150
under my supevision.

330
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,190
He couldn't possibly
have done such a thing.

331
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,550
Your Majesty.

332
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,790
Could you let me see the spells?

333
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,910
The spells?

334
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,290
[14th of the 6th Month]

335
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,270
Your Majesty, look.

336
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,190
There's ink on the
left side of the spells.

337
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,350
It must be made while writing.

338
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,270
Since the ink is on the left side,

339
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,670
the person who wrote it
must be left-handed.

340
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,230
Please, Your Majesty, investigate this.

341
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,910
Who among us is left-handed?

342
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,030
Your Majesty!

343
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,310
Your Majesty, spare us!

344
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,390
Your Majesty, spare us!

345
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,870
Spare us, Your Majesty!

346
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,870
Spare us, Your Majesty!
Spare us, Your Majesty!

347
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,190
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

348
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,990
Spare us, Your Majesty!

349
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,070
Your Majesty!

350
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,630
Your Majesty.

351
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,950
This little eunuch looks
somewhat unfamiliar.

352
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,790
As for Eunuch Li,

353
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,230
he was newly assigned
to the imperial study room.

354
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,910
He's always full of ideas,

355
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,910
especially

356
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,670
when it comes to tricks to amuse me.

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,030
Your Majesty should focus more
on reading The Books of the Sages

358
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,750
and paying attention
to the state affairs.

359
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,270
Since you've been bullied like this,

360
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,710
why didn't you tell me?

361
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,990
I shouldn't bother Your Majesty
with some minor issue.

362
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,590
From now on, you belong to me.

363
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,110
If anyone dares to bully you,

364
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,670
just tell me.

365
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,540
From now on you'll move
and live next to Lu Huan.

366
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,950
However,

367
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,230
Your Majesty, how did you know

368
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,350
I was caught by them?

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,790
This entire palace is mine.

370
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,350
What do I not know?

371
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,830
Your Majesty, you're truly amazing.

372
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,230
From now on,

373
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,910
you are my lifesaver.

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,710
If you have any requests in the future,

375
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,870
just let me know

376
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,030
as long as they make sense.

377
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,230
This little scoundrel framed Eunuch Li

378
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,830
and got caught by Your Majesty.

379
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,350
Along with some people from the temple,
including the little scoundrel

380
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,830
have already been dealt with.

381
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,790
From this, it's fair to say

382
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,190
that Eunuch Li is not
under Chancellor Cui.

383
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,150
But rather seems to be
under Your Majesty's command.

384
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,990
Darn!

385
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,110
Sir.

386
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,710
What should we do next?

387
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,550
Prince Heqin is about to return.

388
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,190
I will report to him when he returns.

389
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,750
For now, let's wait and do nothing.

390
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,390
Yes.

391
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,070
If I go in now,

392
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,550
can I return to the future?

393
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,050
[Wu Hostel]

394
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,390
This is the one.

395
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,990
Or do I need to fill it with water?

396
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,830
Eunuch Li wake up.

397
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,510
Do you want to be dead?

398
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,470
So tired.

399
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,870
Back to work again.

400
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,230
Just drag him out and beat him to death.

401
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,870
Let's go.

402
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,750
Let me go!

403
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,310
I'm innocent!

404
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,870
Hurry up!

405
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,790
No!

406
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,310
I need to hurry back.

407
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,830
Otherwise, I really will be dead.

408
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,630
Water.

409
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,870
Steward Huang.

410
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,230
Why don't you go first?

411
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,030
There's a drought in the north nowadays.

412
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,510
It hasn't rained in the capital
for a long time.

413
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,270
Water is precious.

414
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,360
So. each person is limited
to one bucket of water per day.

415
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,000
What?

416
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,630
Yes.

417
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,390
When will this urn be filled with water?

418
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,190
Good afternoon, Scholar Zhen.

419
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,070
Have you solved the problem
from last time?

420
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,550
I'm still calculating.

421
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,990
The current approximation
for the circumference is

422
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,630
three zhang, one chi, four cun,
one fen, five li, nine hao

423
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,270
and two miao.

424
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,630
Amazing!

425
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,550
Truly worthy of the top scholar!

426
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,470
The answer is already very close.

427
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,910
The value of pi is

428
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,720
three point one four one five
nine two six five three five

429
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,990
eight nine seven nine three two
three eight four six two six.

430
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,710
How did you calculate it?

431
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,230
Eunuch Li is indeed so talented.

432
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,710
Your Majesty.

433
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,790
This is the wisdom from my ancestors.

434
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,110
During the Northern
and Southern Dynasties,

435
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,910
it was deduced
by the mathematician Chongzhi Zu.

436
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,790
If

437
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,110
your Majesty could return my machine

438
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,230
to me,

439
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,510
I could show you even
more amazing tricks.

440
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,470
Greetings to the Empress Dowager.

441
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,590
No need for formalities.

442
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,350
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

443
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,790
Have you seen Yan yet?

444
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,310
I have.

445
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,710
But I happened to catch

446
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,150
the Emperor lose control

447
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,830
over a eunuch that he likes.

448
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,510
It's truly embarrassing.

449
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,670
Yan has just recently been crowned.

450
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,550
He can still be recklessly sometimes.

451
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,190
What Empress Dowager said was right.

452
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,590
So, you see,

453
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,830
only by being a father

454
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,390
can the Emperor become calm.

455
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,230
I think the marriage between
His Majesty and Wan

456
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,550
shouldn't be delayed any longer,
am I right?

457
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,790
Empress Dowager,

458
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,390
you must also pay more attention.

459
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,950
Got it.

460
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,230
Ding-ding.

461
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,110
Calculator.

462
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,910
What's this?

463
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,870
His Majesty

464
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,630
has learned Arabic numerals.

465
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,830
So when you face
with problems in the future,

466
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,190
you can just input the numbers

467
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,710
and the answer
will come out immediately.

468
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,350
For example, this one is pi.

469
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,510
And this one?

470
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,830
This is exponentiation.

471
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,070
It's how many of the same numbers
are multiplied together.

472
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,790
For example, if fifty threes
are multiplied together,

473
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,510
the answer is this number.

474
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,350
You go verify it quickly.

475
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,230
Yes.

476
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,430
Is there anything else?

477
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,350
Show it to me.

478
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,280
You see, when you divide this by this,

479
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
the answer comes out immediately.

480
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,590
Your Majesty.

481
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,830
The Noble Consort is here
on the order of the Empress Dowager

482
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,430
to pay respects to you.

483
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,550
May the Noble Consort enter the hall.

484
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,390
Greetings to Your Majesty.

485
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,150
Greetings to Your Majesty.

486
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,470
No need for formalities.

487
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,310
The Noble Consort has arrived.

488
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,350
Is this the Emperor's consort?

489
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,390
His Majesty has been reviewing
memorials all day and night.

490
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm worried about His Majesty's health

491
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,830
hence I specially made some broth

492
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,830
and sent it over here.

493
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,950
It's my bad.

494
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,710
I've made the Noble Consort worry.

495
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,150
Duo?

496
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,070
Duo,

497
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,470
why are you here too?

498
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,430
Are you also serving as a consort here?

499
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,870
How dare you, servant!

500
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,110
How dare you offend the consort!

501
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,990
Let me teach you a lesson!

502
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,470
Your Majesty, forgive me.

503
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,830
You can't meddle with my people.

504
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,230
It's me who overstepped.

505
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,270
Your Majesty, forgive me.

506
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,510
Is there anything else, Noble Consort?

507
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,310
The Empress Dowager has learned
from the high priest

508
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,190
that the date of marriage
has been chosen.

509
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,150
She hopes Your Majesty
don't miss the propitious time.

510
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,190
Understood.

511
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,670
May granny please go back
and inform the Empress Dowager.

512
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,830
Tell her not to worry.

513
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,710
Your humble servant bids farewell.

514
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,510
Duo must have some unspoken difficulty.

515
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,110
To marry with Emperor Yan?

516
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,350
Is she insane?

517
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,470
Your Majesty.

518
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,510
You can't marry her.

519
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,670
Absolutely not.

520
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,630
Outrageous!

521
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,350
Matters of Your Majesty

522
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,990
are none of your business!

523
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,710
Why can't we get married?

524
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,110
This...

525
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,830
This...

526
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,710
Because there's no affection.

527
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,190
You can't do something like that.

528
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,630
Moreover, the children born this way

529
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,270
will suffer terribly.

530
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,590
How do you know

531
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,190
that I and the Noble Consort
have no affection?

532
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,550
That's true.

533
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,350
After all, Lu Huan is not Teacher Lu.

534
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,350
And the Noble Consort may not
necessarily be Duo.

535
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,790
I should quickly find a solution,

536
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,910
find water and go back.

537
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,950
Your Majesty, it's time for court.

538
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,510
Reporting to Your Majesty.

539
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,560
According to reports,

540
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,730
Prince Heqin is scheduled
to arrive in the capital tomorrow.

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,670
Prince Heqin is returning to the court

542
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,670
Minister Gu,

543
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,390
Prince Heqin is returning to the court.

544
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,550
Shouldn't we report

545
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,030
to the court in advance?

546
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,430
Moreover, he has served only five years
in the Northern Frontier.

547
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,630
That's less than three years.

548
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,070
Why does he want to return?

549
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,870
The Northern Frontier is peaceful now.

550
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,230
It's only natural for Prince Heqin
to return to the court.

551
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,350
Moreover,

552
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,750
the prince has risked
his life for Qi Kingdom.

553
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,830
Now that he's returning in victory.

554
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,710
Your Majesty should personally

555
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,630
greet him at the city gate.

556
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,190
That would be even more inappropriate.

557
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,030
Your Majesty is the ruler
of the Nine Provinces.

558
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,830
Why should he lower himself
waiting at the city gate

559
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,790
just to greet a prince?

560
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,710
Besides,

561
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,250
Prince Heqin has just returned
from the battlefield.

562
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,750
He's carrying evil aura with him.

563
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,190
If it endangered His Majesty's health,

564
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,110
could you bear that responsibility?

565
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,550
How could it endanger His Majesty?

566
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,270
Chancellor Cui, have you

567
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,350
no courage at all?

568
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,670
You're being ridiculous.

569
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,230
When Chancellor Cui
was fighting battles,

570
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,990
you were still playing with mud!

571
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,870
Exactly.

572
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,270
The mud I played with

573
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,350
is definitely not as many as
Chancellor Cui's defeats.

574
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,830
Nonsense!

575
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,110
Am I wrong?

576
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,150
You're talking nonsense!

577
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,230
He hasn't won any battles.

578
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,790
Is that what you said?

579
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,670
Did he ever win battles?

580
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,950
You're ridiculous!

581
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,910
You...

582
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,430
You guys...

583
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,990
You...

584
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,550
Your...Your Majesty!

585
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,550
Your Majesty!

586
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,150
Leave the court.

587
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,990
All hail Our Majesty, long live,
long live, long live!

588
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,510
Greetings to Your Majesty.

589
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,550
Your Majesty.

590
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,430
Minister Gu has asked you
to greet Prince Heqin.

591
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,630
This is clearly a slight against you.

592
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,150
It's just a greeting.

593
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,870
Not a big deal.

594
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,190
But the prince's

595
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,510
sudden return with the troops this time,

596
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,630
I fear there might be other motives.

597
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,710
Minister Gu wants me

598
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,230
to save face for the prince.

599
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,190
Whether I want to or not
still depends on me.

600
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,550
However, the prince's return
comes at good time.

601
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,910
Li Ming's also arriving
from Lu County to the capital.

602
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,230
I was just worried that I didn't
have a chance to go out and meet him.

603
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,270
Your Majesty is wise.

604
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,670
What a lousy palace!

605
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,030
Why is it so hard to find water?

606
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,190
It's driving me crazy!

607
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,910
Is the emperor going out?

608
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,910
Your Majesty.

609
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,550
Don't say anything.

610
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,150
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

611
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,990
Shh.

612
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,030
Congratulations on
the victorious return of Prince Heqin.

613
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,470
Congratulations on
the victorious return of Prince Heqin.

614
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,670
Your Majesty.

615
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,310
Prince Heqin has arrived.

616
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,750
What's going on?

617
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,270
This...

618
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,910
What does His Majesty mean?

619
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,710
Your Majesty.

620
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,950
The prince has arrived.

621
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,990
The prince has passed.

622
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,190
Your Majesty, forgive me.

623
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,990
He's not here.

624
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,950
Where's His Majesty?

625
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,830
Didn't His Majesty promise

626
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,070
to come and welcome the Prince?

627
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,550
Exactly!

628
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,750
The Prince has numerous
battle achievements,

629
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,670
yet His Majesty disregards
even the most basic

630
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,390
courtesy between ruler and servant.

631
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,270
Watch your words.

632
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,470
Prince Heqin has finally returned!

633
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,950
You said you are married.

634
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,910
Why are you here?

635
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,630
So what, if I'm married?

636
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,390
Does being married mean I can't see
handsome men anymore?

637
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,990
You, who are not married,

638
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,110
aren't you dreaming of
marrying Prince Heqin?

639
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:30,990
Prince Heqin.

640
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,550
Prince Heqin.

641
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,030
I'm curious to see what Prince Heqin

642
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,990
looks like.

643
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,830
What makes so many girls infatuated?

644
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,630
Prince Heqin! Prince Heqin!

645
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:46,750
[Congratulations on
the victorious return of Prince Heqin.]

646
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,430
Prince Heqin!

647
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,990
Welcome back!

648
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,350
Welcome, Prince!

649
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,510
Welcome, Prince!

650
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,590
Prince Heqin!

651
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,110
