00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
I can't go back to Ximi empty-handed.

190
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,640
By the way,

191
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,960
I've heard that Qi Kingdom

192
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
has been promoting
a new solution to the drought.

193
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,280
Look into it.

194
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,160
Yes.

195
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,420
[Yang City Office]

196
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,980
[Peace for the People]

197
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,400
Go.

198
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,920
Your Majesty.

199
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
It's all set.

200
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,760
Minister Qian,
you've got a lot of guts!

201
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,760
Your Majesty.

202
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,800
I've been wronged.

203
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Someone must be trying to frame me.

204
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
My loyalty to Your Majesty
is clear to all.

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,040
Even the sun and the moon know that,
Your Majesty.

206
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,640
You didn't think you'd get away

207
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120
with killing Master Sai, did you?

208
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,720
And now you're trying

209
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
to put the food into your pocket.

210
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,760
Who's behind you?

211
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Capture him!

212
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,320
Yes!

213
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,480
Your Majesty!

214
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,880
Your Majesty!

215
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,040
Lu Huan.

216
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,320
- Take Mengmeng with you.
- Yes.

217
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,640
- Let's go.
- Be careful, Your Majesty.

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,080
Alright.

219
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
Go!

220
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,940
Quick!

221
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
Fire the signal flare!

222
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,280
No way.

223
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,880
His Majesty will be in danger.

224
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
We'll only cause trouble
for His Majesty if we go.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,240
His Majesty has his own plans.

226
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,240
Who are you?

227
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,280
I'm your father.

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,840
Your Majesty!

231
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Your Majesty!

232
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,560
Your Majesty!

233
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Your Majesty!

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,640
Mengmeng.

235
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,400
Are you alright?

236
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm doing well.

237
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,000
If I hadn't brought my men here,

238
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,680
would you still had been standing here?

239
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,000
Kong An.

240
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,400
Check the courthouse carefully.

241
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,080
Yes.

242
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,160
Your Majesty.

243
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,600
I'll stay and help too.

244
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,560
Good.

245
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,160
Will you stop looking at me like that?

246
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,000
Your Grace escaped
with great difficulty,

247
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,000
but now you've left yourself
in the open.

248
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
What is it all about?

249
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,240
You didn't know, Your Majesty.

250
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,840
There's been a drought
in Ximi for months.

251
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,520
There's been no harvest.

252
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
We had to empty the treasury

253
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
to buy food.

254
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,600
To save every penny,

255
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
I've been living

256
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,640
with just one cornbread in my hand

257
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
not even a drop of oil in my bowl.

258
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,840
I heard that the recent drought

259
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,640
in your kingdom has eased.

260
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,240
You're pretty well informed.

261
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,120
Then tell me the secret.

262
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Secret?

263
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,360
That's a nice way to ask for it.

264
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,760
I paid for it before.

265
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,880
We haven't even got the food yet.

266
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,120
Is it too much to ask for the secret?

267
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,920
Besides, I saved your lives today.

268
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,640
In your dreams.

269
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
Don't tell me then!

270
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
I can think of something without it.

271
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
[Sai Family]

272
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,440
Your Majesty.

273
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,400
The account book and the case file

274
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,640
on the relief food found

275
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,680
at Qian Ji's place are here.

276
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,180
[Account book]

277
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,960
These four

278
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
are all Chancellor Cui's men.

279
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,880
And why do they need cotton clothes

280
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,040
in this heat?

281
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm afraid this Chui Anzu

282
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
is not transporting cotton clothes.

283
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,800
Look into it.

284
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,280
Yes.

285
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,240
What about the relief food?

286
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,680
It's on its way to the capital.

287
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,200
Bad news!

288
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,440
Kong An! Quick!

289
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,600
What's going on?

290
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,680
I met him on the street.

291
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,240
He was badly hurt.

292
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
So, I brought him back.

293
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,200
Your Majesty.

294
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,480
Zhuiying!

295
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,160
What happened?

296
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
Where are Qi Su and Wan?

297
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,440
The pirates took Her Highness

298
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
at the palace.

299
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,560
His Grace chased them to Yang City

300
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
to save Her Highness and got trapped.

301
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,640
The men were ambushed

302
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,600
when they rushed in.

303
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,360
If this whip were to fall

304
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,120
on Her Highness,

305
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,680
I wonder if she would be able
to withstand it.

306
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,480
Don't you lay a hand on her!

307
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,840
If you dare to lay a hand on her,

308
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
I'll never let you go!

309
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,080
Prince Heqin.

310
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,000
Aren't you at all curious

311
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,720
as to why I took Her Highness?

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,760
The court wants us

313
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,720
for stealing the relief food.

314
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,240
But they didn't know that the food

315
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,280
had already gone
into Chancellor Cui's pocket.

316
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

317
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,080
Nonsense?

318
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,200
I did what I did!

319
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,680
If I didn't do it,

320
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,960
he won't make me take the blame!

321
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,960
As long as you don't hurt Wan,

322
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
Chancellor Cui can satisfy you.

323
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,360
The day Cui Wan was kidnapped,

324
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,480
I sent a letter to the old man.

325
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,840
What do you think happened next?

326
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,400
He said Cui Wan was kidnapped

327
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,760
and her honor was ruined!

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,520
Even if she barely survives,

329
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,720
it's just a way of degrading
the Cui family's reputation!

330
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,000
He asked me to get rid of her
as soon as possible!

331
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,720
Do you see what's going on here?

332
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
Don't hurt Wan!

333
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,480
There's so many of them.

334
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,800
How are we going to break in?

335
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,280
Sai Xue.

336
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,640
How many men do you have left?

337
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,600
The house Ma Kun chose
is in the middle of the market.

338
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
If we make too much noise,

339
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,680
we'll hurt the innocent.

340
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,960
We can use smoke

341
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,320
to knock them out.

342
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
But their manpower

343
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
is too much after all.

344
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,520
It's going to be hard

345
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,360
to get them out of there

346
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
without alerting the pirates.

347
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
What should we do then?

348
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,760
I have an idea.

349
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Give me a second.

350
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,760
I thought I'd brought this

351
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,680
for nothing.

352
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,440
What's this?

353
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,280
Beware, Your Majesty.

354
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Don't make a big deal out of it.

355
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
I couldn't possibly harm His Majesty.

356
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,520
It's a bubble maker.

357
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,640
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

358
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,840
What are you going to do with this?

359
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,920
When I watched the drama,

360
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,200
I noticed that the drugs

361
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
doesn't seem to work
on powerful villains.

362
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
So I thought I'd add some poison

363
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,280
to this.

364
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,760
A very powerful one.

365
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,320
They'll be poisoned
when it touches the skin.

366
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,600
Your Majesty.

367
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,440
Kong An.

368
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,600
I'll do it now.

369
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,400
Your Majesty.

370
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,280
This is it.

371
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
Ma Kun lives in the master bedroom.

372
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,000
They have a dozen or so men

373
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,840
to a sentry post.

374
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,840
The shift changes every four hours.

375
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,760
Your Majesty.

376
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,200
Are we going to do it now?

377
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,320
Let's observe a little longer.

378
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,680
Someone's coming. Let's leave.

379
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,520
Who are they?

380
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,600
What are they doing here?

381
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,800
His Majesty has given orders.

382
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,840
Don't leave anyone alive.

383
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,120
You go and find Her Highness first.

384
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,840
Be quick.

385
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,440
Alright.

386
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,400
Boss!

387
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,440
How is it going?

388
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,480
It's no good!

389
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,160
Outside...

390
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,080
Take them!

391
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,040
Wan.

392
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,720
Wan.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,800
- Wan.
- How are you?

394
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,760
Quick.

395
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,840
Wan.

396
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,120
Wan.

397
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,240
I'll do it.

398
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,360
Where's His Majesty?

399
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm here.

400
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,440
Is Wan alright?

401
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,720
She must have been drugged.

402
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,560
This Ma Kun is a tough guy.

403
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,640
He'd rather kill himself
than surrender.

404
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,520
Another thing.

405
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
What about the men in black

406
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
who came to assassinate in my name?

407
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,440
They're all dead.

408
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,760
Let's get out of here.

409
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,980
[Sai Family]

410
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,520
Physician.

411
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,680
How is she?

412
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,440
The girl is fine.

413
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,640
It's just that she's been drugged

414
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,720
and scared.

415
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
I'll prescribe a medicine
to calm her nerves.

416
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,960
Take it and rest for a day
and she'll be fine.

417
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,320
Thank you, Physician.

418
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Please follow me, Physician.

419
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm sure you two have a lot
to talk about.

420
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,680
Why don't I take care of Wan

421
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,200
and you two go out to talk?

422
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,440
Thanks a lot.

423
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,280
Cui Anshi

424
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,280
is so cruel.

425
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,440
Chancellor Cui is Your Majesty's uncle

426
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,000
and also Wan's father.

427
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,760
How could he...?

428
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,960
Wan did everything she was told
by her father.

429
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,120
And him?

430
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,400
How dare he sent the assassins

431
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
to kill Wan under the guise of me!

432
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,200
Wan

433
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,520
mustn't know about this.

434
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I don't want her to feel bad.

435
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,440
Alright.

436
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,720
I promise you.

437
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,040
But we've got to figure out what to do

438
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,760
now that we're on our way back.

439
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,680
How about we...

440
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,680
- Your Honor.
- Say it!

441
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,040
How's it going over there?

442
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,200
None of the assassins we sent out

443
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,240
have returned.

444
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,360
I sent the others over there
to check it out.

445
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
Only to find that the dwelling
where the pirates were hiding

446
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,080
had been cleaned up.

447
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,200
Not a single trace.

448
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,400
Not a single trace?

449
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,920
Yes.

450
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,760
What does that mean?

451
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
If Wan

452
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,120
is really taken away by pirates,

453
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
wouldn't it be that the pirate
kidnapped the Noble Consort?

454
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,760
Then the Cui family's authority
in the palace

455
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,240
will be undermined.

456
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,880
I heard from the neighborhood.

457
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,680
There was a lot of shouting that day.

458
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm afraid...

459
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,320
I'm afraid our men were done.

460
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,840
As for the lady, I'm afraid she's...

461
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,320
Investigate it again.

462
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,880
I want to see her,

463
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,200
death or alive.

464
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,120
Yes.

465
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,000
Your Honor.

466
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,880
There's a man called Qian Ji

467
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
at the door asking to see you.

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,840
What?

469
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,960
His Majesty found the relief food?

470
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,440
I didn't expect His Majesty

471
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,120
to go to Yang City.

472
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,080
Rubbish!

473
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,200
Please forgive me!

474
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,520
The last time I sent
the Empress Dowager's belongings

475
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,480
to the Summer Palace.

476
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,560
His Majesty only sent

477
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,080
his insignificant eunuchs to take them.

478
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,400
It was not Steward Lu.

479
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,440
Could it be that His Majesty

480
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,400
was no longer at the lodge
at that time?

481
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,760
It seems we have underestimated

482
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,880
His Majesty.

483
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,080
He's never even been
to the Summer Palace.

484
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
Now that His Majesty knows

485
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,800
there's a problem with the relief food.

486
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,880
It won't be long

487
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,160
before he finds out about us.

488
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,840
What should we do?

489
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,400
Tell Anzu

490
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
to send more private soldiers

491
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,160
to guard the capital.

492
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,920
Also,

493
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,000
order the palace guards

494
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,520
to be replaced by Imperial Guard.

495
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,560
If His Majesty wants to stay outside,

496
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,720
fine.

497
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,840
We'll make sure he never comes back.

498
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,400
Go

499
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,600
and arrange for more men

500
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,360
to take care of it.

501
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,920
Yes.

502
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,400
Looks like

503
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,880
it's about time.

504
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,440
Wan,

505
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
will you blame me

506
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
if I do this?

507
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,200
I couldn't bear to let you
get hurt in any way.

508
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,800
Huai An.

509
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,920
Wan.

510
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,880
You're awake.

511
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,200
How do you feel?

512
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
Feeling better?

513
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,240
Slowly.

514
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
How's your injury?

515
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,840
I'm fine.

516
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,680
It's a small injury.

517
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,920
You don't need to worry.

518
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,120
Where are we?

519
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,240
This is Yang City's Sai Residence.

520
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,080
His Majesty rescued us.

521
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
His Majesty?

522
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,280
Huai An.

523
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
My father doesn't know

524
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,240
I've been kidnapped, does he?

525
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
He'd be worried about me

526
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,520
if he knew.

527
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't think Chancellor Cui knows yet.

528
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,800
That's great.

529
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,240
And Shitao.

530
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,640
- For me, she...
- Enough.

531
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,800
Don't think too much.

532
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,840
Rest when you're hurt.

533
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,600
Come.

534
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,080
I'm scared of being alone.

535
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,520
Will you hold me?

536
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,960
Don't be scared.

537
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,840
I'm here now.

538
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,040
Huai An.

539
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,200
This time

540
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
we won't be separated again,

541
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,120
right?

542
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,200
No, we won't.

543
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Don't worry, Wan.

544
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,880
Your Majesty.

545
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,160
I received a letter
from Minister Li today.

546
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,280
Said he was on his way to Yang City.

547
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,160
He'll be here in a couple of days.

548
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,680
Minister Li is coming too.

549
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
I have something to tell him.

550
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
Did you find a place for him to stay?

551
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,240
Your Majesty.

552
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,400
It's been arranged.

553
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,160
It's in the small courtyard
behind the Sai Residence.

554
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,640
It's quiet and comfortable.

555
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,760
Mengmeng.

556
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,880
Sai Xue's not here yet.

557
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,360
Isn't Your Highness returning
to Ximi yet?

558
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,160
Is your family not worried about you?

559
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,600
Why are you so eager to get rid of me?

560
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,040
I've helped you twice.

561
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,080
And also,

562
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm waiting for your plan

563
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,080
to cure the drought.

564
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,600
By the way,

565
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,720
Is your engagement

566
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,640
real or not?

567
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,320
So you're a consort

568
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,760
or a queen?

569
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
But aren't all your consorts here

570
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,120
like this?

571
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,920
Why do you look like that?

572
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
It's kind of adorable.

573
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,560
It's none of your business.

574
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,640
We're in a relationship now.

575
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,160
It's not time
to talk about marriage yet.

576
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,120
So you're not married yet?

577
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,280
Then I have a suggestion for you.

578
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,600
Look.

579
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,080
He's the Emperor of Qi Kingdom.

580
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,760
He won't make you his Queen either.

581
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,040
Instead of going back to be his consort,

582
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,000
Why don't you consider
coming to Ximi with me?

583
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,720
I'll make you the legitimate wife.

584
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,280
You dare to?

585
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,400
Think about it and get back to me.

586
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm going to check on Sai Xue.

587
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,400
What do you think

588
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,840
of what he just suggested?

589
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,600
I'm just kidding.

590
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,680
Are you mad?

591
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,640
Smile.

592
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,240
My lady.

It's time to eat.

I'm not hungry yet.

595
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Tell His Majesty and the others

596
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,560
that they don't have to wait for me.

597
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,840
Shen family's and Li family's orders

598
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,720
have all been cancelled.

599
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I'll have to see

600
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,880
who else is available.

601
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,680
What about the compensation
for the Li family?

602
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,160
I'll figure it out.

603
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,260
[Noble and Auspicious]

604
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,120
Where's your lady?

605
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,040
The lady's still working on the books.

606
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,920
Ever since Master died,

607
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,680
she's been busy with the escort
every day.

608
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,600
She doesn't even eat anymore.

609
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
What's going to happen
if this keeps up?

610
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,120
I know now.

611
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,240
I heard there's a great cook

612
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
at the Qingteng Teahouse.

613
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,840
Why don't you come

614
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
and try it with me tonight?

615
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,840
I'm not going.

616
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,840
Why are you upsetting your body?

617
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,320
Why would I go out with you

618
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,800
if it's not justified?

619
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,600
So it's the title you want.

620
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,400
You should have said so.

621
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,880
I don't want to joke with you.

622
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,320
I'll wait for you
at the Qingteng Teahouse tonight.

623

I won't leave

What if I grow fat?

I'd like it even if you got fat.

631

You've just recovered,

You called me here to see this?

This

is a delicacy from my hometown.

666

It's called instant noodles.

I think it's better
than the imperial kitchen's cooking.

This may look like a simple bowl
of noodle,

ask him
