There's no need for it.

192
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm fine.

193
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,100
Where is Eunuch Li?

194
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,820
Your Majesty.

195
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
How can you still be worried
about that traitor?

196
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,940
If he wasn't instructed by Prince Heqin,

197
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,980
you would not have eaten

198
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,340
that food with peanuts in it.

199
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,460
And you would not have fallen ill.

200
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,260
Are you saying Prince Heqin?

201
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,020
Your Majesty,

202
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,980
please have a look.

203
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,980
Do you need to be that far away from me?

204
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,580
Come closer.

205
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,500
Come over here!

206
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,180
Is this Prince Heqin?

207
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,860
No.

208
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,420
This is Bai Lian.

209
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,740
He's someone from my hometown.

210
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,380
Nonsense!

211
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,060
He looks exactly

212
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,100
like Prince Heqin.

213
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,100
This...

214
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,620
I couldn't explain it either.

215
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,260
How about this?

216
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,900
Are you deliberately trying

217
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,340
to poison me with peanuts?

218
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,300
Peanuts?

219
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,380
Are peanuts poisonous?

220
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,060
Are you allergic to peanuts?

221
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,980
Then what about this?

222
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,940
This...

223
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,820
Your Majesty,

224
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,220
this thing is amazing.

225
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,220
Once I use it on you,

226
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,180
things will work out for us.

227
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,380
This belongs to the Noble Consort.

228
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,580
She asked me to keep it for her

229
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,100
when she left the palace.

230
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,780
The Noble Consort?

231
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,300
Open it for me.

232
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,980
Why is it happening again?

233
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,420
Bring my ointment for me.

234
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,460
It's on the table.

235
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,660
Alright.

236
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,340
Your Majesty.

237
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,380
She's...a girl?

238
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,340
Your Majesty...

239
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,740
Oh, no!

240
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,020
How will I face King Yama in the future?

241
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,180
Your Majesty.

242
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,020
Your Majesty...

243
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,620
Eunuch Li, I'm coming in.

244
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,220
Who is it?

245
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,980
Oh, no!

246
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,460
Is he really here to catch me?

247
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,820
What are you doing?

248
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,740
His Majesty ordered

249
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,940
it is unlucky and unsafe

250
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
to place this urn in the room.

251
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,180
To prevent Eunuch Li
from committing suicide again,

252
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,060
we shall take away the urn.

253
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,260
I didn't plan to use the urn
for committing suicide,

254
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,740
I left it in the room

255
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,180
because I was afraid
that others would use the water in it.

256
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,180
There's no need to take these away.

257
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,420
I'm not planning to commit suicide,

258
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,580
return the scissors to me!

259
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,740
[Eunuch Quarters]

260
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,420
Forget it!

261
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,300
Since I cannot return through the urn.

262
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,260
But he must return the scissors to me.

263
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,020
I gained a lot
from this official business trip.

264
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,100
Please let it rain!

265
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,420
Isn't he the...

266
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,940
high priest from the other day?

267
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,580
Did anything happen
in the Lingtai Pavilion recently?

268
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,780
High priest, everything is normal

269
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,500
while you're not around.

270
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,260
That day he stood so close to me

271
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,300
on the altar,

272
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,380
it would be bad if he recognized me.

273
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,300
What are you doing?

274
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,100
Hurry to the hall to assemble.

275
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,540
Yes.

276
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,940
How is it him?

277
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,900
What is going on?

278
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,060
This is a eunuch assessment
for new recruits

279
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,540
that is held every 6 months.

280
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,660
Eunuchs need to be assessed?

281
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,700
Of course.

282
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,380
Recently, someone has disguised
as a eunuch

283
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,660
and did things
that have greatly tarnished

284
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,420
our reputations.

285
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,180
Remember this,

286
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,100
when working in the palace,

287
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,340
if you're not careful

288
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,780
you may be arrested
for deceiving the emperor.

289
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,260
Yes.

290
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,060
Your Majesty,

291
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,940
the money has been delivered
to Lu County.

292
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,540
Minister Li
will not be troubled anymore.

293
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,540
These are the local taxes
that you asked me to calculate.

294
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,020
I've checked them all.

295
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,340
Please take a look.

296
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,620
Your Majesty,

297
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,780
Your Majesty.

298
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,140
Did Your Majesty
not sleep well yesterday?

299
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,780
As long as the ration problem
of Lu County is not solved,

300
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,460
I would not be able to sleep well.

301
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,780
Even though
the Lu County issue is pressing,

302
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,300
Your Majesty must take care of yourself.

303
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,860
I know.

304
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,940
Let's continue.

305
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,140
Your Majesty,

306
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,340
Your Majesty,

307
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,660
Your Majesty.

308
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,620
Sorry I came late.

309
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,100
Is Eunuch Li not here today?

310
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,380
Reporting to Your Majesty.

311
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,140
Today is the twice-a-year

312
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,500
eunuch assessment day.

313
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,260
Eunuch Li

314
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,420
is getting assessed.

315
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,020
That's good.

316
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,660
It's time she suffers for a bit

317
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,220
and learn some rules.

318
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,340
Five chi six.

319
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Next.

320
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,940
They need to assess our heights too?

321
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,580
Of course,

322
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,420
- Next.
- a eunuch who is not tall enough

323
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,140
will be chased out of the palace.

324
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,750
Stand straight.

325
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,460
Five chi eight.

326
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,420
Next, please.

327
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,340
Stand properly.

328
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,460
Four chi eight.

329
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,220
Six chi two,

330
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,300
write it down.

331
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,620
Your turn.

332
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,380
Ready,

333
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,460
jump.

334
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,860
Measure to the hand.

335
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,660
Shouldn't you measure to the leg?

336
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,660
We're moving on to the last item.

337
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,460
Body check-up.

338
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,140
Body check-up?

339
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,020
Oh no, oh no.

340
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,980
Excuse me!

341
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,260
Eunuch Li,

342
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,660
what is it?

343
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,300
I...

344
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,220
I'm having a stomach ache.

345
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,180
Can I...

346
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,780
Go back to your position.

347
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,500
Eunuch Li,

348
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,740
You serve by His Majesty's side
all day long

349
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,340
yet your body is so weak.

350
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,900
We'll need to get it properly checked.

351
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,980
Let's start.

352
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,860
Lu Huan.

353
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,980
Yes.

354
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,460
Tell me,

355
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,580
what is the eunuch assessment for?

356
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,060
All eunuchs are to serve Your Majesty.

357
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,700
This assessment is naturally used

358
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,580
to make sure
the eunuchs serve Your Majesty better.

359
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,260
Since it's for my sake,

360
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,220
I should go take a look for myself,
am I right?

361
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

362
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,580
Let's go

363
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,700
to the Eunuch Quarters.

364
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,540
Your Majesty.

365
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,820
Let's go.

366
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,260
Your Majesty,

367
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,220
Your Majesty.

368
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,300
Is the Eunuch Assessment Day tomorrow?

369
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,460
Yes.

370
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,780
I've already informed Steward Huang.

371
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,980
I'd like to see

372
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,300
how would Qi Yan react.

373
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,660
[Qingyan Palace]

374
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,180
Your Majesty.

375
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,900
Prince Heqin,

376
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,420
what a coincidence!

377
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,620
I specifically came here
to see Your Majesty.

378
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,660
Is it so?

379
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,380
But I have some matters
to attend to today.

380
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,260
I'm afraid you came at the wrong time.

381
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,140
Is Your Majesty heading over
to the Eunuch Quarter?

382
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,220
Do I need to report to you

383
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,300
wherever I'm going?

384
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,580
I heard

385
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,220
that the Eunuch Assessment has included

386
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,180
a new item, which is a body check-up.

387
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,940
Here I thought Your Majesty would want
to join in the fun.

388
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,740
Your Majesty,

389
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,780
this is the first time I heard

390
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,100
that the Eunuch Assessment

391
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,700
has included a body check-up.

392
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,860
What does Prince Heqin know about this?

393
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,300
What is Your Majesty afraid
of others knowing?

394
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,020
I don't have time to play
the guessing game with you.

395
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,620
I have something else to do.

396
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,940
I'll leave now.

397
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,500
Are you not interested to find out

398
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,780
about Eunuch Li too?

399
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,860
Immediately summon Li Mengmeng

400
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,180
to the Imperial Study Room.

401
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,180
Yes.

402
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,540
Chancellor Cui.

403
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,500
Chancellor Cui,

404
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,620
we shall take our leave now.

405
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,740
So,

406
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,540
what is it?

407
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,660
Chancellor Cui,

408
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,820
look here.

409
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,980
Do you recognize him?

410
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,940
Isn't it the little eunuch

411
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,300
that's serving by His Majesty's side?

412
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,460
He's not a mere eunuch.

413
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,980
Here!

414
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,060
Chancellor Cui,

415
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,540
take a look.

416
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,740
Doesn't she look familiar?

417
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,060
Okay,

418
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,580
stop being secretive.

419
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,900
Just say it.

420
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,340
Isn't this...

421
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,220
Isn't this

422
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,580
the Emissary Xiao
who was praying for rain?

423
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,500
This is the

424
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,820
Emissary Xiao that has disappeared.

425
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,460
It is Emissary Xiao.

426
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,860
Why does this Emissary

427
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,620
constantly

428
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,420
hide by His Majesty's side?

429
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,060
Pay respect to the Empress Dowager.

430
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Please stand up.

431
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,420
Pay respect to the con...

432
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,780
Empress Dowager,

433
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,980
what happened to Consort Wan?

434
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,220
Wan just did a body check-up.

435
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,100
She has not sleep

436
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,860
with Yan yet.

437
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,460
This is my fault.

438
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,660
It's my fault

439
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,380
that I doted on Yan too much

440
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,860
to allow
such a ridiculous thing to happen.

441
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,060
I will get this straightened out.

442
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,180
Empress Dowager,

443
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,580
I came here this time
to share something important.

444
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,340
I've investigated and found out

445
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,380
that the reason why the consort
has yet to sleep with the emperor

446
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,420
is because there's a demon

447
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,100
bewitching His Majesty.

448
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,620
What do you mean?

449
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,780
Empress Dowager, do you still remember?

450
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,980
At the rain praying ritual,

451
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,300
Emissary Xiao suddenly appeared.

452
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,220
He said that he's an emissary.

453
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,260
But ever since his appearance,

454
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,500
the Qi Kingdom drought problem
has not been alleviated.

455
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,980
Thus, I believe that

456
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
he's a pretentious demon.

457
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,780
He's now serving by His Majesty's side

458
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,940
under the pretense of Eunuch Li

459
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,420
and his goal is to seduce His Majesty.

460
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,380
Forgive me, Empress Dowager.

461
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,660
I remembered something.

462
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,020
Say it.

463
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,420
I remember
on the day of the consummation,

464
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,220
Eunuch Li was also in the inner palace.

465
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,540
I saw with my own eyes

466
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,740
that Eunuch Li came out from there.

467
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,420
Shi Tao

468
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,100
Your Highness.

469
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,980
Empress Dowager,

470
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,700
this has nothing to do with anyone else.

471
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,420
Noble Consort!

472
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,900
Bring Eunuch Li to me.

473
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,900
Yes.

474
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,180
Eunuch Li is here.

475
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,980
Come here.

476
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,740
Come here.

477
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,740
Eunuch Li,

478
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,300
have you heard of a story

479
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
in the palace?

480
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,860
A young eunuch had entered the palace
without being cleansed.

481
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,420
Later on, he was found out.

482
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,620
And then what happened?

483
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,820
What happened?

484
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,900
Of course he was cleansed after.

485
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,820
Remove your clothes.

486
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,060
Remove them!

487
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,260
Quickly!

488
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,500
Stop dilly-dallying.

489
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,740
Lu Huan is here

490
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
and he's waiting outside.

491
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,220
Steward Lu,

492
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,980
what brings you here?

493
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,980
Why?

494
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,740
Can I not be here?

495
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,020
No, no.

496
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,380
Where is Eunuch Li?

497
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,940
His Majesty is looking for him.

498
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,180
Steward Lu,

499
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,740
Eunuch Li's body check-up
is not done yet.

500
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,100
Please wait a while more.

501
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,980
You're saying that His Majesty
has to wait longer?

502
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,020
How dare you!

503
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,260
No, no!

504
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,860
Quickly!

505
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,540
Bring Eunuch Li here!

506
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,060
Yes.

507
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,780
What are you doing here, Steward Lu?

508
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,260
Granny Sun,

509
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,420
why are you here?

510
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,620
Under the will of the Empress Dowager,

511
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,220
I'm here to summon Eunuch Li.

512
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,260
Please come with me,

513
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,140
Eunuch Li.

514
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,980
Were you the one
who included the body check-up?

515
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,500
Yes.

516
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,580
You've previously caused Minister Li
to be exiled to Xi Mi

517
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,220
and now you want to harm Eunuch Li?

518
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,100
Qi Su,

519
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,260
what are you trying to do?

520
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,220
I only want to remind you

521
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,740
on what you should do,

522
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,220
and what you shouldn't.

523
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,660
Is it your concern

524
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,380
that I have one more person serving me?

525
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,860
Your Majesty can have a Eunuch Li,

526
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,660
Eunuch Wang or Eunuch Bai

527
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,340
for all I care.

528
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,580
But this person cannot be a woman.

529
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,740
The Noble Consort
has not borne a child yet.

530
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,900
If a woman of unknown origin

531
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,100
were to appear by your side now,

532
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,100
what would that make the Noble Consort?

533
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,180
The Noble Consort?

534
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,380
You have no right to worry about her.

535
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,260
Qi Yan.

536
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,180
You knew

537
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,580
that Wan and I like each other,

538
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,580
yet you decided to marry her

539
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,100
and make her the laughingstock
of the palace.

540
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,540
And now serving by your side

541
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,180
is a woman who pretends to be an eunuch.

542
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,660
If you're going to continue
with this ridiculous act,

543
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,380
don't blame me for hurting the eunuch.

544
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,500
What can you do?

545
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,140
Eunuch Li is my subordinate,

546
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,620
it's none of your business.

547
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,820
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

548
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,420
Emissary Xiao,

549
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,580
we meet again

550
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,740
after the ritual.

551
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,780
What are you saying?

552
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
I don't understand.

553
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,740
You're familiar with these, aren't you?

554
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,660
How dare you lie in front
of the Empress Dowager.

555
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,900
Say it!

556
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,740
Why did you pretend to be an emissary

557
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,860
and now

558
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,940
you're pretending to be an eunuch
serving His Majesty's side.

559
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,620
What are your intentions?

560
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm innocent,

561
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,260
I really am.

562
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,740
Empress Dowager, I'm innocent.

563
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,940
This is bad.

564
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,020
I'm really done for this time.

565
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,500
Empress Dowager,

566
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,020
I have no choice

567
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,540
but to hide my identity
to serve His Majesty.

568
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,820
It's because on the day of the ritual,

569
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,180
I...

570
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
I noticed

571
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,780
that the emperor has some sort
of bad aura enveloping him

572
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,740
thus I stayed back

573
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,580
to eliminate his misfortunes.

574
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,180
What nonsense!

575
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,260
Did you think that you
can manipulate the Empress Dowager

576
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
like what you did with His Majesty?

577
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,380
Empress Dowager,

578
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,660
this person is ominous,

579
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,820
don't believe a word he said.

580
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,140
His Majesty is the son of the heaven.

581
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,420
How is it possible
that he's surrounded by a bad aura?

582
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,220
You're just making things up.

583
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,820
Do you have proof?

584
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,580
I implore that the Empress Dowager
bring His Majesty here

585
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,780
and I'll demonstrate it.

586
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,260
Empress Dowager,

587
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,860
he's just using you

588
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,500
to summon His Majesty here
to save himself.

589
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,580
You must not fall into his trap.

590
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,380
Empress Dowager,

591
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,940
this person pretended
to be the Emissary,

592
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,500
manipulated the people

593
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
and prevented His Majesty
from consummating.

594
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,500
It should be a death penalty.

595
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,860
Empress Dowager,

596
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,500
we should send him to prison

597
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,300
and I'll interrogate him myself.

598
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,260
Once the truth is out,

599
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,500
he'll be beheaded immediately.

600
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,020
We'll just follow
Chancellor Cui's advice.

601
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,620
The Empress Dowager is wise.

602
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,180
Say it,

603
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,260
who instructed you

604
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,820
to suddenly appear

605
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,780
in the rain praying ritual?

606
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,580
And who instructed you

607
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,340
to prevent His Majesty
from consummating?

608
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,340
I've said it many times.

609
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,140
No one.

610
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,820
There's really no one.

611
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,180
You're really stubborn.

612
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,580
Wake him up!

613
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,420
You've been in the palace for so long,

614
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,820
do you know what is the lingering death?

615
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,620
I'll tell you now.

616
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,540
It means I'll use this knife

617
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,900
to cut off

618
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,740
your body bit by bit

619
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,020
till you wish you were dead.

620
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,220
I want to see His Majesty.

621
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,340
Do you think you can see His Majesty

622
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,380
whenever you want to?

623
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,900
Say it!

624
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,140
Who is the instigator?

625
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,060
There's really no one!

626
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,100
There isn't!

627
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,260
Alright,

628
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,420
then let's start with your face.

629
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,940
