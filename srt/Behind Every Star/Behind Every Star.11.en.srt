1
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,953
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,996
"Dad, why…"

3
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,791
"Dad, why don't…"

4
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,794
What's wrong? Is it not going well?

5
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,629
EPISODE 11

6
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,672
No.

7
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,839
I'm a little stuck.

8
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,010
"Dad, why don't you take me for who I am?"

9
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,472
"No matter whom I like,
I'm still your son."

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,557
Scene 42, right?

11
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,018
Do you have my lines memorized?

12
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,479
When I first got into acting,

13
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,108
if we messed up a line,
we had to reshoot the whole scene.

14
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,151
We didn't have editing back then.

15
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,987
So it wasn't just up to me.

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,240
No, if my partner got it wrong,
we all failed together.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,868
That's why I memorized
my partners' lines too.

18
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,582
We had to know our work inside out.

19
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,959
That was real acting.

20
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,007
Goodness, I'm babbling about the old days.

21
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,217
It's all right.

22
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,222
You're all set.

23
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,348
Okay.

24
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,563
Try memorizing your partner's lines too.

25
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,106
It'll help.

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,275
Okay.

27
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,863
I'm on set right now.

28
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,616
I'll have someone send you
Kang Hee-sun's profile.

29
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,783
Okay.

30
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,452
And I emailed you a video too.

31
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,786
Mr. Lee.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,330
I'm sorry. Let me call you back.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,248
Hello.

34
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,084
How are you feeling, sir?

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,171
About scene 40. As you said,

36
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,049
a suit will be better than pajamas
to depict his emotions--

37
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,717
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,636
Sorry?

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,056
This woman is telling me to get changed.

40
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,682
Mr. Lee?

41
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,517
I don't know who you are,

42
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,978
but you shouldn't say
such things to a stranger.

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,358
What's wrong, Mr. Lee?
She's Director Lee Chan.

44
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,319
He must have mistaken you
with that new hairstyle.

45
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,612
Right?

46
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,741
I'm tired. I need to go home and sleep.

47
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,243
Sorry? Mr. Lee.

48
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,833
It's not Alzheimer's disease.

49
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,545
You recently had a slight stroke, right?

50
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,757
You're feeling some aftereffects from it.

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,801
You'll be fine after some time.

52
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,388
See? I told you it was nothing.

53
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,889
You fret over nothing.

54
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,516
Let's go.

55
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,892
One second, Mr. Lee.

56
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,436
Is there anything we should be careful of?

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,398
Goodness. Eat all three meals.

58
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,734
Walk often. Sleep well. It's so obvious.

59
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,152
Isn't that so, Doctor?

60
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,779
Yes, you're right.

61
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,866
But it might take a few more weeks
until you're fully recovered.

62
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,161
Meanwhile, your sense of time
may become mixed up,

63
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,914
and you may experience disorientation.

64
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,422
She said it wasn't a big deal,
so don't make an ordeal out of this.

65
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,593
And especially Jang Myung-aeh.
You must keep it a secret from her.

66
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,679
Okay? She'll be jolly to know.

67
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,931
I told you that she left the agency.

68
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,350
-Don't you remember, Mr. Lee?
-What?

69
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,937
Yes, right. I remember.

70
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,431
Do you want to have lunch together?

71
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,059
Are you talking to me?

72
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,813
Why?

73
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,149
I put in a good word for you
with President Koo.

74
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,568
You know I have his trust, right?

75
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,579
What do you think

76
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,082
about calling Eun-gyul to join us?

77
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,221
Cheer up, Hyun-joo!

78
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,724
<i><font color="white">I thought you were leaving the agency.</font></i>

79
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,810
I thought you'd leave and start a new one.

80
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,146
Right, you no longer have a financier.

81
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,273
I told him to stay.

82
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,985
Director Ma is the pillar of Method.
We can't do without him.

83
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,781
I want to create a team
to oversee production.

84
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,908
We'll be co-producing for a while,

85
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,744
but one day,
we'll create self-produced works.

86
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,121
We'll need a leader for that.

87
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,916
Someone competent and experienced.

88
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,421
How did it go?

89
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,510
The investors are saying
Mr. Lee should leave the production.

90
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,015
But the director hopes
he manages to get through this.

91
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,560
She's currently
shooting the scenes that exclude him.

92
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,311
This is troublesome.

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,939
We're the co-producers,

94
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,984
so it'll be awkward for us
if he leaves the production.

95
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,571
I think he should take a break.

96
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,406
He says he's okay,

97
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,074
but if he gets any worse--

98
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,076
But the doctor said he'll be fine.

99
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,037
Then let's keep an eye on him.

100
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,456
He wouldn't want
to leave the production like this.

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,543
What do you think, Ms. Chun?

102
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,463
I don't think it's an easy decision.

103
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,676
And you're right. Mr. Lee
may not want to leave the production.

104
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,597
Also, the ad offer Ko Eun-gyul got
involves this film too.

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,724
So this is tricky.

106
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,393
Here's the verdict.

107
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,854
We should let Mr. Lee continue the film.

108
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,733
Also, let's keep this quiet
from the reporters.

109
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,610
You're all awful.

110
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,362
Of all people, this is Mr. Lee Soon-jae.

111
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,905
Aren't you concerned for him?

112
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,869
How can you only discuss
ads, investors, and money?

113
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,754
Everyone treats me differently,

114
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,214
just because I'm Director Ma's daughter.

115
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,552
It's not like anything changes.

116
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,765
They say the position makes the person.

117
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,141
Like in the film <i><font color="white">Masquerade</font></i>.

118
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,353
Once that commoner sat on the throne,
he became King.

119
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,231
Although Director Ma is my father,

120
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,193
I'm still just So Hyun-joo.

121
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,407
Like how we find out later
that the lead role is a clone,

122
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,995
and the clone still argues
that he's a human with a warm heart?

123
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,624
<i><font color="white">Blade Runner</font></i>?

124
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,211
-You're good.
-I love that film.

125
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,589
See? Look at how you know
all these films by heart.

126
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,384
This industry is perfect for you.

127
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,803
Stay strong.

128
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,596
They'll talk now,

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,183
but people don't really care
about other people's business.

130
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,228
Thank you, Jin-hyeok.

131
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,065
In that case,

132
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,902
join my team
once I become the team manager.

133
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,448
I'll think about it.

134
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,911
GOURMET CRUNCHY AND CHEWY
SWEET AND SOUR PORK

135
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,835
The freshly fried
crunchy and chewy sweet and sour pork!

136
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,629
Mom! I'll be the cook on weekends.

137
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,090
I'm glad I listened to you, Ms. Chun.

138
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,092
Much classier than the <i><font color="white">mukbang</font></i> concept.

139
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,263
Ms. Chun, why don't you join my company?

140
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,391
-Hello.
-Hello.

141
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,976
-Hello.
-Hello.

142
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,936
-Hello.
-Hello.

143
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,312
EMPHASIZE A WARM FAMILY SCENE

144
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,064
DRAFT A

145
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,025
Next.

146
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,279
DRAFT B

147
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,450
A FUN AND LIVELY SCENE

148
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,743
GOURMET CRUNCHY AND CHEWY
SWEET AND SOUR PORK

149
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,167
It's chewy yet crunchy.

150
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,676
What do you think?

151
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,888
I think this <i><font color="white">mukbang</font></i> concept
fits this product better.

152
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,060
This is great.

153
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,645
What does the production crew think?

154
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,439
-No?
-I love it!

155
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,899
-It's great.
-I love it.

156
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,942
That was trendy.

157
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,278
We're an entertainment agency,
not a food company.

158
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,282
Would people notice our actor
if he only ate without a single line?

159
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,493
What's wrong with <i><font color="white">mukbang</font></i>? It's trendy.

160
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,661
A successful commercial helps the company,

161
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,830
which helps our actor.

162
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,707
What about the actor's image?

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,126
Hello.

164
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,214
Is this industry a joke to you?

165
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,176
Right.

166
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,971
How come you had no idea your associate
was your boss's daughter for three months?

167
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,019
You put on a con act
when I asked you to get Kim Ji-hoon.

168
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,230
Then you insisted
on keeping Daniel Henney,

169
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,689
but let him slip away.

170
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,818
You're all talk and no action.

171
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,611
This is why I have to step in.

172
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,724
Hey, Mr. Kim.

173
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,687
Hee-sun.

174
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,899
Why is your hair wet after rehearsal?

175
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,987
Well, it's…

176
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,446
This thing happened.

177
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,491
I'm so tired.

178
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm completely drained.

179
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,663
What? Why?

180
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,915
We practiced the poses too.

181
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,587
The film will be much more shocking
than the original draft.

182
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,297
Shocking?

183
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,882
In which scenes?

184
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:17,051
You can see it for yourself later.
You'll be so surprised.

185
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,304
Goodness.

186
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,431
Hee-sun.

187
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,308
You need to be careful

188
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,352
if the script is modified
and the director asks you to do things

189
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,479
that weren't part of the original script--

190
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,440
Like what kind of things?

191
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,318
Dirty scenes?

192
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,280
-No, that's not what I meant.
-Gosh.

193
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,909
Is that Oh Hun?

194
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,411
DIRECTOR OH HUN
HEE-SUN, DID YOU GET HOME SAFELY?

195
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,580
He's unbelievable.

196
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,916
He's texting an actress at this hour?

197
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,294
Hee-sun, where are you going?

198
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,880
You're not going to see Hun, are you?

199
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,508
Hee-sun.

200
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,186
<i><font color="white">Finally,</font></i>

201
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,064
I've chosen the team manager
for the Talent Development Team.

202
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,570
I gave it a lot of thought.
wh I hire an experienced outsider?

203
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,530
And I keep thinking,

204
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,034
it should be someone
who knows Method Entertainment well.

205
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,373
Now, let's all celebrate.

206
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,458
Congratulations, Jin-hyeok.

207
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,754
Congratulations, Ms. So Hyun-joo.

208
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,967
Did you apply as well?

209
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,928
No, I didn't apply.

210
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,597
I trust actions over fancy words.

211
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:49,268
And Hyun-joo has displayed
her competence through her actions.

212
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,312
She has a keen eye for talent.

213
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,066
She saw potential in an actor
that none of us did,

214
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,442
albeit missing out on him.

215
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,947
On top of that, she kept a big secret

216
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,448
for three months.

217
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,993
Then why did you hold interviews?

218
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,662
She's only been with us
as a trainee for three months.

219
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,623
Right, I said I'd make
the final call back then.

220
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,625
You didn't say anything about it, so…

221
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,502
Anyway, congratulations.

222
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,504
Talent Development Team Manager,
Ms. So Hyun-joo.

223
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,219
Good luck.

224
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,393
Congrats, Manager So.

225
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,659
Jin-hyeok. Hey.

226
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,421
I really didn't know. I just found out.

227
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,757
While shooting <i><font color="white">Memories of Murder</font></i>,

228
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,342
Park Hae-il kept asking
Director Bong Joon-ho

229
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,095
whether he was really the culprit or not.

230
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,264
-Jin-hyeok.
-Shut up and listen.

231
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,935
Director Bong told him
to act believing that he was innocent.

232
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,646
But he thought to himself,

233
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,149
"No matter how much you feign innocence,

234
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,651
people will despise you."

235
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,781
President Koo decided this alone.
I never said I wanted to do it.

236
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,824
You never wanted to be a team manager?

237
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,951
-Can you say that with complete honesty?
-Yes!

238
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,791
What about your dad?
I'm sure you told him.

239
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,875
No.

240
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,922
I said I wanted to join
the new team, but--

241
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:45,301
See? Director Ma used his influence
to make his daughter a team manager.

242
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,471
You acted so nice to my face,
then you backstab me.

243
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,974
You must have enjoyed it.

244
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,518
What?

245
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,561
Jin-hyeok.

246
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,273
Here.

247
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,275
My blood and sweat.

248
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,445
-Goodness.
-Jin-hyeok.

249
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,738
Jin-hyeok.

250
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,837
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,632
-For what?
-Everything.

252
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,678
That I couldn't tell you
Director Ma was my dad.

253
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,390
That I kept it from you.

254
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,102
I'm sorry for everything.

255
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,815
You still have no idea what you did wrong.

256
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,359
Sorry?

257
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,947
You shouldn't be apologizing
about not telling me about your dad.

258
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,533
You should be sorry

259
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,287
for coming between Daniel and Ye Min-su
to protect Director Ma.

260
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,168
If you're an agent,
the actor must come first no matter what.

261
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,586
Don't you think?

262
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,966
You have no right
to call yourself an agent.

263
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,859
Mr. Lee, hello.

264
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,402
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

265
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,279
Mr. Lee, what brings you here?

266
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,448
Let's go inside. I have to talk to you.

267
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,699
Sure. This way, please.

268
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,374
Wang Tae-ja and I go back 30 years.

269
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,419
It was before I had the role
of Dae-bal's father.

270
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,796
Let's see.

271
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,551
The first time I was in a TV drama was

272
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,012
the year 1957.

273
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,597
Goodness.

274
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,266
It's already been over 60 years.

275
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,060
It's been that long already.

276
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,941
I never once walked away from a project.

277
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,694
I always did my best
and finished each production.

278
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,533
I'd like to ask for your help
so I can finish shooting this film.

279
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,455
I want to leave behind a positive legacy.

280
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,457
Please help me protect my 60-year career

281
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,962
so I don't have any slip-ups
until the end.

282
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,883
Mr. Lee.

283
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,428
You need to go for occasional checkups
while shooting the film.

284
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,889
I'm fine. You don't have to worry.

285
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,862
Hello.

286
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,657
We've met before. My name is Koo Hae-jun.

287
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,325
I know you.

288
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,161
The one who kicked out
Director Jang Myung-aeh.

289
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,788
It seems you're the type

290
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,498
that throws people away
when they're no use.

291
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,625
So, are you going to throw me away too?

292
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,378
No.

293
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,963
No, sir. Don't say that.

294
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,800
Whether it be an old object
or an old person,

295
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,510
they all have their uses.

296
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,681
Failing to realize that
shows the shortcomings of your abilities.

297
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,726
The founder of this agency, Wang Tae-ja,

298
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,187
had an uncanny ability to perceive people.

299
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,399
-I'll be going then.
-Yes, sir.

300
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,234
Take care, sir.

301
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,246
He looks healthy.

302
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,623
I won't have to worry.

303
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,813
Let's have a drink.

304
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,905
-Mr. Lee Soon-jae.
-Yes.

305
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,824
He and Director Jang Myung-aeh
were like sworn enemies,

306
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,577
but I guess he feels bad that she left.

307
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,329
I'm sure he does.

308
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,457
So why was their relationship so bad?

309
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,542
It's been like that since we came.

310
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,338
I'm sure it's something we don't know,
something between the elders.

311
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,131
Maybe.

312
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,842
I suddenly remembered.

313
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,094
It was

314
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,389
when we just started here.

315
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,641
It was a director of a radio show

316
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,185
or someone like that
who called us bag keepers,

317
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,521
so President Wang completely lost it.

318
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,731
-Do you remember?
-The bag keeper incident.

319
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,858
We had no idea what it meant, but he went,

320
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,860
"Apologize to my associates!"

321
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,905
-He grabbed him by the collar and got mad.
-I remember.

322
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,532
-It was cool of him.
-Man.

323
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,908
-He was cool.
-Right.

324
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,369
Back then,
I wanted to be an agent like him.

325
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,414
Yes. Someone their juniors can look up to.

326
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,042
We lived so diligently
with that one thought in mind.

327
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,044
We did.

328
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,343
Dating. Marriage. Love.

329
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,556
I set aside all of that
and just pushed forward.

330
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:29,562
But these days, I'm starting to think
if I had to make such choices.

331
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,940
It feels like I'm in a thick fog,

332
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,985
and lost all sense of direction.

333
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,946
Like I've lost my way and I'm wandering.

334
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,573
That's what it feels like.

335
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,370
That's exactly how I feel right now.

336
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,580
Yes.

337
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,291
Both for Mr. Lee Soon-jae

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,543
and Hee-sun.

339
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,171
Nothing is going right.

340
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,841
I wonder if I deserve to be an agent.

341
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,050
Me too.

342
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,636
I feel like that too.

343
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,900
No one believes that I have the talent.

344
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,360
Don't you trust your own talent?

345
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,237
I do believe in it.

346
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,864
That's all you need.

347
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,159
You trust it, and I'll trust you.
That's all there is to it then.

348
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,245
Cut!

349
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,415
Excellent. I love it.

350
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,002
-Mr. Lee, are you okay?
-Next scene.

351
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,337
I'm fine.

352
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,090
If you're tired, you can take a rest.
Let me know anytime.

353
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,509
It's fine.

354
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,719
Just don't interrupt my flow.

355
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,015
Mr. Lee, hello.

356
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,684
My name is Lee Myeong-ju of SY Pictures.

357
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,145
Yes, hello.

358
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,733
SY Pictures is co-producing our film.

359
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,693
She came by to greet you.

360
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,862
You're a very important person.

361
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,113
Mr. Lee.

362
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,409
Please excuse me. It's time for makeup.

363
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,954
I need lots of it at this age.

364
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,583
Keep it up!

365
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,213
He's much more diligent
and passionate than me at his age.

366
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,424
Exactly. He's so wonderful.

367
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,595
Right.

368
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,557
How do you think
Director Oh Hun's film will turn out?

369
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,352
I'm not sure. Is there a problem?

370
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,188
Well, the investment committee asked.

371
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,818
It's an art film, so they were concerned.

372
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,653
I see.

373
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,947
I don't mean to pry.

374
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,282
Don't worry about it then.

375
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,161
You know how Director Oh Hun's films
are quite intense,

376
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:55,457
and this one might be quite tricky
for the Korea Media Rating Board.

377
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,293
Because of the ratings?

378
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,502
Yes.

379
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,214
It all depends on the film.

380
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,467
It may ignite passion within the audience

381
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,263
just like <i><font color="white">Fifty Shades of Grey</font></i>.

382
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,767
If that was rated R,
Director Oh Hun's movie is rated XYZ.

383
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,103
Rated XYZ?

384
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,813
-Come this way.
-What?

385
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,481
Why?

386
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,492
Yes, Director Lee.

387
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,953
Sorry? Without any prior notice?

388
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,165
I just heard the news too.

389
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,502
The investors want to
directly check on Mr. Lee's condition.

390
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,505
One of their staff members
will come and check if he's okay.

391
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,965
Check? Check for what?

392
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,009
So what if they check him?

393
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,095
If he's unfit, what will they do?

394
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,763
This puts me in a tough spot too.

395
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,140
Do you think I want to do this mid-shoot?

396
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,025
Please explain it to Mr. Lee.

397
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,869
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

398
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:59,081
Don't say that.
There's no reason for you to apologize.

399
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,627
You can relax and talk to them like this.
I'll be by your side.

400
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,338
Don't worry. I'm completely fine.

401
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,591
Go now. I have to read the script.

402
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,718
Gosh.

403
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,470
Goodness.

404
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,016
Excuse me.

405
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,560
-Let me ask you for a favor.
-Sure, Mr. Lee.

406
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,228
Where's my agent?

407
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,147
Mr. Kim Jung-don?

408
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,566
-He's right there.
-No, not him.

409
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,860
The one who's in charge of me.
Wang Tae-ja.

410
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,532
And where's my field manager?

411
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,786
Her name is Jang Myung-aeh.

412
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,627
<i><font color="white">Your call cannot be connected.
You will be connected to…</font></i>

413
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,753
DIRECTOR JANG MYUNG-AEH

414
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,379
MANAGER KIM JUNG-DON

415
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,381
What happened?

416
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,300
He's still the same.

417
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,054
He locked himself in the waiting room
and hasn't moved an inch.

418
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,056
Mr. Lee, are you all right?

419
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,142
Let me try.

420
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,019
Mr. Lee.

421
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,063
-He must be quite confused.
-Please talk to me.

422
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,983
<i><font color="white">Someone even told him
that President Wang passed away.</font></i>

423
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,321
He said he won't come out
unless Director Jang is here.

424
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,866
<i><font color="white">The investors want to send someone,
and the shoot is on hold.</font></i>

425
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,034
<i><font color="white">What do I do?</font></i>

426
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,829
Why is he looking for her?
I thought they had bad blood.

427
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,955
<i><font color="white">Tell me about it.</font></i>

428
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,791
I have to stay here,
so please do something from your side.

429
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,960
<i><font color="white">-Okay?</font></i>
-Okay, hang up for now.

430
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,297
What's wrong?

431
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,132
You heard him.

432
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,218
Mr. Lee won't shoot without Director Jang.

433
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,764
Then you can pick her up
and go to the set.

434
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,140
Don't you know her address?

435
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,101
Why would she help
after you kicked her out?

436
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,187
Then should I reinstate her?

437
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,731
Hey!

438
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,487
What do you take us for?

439
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,907
Do you think we'll do whatever you want
because you pay us?

440
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,036
The original owner
of that seat you're in right now

441
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,583
gave us unconditional support and
allowed us to take pride in our work.

442
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,126
So everyone respected him.

443
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,964
Do you think anyone here
thinks of you like that?

444
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,343
Some might humor you
and be afraid of you for your money.

445
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,055
Someone sent by the investors
will arrive on set very soon.

446
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,975
If Mr. Lee stays like that,
the film will get scrapped.

447
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,853
Then you'll end up losing
your most cherished possession,

448
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,563
your money.

449
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,697
<i><font color="white">Mr. Lee, please open the door.</font></i>

450
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,950
I understand your confusion.
Allow me to explain.

451
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,244
Is Jang Myung-aeh here yet?

452
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,874
She's on her way right now.

453
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,044
I have something to say to her.

454
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,505
If you tell me, then I'll relay it to her.

455
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,673
Please open the door.

456
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,800
The one the investors sent is here.

457
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:39,968
What?

458
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,888
I'll go explain the situation.

459
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,518
Hey.

460
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,812
Why are you all standing around?

461
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,072
These days, you get
a hearty meal on set too.

462
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,450
It's improved a lot compared to the past.

463
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,161
There was no such thing
as a food truck back then.

464
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:10,832
When our seniors bought us food,
we were grateful and ate.

465
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,501
Things sure have gotten better.

466
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,503
Of course, it'll probably get even better.

467
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,671
Yes.

468
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,343
I heard you were a bit ill.

469
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,887
Have you been receiving treatment?

470
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,264
Of course.

471
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,433
Everyone around my age goes through this.

472
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,646
Mr. Lee, this could be uncomfortable,

473
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,648
but you have to be honest with me.

474
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,611
When you're on set,

475
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,490
have you ever
become forgetful or hazy at all?

476
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,666
I heard you suddenly said
you wouldn't continue shooting.

477
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,876
Why did you say that?

478
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,269
Mr. Lee.

479
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,856
What did you eat for lunch today?

480
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,651
The food truck menu.

481
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,613
The food truck menu?

482
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,698
Yes.

483
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,245
You don't remember?

484
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,207
No, I don't remember.

485
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,628
-All right.
-Of course, he doesn't know.

486
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:55,437
You always bring your own lunch box,

487
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,856
ever since <i><font color="white">Men of the Bath House</font></i>.

488
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,568
So of course, you don't know
what the food truck served.

489
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,780
Yes, since <i><font color="white">Men of the Bath House</font></i>. Right.

490
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,449
I've always packed my lunch since then.

491
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,992
I don't eat from the food truck.

492
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,787
I always eat my lunch box on set.

493
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,580
I see.

494
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,998
Who are you?

495
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,751
-Me? I'm--
-Jang Myung-aeh.

496
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,086
She's my agent.

497
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,127
We somehow managed today,
but the problem is tomorrow.

498
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,714
She'll come tomorrow
and watch you film all day long.

499
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,552
I might as well quit now.

500
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,056
I'm a huge nuisance
with my stubborn decision.

501
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,934
Did you call me here
to show how weak you've become?

502
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,355
Where's the spirit from that day
you made me break up with President Wang?

503
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,903
I was against your relationship
for your sake.

504
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,241
Tae-ja wasn't someone
who could make you happy.

505
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:41,251
I only found out a long time
after breaking up with him.

506
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,714
That you told President Wang
that you'd cut ties with him

507
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,340
if he kept dating me.

508
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,595
I resented you with all of my heart.

509
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,140
That was already 20 years ago.

510
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,018
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,020
I called you here to say that.

512
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,274
I wanted to apologize to you
before my memories start to fade.

513
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,534
Why do you say that?

514
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,246
You can continue your work on movies.

515
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,956
-Can I really?
-Yes.

516
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,209
What if I can't remember again?

517
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,711
I'll be by your side.

518
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,421
I am

519
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,882
your agent, Mr. Lee.

520
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,256
Director Jang.

521
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,967
Director Jang, you're here.

522
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,468
-We waited for you.
-Director Jang!

523
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,595
Director Jang!

524
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,430
-Goodness.
-Director Jang.

525
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,274
Congratulations on your return
to Method Entertainment.

526
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,570
Give her a hand!

527
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,324
I didn't think you would easily help us.

528
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,242
24 HOURS AGO

529
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,078
I'm sorry for barging in
and asking for help.

530
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,332
But you're the only one
who can look after Mr. Lee Soon-jae.

531
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,625
What do you want?

532
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,003
Reinstatement? A raise?

533
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,718
Fine.

534
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,761
I'll help.

535
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,847
However,

536
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,434
give me one good reason
to keep you as my boss.

537
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,438
You probably never thought of that.

538
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,858
You're good at discarding people,

539
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,277
but your skills
of winning people over? Zero.

540
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,281
I want to be a respectable boss.

541
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,828
Not someone who staff is afraid of,
but someone who is respected.

542
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,829
In order to do that,

543
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,415
I need you, Director Jang.

544
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,800
From now on, she's in charge

545
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,928
of finding writers, directors, and actors
for every new project.

546
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,098
Director Ma takes charge of production.
Director Jang, preproduction.

547
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,475
What do you think?

548
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,934
The best partners, right?

549
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,982
Your style completely changed
while you were away.

550
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,777
It's Kim Hee-sun's style
from <i><font color="white">Men of the Bath House</font></i>.

551
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,570
More like Mathilda.

552
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,488
Until now,

553
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:01,368
I had it easy thanks
to the connections I made over 20 years.

554
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,204
But from now on,

555
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:08,833
I'll prove why Method Entertainment

556
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,087
needs me.

557
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,049
A hand, everyone.

558
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:18,968
All right!

559
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,903
Come in.

560
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,500
Director Jang.

561
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,293
I'm…

562
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,255
You've apologized enough times.
You can stop now.

563
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,183
I heard everything.
It must've been tough for you.

564
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,185
Is it okay…

565
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,315
for me to still be here?

566
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,777
You would know best.

567
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,863
I should…

568
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,949
put this here.

569
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,370
You decide where you should be.

570
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,142
You look like a dad
who dotes on his daughter.

571
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,853
How did you hide it all along?

572
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,190
It must've been tough.

573
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,150
I'm sorry.

574
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,402
I couldn't even help.

575
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,740
You probably didn't have the chance,
with so many things going on.

576
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,455
I'll put together everything
about ongoing productions.

577
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,874
And put together
everything in your life too.

578
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,877
It's too late to regret
after losing it all.

579
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,421
Right the wrongs…

580
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,549
before it's too late.

581
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,238
I prefer the ones who are sly upfront

582
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,574
than those who stab others in the back.

583
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,496
Oh, my.

584
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,923
Ms. Sunny.

585
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,925
Will you be all right?

586
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,052
Director Jang holds her grudges forever.

587
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,146
Hello.

588
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,065
How may I help you?

589
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,192
Is Ms. Jang Myung-aeh here?

590
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,112
Yes, well… Director Jang.

591
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,197
This was delivered to you.

592
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,997
Who sent me this precious child?

593
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,126
<i><font color="white">Monstera albo epipremnum
pinnatum variegata</font></i>.

594
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,295
This is a rare species that's hard to get.

595
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,965
It was hard to get, but this is a token
of my apology. Please accept it.

596
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,466
Excuse me.

597
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,135
-This way, please.
-Sure.

598
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,888
-Please go slowly. Be careful.
-Of course.

599
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,277
I'm glad to have you back.

600
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,492
I couldn't find a place
with a better view.

601
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,997
There's something I always consider
when I need to make a choice.

602
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,541
When I die later,

603
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,921
would I regret this choice or not?

604
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,551
If I left Method now,

605
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,847
I knew I wouldn't die in peace
with this resentment in my heart.

606
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,228
Is there anything like that for you?

607
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,149
A decision in your life
you regretted the most.

608
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,745
What great weather to work overtime.

609
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,568
<i><font color="white">Pick up your mail.</font></i>

610
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,946
<i><font color="white">The passcode is 130835.</font></i>

611
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,414
What is it?

612
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:17,173
I was just in the area, passing by.

613
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:22,219
You know I jog here at this hour.

614
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,597
Yes.

615
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,350
Did you have something to say?

616
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,602
I do,

617
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,315
but now that we're face to face,

618
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,403
I don't know where to begin.

619
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,949
My thoughts are all jumbled.

620
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,408
Just say it.

621
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,786
I'll make sense of it.

622
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,546
I'm sorry.

623
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,594
I'm sorry for hurting you.

624
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,764
I'm sorry for using my work

625
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,227
as an excuse to demand
your unconditional understanding.

626
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:17,233
I thought about the one thing
I regret the most in my life,

627
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,902
and it was losing you.

628
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,451
Is that all?

629
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,041
Yes.

630
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,209
Okay.

631
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,294
Take care.

632
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,795
What I regret the most in my life is…

633
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,467
taking the case at Method Entertainment.

634
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,263
No.

635
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,599
Meeting you on that chat.

636
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,438
But…

637
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,526
I had this thought while I was running.

638
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,989
If I lose you again,

639
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,451
I'll probably regret it.

640
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,369
That came to mind.

641
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,503
So…

642
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,589
if we're going to

643
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,092
regret it either way,

644
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,677
then let's regret it as a couple.

645
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,684
If we don't regret anything, even better.

646
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,025
You won't. You'll never regret this.

647
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:37,540
It's a promise.

648
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,354
Hey, Hyun-joo.

649
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,361
I'd like to tell you something.

650
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,072
Will it take long? I have an engagement.

651
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,783
No, it won't take long.

652
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:14,952
What is it?

653
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:23,043
I don't think I can be the manager
of the Talent Development Team.

654
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,672
Why not?

655
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,549
I appreciate the offer,

656
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,303
but I want to assist my seniors
just as I'm doing now

657
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,513
and learn more about my work.

658
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:39,310
And I think Jin-hyeok would
make a better manager than me.

659
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,936
Did I take you the wrong way?

660
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,523
I thought you were ambitious.

661
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,776
I'm sorry.

662
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,988
Make your choice.

663
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,616
Take the position or quit.

664
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:55,576
What?

665
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,330
You easily give up
when presented with a chance.

666
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,250
Why should I keep an employee
that has no passion or spirit?

667
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,381
You'll either take the position or leave.

668
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,925
It's one or the other.

669
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:33,239
MOM, ARE YOU ASLEEP?

670
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,539
MOM

671
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,335
Mom, you weren't asleep?

672
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,087
<i><font color="white">Why aren't you asleep yet?</font></i>

673
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,714
Mom.

674
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,467
Things are

675
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,262
a little tough for me.

676
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,513
<i><font color="white">Why?</font></i>

677
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,933
<i><font color="white">Are people being harsh
because you were promoted?</font></i>

678
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,643
I have…

679
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,021
no idea what to do.

680
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:08,732
<i><font color="white">What about your dad…</font></i>

681
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,484

682
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,779

683
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,658

686
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:24,748
Okay.

687
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,420
I'll go to sleep now.

Mom…

691
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:30,731
The hospital said
there was nothing to be concerned about.

692
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,775
-Director Lee, you heard it too.
-Of course.

693
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,319
He's extra-passionate about this film too.

694
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,820
-Yes, he is.
-And--

695
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,155
There he is.

696
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,823
-Mr. Lee, you're here.
-Mr. Lee.

697
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,534
I kept you waiting, right?

698
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,080
We're almost done setting up,
so take a seat and give us a moment.

699
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,539
-I'm here again.
-Hello.

700
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,333
-Okay.
-Hello.

701
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,668
How are you feeling?

702
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,128
Great. I'm feeling great.

703
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,713
He looks fine, right?

704
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:58,467
Yes, he seems that way.
But we'll wait and see.

705
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,260
He practiced a lot too.

706
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,388
Sure.

707
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,809
-The first shot will be toward you.
-Okay.

708
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,143
Let's roll.

709
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,107
"Grandpa."

710
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,984
"Which memory makes
you feel the happiest?"

711
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,411
Sir, that's not the right scene.

712
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,038
"I once read in a book

713
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:32,251
that the older the memories are,
the more vivid they're remembered,

714
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,920
as if they happened yesterday."

715
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,055
Mr. Lee!

716
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,038
Nice angle.

717
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,957
Let's wrap it up and get rolling.

718
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,209
Let's get rolling already.

719
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,586
Let's get ready.

720
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:25,512
How could I oppose my father's will?

721
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,348
I don't think I can do that.

722
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,977
I cannot live without you, Sun-ae.

723
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,731
Without you…

724
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:38,650
You…

725
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,818
Hey!

726
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:45,699
"My life is meaningless."

727
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,243
Is that so tough to memorize?

728
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,246
I'm sorry.

729
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,916
-How many takes is that?
-I'm sorry.

730
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,670
Set it up again.

731
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,589
Let's take it from the top!

732
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,095
It must be tough.

733
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:12,267
Goodness, I was like you before.

734
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:13,393
That's right.

735
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:18,524
I was often scolded for missing my lines.

736
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:21,818
Why? The cost of film was expensive.

737
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:26,114
So the person making
the mistake feels awful.

738
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,368
But I won't give up.
I'm going to keep going.

739
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,578
Let me tell you a way.

740
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,956
Memorize every single line
including your partner's.

741
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,959
Then even if you miss one,

742
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,127
you can help each other
and get past the scene.

743
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,005
Mr. Lee Soon-jae.

744
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,925
Yes?

745
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,512
Let's roll again.

746
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,274
<i><font color="white">I cannot live without you, Sun-ae.</font></i>

747
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,778
<i><font color="white">Without you, my life is meaningless.</font></i>

748
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,159
Sir.

749
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,370
Sir.

750
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,543
Hello?

751
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,758
Did you already memorize my lines too?

752
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,179
He told me that

753
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:34,391
I must memorize my partner's lines
as well as mine.

754
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:37,311
That way, I can understand
the overall scene.

755
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,647
One second.

756
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:45,110
"Memories become more vivid over time

757
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,696
because it's painted again with memories."

758
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,740
Those are my lines.

759
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,200
Yes, I memorized your lines too, sir.

760
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,787
Everything? It's quite a lot.

761
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,582
You memorized all my lines too.

762
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,838
Were you practicing tomorrow's scene?

763
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:07,966
-See?
-All right, now.

764
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,926
Let's make the performance scene great.

765
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,013
Let's roll.

766
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,015
Let's begin!

767
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,560
Here we go.

768
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,395

did you say that on purpose?

00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,951
I was completely fooled by your act.

794
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,921
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

795
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,758
I was just worried.

796
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,968
It's not as dirty as you think.

797
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,514
We omitted the bedroom scenes.

798
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,017
-Really?
-It's Director Oh's goal

799
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,853
to make it look erotic without any nudity.

800
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,189
Those bastards!

801
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,233
Hey, what's wrong?

802
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,943
How could they do this to me?

803
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,529
The investors want to pull out.

804
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,906
The production
won't even pick up my calls.

805
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,908
All of a sudden? Why?

806
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,953
The investor committee said that my film…

807
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,375
was unspeakably provocative and lewd.

808
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,586
Wait, it's not true.

809
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,463
No, it's not.

810
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,133
Who could have said that to them?

811
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,425
Mr. Kim?

812
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:44,057
How can one condemn my film like this?

813
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,060
Hey, Hun. Calm down.

814
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,188
Let's look for another investor.

815
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,649
-Will you give up like this?
-No.

816
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,817
I am

817
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,902
done making films.

818
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,201
Director Oh! No, you can't do that!

819
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,627
So that was that.

820
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,674
I couldn't eat any cup noodles.

821
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,677
You put them up so high,
I couldn't reach them.

822
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,848
Anyway, that's that.

823
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,937
What about you?
Nothing special in particular?

824
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,732
Not really.

825
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,526
I just went to work,
did my job, and worked out.

826
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:38,570
Right.

827
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:44,242
I got rid of my TV at home.

828
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,539
When I would see actors on TV,
I kept thinking of you.

829
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:56,838
It kept reminding me of our breakup,

830
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,965
so it was a bit painful.

831
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,435
Je-suk?

832
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:12,729
Hey, my gosh.

833
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,856
I thought I saw someone familiar.

834
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:16,983
Why are you here?

835
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,860
I'm a regular here.

836
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:21,821
Right.

837
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,199
Sang-uk.

838
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,494
He's the new president of the agency.

839
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,583
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Sang-uk.

840
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,298
I'm Koo Hae-jun.

841
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:54,980
Won-jae.

842
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,899
Hello?

843
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:00,819
Yes, sir.

844
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:02,946
Okay.

845
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,937
BEHIND EVERY STAR

846
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,923
The host of the Busan International
Film Festival deserves a dress like this.

847
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:27,966
<i><font color="white">You're telling me she can't wear it?</font></i>

848
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,342
It was an update. I'm going to solve it!

849
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,344
<i><font color="white">I'm sure most dresses
have already been taken.</font></i>

850
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,680
I'm here today to see you, Eun-soo.

851
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,015
<i><font color="white">You absolutely ruined our marriage.</font></i>

852
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,517
<i><font color="white">I like you.</font></i>

853
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,769
<i><font color="white">When I find that jerk, he's dead meat.</font></i>

854
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,563
Hyun-joo.
Do you want to go to the US with me?

855
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,273
<i><font color="white">I won't ever be giving up.</font></i>

856
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,024
Please take good care of Hyun-joo.

857
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,277
<i><font color="white">She just mooches off celebrities.</font></i>

858
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,236
I can't do that with you.

859
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,779
<i><font color="white">Isn't that what you wanted?</font></i>

860
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:52,615
Achieving your goal
by whatever means necessary.

861
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,075
<i><font color="white">The opening ceremony starts soon.</font></i>

862
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,702
<i><font color="white">What do you mean, the dress is gone?</font></i>

863
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,537
