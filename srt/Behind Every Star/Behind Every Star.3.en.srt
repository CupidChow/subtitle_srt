00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,952
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,833
"Physical beauty disappears."

3
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,294
"It's a temporary possession."

4
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,797
"However, a beautiful heart

5
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,340
that enriches the soul…

EPISODE 3

7
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,094
…and the love in our hearts
will always be there."

8
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,182
"They only grow with the passing of time."

9
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:01,644
"The love in our hearts
will always be there."

10
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,563
-"They only--"
-"The love in our hearts

11
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,065
will always be there."

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,402
"They only grow with the passing of time."

13
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,446
Hello, ma'am.

14
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,325
Arthur Miller. I adore that playwright.

15
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,286
-It's Tennessee Williams.
-Are you an aspiring actress?

16
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,831
Yes, I also act on stage.

17
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,709
This is the play I'm in now.

18
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,961
Is that so?

19
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,380
There's still plenty of time.
I'll stop by sometime.

20
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,467
Those are the good days.

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,303
I was once like you, young lady.

22
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:40,099
My heart was full of dreams
to the point that it was overflowing.

23
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,769
-Gosh, those were the days.
-Welcome, Ms. Kim.

24
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,395
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

25
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,564
I should have gone to see you,
but something urgent came up.

26
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,484
Right. Won-jae, put it down. It's heavy.

27
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,111
I brought some marinated crab,

28
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,240
hairtail boiled in soy sauce,
and some radish kimchi.

29
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,325
You don't have to do this every time.

30
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,036
You need to eat right
no matter how busy you are.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,454
-Thank you.
-Sure.

32
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,248
-Okay, now.
-This way, ma'am.

33
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,750
-Goodness.
-Hello, Hyo-rim.

34
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,585
-What brings you here?
-Hello.

35
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,587
Why are you at the office?

36
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,798
-Director Ma wanted to see me.
-I see.

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,676
-I came to see Mr. Kim.
-I see.

38
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,636
If I had known, we could have carpooled.

39
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,680
-We should have.
-Your car is really nice.

40
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,225
Oh, my. Did you get a new outfit?
I haven't seen it before.

41
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,394
That's a nice color.

42
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,771
There's some leather too. It's cute.

43
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,316
Is there anything Mommy doesn't know?

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,694
You have an eye
for all the latest fashion trends.

45
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,738
-We should go shopping sometime.
-Let's do that, Mommy.

46
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,157
Just give me a date.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,408
Okay.

48
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,076
-Let's head inside.
-Sure.

49
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,829
-To your office, Mr. Kim?
-This way.

50
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,002
When will the shoot begin?

51
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,546
Early next year.
It's scheduled to air in September.

52
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,630
Okay.

53
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,340
How did you find the script?

54
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,719
It's been a while
since I've seen such a good script.

55
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,514
Since it's Ms. Kim So-hyun who wrote it,
I won't have to worry about the ratings.

56
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,724
Of course not.

57
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,894
Senior actors hardly get
any screen time these days,

58
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,606
but this is perfect for you to return
to TV with since you'll be the lead.

59
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,441
It's so much fun!

60
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,525
It's amazing, right?

61
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,194
She really went the length
to write a hit this time.

62
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,031
Are you sure I can play
a role in this drama?

63
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,534
Of course. She said you'd be welcome
anytime as long as you're okay with it.

64
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,120
It'll be a great opportunity for you.

65
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,164
A great opportunity, indeed.

66
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,333
It's about time
I resumed my acting career.

67
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,709
I think so too.

68
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,380
If you turn it down, people will think
you're only doing variety shows now.

69
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,507
Okay. Good work.

70
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,845
I'd like to schedule a meeting
with the director and the writer.

71
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,723
-Would that be okay?
-Of course, I'd love to.

72
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,602
Ms. Kim is rather picky
when it comes to casting.

73
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,438
Both the writer and the director
just adore you.

74
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,940
They said you'd be perfect.

75
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:56,152
They should be thanking me
since I found them their perfect actor.

76
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,528
You're right.

77
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,531
-Then I'll give you a call later.
-Okay.

78
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,411
And also, you can't tell anyone
that you've seen this script.

79
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,414
-That's great. It's perfect for me.
-No one else has seen it.

80
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,374
-It's top secret.
-And another thing…

81
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,459
I asked you over
because the script had to be

82
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,086
-kept confidential.
-I mean it.

83
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,837
I'll do a great job.

84
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,216
Fine. My lips are sealed.

85
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,636
-So who's playing the mother-in-law?
-Who's playing the daughter-in-law?

86
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,974
MY SON'S WOMAN

87
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,226
MY SON'S WOMAN

88
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,274
You said it was top secret.

89
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,820
I could have read it at home.

90
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,871
-Didn't you know about this?
-No, ma'am.

91
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,082
-Exactly, I thought it was--
-I'm back.

92
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,293
I checked with the production.

93
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,129
I got back to them late
because I was checking your schedule,

94
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,673
and they made an offer
to Hyo-rim in that while.

95
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,133
-I see.
-That's impossible.

96
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,927
I first talked to them months ago
for her to get this role--

97
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,804
In the end, isn't this for the better?

98
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,473
We can see you two in the same drama.

99
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,769
Is the writer okay with the two of us
starring in the same drama again?

100
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,315
Of course. I just talked to her,
and she was thrilled.

101
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,650
Really? That's great then.

102
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,943
This is great news, right?

103
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,488
I can't believe I'm starring in
another drama with you.

104
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,991
My gosh, what are the chances?

105
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,996
You lied about contacting them first.

106
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,042
Your goal was to have Ms. Kim Soo-mi
and Hyo-rim both cast in the same show.

107
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,376
That's right.

108
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,629
The production said
they were talking to Hyo-rim,

109
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,924
so I went to talk to the writer about
casting Ms. Kim and she said it was okay.

110
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,217
What's the problem?

111
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,511
How could you cut in like that?

112
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,430
I knew you'd make a fuss about it.

113
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,100
Then why didn't you tell me
that Hyo-rim had the role?

114
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,269
Because the script was confidential.

115
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,314
This is a huge project
that will be aired over multiple seasons.

116
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,358
We're going to have
two of our actors star in it.

117
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,486
Do you get what that means?

118
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,412
Get it together
if you want to save the company.

119
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,471
It's me. I have a favor to ask.

120
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,640
I wanted to introduce someone.

121
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,017
A woman? Hardly.

122
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,479
She's an agent.
She doesn't have a lot of experience,

123
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,940
but she's still a good kid.
She's smart and diligent.

124
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,274
"Actors."

125
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,904
If we don't max out the corporate card,
we won't be able to sleep peacefully.

126
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,573
Think about how much we suffer at work.

127
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,244
So I'm going to use up everything
and not even leave 100 won behind.

128
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,912
I'm going all out.

129
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,623
RECRUITING NEW OR EXPERIENCED AGENTS
ACTOR'S AGENT FOR HIRE

130
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,250
EUN-GYUL
A NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

131
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,253
I just don't get
why you're acting like this.

132
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,466
Can we meet up and talk?

133
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,957
-Director Ma.
-My gosh.

134
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,667
Do you need anything?

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,627
No, not really.

136
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,421
-I was looking for a script.
-Script…

137
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,798
No, it's all right.
I don't think it's here.

138
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,300
It's all right.

139
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,523
We're back.

140
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,943
I should've bought the croque monsieur.
I keep craving it.

141
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,361
Exactly.

142
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,072
-But the macarons here are excellent too.
-Indeed.

143
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,793
You had quite the feast.
Have you no conscience?

144
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,295
Thank you.

145
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,759
DIRECTOR MA TAE-OH

146
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,471
I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST TIME

147
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,722
Mr. Kim.

148
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,892
Director Yoon Jong-bin contacted us.

149
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,186
He wants one of our actors
to audition for him.

150
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,146
That's great. Who?

151
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,439
Well…

152
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,733
It's Hee-sun.

153
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,612
Kim Hee-sun? The Hee-sun we know?

154
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,114
Well…

155
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,410
Ms. Kang Hee-sun
is not signed as an actress with us.

156
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,205
No. Yes, that's right.

157
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,082
No, not at all.

158
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,668
In that case,
please call the audition off--

159
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,422
What did you just do?

160
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,550
It wasn't easy for me
to land that audition.

161
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,010
Can't you turn a blind eye just once?

162
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,804
Let me audition just once.

163
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,639
Can't I?

164
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,640
Please?

165
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,226
What were you thinking
when you told them that?

166
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,561
What if you get the part

167
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,146
and they find out
you aren't signed with us?

168
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,568
This is falsifying documentation.
This is fraud.

169
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,737
But I can always sign with you

170
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,156
once I get the part.

171
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,201
Says who? We have no intention
of signing a contract with you.

172
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,162
Why not?

173
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,331
I mean, we don't even know
how good you are.

174
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,335
Exactly. You haven't even seen me act.

175
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,380
I asked you to come
to watch my play in your free time,

176
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,756
but nobody came.

177
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,968
There isn't a single person in this agency
who shows me any interest.

178
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,179
You all just ignore me
no matter how hard I try!

179
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,264
One second.

180
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,642
Will you lower your voice?

181
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,936
Don't push me around.
You're not even my agent.

182
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,980
What are you talking about?

183
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,523
Agents never push clients around.

184
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,777
I'm sorry for lying about
being signed to the agency, okay?

185
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,613
You don't seem sorry at all.

186
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,411
But no one helps me around here.

187
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,958
The actors here have agents
who look after them and help them.

188
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,252
But I had no one.

189
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,174
You have no idea, do you?

190
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,344
I'm so jealous of your actors.

191
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,810
This week is my last show.

192
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,437
Come if you want. I don't care.

193
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,230
A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE

194
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,781
Come.

195
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,075
Please.

196
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,006
Yes, Hyo-rim. Did you get home all right?

197
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,634
What?

198
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,929
What do you mean?

199
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,223
You can't do the drama?

200
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,936
Yes.

201
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,398
THE SPY MOVIE

202
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,138
What's wrong?

203
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,764
I saw everything.

204
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,435
Director Ma left the tickets
to the preview on your desk.

205
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,855
This again? I told you
there's nothing going on between us.

206
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,859
If that's the case,
why did he give you those tickets?

207
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,070
A VIP ticket, at that.
It's reserved for industry veterans.

208
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,907
I think he was just passing it
on to me at Ms. Chun's request.

209
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,201
Since I've never attended a preview,

210
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,163
-he probably wanted me to experience--
-What?

211
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,415
You looked upward
and to the right just now.

212
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,375
That proves that you're lying.

213
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,169
I've got you now.

214
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,299
I've known Director Ma for years.

215
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,677
He's not the type of person
who'd ever run errands for Ms. Chun.

216
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,723
Hee-sun even said you came to see him
when you first came to our office.

217
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,266
Who are you?

218
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,644
I swear, there's nothing
going on between us.

219
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,272
It sure doesn't look that way.
You better start talking.

220
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,065
Could you please let it go?

221
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,109
Now you're being even more suspicious.

222
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,653
Tell me.
What's your relationship with Director Ma?

223
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,280
-Director Ma is…
-Yes?

224
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,573
-my dad…
-Dad?

225
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,912
What? Dad?

226
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,374
My dad's friend.

227
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,002
Director Ma and my dad are friends.

228
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,176
Lies. So you're going to keep lying?

229
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,346
It's the truth, honest to God.

230
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,935
Then why didn't you just say so?

231
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,729
Well, because…

232
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,901
It's quite difficult

233
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,779
to bring up with others.

234
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:47,117
I was actually born out of wedlock
and my dad has a family of his own.

235
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,371
Only Director Ma knows about this.

236
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,208
Wait. Your dad isn't
one of our clients, is he?

237
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,962
Who is it?

238
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,172
Can you tell me?

239
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,300
I'm afraid I can't do that.

240
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,846
Come on, I'll keep your secret.

241
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,890
Just give me his initials or something.

242
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,433
I can't.

243
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,310
Or else I'll tell everyone.

244
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,770
-You can't.
-Every one of them.

245
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,319
That's So Ji-sub.

246
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,741
Your name is So Hyun-joo.

247
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,537
Did Director Ma get you those tickets

248
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,708
so you could meet up with So Ji-sub?

249
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,878
Goodness, you look a little like him.

250
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,007
I had no idea.
I thought Director Ma and you were…

251
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,885
Goodness, I'm so sorry.

252
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,889
-It must've been hard.
-You really can't tell anyone else.

253
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,100
-I won't tell anyone until the day I die.
-Okay.

254
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,727
Don't worry.

255
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:39,021
Our general director hasn't come in yet.

256
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,985
You're late.
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

257
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,613
-What's going on?
-A special tax investigation.

258
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,739
Special tax investigation?

259
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,575
That means someone ratted us out
to the National Tax Service.

260
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,828
By any chance,
do you have an empty office?

261
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,789
We need some office space.

262
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,000
I can help you with that.

263
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,471
What's with her sudden enthusiasm?

264
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,935
As you may already know,

265
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,312
the company president
passed away recently.

266
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,149
It's hectic having to be audited
on top of that.

267
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,321
Have we met?

268
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,787
-I don't think so.
-Don't get ahead of yourself.

269
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,497
I'm not trying to start something.

270
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,499
You just seem familiar.

271
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,213
If you need anything--

272
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,718
Call for me if you need anything.

273
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,637
My office is down that way.

274
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,349
Bye, then.

275
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,151
NATIONAL TAX SERVICE

276
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,125
A tax investigation out of the blue?

277
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,919
They never barge in here for no reason.

278
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,673
Someone definitely reported us,
but for what?

279
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,800
Did we evade our taxes or something?

280
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,054
Why are you so quiet?
You're making me anxious.

281
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,305
What is it?

282
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,806
Do you know something?

283
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,683
Well, actually…

284
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,397
Mr. Wang actually used a bit
of the company's money for himself.

285
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,899
-What?
-What?

286
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,068
Why are you telling us that now?

287
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,111
How much? Since when?

288
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,531
I don't know the details.
I only found out a few months ago.

289
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,992
He said he'd take care of it
when he got back.

290
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,744
I can't believe this.

291
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,498
Then what will happen now?

292
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,416
Let's wait and see.

293
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,002
We'll tell our staff
to give them their full cooperation

294
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,922
and have them keep it a secret
so our clients don't find out.

295
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,509
And if there are any casting calls
currently underway, hurry it up.

296
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,970
Let's seal Ms. Kim
and Hyo-rim's casting contracts

297
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,431
as soon as our meeting
with the screenwriter is over.

298
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,391
Right. I'll do that.

299
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,602
Who do you think reported us?

300
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,730
It might have been Star Media.

301
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,567
Their president and Mr. Wang
fought like cats and dogs.

302
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,281
I'll keep my eye
on Mr. National Tax Service

303
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,742
and try to find out whatever I can
on who's behind this.

304
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,786
And how will you do that?

305
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,496
By doing whatever necessary.

306
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,924
Do you need help?

307
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,636
How do you like your coffee? Black?

308
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,598
-I'll do it.
-Let me help you get started.

309
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,475
A single shot or a double?

310
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,395
Double shot, then.

311
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,814
And with extra water.

312
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,024
Double shot

313
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,444
with extra water.

314
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,780
Just like me.

315
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,036
This machine is quite old,

316
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,624
so it takes some time for it to heat up.

317
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,338
Once you feel the machine

318
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,800
getting hotter and hotter,

319
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,888
that's when you press the button.

320
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,499
The entire elevator reeks of food.

321
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,709
Gosh.

322
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,880
Have you read the script?

323
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,884
Yes, it was great. What about you?

324
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,510
It was simply remarkable.

325
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,097
Ms. Kim sure is an amazing screenwriter.

326
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:30,395
I had no idea you wanted to act
in a drama of hers that badly.

327
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,815
If we were to begin shooting
at around six in the morning,

328
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,985
we'll probably end up spending
the entire day together and then some.

329
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,780
Yes.

330
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,490
Yes, I'll email you.

331
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,075
Goodbye.

332
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,036
-Hello.
-Hey.

333
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,037
Hi.

334
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,582
Your heels are adorable. Are they new?

335
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
No, I've had them for a while now.

336
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,338
I wish I had a pointy pair like that.

337
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,423
They're to die for.

338
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,968
-Ma'am. Hyo-rim. Welcome.
-Hey.

339
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,678
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

340
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,804
Welcome.

341
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,891
Mr. Kim, may I have a word with you
before the meeting?

342
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,310
Sure thing.

343
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,647
Won-jae, there's a big fridge in there.
Go and put the food in there.

344
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,565
You really didn't have to.

345
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,903
Go on and take a seat.

346
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,740
So? Have you given it some thought?

347
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,328
I thought I'd be fine
just until this morning, but…

348
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,246
But?

349
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,457
I started having second thoughts
after seeing her face.

350
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,667
Hyo-rim.

351
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,544
You have no idea what it's like.

352
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,046
She keeps watching me
to see what clothes I'm wearing,

353
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,008
what shoes I've got on,
or what bags I'm carrying.

354
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,678
And then she'd be like
"Honey, what brand is this?"

355
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,681
"Honey, when did you buy that?"

356
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,852
I have no idea what it is
that she wants from me.

357
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,562
Things are bad enough already,

358
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,273
and now I have to put up with her
for another six months?

359
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,691
It's giving me a headache.

360
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,989
Fine. If you say so.

361
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,575
I can see how stressed you are.

362
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,411
I can't force you
to do something you don't want.

363
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,204
But I'm worried about this one thing.

364
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:16,084
I'm worried that Ms. Kim might be hurt
when she learns that you turned it down.

365
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,796
She already knows
you wanted to do this more than anything.

366
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,258
She might end up thinking
that you quit because of her.

367
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,636
-What should I do?
-Say you'll do it.

368
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,679
You startled me.

369
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,515
How long have you been standing there?

370
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,768
Something as important as this…

371
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,146
should be discussed behind closed doors.

372
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,107
Anyway, the solution is quite simple.

373
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,650
If you cannot turn it down,

374
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,446
make them turn you down instead.

375
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,076
Since the show delves into
its subject matter with some depth,

376
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,788
I wanted to meet each of you
separately to discuss your roles.

377
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,417
Do you have questions
regarding the script?

378
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,464
It seemed that I'd have
the opportunity to show the audience

379
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,551
the wide range of styles
that I can manage to pull off.

380
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,804
So I thought my character should be seen

381
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,431
wearing some high-end luxury items
during the peak of her success.

382
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,433
What do you think?

383
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,560
Well, the wardrobe team

384
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,563
won't have any problems
taking care of that.

385
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,275
I think it's important
that you portray the animosity

386
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,945
between your character
and her mother-in-law with realism.

387
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,781
That's right. Animosity.

388
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,991
So I thought it'd be great if I could

389
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,911
express such feelings
through my hairstyle and my nails.

390
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,789
My character will start off the show
with ash brown hair

391
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,625
then she'll start wearing a bob
after she becomes successful.

392
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,795
And her nails will also
begin to be more extravagant.

393
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,672
What do you think?

394
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,592
Mr. Kim, what do you think?

395
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,138
As you can see,
she's all about the fine details.

396
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,142
Hyo-rim fashion, Hyo-rim makeup,

397
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,560
and Hyo-rim hairstyle.

398
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,690
These need to be at the forefront
for the show to be a success.

399
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,818
Don't you think so, Ms. Kim?

400
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,988
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

401
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,168
-Ma'am.
-Hey.

402
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,545
-How did it go?
-How was the meeting?

403
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,839
It was okay, I guess.

404
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,591
They're waiting for you.

405
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,093
I'm sure you did well.

406
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,762
Great work.

407
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,391
You must already know
from having read the script,

408
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,560
but your character deviates quite a bit

409
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,438
from the other mothers-in-laws
audiences have seen on TV.

410
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,232
She was different indeed. I loved it.

411
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,944
As you are already successful,
you find yourself in conflict

412
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,072
with your daughter-in-law
because of your different backgrounds.

413
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,243
Hey, wait.

414
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,704
Is this some kind of joke?

415
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,706
I thought you were better than that.

416
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,750
-I can't believe you.
-Ma'am?

417
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,837
Gosh, I'm sorry.

418
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,839
My mind wandered off for a moment.

419
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,507
Right.

420
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,678
So it's more than just a soap opera.

421
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,181
The relationship between
the two women develops over time

422
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,391
and emotions like love, hate,
and envy begin to sprout

423
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:22,479
from the resentment and contempt
they had for one another initially.

424
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,022
My gosh, there you are!

425
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,566
It's been so long.

426
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,486
-I see that you tagged along too.
-Wait…

427
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,322
You haven't aged a day. Come on in.

428
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,074
-Ma'am.
-You…

429
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,034
Are you all right?

430
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,371
There's no one here, is there?

431
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,706
No, there isn't.

432
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,832
That's odd.

433
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,001
-I've been seeing things lately.
-Gosh.

434
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,295
I'm sorry. I'll stay focused.

435
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,383
So we explore the emotions
the two characters begin to develop.

436
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,717
-Yes.
-Keep going.

437
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,515
I thought that the two of you
being in-laws in real life

438
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:02,852
could help you two explore
your characters in greater detail

439
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,397
because of your similarities.

440
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,356
My goodness!

441
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,441
Why are you sitting on her head?

442
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,777
-My gosh.
-Get off her. Have you lost it?

443
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,154
-Get down! Hey!
-Ma'am.

444
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,448
Ms. Kim, I think we should reschedule--

445
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,908
Hold on. Listen.

446
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,286
Ma'am, why did you--

447
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,998
It's just that
I really didn't like that role.

448
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,835
I was afraid that I wouldn't
get any more offers if I turned it down.

449
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,337
Hyo-rim might get the wrong idea too.

450
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,966
That's why I sabotaged the meeting.
Wasn't my acting great?

451
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,679
I wanted her to reject me
so that I wouldn't get the role.

452
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,141
Ma'am, didn't you say
that you loved her work?

453
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,727
You also loved
how you got so much screen time.

454
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,939
Is it because you want to avoid
working alongside your daughter-in-law?

455
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,608
No, that's not it.

456
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,154
Still, you can't just quit.

457
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,613
I'll call Ms. Kim

458
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,824
-and tell her that Hyo-rim should--
-No, wait.

459
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:02,412
Just let me quit
and let Hyo-rim keep her role.

460
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,917
If you drop out,
Hyo-rim will have to as well.

461
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,835
Why?

462
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:15,300
Hyo-rim was cast in the show under
the condition that you come on board.

463
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,053
I didn't tell her this
because it might upset her.

464
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,139
If you quit now, she won't be
able to keep working on this show.

465
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,141
She'll be absolutely disappointed.

466
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,185
Why are you telling me that now?

467
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,020
Mr. Kim. My goodness!

468
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,439
Be quiet.

469
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,483
What is it? What happened?

470
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,568
I was told that Ms. Kim Soo-mi started…

471
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,572
-talking to ghosts during the meeting.
-What?

472
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,160
-What are you saying?
-I have no idea.

473
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,454
Won-jae said he heard her say that
as he was seeing her out,

474
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,414
but I have no idea what he meant by that.

475
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:51,169
Anyway, the writer is now adamantly
against working with Ms. Kim Soo-mi.

476
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,962
Apparently, she's Christian.

477
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,010
If I had known,
I would have just kept my mouth shut.

478
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,262
Then Hyo-rim would have
at least kept her role.

479
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,227
-Where is the writer?
-She's in the parking lot.

480
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,939
She can see dead people?

481
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,315
-Ms. Kim!
-Does she really?

482
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,359
Sir.

483
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,780
Hyo-rim sabotaged today's meeting
on purpose.

484
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,826
-What?
-She pretended to be a ditz

485
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,911
so you'd turn her down.

486
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,039
She must really not have wanted
anything to do with the production.

487
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,666
No, that's not it.

488
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,628
You know how much
of a fan she is of your work.

489
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,839
She wanted this role more than anything.

490
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,383
But actually,

491
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,095
she didn't want to work
alongside Ms. Kim Soo-mi.

492
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,892
And she cried her heart out
on her way home after the meeting.

493
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,064
Could you please forgive her
and give her another chance?

494
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,525
-Please, I beg of you.
-Goodness.

495
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,738
If Ms. Kim Soo-mi also didn't want
to work alongside Hyo-rim,

496
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,282
we didn't have to get both of them
cast for the show.

497
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:07,704
I've prepared for months
to get Hyo-rim this role.

498
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,207
So can't you just let her have this role?

499
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,251
When will you quit being such an amateur?

500
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,672
If they work together,
do you know how many ad offers that'll be?

501
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,342
But we can't just force them into it
when they're not comfortable with it.

502
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,638
All you care about is your actors.
What about the agency?

503
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,891
Look at the state we're in.

504
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,603
I'm not doing this for myself.
I'm doing this to save the company.

505
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,566
Mr. Kim.

506
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:41,529
There's no telling how much we'll have to
cough up once the investigation ends.

507
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,656
We might end up suffering serious losses.

508
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,161
So make sure you have
both of them cast no matter what.

509
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,246
Do you understand?

510
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,140
But you know what?

511
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,395
I really do think
I've seen you somewhere before.

512
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,565
I never forget someone's face
once I see them.

513
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,776
Would you like a hint?

514
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,486
So we have met before.

515
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:22,987
Where was it?

516
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,743
"I hate pathetic, pushy losers like you,

517
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,703
so never talk to me again."

518
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,081
PINETREE86: ARE YOU STILL THERE? HELLO?

519
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,207
YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN UP…

520
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,221
You're Pinetree.

521
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,979
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

522
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,189
You do know that what people say online

523
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:02,652
doesn't necessarily reflect
what they actually mean to say, right?

524
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,952
What are the chances?
How did we end up meeting like this?

525
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,913
Don't you think that we were
drawn together by fate?

526
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,797
Are you doing this because you're afraid
of what I'd do to this company?

527
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,923
No.

528
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,803
I just wanted to continue the conversation
we never got to have that night.

529
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,058
If you keep bothering me like this,

530
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,146
your company might end up in
a worse predicament than it's in already.

531
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,399
As you already know,
I am such a pathetic loser.

532
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,821
That's not what I meant.

533
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,212
Still, it's so good to see you again.

534
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,492
I'd like to have the both of you onboard.

535
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,957
Yesterday, I discovered these new emotions
that you two seemed to share.

536
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,459
That's why I wanted to
see you two again today.

537
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,962
Let's be honest.

538
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,632
You both don't want to
work with each other.

539
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,843
That's why you both ended up
sabotaging your meetings.

540
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,182
Why did you tell them
that you didn't want to work with me?

541
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,726
I could say the same thing.
What about you, then?

542
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,354
Don't try to put the blame on me.

543
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,856
Be honest. Why did you tell them that?

544
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,151
I doubt anyone would ever want to
work alongside their mother-in-law.

545
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,320
You stay out of this.

546
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,864
Tell me.

547
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,243
Why did you tell them
that you didn't want to work with me?

548
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,998
Frankly speaking, the thought of
having to see you for the next six months

549
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,417
was quite unnerving.

550
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,545
I bring you food every chance I get,

551
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,840
and I always tell my friends
how proud of you I am when I see them.

552
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:33,594
You're all I ever talk about with anyone,
whether it's our fellow actors or friends.

553
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,847
What's so unnerving about working with me?

554
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,601
I'm grateful that you say nice things
about me on TV or with your friends,

555
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:45,231
but at times, it feels as if you're
pushing me to be a better daughter-in-law.

556
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,401
I'm thankful for all
the food you bring me.

557
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:52,113
But checking whether I post it on
social media or checking for news about it

558
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:57,076
puts a lot of pressure on me.
I can't help but feel stressed out.

559
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,829
I can't believe this.

560
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,457
I don't even know
how to check social media.

561
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,502
Why would you be worried about that?
That's complete nonsense.

562
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,754
Goodness.

563
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:12,175
Is this what I get after bringing you food
all this time and complimenting you?

564
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,468
Be honest.

565
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,597
That food isn't for me. It's for your son.

566
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,265
You still eat it, don't you?

567
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,143
While we're on the subject,

568
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,563
think of all the jewelry
and the watches I gave you.

569
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,066
Think of all the designer bags I gave you.

570
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,903
You always call me "Mommy"
and start wagging your tail when I do.

571
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,988
Was all of that just an act?

572
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,240
That's exactly it.

573
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,034
The mother-in-law
disguises her selfishness

574
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,119
as the love she supposedly has
for her daughter-in-law,

575
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,621
while the daughter-in-law continues

576
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,290
to treat her mother-in-law
with nothing but lies and deceit.

577
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,085
What on earth are you going on about?

578
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,670
She's telling it like it is.
You call this deceit?

579
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,341
She's told me that this is
how she really feels deep down inside.

580
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,135
I'm not accusing her of being selfish.

581
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,387
I feel uneasy being around her
because I'm not so sure

582
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,265
that I can live up to her expectations.

583
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,102
Before I got married,

584
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,105
I was just Seo Hyo-rim the actress.

585
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,360
But now people just see me
as Kim Soo-mi's daughter-in-law,

586
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,071
when I…

587
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,033
I just want to be myself.

588
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,869
-She's crying.
-Wait.

589
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,080
Why are they so immersed?

590
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,583
I don't think they're doing a reading.

591
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,879
I just feel like I'm not enough.

592
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,301
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry.

593
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,804
That's right.
You still have a long way to go.

594
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,432
That's why you should stick close
and try to learn from me.

595
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:47,645
You keep making my imagination run wild
by just saying you don't want to.

596
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,772
You're good in your own way.

597
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,609
Why would you even compare yourself to me,
a veteran of 50 years' experience?

598
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,111
Enough. Stop crying.

599
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,445
-Don't you worry.
-But…

600
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,780
Go on.

601
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,325
I still don't get why
you didn't want to work with me.

602
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,618
Now, that--

603
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,579
I think I can answer that.

604
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,374
It might be because Ms. Kim Soo-mi

605
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,712
had also felt rather small
whenever she was with you, Hyo-rim.

606
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,548
Not only are you young,

607
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,802
but you also have
the love of her son all to yourself.

608
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,305
And you still have
a bright future ahead of you

609
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,808
-while it's all downhill for Ms. Kim now.
-What?

610
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,518
What we have here

611
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,771
is exactly what I've been looking for.

612
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,275
The daughter-in-law who wants to
triumph over her mother-in-law,

613
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,111
and the mother-in-law who is

614
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,614
envious of her daughter-in-law's
youth and potential.

615
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,578
This drama will most certainly make waves.

616
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,081
Now this is what you call method acting!

617
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,376
-You bitch! I'm going to kill you!
-Ma'am!

618
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,629
You damn bitch.

619
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,640
Darn it.

620
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:10,019
I'll make sure to apologize to her.

621
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,313
I lost it there for a moment.

622
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,982
I think I broke one of her glass lenses.

623
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,734
Is her face okay?

624
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,402
It's fine, ma'am.

625
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,906
We're also to blame
for having pushed the two of you ahead

626
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,699
to work on the same show.

627
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,534
That's not true.

628
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:30,581
How are you so wise and kindhearted?

629
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,250
You're right, Mother.

630
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,293
Listen.

631
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:38,339
You weren't the reason why
I backed out of working on that show.

632
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,133
You had nothing to do with it, Hyo-rim.

633
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,053
I just didn't like it that much
to begin with.

634
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,096
I'm sorry?

635
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,139
I never get any new roles.

636
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,391
I'm always someone's mom,

637
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,352
someone's mother-in-law,
or someone's foulmouthed grandma.

638
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,647
I'm so sick and tired of playing
the same roles over and over again.

639
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,857
Why is it that people here

640
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,486
can't make something like
The Bridges of Madison County?

641
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,154
I don't want to do it.

642
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,199
How many more films or shows
do you think I can be in?

643
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,744
I just want to stick to playing
the roles I actually like from now on.

644
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:14,333
Why didn't you just say so from the start?

645
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,878
Well, he told me
that you'd also have to quit

646
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,880
if I ended up declining the offer.

647
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,426
-Who told you that?
-I didn't want to be in it from the start.

648
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,636
You said so yourself.
Didn't you, Director Ma?

649
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,307
You said Hyo-rim would
have to quit if I declined the offer.

650
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,225
Well, that's--

651
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,393
That's impossible.

652
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,854
We were working on
getting Hyo-rim cast in the show

653
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,523
months before they went
to you with the offer.

654
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,691
That's right.

655
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,361
Wait. I mean, why would you…

656
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,321
What did I do?

657
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,282
Well, actually…

658
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,410
Hear me out, Hyo-rim. Let me explain.

659
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,495
Ma'am.

660
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,831
Bye.

661
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,214
The doors are closing.

662
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,725
How can you smile right now?

663
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,644
I told you I was against
having them working together.

664
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,189
You should've listened to me.

665
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,195
Gosh, why that little…

666
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,280
Hey!

667
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,325
Don't let this get to you.

668
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,912
You still have plenty of chances
for other great titles.

669
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,247
Okay.

670
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,752
And who knows?
We might end up being cast together again.

671
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,385
Let's get rid of the labels
as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law

672
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,597
and square off as two actresses
competing against each other.

673
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,767
-I'd love that.
-Sure.

674
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,104
Mother. What do you think
about my outfit today?

675
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:02,274
It's just my style, but I don't think
I could just wear it anywhere.

676
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,903
It would be perfect to wear
when attending parties or concerts.

677
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,490
I bought one more of this outfit.

678
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,492
-Really?
-To give to you.

679
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,371
My goodness. Let me take another look.

680
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,331
Gosh, I love it.

681
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,584
-It's pretty, right?
-It is. How wonderful.

682
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,920
Your dress is pretty too.

683
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,714
I guess all that time
I spent shopping finally paid off.

684
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,973
This seems to make
my complexion look a bit fairer.

685
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,684
Mom. Which do you think is better?

686
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,604
Why all the fuss when you're just
going to the movies with a friend?

687
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,232
Hold on, don't tell me.

688
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,443
Don't you dare start dating
some random guy.

689
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,112
-I'm not going with a guy.
-Listen, you.

690
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,198
Have you tried calling your dad?

691
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,577
I did and I already met him.

692
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,661
What did he say?

693
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,246
He told me to work hard

694
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,540
and to call him if I ever need anything.

695
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,791
Is that so?

696
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,880
Anyway, don't call your dad too often.

697
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,465
You know what I mean, right?

698
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,884
I know.

699
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,343
I'm sorry.

700
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,512
Don't be like that again.

701
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,389
I'm running late. Bye.

702
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,600
Don't stay out too late.

703
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:09,985
Hi.

704
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,614
What are you doing here?

705
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,325
A friend of mine has
a supporting role in the movie.

706
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,743
He gave me a ticket.

707
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,411
What about you?

708
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,456
I came with Ms. Chun.

709
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,708
Really?

710
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,210
Where is she?

711
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,921
She's running late because of traffic.

712
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,549
I see.

713
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,928
Do you want this? I can get another one.

714
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,930
No, it's okay.

715
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,099
-Take it.
-No, it's fine.

716
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,725
Come on, just take it.

717
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,738
I'll head inside now.

718
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,828
Also, let me know…

719
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,749
if you ever feel like talking to me again.

720
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,959
I'll wait for you.

721
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:09,837
Sure.

722
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,268
-I'm just barely getting by.
-It must have cost a fortune.

723
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,061
-Hey, you're here.
-Hello.

724
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,355
Director Ma.
I don't think I'm feeling too--

725
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,983
This is So Hyun-joo,
the one I told you about.

726
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,694
And this is Chief Baek Gang-ho
of Play Entertainment.

727
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,489
Hello, my name is So Hyun-joo.

728
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,824
I've heard a lot about you.

729
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,452
He had nothing
but nice things to say about you.

730
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,662
Thank you.

731
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,081
You two should chat.

732
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,084
Feel free to ask him any questions
that you may have.

733
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,129
-See you around.
-Okay.

734
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,258
-Hello, Director Ma.
-Hello.

735
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,348
This is no place for a lady
to be standing around.

736
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,390
Okay.

737
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,477
A drink, please.

738
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,607
It's tough working
under Director Ma, right?

739
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,484
He's such a perfectionist.

740
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,986
No, not at all.

741
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,488
He's very nice to me.

742
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,572
Really?

743
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,243
We're actually looking
to hire experienced agents.

744
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,329
If it's okay with you,

745
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,289
you're welcome to join us.

746
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,668
Thank you for the offer, but it's okay.

747
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,045
I've only just started
working as an agent.

748
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,382
You shouldn't miss
such a great opportunity.

749
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,468
Moving agencies
isn't a big deal in this industry.

750
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,012
I'll consider it.

751
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,768
Don't be like that.

752
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,062
I'll treat you better than Director Ma.

753
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,773
I'm sorry?

754
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,860
I've already discussed this with him.

755
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,697
He begged me to take care of you.

756
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,035
How did you end up
with a connection like him?

757
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,415
There must be something special
about you that I'm yet to find out.

758
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,086
How about we skip the movie
and head out for some fresh air?

759
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,088
You must have a death wish.

760
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:18,757
What was that?

761
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,429
I said that you must have a death wish!

762
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,349
-My gosh.
-What's going on?

763
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,935
-What?
-What's going on?

764
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,937
What happened?

765
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,150
It's fine. Don't mind me.

766
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,111
I'm fine.

767
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,408
Hey.

768
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,079
What do you think you're doing
in front of all these people?

769
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,792
Jerk…

770
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,961
What?

771
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,796
Lucky for us,

772
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,341
now that I've made a scene
in front of all those people,

773
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,093
no agency will ever want to hire me.

774
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,680
Now, I can't help but work
for Method Entertainment until I die.

775
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,100
Even so,

776
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,729
how could you leave me
in the hands of a creep like that?

777
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,900
If you hate me that much,

778
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,028
why don't you leave the company instead?

779
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,322
Has that never crossed your mind?

780
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,685
Excuse me.

781
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,736
Basement one. Going down.

782
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,406
-What are you doing here?
-Hey. Nothing much.

783
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,950
-Are you getting off work now?
-Yes.

784
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:51,994
I heard the others say

785
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,871
the guy from the National Tax Service
is the no-nonsense type.

786
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,666
That seems to be true,

787
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,043
but I think there's more to him
than meets the eye.

788
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,588
Whatever.

789
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm feeling down. Are you up for a drink?

790
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,925
We could go to that bar you like.

791
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,844
I'll just head home today.

792
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,846
I'm off.

793
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,098
-Just like that?
-Yes.

794
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,392
Drive safely.

795
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,954
A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE

796
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,500
Are you just going to live here?

797
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,880
I was planning on doing that

798
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,925
if you were okay with it.

799
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,886
Well, okay.

800
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,764
RUNTIME: 2 HOURS AND 30 MINUTES,
NO INTERMISSION

801
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,767
Could you help us out a little?

802
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,270
I don't think you ever
enjoyed talking with me.

803
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,065
Your so-called millionaire friend.

804
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,485
I guess he won't ever meddle
in your private life.

805
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,655
He's not the kind of man you think he is.

806
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:14,159
He is a gentleman and he respects me.

807
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:18,830
All he wants from me is friendship.

808
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:23,710
People tend to grow lonely
when they become much too wealthy.

809
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,422
Those are

810
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,133
the only things I have.

811
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,721
The kind of things that make me
shine brighter as the days go by.

812
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,020
I find it strange…

813
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,150
how you called me…

814
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,155
a pitiful woman.

815
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,160
My heart is

816
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,789
filled with such treasures.

817
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,503
I believe…

818
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,133
that I am living an affluent life.

819
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,848
When the lights go off

820
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:22,060
And the stars fall asleep

821
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:27,649
I begin to hear a whispering voice

822
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:33,864
Someone once said to me

823
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:38,410
That I must shine more brightly

824
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:44,875
They told me with a smile on their face

825
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,546
Like the star that rises

826
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:54,217
In the break of dawn after a long night

827
00:50:55,177 --> 00:51:01,224
I may seem faint in your eyes

828
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:05,645
But everyone will eventually know

829
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:10,192
After time has passed

830
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,196
That the only thing that didn't shine

831
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:21,912
Was your heart

832
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,358
Ma'am?

833
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,319
I call myself an agent

834
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,738
but it's been so long
since I last watched a play.

835
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,785
Are you sure you're here for the play?

836
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,578
Sorry?

837
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,288
How adorable.

838
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,584
You have no idea
how jealous of you I am right now.

839
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,880
Ma'am.

840
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,383
You wanted a new role to play

841
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,927
and also said earlier today

842
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,639
that life is too short for us
to do all the things we enjoy.

843
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,769
Please tell me
the kinds of roles you'd like to play.

844
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,439
I might still be a nobody,

845
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:35,443
but I'll help you soar
to achieve any dreams that you have.

846
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,281
Thank you for taking an interest
in my dreams.

847
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,660
I never thought anyone would ever
ask me such a question again.

848
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,582
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

849
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,001
You know what?

850
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,504
Before I pass away,

851
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:00,719
I want to play a character who
experiences love at its most passionate.

852
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,139
I want to star in a romance.

853
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,981
I want to experience love

854
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,234
that I can cherish forever…

855
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,779
even after my death.

856
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,534
A romance like that.

857
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,833
-Great job today.
-Good work.

858
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,918
-I'll come visit again.
-Okay.

859
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,044
Goodbye.

860
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,922
-Great job today.
-Congratulations.

861
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,299
-Let's go eat.
-Let's go.

862
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,718
-Let's go.
-You were great.

863
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,885
Bye.

864
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,724
Hee-sun.

865
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,899
You came. I thought you wouldn't.

866
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,194
That was a great play.

867
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,448
I was really moved.

868
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,659
Really?

869
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,245
I'm not just saying that.

870
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,958
Seeing you on that stage
actually put me to shame.

871
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:43,089
I realized how hard
you must have been working all this time.

872
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,177
Well, while we're on the subject,

873
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:48,887
will you…

874
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,266
sign with me as my client?

875
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,979
I made up my mind
after I saw you perform on stage.

876
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,566
If there's anything you need,
I'll be there to fill in the blanks.

877
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:06,946
That'd be great.

878
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,741
We'll sign the contract tomorrow.

879
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,909
Okay.

880
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,953
Will you take me home then?

881
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,956
-I'm sorry?
-You're my agent now.

882
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,501
Of course, I should. Let's go.

883
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,129
What about your wrap party?

884
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,839
We had one yesterday.

885
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,759
Right, when did you learn
to play the guitar?

886
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:31,513
I took guitar lessons for six months
in my first year of junior high.

887
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,140
-I can only play a few chords.
-I couldn't tell.

888
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,964
Did I keep you waiting?

889
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,217
No, I just got here.

890
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,762
What do you think?

891
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,056
It's nice here, isn't it?

892
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:19,978
It's the perfect place to visit
when something troubles you.

893
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,899
Wang Tae-ja, that punk.

894
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,237
I never thought he'd pass away like that
and have you sort his shit out for him.

895
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:35,493
You must have your hands full
cleaning up after him.

896
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,624
Why did you want to see me?

897
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,085
Why would I need a reason
to ask you to come see me?

898
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,338
I thought we were much closer than that.

899
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,639
What do you think

900
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,517
about coming to Star Media?

901
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:11,488
You're the only one I can think of
who deserves to carry on my legacy.

902
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,708
What are the terms?

903
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,506
Method Entertainment's actors.

904
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:34,010
If you manage to bring over
your clients when you join us,

905
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,974
you'll become the owner of
the largest entertainment agency in Korea.

906
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,865
Think about it.

907
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,405
BEHIND EVERY STAR

908
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,141
Someone offered to buy the company.

909
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,351
-Have you considered my offer?
-I've made my decision.

910
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,186
Don't mess with our clients.

911
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,480
Let's show the Korean audience
who Soo-hyun really is.

912
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,648
You haven't found a nanny yet?

913
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,650
How long are you going to use
your kid as an excuse?

914
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,236
-"Excuse"?
-Are you really not interested in me?

915
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,572
Once labeled as a traitor,
I won't be able to work in this field.

916
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,865
A whistleblower? What do you mean?

917
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,241
Oh, my goodness! Wake up!

918
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,951
He shouldn't be dating any random girl.

919
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,163
-You can just tell them who I am.
-How far has it spread?

920
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,707
People are posting that
they saw her being taken by the police.

921
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,500
-What?
-We need to do something.

922
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,503
Method Entertainment
might really go under.

923
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,130
