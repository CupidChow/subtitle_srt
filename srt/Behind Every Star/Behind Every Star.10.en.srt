1
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,953
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,579
He's beautiful.

3
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,957
Like a painting.

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,252
His every move

5
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,421
is like a work of art.

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,058
-He waved at me.
-No, he waved at me.

7
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,324
<i><font color="white">Give me your address.
I'll send your stuff.</font></i>

8
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,598
She's an up-and-coming director.

9
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,475
She won Best New Director
at the Blue Dragon Film Awards.

10
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,479
We're going to co-produce this film
with SY Pictures.

11
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,148
Director Ma, please take charge.

12
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,816
And cast our actors.

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,234
Okay.

14
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,030
The main character is Korean-American.

15
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,741
-How about Daniel Henney?
-He can't do it.

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,826
Why not?

17
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,828
The script seemed interesting.

18
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,497
You don't trust my judgment?

19
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,876
Or is there another reason
why you're opposed?

20
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,004
He's not going to star in the film
just because we produce it.

21
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,965
We should ask his opinion first--

22
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,050
Daniel Henney…

23
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,097
These are the earnings of our clients
from the past three years.

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,392
Daniel Henney's is the lowest.
Why is that?

25
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,728
He's been working constantly
in the US, hasn't he?

26
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,189
He's different from our other actors.

27
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,067
We're working with him
similarly to how agencies work in the US.

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,654
So our role is simply to support
his projects in Korea…

29
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,864
Say something.

30
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,911
You can't judge an actor
simply by how much money they earn.

31
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,955
Then how should we judge them?

32
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,875
Daniel is an established Hollywood star.

33
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,795
Just having him as a client
in and of itself is meaningful.

34
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,464
It also helps other actors go global too.

35
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,300
So what you're saying is that

36
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,594
just having him around
makes us look successful?

37
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,762
That's not what I--

38
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,516
Fine, if you say so.

39
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,270
Since you only care about
how much money an actor makes,

40
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,064
you probably couldn't understand.

41
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,734
You're right.
I couldn't possibly understand.

42
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,655
Make sure Daniel Henney stars in this film
or I'll terminate his contract.

43
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,864
In his case…

44
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,201
I got you a new film
and even found the right actor for it.

45
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,412
I've given it to you on a silver platter.

46
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,539
If you can't do the rest,
isn't that a problem?

47
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,627
Or do you think I'm running wild again?

48
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,972
Daniel!

49
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,183
-How are you?
-Yes. What about you?

50
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,352
Did you talk to him about this?

51
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,854
I was planning to over lunch.

52
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,564
-Director Ye Min-su?
-You know her, right?

53
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,275
She won the Best New Director Award
for <i><font color="white">Silly Romance</font></i>.

54
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,569
I loved that movie.
It was a beautiful film.

55
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,404
I'll talk about it over lunch.

56
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,990
Give it a read. It's her new work.

57
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,116
Her what?

58
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,033
Her new film.

59
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,871
I'll talk to him about it.

60
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,622
We don't have time.

61
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,875
Other agencies are after this.
What if we lose it?

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,090
The main character suits you perfectly.

63
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,429
How about meeting Director Ye in person?

64
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,890
What's the rush? Let him read it first.

65
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,601
I think we should meet her
while you're in Seoul.

66
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,935
Okay, that sounds good.

67
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,230
Okay, that's great.
Let me give her a call.

68
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,815
-Give me just a second.
-Wait.

69
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,442
Ms. Chun.

70
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,825
METHOD CHUN JANE

71
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,417
Hello.

72
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,379
Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
This is Chun Jane from Method.

73
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,881
Go ahead.

74
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,384
<i><font color="white">I was wondering if we could meet up</font></i>

75
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,929
and talk about your new film
with Daniel Henney.

76
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,474
-Who?
-Daniel Henney.

77
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,354
He thinks your new script is incredible.

78
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,772
He's dying to meet you.

79
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,023
Daniel Henney?

80
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,526
That Daniel Henney?

81
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,195
Imagine Daniel Henney
starring in your film.

82
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,739
You two would make
such an incredible pair.

83
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,033
Right.

84
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,953
It's such an incredibly ridiculous idea.

85
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,038
Hello--

86
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,047
How did it go?

87
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,926
She's over the moon.

88
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,435
A man who seems to be too good to be true.

89
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,563
An ordinary woman marries him

90
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,566
and finds her way between
the fantasy and reality of marriage.

91
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,860
Daniel Henney is perfect for this.

92
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,364
I'm sure we can find an alternative.

93
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,119
He's seen all your films.

94
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,831
He finished reading this on the spot
and absolutely wanted to be in it.

95
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,001
I guess his tastes have changed.

96
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,048
Four years ago,

97
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,551
I met him for the first time
at a film festival event

98
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,304
I asked him to read my script,

99
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,972
but he gave me his email address,

100
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,433
saying he was flying to the US
after the event

101
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,684
and would read it there.

102
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,937
So you two have already met.

103
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,231
I got a reply from him.

104
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,776
"I feel uncomfortable
being contacted directly,

105
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,154
so please don't send me any more emails."

106
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,407
"I'm going to delete the script
and pretend I didn't read it."

107
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,661
That was the first draft of <i><font color="white">Stranger</font></i>.

108
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,373
I wrote it before <i><font color="white">Silly Romance</font></i>,
and it was my first full-length film.

109
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,586
I guess he's changed his opinion about me
now that I've won an award?

110
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,129
Tell him to forget it.

111
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,633
Director?

112
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,847
What do you think?

113
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,308
What?

114
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,268
The commercial proposal.

115
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,353
Right

116
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,815
It's made with coffee bean extract?

117
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,818
And this is for Eun-gyul?

118
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,820
Yes. Isn't that great?

119
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,459
"Enjoy it like coffee anytime, anywhere."

120
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,296
Something like that?

121
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,758
It does wake me up a bit.

122
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,052
You're good.

123
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,061
Why did you report to Director Ma
about Eun-gyul's commercial?

124
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,854
Ms. Chun's in charge of it.

125
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,940
Eun-gyul is his son,

126
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,693
so I thought he might want to know.

127
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,863
Does Director Ma have something to do with

128
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,241
you being Eun-gyul's agent?

129
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,245
You pretend to serve Ms. Chun,

130
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,414
but you also serve Director Ma
behind her back?

131
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,582
Shrewd move.

132
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,251
Think whatever you want.

133
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,048
Why aren't you saying anything
about Park Chun-bae's nomination

134
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,383
for an award?

135
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,261
"See? I told you so."

136
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,513
I thought you'd brag along those lines.

137
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,104
I don't have the right to brag.

138
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,440
It's not like I'm his agent.

139
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,870
Jane? How did it go with Henney?

140
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,246
I'm working on it.

141
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,754
We should sign a contract
as soon as we know his schedule.

142
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,380
Okay, and…

143
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,300
Director Ye refuses to work with Daniel.

144
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,052
Why?

145
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,305
He turned her down four years ago
at the first draft of <i><font color="white">Stranger</font></i>.

146
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,306
Did you know?

147
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,224
No, it's news to me.

148
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,185
This is driving me crazy.

149
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,562
Anyway, she adamantly
refuses to work with him.

150
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,897
In that case…

151
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,566
there's nothing we can do.

152
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,276
That's it? That's all you can say?

153
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,695
If the director doesn't want him,
what can we do?

154
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,325
Let's find another film for Daniel.

155
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,495
I mean, you've seen the script.

156
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,622
Then you must know it's going to be huge.

157
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,042
Regardless of what Koo Hae-jun thinks,
Daniel Henney must--

158
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,753
Ms. Yoo, I'm really sorry,
but this is an important matter.

159
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,921
Could you excuse us?

160
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,381
I was talking to him first,
and you barged in.

161
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,510
Then, persuade the director first.

162
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,804
We'll schedule a meeting
once she says yes.

163
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,808
How about we let them meet and talk--

164
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,142
That won't work.

165
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,021
What if things get worse if they meet up?

166
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,400
Okay. Then let me ask Daniel
what exactly happened.

167
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,862
I'm meeting him tomorrow anyway,
so I'll ask him what happened.

168
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,866
Okay, please do that.

169
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,370
Director Ma, Daniel must do this film.

170
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,247
We can't miss this. I'm dead serious.

171
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,916
I'll ask him tomorrow and let you know.

172
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,585
I'll leave you two to talk.

173
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,048
Gosh.

174
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,592
She can be so rude sometimes.

175
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,724
Right. Where were we?

176
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,897
<i><font color="white">All agents at the office
are to come to the meeting room right-- </font></i>

177
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,316
<i><font color="white">I mean, to the meeting room, please.</font></i>

178
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,112
Close the door.

179
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,372
Tomorrow, I'll be interviewing applicants
for Talent Development Team manager.

180
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,917
I want the managers
to participate in the interviews.

181
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,003
Ultimately, the final decision is mine

182
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,589
but we want to ensure a fair process.

183
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,175
Shall we start with Ms. Chun?

184
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,677
-Attend tomorrow's interviews.
-Sorry, but I don't have time.

185
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,762
-The day after?
-I'm busy all week.

186
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,432
I'm leaving if the meeting is over.

187
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,225
Chun Je-suk!

188
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,982
There are nine applicants.

189
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,235
-Me too.
-Okay, ten.

190
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,030
Each manager should interview
at least three applicants.

191
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,740
Be sure to make time.

192
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,492
Let me check my schedule first.

193
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,870
I'm choosing the date and time. Okay?

194
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,484
What was with you
and President Koo back there?

195
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,278
Did you two have a fight or something?

196
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,365
You've always disliked him,
hence your attitude.

197
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,742
But what's gotten into him?

198
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,204
He used to be silly around you,
but he's suddenly being so cold.

199
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,082
Does he have feelings for you?

200
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,459
You know,

201
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,504
maybe he's harassing the girl he likes,
like a little kid.

202
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,133
I'm sure he'll stop soon.
Don't let it bother you.

203
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,514
I kissed him.

204
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,516
What?

205
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,351
I kissed him.

206
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,522
What did you say?

207
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,650
I kissed Koo Hae-jun.

208
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,360
-You kissed--
-Be quiet.

209
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,987
-Hey!
-What?

210
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,953
-Don't tell me--
-No. I didn't.

211
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,080
-Did Mr. Koo--
-No! It's nothing like that.

212
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,123
Stop that thought.

213
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,168
I drank too much.

214
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,963
I was completely wasted
and out of my mind.

215
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,090
I mistook him for Sang-uk.

216
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,135
<i><font color="white">But he doesn't look anything like him!</font></i>

217
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,513
That's why I said I was out of my mind.

218
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,557
What are you going to do now?

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,183
What do you mean? It was nothing.

220
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,977
Shake. It was just like this.

221
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,979
It was nothing.

222
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,147
You…

223
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,944
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

224
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,823
-Hi, Hee-sun.
<i><font color="white">-Mr. Kim.</font></i>

225
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,034
<i><font color="white">I just met Director Oh Hun.</font></i>

226
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,160
Director Oh Hun?

227
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,996
Just the two of you? Without telling me?

228
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,998
<i><font color="white">I'm telling you now.</font></i>

229
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,251
Right. I guess you
exchanged numbers the other day.

230
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,671
But you should contact him
through the company from now on.

231
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,800
If you start talking personally,
it might become hard to talk business--

232
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,136
<i><font color="white">I'm doing a soundtrack test tomorrow.</font></i>

233
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,096
-Tomorrow?
<i><font color="white">-Yes.</font></i>

234
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,600
<i><font color="white">That's why I'm calling you.
I wanted you to be the first to know.</font></i>

235
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,478
Oh, I see.

236
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,689
That's great, Hee-sun. Congratulations.

237
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,609
<i><font color="white">I have to go practice.
I'll talk to you later.</font></i>

238
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,861
All right. Keep it up.

239
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,749
Hello.

240
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,264
Hey.

241
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,433
Why are you still here?

242
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,813
Ms. Chun asked me
to check Director Ye's schedule.

243
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,315
She's trying to arrange
a meeting with her and Daniel.

244
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,238
All right then.

245
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,533
Hyun-joo.

246
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,871
Can you send me
Director Ye's schedule too?

247
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,499
But don't tell Ms. Chun.

248
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,001
Why not?

249
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,132
There's something
I want to discuss with her personally.

250
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,804
Actually,

251
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,640
the person who rejected her script

252
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,393
was me, not Daniel.

253
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,311
What?

254
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,689
He doesn't even know she emailed him.

255
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,315
I deleted it without showing him.

256
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,454
Why did you do that?

257
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,414
The script wasn't that good.

258
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,750
And the character was just like Daniel,
as if a stalker wrote it.

259
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,713
I rejected it because I thought
he shouldn't get involved with her.

260
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,090
Plus, she was a nobody back then.

261
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:11,387
Then why don't you tell them the truth
that you rejected it for the actor's sake?

262
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,598
Daniel may understand,

263
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,893
but Director Ye won't want to work with us
once she finds out.

264
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,272
Our company is co-producing the film,
and this is my debut as a producer.

265
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,027
But I messed it all up.

266
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,489
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,451
If things were good
between you and your wife,

268
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,372
you'd already be doing
what you really wanted to do.

269
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,668
That's not what I meant.

270
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,345
Anyway, I'll talk things out
with Director Ye.

271
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,222
Just send me her schedule.

272
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,351
I think I can help.

273
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,616
You didn't have to give me a ride.

274
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,868
Stop saying that.
You need your agent with you.

275
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,329
But my agent is Director Ma.

276
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,332
Hello.

277
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,043
I'm here too.

278
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,464
I revised the song a little.

279
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,967
Your voice inspired me.

280
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,677
-Really?
-Yes.

281
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,637
This way, please.

282
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,015
Oh, my. Are we going to record here?

283
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,433
That's right.

284
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,898
This is a restricted area.

285
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:46,941
But I should--

286
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,026
Why don't you go wait at a café?

287
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,153
Call me when you're finished--

288
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,040
<i><font color="white">It's true.</font></i>

289
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,960
He said he had no idea
and asked me to apologize to you.

290
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,671
Tell him I reject his apology.

291
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,801
I mean…

292
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,764
An actor offered his apology first.
That's not easy for an actor to do.

293
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,766
You don't know him well enough,

294
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,893
but he never says what he doesn't mean.

295
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,980
Born in 1979,
in Carson City, Michigan, US.

296
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,983
His father is Irish-American
and his mother, Korean-American.

297
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,985
He has two dogs named Juliette and Roscoe.

298
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,155
He also had a golden retriever,
but Mango died a few years ago.

299
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,408
Despite his physique,
basketball is the only sport he's good at.

300
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,456
I used to be a member of his fan club.

301
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,793
I probably know more about him
than anyone in Korea.

302
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,718
I've been through a lot before I debuted.

303
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,889
But one day, I saw Daniel Henney
in <i><font color="white">My Lovely Sam Soon</font></i>.

304
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,183
I didn't think a man like him could exist.

305
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,353
Watching him gave me a goal.

306
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,105
I wanted to make a film starring him.

307
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,816
A film just for him.

308
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,653
And that became <i><font color="white">Stranger</font></i>.

309
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,698
So the script found its rightful owner.

310
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,241
No one would understand

311
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,205
how I felt when the love letter I'd
written over ten years was torn to pieces.

312
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:28,959
Anyway,

313
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,297
did he really say
he was eager to star in my film?

314
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,341
Yes.

315
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,301
Serves him right.

316
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,263
Tell him I'll invite him
to the sneak preview at least.

317
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,937
I'll wrap things up then.

318
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,524
You'll be branded as an amateur director
into Daniel's memory forever,

319
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,025
but whatever. I'll wrap it up.

320
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,319
Why am I an amateur?

321
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,698
He's trying to apologize to you,
but you're not even giving him a chance.

322
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,660
"This director puts her pride
before her film."

323
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,662
That's probably what he'll think.

324
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,914
If you're a pro,

325
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,084
you should be able to join hands
even with an enemy for your film.

326
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,627
Never mind.

327
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,629
I'll just wrap things up. That'd be best.

328
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,259
Schedule a meeting.

329
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,054
That's a great idea.

330
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,723
I'm not saying I'm casting him.

331
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,349
I just want to meet him.

332

How did it go with Director Ye?

348

She wants to meet Daniel.

That's a relief.

351
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:11,288
Then I'll check their schedule

Hold on.

Why are you so excited
about their meeting?

Well, it's just…

356
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,428
The main character
in the director's new film

357
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,974
seems just perfect for Daniel.

358

Also,

359
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,312
it'd be a shame
if another actor starred in the film.

360
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,855
It'd be such a shame.

361
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,857
Gosh.

362
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,943
You sound like a real agent now.

363
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,987
I'm proud.

Check their schedules and let me know.
You can leave.

Yes, ma'am.

This is bad.

367
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,255
The interviewees for Talent Development
Team manager seem so competent.

368
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,214
What do I do?

369
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,092
Why would so many
prestigious university graduates

370
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,303
compete for a mere manager position?

371
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,888
I'm so bummed.

372
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:14,226
Come on. You're still
much more experienced than them.

373

That lady is a theater professor
at J University.

374
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,816
She's worked at production companies
and has trained many idols.

375
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,822
Even I'd hire her if I were the president.
What do I do?

376
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,490
Well?

377
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,826
Do you need my help?

378
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,499
It's time for action, Yoo Eun-soo.

That's right.

Since the movie
is about sexual minorities,

I guess it's bound to make
some people uncomfortable.

00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,823
<i><font color="white">Three minutes until we're on the floor.</font></i>

470
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,008
Tae-oh.

471
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,517
You did great today.

472
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,644
You're such a good talker.

473
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,938
I'm just used to it now.

474
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,023
I guess so.

475
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,901
Ms. Chun!

476
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,153
What are you doing here?

477
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,572
You can't go this way.

478
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,407
-Why not?
-There's a protest going on.

479
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,076
-A protest?
-Go that way.

480
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,786
-I'm sorry.
-What's going on?

481
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,163
-I'll explain later. I'm sorry.
-Hold on.

482
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,624
-Hurry up.
-Stop pushing me.

483
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,708
-Quickly.
-Oh, gosh.

484
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,214
-Please, go.
-You want us to walk down?

485
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,008
Please don't ask. There's a problem.
For now, you have to go

486
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,051
-Go where?
-I'm sorry.

487
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,219
I'll tell you later.

488
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,262
-Can't you be a bit clearer?
-No, not now…

489
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,236
Your phone isn't going anywhere.

490
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,446
I haven't heard back from him.

491
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,991
He said he'd let me know right away.

492
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,661
I guess I failed again.

493
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,705
Come on. The test was this morning.

494
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,002
Can you call him and ask him how I did?

495
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,631
Well, he must be very busy right now.

496
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,174
There are many other candidates.

497
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,344
There are other candidates?

498
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,512
Yes.

499
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,811
Even if you don't get cast,
think of it as a good experience.

500
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,981
But he's always been like this.

501
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,066
Whenever he's busy,
he's impossible to reach.

502
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,944
He has so much to do
and so many people to meet.

503
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,030
He has to see his girlfriend
now and then too.

504
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,870
What I mean is, you should wait patiently.

505
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,330
All right.

506
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,544
Photoshoots, previews,

507
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,713
volunteering at an animal shelter
and so on.

508
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,341
He's fully booked until his departure.

509
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,677
I knew it.

510
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,764
He only pretended to be interested
to give me the cold shoulder.

511
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,602
What did I expect? People rarely change.

512
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,520
It's not like that.

513
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,356
-What about early mornings?
-I asked,

514
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,650
but he goes jogging every morning.

515
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,489
Fine. I'll give him a call.

516
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,074
I guess he still has to eat.

517
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,784
We'll talk over a meal.

518
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,870
ACTOR DANIEL HENNEY

519
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,207
Let's hear what he has to say.
I'm sure he'll make some time.

520
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,294
Don't pick up.

521
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,379
Daniel, it's Jane.

522
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,925
I'm calling you regarding
Director Ye's movie.

523
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,135
She wants to see you
before you depart next week.

524
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,220
-How about it?
-When did I say that?

525
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,473
<i><font color="white">I'd love to see her too.</font></i>

526
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:45,023
Really? You came to the radio station?
We must've missed each other.

527
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,483
He's full of lies.

528
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,652
Does tomorrow morning work for you?

529
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,153
Can we meet at our office?

530
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,739
<i><font color="white">Let's do that.</font></i>

531
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:57,035
All right. I'll decide what time
we should meet and call you back.

532
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:57,953
See you tomorrow.

533
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,500
What happened?

534
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:05,961
I have no idea.

535
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:10,340
When I asked him,
he said he didn't have time. Why did he…

536
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,094
So you'll see him tomorrow.

537
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,596
Good.

538
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,351
<i><font color="white">Daniel Henney and Director Ye
are meeting tomorrow at 11 a.m.</font></i>

539
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,356
What do I do?

540
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,482
Come in.

541
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,485
Hi, Hee-sun.

542
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,862
These are the résumés of the interviewees.

543
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,074
I feel so bad.

544
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,578
How am I supposed to decide
who gets the job and who doesn't?

545
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:40,996
Thanks.

546
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,751
It's Director Oh Hun!

547
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,213
"I've thought a lot about it, but…

548
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,173
I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT,
BUT LET'S DROP THE SOUNDTRACK

549
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,801
…let's drop the soundtrack."

550
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,306
He should at least let you know
on the phone, respectfully.

551
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,974
I'm disappointed in him.

552
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,184
Don't let it get to you, Hee-sun.

553
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,644
Hold on.

554
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,771
"Instead, please be in my film
as my partner."

555
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,815
"We'll sing the soundtrack together too."

556
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,483
His partner?

557
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,069
What does this mean?

558
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,031
That can't be.
I thought the casting was over.

559
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,409
-Let me call him and find out.
-Okay.

560
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,498
-Put it on speakerphone.
-Wait.

561
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,127
-Hey, Jung-don.
<i><font color="white">-What do you mean by your partner?</font></i>

562

<i><font color="white">I thought the casting was over.</font></i>

563
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,213
I broke up with her.

564
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,591
You broke up…

565
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,009
You were going out with her?

566
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,761
It's a long story.

567
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,722
But anyway,
I guess it was a good thing after all

568
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,932
since I met Hee-sun.

569
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,353
-What's he saying?
-Hold on.

570
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,731
Don't you think this is a bit rash?

571
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,025
You haven't seen her acting yet.

572
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,861
<i><font color="white">But I've seen how she conveys
her emotions when she sings.</font></i>

573

<i><font color="white">After all, acting is
all about conveying emotions.</font></i>

574

And…

575
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,203
I'm beginning to realize
what an attractive person she is.

576
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:12,796
I want to show her charm
to the world through my film.

What the hell?

581
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,183
What did he say?

582
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,145
He broke up with the actress
who was going to play the lead.

583
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,523
I think that's why he kicked her
out of the movie.

584
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,526
I think you should think carefully…

585
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,697
"You're the heroine of my film.
I look forward to working with you."

The heroine?

587
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,453
I'm the heroine?

588
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,082
-Let me see.
-I'm the heroine!

589
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,418
He says I'm the heroine of the movie!

590
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,768
Do you have something to say?

591
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,520
Spit it out. What is it?

592
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,565
-That day…
-That day?

593
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,400
It was a mistake.

594
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,693
A mistake?

595
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,119
Why did you slap me? You kissed me.

596
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,579
Yes.

597
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,205
Let me make this clear.

598
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,459
I was wasted,
and I mistook you for someone else.

599
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,254
A mistake that will never happen again.

600
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,590
It's no big deal.
Let's pretend nothing happened.

601
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,638
The interviewee is here.

602
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,477
Ms. Lee Hye-mi?

603
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,061
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

604
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,439
You've been working
as a film festival programmer.

605
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,108
What made you apply
for a completely different job?

606
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,903
I don't think it's completely different.

607
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,863
I get to proactively search and develop--

608
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,740
-You came on to me.
-Excuse me?

609
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,408
I mistook you for someone else.

610
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,868
Pardon?

611
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,205
Sorry about that.

612
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,708
When it comes to finding new talents,

613
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,171
what do you think is the most important?

614
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,257
Rather than abstract terms
such as passion and ambition--

615
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,258
I wanted to win.

616
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,220
-Pardon?
-That's why I ended up drinking so much

617
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,888
and couldn't think straight.

618
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,515
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

619
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:31,226
-I quit drinking.
-I'm not talking about right now.

620
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,645
You were sober.
You had two anti-hangover drinks.

621
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,855
That was after.
What's the fuss over a kiss?

622
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,441
It's nothing to fuss over.
And I already love someone else.

623
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,692
Who? The tax guy?

624
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,110
Who asked who out?

625
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,278
-Excuse me…
-Hey.

626
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,447
How dare you talk about him?

627
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:45,949
What about kissing? Did you?

628
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,200
Was I first?

629
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,244
Who did you kiss first? When was it?

630
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,538
Should I come back later?

631
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,040
-No. I'm leaving.
-You can't do that.

632
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,458
Good luck. You can do this.

633
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,418
Wait. Come back here.

634
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,255
-She kissed him, don't you think?
-Sorry?

635
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,507
-Wait.
-Where…

636
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,551
Where are you going?

637
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,166
Hey.

638
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,336
What's up? I heard about Hee-sun.

639
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,716
Why do you look so depressed?

640
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,802
You were jumping through hoops
to get her a role.

641
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,808
I'm not sure if this movie
is really good for her.

642
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,607
I don't like how he described
the movie as erotic.

643
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,152
Hun is head over heels for Hee-sun.

644
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,821
What? Do you feel like he's taken her?

645
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,951
You know how he is.

646
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:15,038
He's attractive.
Both as a director and as a man.

647
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,711
Our job is to make people love our actors.

648
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,504
Directors included.

649
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,550
It's a good thing for an actor
to be loved by a director, isn't it?

650
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,053
I do know that. You're right.

651
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,890
If you feel this way while knowing that,

652
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,435
there must be another reason.

653
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,105
I'm off.

654
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,698
Gosh.

655
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,590
RECENT CALLS

656
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,675
WIFE
DANIEL HENNEY

657
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,511
WIFE (2)
YOO EUN-SOO

658
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,859
YOO EUN-SOO

659
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,087
Do I look nervous?

660
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,798
Come on. You already know them.
What's the problem?

661
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,301
Just act as usual.

662
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,432
I can't look people in the eye
when I'm nervous.

663
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,184
If I make eye contact with Mr. Koo,

664
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,686
I might faint.

665
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,982
Then why don't you look at Sunny,

666
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,443
who will be sitting next to Mr. Koo?

667
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,486
What?

668
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:56,908
Turn your anger and competitive spirit
toward her into confidence.

669
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,872
Crush her.

670
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:14,967
So many actors in this world
remain unknown

671
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:19,055
despite their excellent potential
and competence.

672
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,600
I'd like to cultivate their talent

673
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,645
and turn them into valuable jewels.

674
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,690
I like your confidence.

675
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,027
In every other aspect as well,

676
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,572
I'm sure I surpass the other applicants.

677
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,366
Beating the competition

678
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,368
is my specialty.

679
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:45,706
That's why I should become
the Talent Development Team…

680
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,544
manager.

681
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,674
I'm sorry.

682
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,717
It's about the fan meet.

683
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,427
Excuse me.

684
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,889
-Where are you going?
-Sorry?

685
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,307
We're not done yet.

686
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,938
Sit back down. Come on.

687
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,532
How are you planning to find new actors?

688
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,075
What?

689
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,997
Well…

690
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,293
I'm going to visit
theater companies in person

691
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,919
to see their performances and…

692
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,964
That's about it.

693
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,427
Will you have time

694
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,555
to fulfill your duties as a manager
on top of your existing duties?

695
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,640
Well…

696
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,145
I'm planning to use
my personal time for that

697
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,772
since to me, work is…

698
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,399
a hobby.

699
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:02,658
When do you feel most proud while working?

700
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,872
It's when I find…

701
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,540
When I discover…

702
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,877
people's talents, I think.

703
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,003
Where are you looking?

704
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,922
Look me in the eye.

705
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,089
What?

706
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:20,760
Are you okay?

707
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,386
What's wrong?

708
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,221
I don't trust

709
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,475
anything anyone says.

710
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,186
You don't have to.

711
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,272
My body…

712
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:35,858
Sorry.

713
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,736
"My body…"

714
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,159
Should we try again from here?

715
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,202
-Sure.
-Okay.

716
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,668
Whenever I see your eyes,

717
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,629
I go back to being my old self.

718
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,340
Don't believe

719
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,802
that my eyes are telling the truth.

720
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,429
My body

721
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,015
might be telling a lie.

722
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,600
There you are.

723
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,352
What the heck?

724
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,688
What?

725
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,564
Were you rehearsing?

726
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:16,816
Did I interrupt you?

727
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,067
-My bad.
-Jeez.

728
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,443
How did you know I was here?

729
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,779
Hyun-joo told me.

730
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,323
Why didn't you tell me
you had a rehearsal?

731
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,950
I could have given you a ride.

732
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,451
Well…

733
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,121
It came up last minute.

734
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,750
Let me know beforehand
when there's a rehearsal.

735
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,419
I need to pick Hee-sun up.

736
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:37,920
I'm not sure.

737
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,716
We might decide to meet
at the last minute often from now on.

738
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,343
It's fine. Just let me know.

739
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:49,515
Make sure someone from the company
accompanies you everywhere,

740
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,725
even if it isn't me.

741
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,603
All right then. I'll wait in the car.

742
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,898
Call me when you're done.

743
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,742
This way, please.

744
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,619
Hyun-joo.

745
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,955
-Hello.
-Hi.

746
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,332
-Please have a seat and wait here.
-Okay.

747
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,500
All right.

748
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,300
Would you like something to drink?

749
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,136
Sure.

750
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,236
Why isn't he picking up?

751
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,279
What about Eun-soo?

752
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,198
She's not picking up either.

753
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,533
This is driving me nuts.
This is so important.

754
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,517
Hello. Nice to see you.

755
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,854
I know you're busy, so I'll keep it short.

756
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,107
No, you don't have to.

757
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,655
You have all of his time for today.

758
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,615
What an honor. Take a seat.

759
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,001
Please introduce yourself.

760
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,545
What?

761
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,296
Isn't this what they do in the US?

762
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,049
I'm doing this the American way for you.

763
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,679
You're right.

764
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,473
But I've never done this in Korea before.

765
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,228
Nice to meet you.

766
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,156
That's 188 cm.

767
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,575
And born in the Year of Sheep.

768
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:21,292
Now, let's see you improv.
I'll play opposite you.

769
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,753
An improv?

770
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:32,386
You mercilessly dumped
the woman who loved you.

771
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:36,932
Four years later, you show up
in front of the woman again and apologize.

772
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,019
Whenever you're ready.

773
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,005
I can't forgive you.

774
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,966
Regret dumping me
for the rest of your life.

775
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,403
Did you think
that would make me forgive you?

776
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,655
Should I continue?

777
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,782
It's over.

778
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,367
Apologize.

779
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,785
Why did you do that to me?

780
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,329
-That's enough.
-No, I'm not done yet.

781
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,914
Apologize to me!

782
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,260
It's all right.

783
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,303
Do you understand now?

784
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,473
How it feels to be rejected?

785
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,729
Have I done anything wrong to you
in the past?

786
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,065
You hurt me.

787
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,776
You threw away my script in the garbage.

788
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,570
All he did was click the delete button.

789
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:17,074
Then it goes to the trash can.
Isn't that the same thing?

790
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,452
You were my muse.

791
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,498
But you utterly disregarded
the first script that I wrote for you.

792
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,960
Compared to how hurt I felt back then,

793
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,712
this is nothing.

794
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,131
Okay. Hold on.

795
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,882
What…

796
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,093
What are you talking about?

797
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,266
Daniel, that's…

798
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,352
She emailed you the script of <i><font color="white">Stranger</font></i>
four years ago, right?

799
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,773
He doesn't even remember it.

800
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,859
-I never got an email.
-Liar.

801
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,447
Seriously, I didn't get any email.

802
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,698
It's my fault.

803
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,663
It was back when
I had just started working here.

804
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,959
And I was going through the scripts
that had been emailed to us.

805
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,630
I thought the script was too difficult,

806
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,258
so I deleted it.

807
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,596
Director Ye.

808
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,308
Director Ye,
everything's fine now, isn't it?

809
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,893
Everything's been cleared up.

810
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,103
-The problem has been solved.
-"Solved"?

811
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,813
What's been solved?

812
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,358
Your stupid employee
throwing away my script?

813
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,569
Me resenting my favorite actor
for four years?

814
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,822
Or is it me insulting my favorite actor?

815
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:48,957
This is the most
humiliating day of my life.

816
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,884
Daniel, I'm sorry.

817
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,058
What a great company this is.

818
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,278
Daniel.

819
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,243
So Hyun-joo!

820
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:27,496
So Hyun-joo, come out right now.
Explain what happened.

821
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,416
So Hyun-joo!

822
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,625
I know you're in there.

823
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,461
Come out, or I'll knock the door down!

824
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,755
Come out. I'm counting to ten.

825
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,632
One, two…

826
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:42,928
Director Ma.

827
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,680
There's a problem.

828
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,307
Daniel and Director Ye had a huge fight.

829
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,517
Wake up.

830
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,770
Tell them I went missing.

831
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,022
What are you talking about?

832
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,191
Or just tell them I died.

833
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,779
Wake up.

834
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,114
I don't want to.

835
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,615
Wake up right now!

836
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,161
Hey, Ma Tae-oh.

837
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,999
This isn't the man I love and respect.

838
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,230
I'm sorry.
I didn't know there was a meeting

839
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,690
and had my phone turned off.

840
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,235
You didn't go home last night?
You haven't changed.

841
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:48,202
Daniel and Director Ye
insist on suing each other.

842
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,705
Method's first co-production project

843
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,957
officially fell through.

844
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,209
Who's responsible?

845
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,085
I'll sort things out.

846
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,297
There's been a misunderstanding,
but it can be cleared up.

847
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,257
I'll try to calm down Director Ye.

848
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,052
Director Ma,
you talk to Daniel and clear things up.

849
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,681
The real problem is So Hyun-joo.

850
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:12,768
Why?

851
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,020
She's been acting strange lately.

852
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,856
It seemed like she was trying
to stop Director Ye and Daniel

853
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,691
from meeting on purpose.

854
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,443
You know what she said back there?

855
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,445
She said she worked here four years ago

856
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:26,323
and she's the one
who rejected Director Ye's script.

857
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,158
Really? What's going on?

858
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,119
Is she imagining things?

859
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:35,249
Or could she be a spy
sent from another company?

860
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,166
Like Star Media?

861
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,960
You're being absurd.

862
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,754
But something's definitely off.
So why should we keep her?

863
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,298
We'll take legal action and fire her.

864
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,807
She's done nothing wrong.

865
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,476
I asked her

866
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,604
to stop Daniel and Director Ye
from meeting.

867
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,943
And I'm the one who deleted the script.

868
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,365
So Hyun-joo
was trying to take the fall for you?

869
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,162
Why would she do that?
What would she gain?

870
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,716
Hyun-joo…

871
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,308
is my daughter.

872
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,353
Your daughter?

873
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,358
Daughter? Your daughter?

874
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,193
What about Eun-gyul?

875
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,530
They have different mothers.

876
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,407
They're half-siblings.

877
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,868
Is that why you hired her?

878
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,870
No, wait.

879
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,371
You're the one who hired her.

880
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,372
<i><font color="white">You're from Busan?</font></i>

881
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,373
I live near Haeundae.

882
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,541
What about your parents?

883
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,920
My mom lives in Busan.

884
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,213
And I don't have…

885
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,050
a dad.

886
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:10,552
And no one knew about it?

887
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:11,970
Not even you, Je-suk?

888
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,265
You find this funny?

889
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,352
It's all my fault.

890
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,648
I'll take responsibility.

891
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,733
I'll…

892
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,235
resign.

893
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,405
