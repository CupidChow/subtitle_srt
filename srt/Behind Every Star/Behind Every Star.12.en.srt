EPISODE 12

3
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,881
NEW-GENERATION DESIGNER HAN BO-REUM

4
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,758
Han Bo-reum, the <i><font color="white">hanbok</font></i> designer?

5
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,261
He became famous
after a BTS member wore his clothes.

6
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,262
Here you go.

7
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,641
-That was him?
-His atelier is in Busan,

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,185
and I went there to get a <i><font color="white">hanbok</font></i> once,

9
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,146
but I was told it's a two-year wait
because of all the orders.

10
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,862
Let's see.

11
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,239
Is she ready?

12
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,910
-Let me show you.
-Yes, please.

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,303
What do you think?

14
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,556
Do I look good?

15
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,437
Outstanding! You're so gorgeous!

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,731
I can't believe how thin this fabric is.

17
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,482
And it drapes so nicely.

18
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,402
It must have been hard
to get your hands on this.

19
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,988
Is she the best agent
in the world or what?

20
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,240
No, you can't.

21
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,784
You shouldn't move.
Be careful with the dress.

22
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,120
-The fitting isn't finished yet.
-Stay still.

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,289
Gosh.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,836
The host of the Busan International
Film Festival deserves a dress like this.

25
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,632
It's a much bigger deal
than just walking the red carpet.

26
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:17,054
You'll be the main event
of this year's film festival.

27
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,974
Nice.

28
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,267
This is incredible.

29
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,979
-I knew it'd look great on her.
-She looks amazing.

30
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,981
-Of course.
-How much is it?

31
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,025
Who cares? Just look at her.

32
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,879
The one who picks the red stick is going.

33
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,089
Okay.

34
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,471
-I choose this.
-Okay.

35
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,473
-Let's switch.
-All right.

36
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,725
One, two, three.

37
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,063
Eun-soo wins!

38
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,606
Eun-soo

39
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,775
is going to Busan.

40
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,237
<i><font color="white">Flowers are in bloom</font></i>

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,281
<i><font color="white">On Dongbaek Island</font></i>

42
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,413
Won-jae, can't you stay back in my stead?

43
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,582
I have to assist Ms. Chun.

44
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,130
Usually, it's the youngest one
that stays back.

45
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,595
That feels nice.

46
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,725
I had a celebrity
visit my shop the other day.

47
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,268
Park Seo-jun.

48
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,730
Fair-skinned and tall…

49
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,690
He must be popular with the girls.

50
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,150
I don't care.

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,485
All I care about is Youngtak.

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,990
<i><font color="white">What were you doing in there?</font></i>

53
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,077
Does Youngtak have a girlfriend?

54
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,329
I'm not sure.

55
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,331
I thought you worked as an agent.

56
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,500
And you don't even know that?

57
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,294
Even if he does, he'd never admit it.

58
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,089
He'd say, "My fans are my girlfriend."

59
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,634
They say all celebrities are two-faced.

60
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,261
You're the one that's two-faced.

61
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,679
What did you say?

62
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,266
-I mean your makeup looks great.
-Okay.

63
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,604
<i><font color="white">What were you doing in there?</font></i>

64
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,231
It's hot!

65
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,399
What was that?

66
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,568
You should train her better.

67
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,236
I'm never coming back here.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,198
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:48,121
Didn't I tell you
to treat them with extra care?

70
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,000
They're the ones who got me
all the wedding hairdo jobs.

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,961
They were gossiping about celebrities
the whole time. Pathetic.

72
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,217
Are you defending celebrities because
you were an agent for a few months?

73
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,471
It's not like anyone's going to miss you
up there in Seoul.

74
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,680
Your dad…

75
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,518
Let's drop it.

76
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,603
It's not worth it.

77
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,147
Anyway,

78
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,193
go to her shop and apologize tomorrow.

79
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,110
Understand?

80
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,781
Hey.

81
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,700
My goodness.

82
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,413
<i><font color="white">How's Hyun-joo doing?</font></i>

83
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,670
I FEEL BAD SHE LEFT THAT WAY

84
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,881
<i><font color="white">She's doing well. Don't contact me again.</font></i>

85
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,344
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO HYUN-JOO

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,679
<i><font color="white">She blocked your number.</font></i>

87
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,182
<i><font color="white">Leave the kid alone,
and let's live our separate lives now.</font></i>

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,668
The designer insists
on mending the dress herself.

89
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,670
She won't even let us touch it.

90
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,090
The opening is in two days,
so I'm looking for another dress.

91
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,342
I'm sure most dresses
have already been taken.

92
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,803
And the remaining ones
won't be good enough.

93
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,807
Rona Mikel won the Academy Award
for Best Costume Design last year.

94
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,852
Every actress in Hollywood
is lined up for her dresses.

95
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,478
I know that.

96
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,148
I also know that
you begged C&G to get that dress.

97
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,859
C&G had their own reason to help us.

98
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,236
A-joong is starring in a film
they're sponsoring,

99
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,864
so they must want to generate
publicity for the film.

100
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,782
Exactly. I know that too.

101
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,868
You said you'd get her into Hollywood.

102
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,745
So I invited reporters from overseas

103
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,164
and asked them
to get the dress on the front page.

104
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,915
You're telling me she can't wear it?

105
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,335
Suk, you're being a little sloppy here.

106
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,629
Is something distracting you?

107
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,048
A-joong is going to wear
that Rona Mikel dress.

108
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,759
All of it will go as planned.

109
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,385
It was an update. I'm going to solve it!

110
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,179
You'll have to.

111
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,348
To make up for losing Henney.

112
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,434
Solve the dress issue by tonight.

113
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,520
And share the revised contract
with me tomorrow morning.

114
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,195
Let's go.

115
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,536
<i><font color="white">-Won-jae.

117
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,165
-please escort him.
-That's right.

118
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,000
-Thanks.
-Got it.

119

-No, it's at 4 p.m.
-You're already there?

120
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,838
Our field manager, Choi Won-jae,
will meet you.

121
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,131
-One moment.
-Jin-hyeok.

122
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,051
Reschedule Ji-hoon's meeting.
It overlaps with the KOFIC meeting.

123
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,888
Give me a second. I'm scheduling
interviews with overseas reporters.

124
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,432
And send our schedule to the hair team.

125
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,935
Okay, let me write that down.

126
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,937
Mr. Park, I'm sorry… Hello?

127
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,857
-Ms. Chun!
-Yes?

128
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,944
Can you please hire more people?

129
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,447
With one person gone,
I'm too busy to even breathe.

130
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:13,243
Hire? I'll do that. Wait just a few days.

131
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,453
Can you check
Eun-gyul's red carpet schedule?

132
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,539
-Anyone?
-I'll do it.

133
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,624
I can do it.

134
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,875
You said you're too busy.

135
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,419
Get your name on the list.

136
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,547
Eun-soo, book flight tickets for her.
She'll sit next to Eun-gyul.

137
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,174
Also, Director Ma will attend
the opening in my stead.

138

This is K Production's Ms. Kang So-yeon,
the director of the opening ceremony.

00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,745
Nice to meet you.

You had it mended? Oh, my.

There's a seamstress in Dongdaemun

159
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,117
who's famous among foreign designers.
Her name is Ms. Park.

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,618
-I know her.
-We persuaded

161
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,620
the designer all night via video call.

162
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,957
I went to Ms. Park
and begged her to fix it.

163
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,752
I can't believe you.

164
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,088
She can work magic sometimes.

165
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,966
How could I give up
when you love this dress so much?

166
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,386
I wanted to let you wear it
no matter what.

167
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,638
It's all up to me now, right?

168
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,057
Don't worry. You'll do great.

169
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,560
You're going to look gorgeous.

170
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,570
What's this?

171
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,489
Come with me later.

172
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,367
Let's get some fresh air
and watch a few movies.

173
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,040
The company will pay
for your flights and hotel room…

174
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,508
She's been invited as an actress.
Don't get the wrong idea.

175
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,517
I didn't say anything.

176
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,367
Where's the revised contract?

177
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,118
<i><font color="white">I left it in your office…</font></i>

178
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,704
<i><font color="white">No, I forgot it on my desk.</font></i>

179
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,667
Where on your desk? I can't find it.

180
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,126
<i><font color="white">Check my drawer…</font></i>

181
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,378
<i><font color="white">Are you in my office?</font></i>

182
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,380
<i><font color="white">Who said you could go in there?</font></i>

183
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,215
I'm busy, so just tell me.

184
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,425
-Which drawer?
<i><font color="white">-The top one.</font></i>

185
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,928
<i><font color="white">It's there, right?</font></i>

186
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,973
<i><font color="white">Take that and leave now.
Don't hang around in there.</font></i>

187
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,599
REVISED STANDARD CONTRACT

188
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,477
Ms. Kang.

189
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,521
Did you want to see me?

190
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,025
I wanted to have tea with you.
Do you have time?

191
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,401
Yes, sure.

192
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,866
This is Ms. Shin Ju-gyeong,
a close friend of mine.

193
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,452
This is Ms. Chun Jane
whom I told you about.

194
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,828
Nice to meet you.

195
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,413
Nice to meet you too.

196
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,792
Ju-gyeong's father is
Chairman Shin Seung-cheol of C&G Group.

197
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,963
Nice to meet you.
I've met Chairman Shin a few times.

198
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,759
She's very interested
in the film and agency industry,

199
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,969
so I wanted to introduce you.

200
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,433
Let's be friends.

201
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,934
Can I call you by your name?

202
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,188
Sure, you can do that.

203
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,400
"Enjoy the greatest films in one place."

204
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,487
"This is the 27th year."

205
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,284
"Enjoy the greatest films in one place."

206
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,370
"This is the 27th--"

207
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,623
CHUN JANE

208
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,002
Hi, Jane.

209
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,712
Did you get some rest?

210
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,134
By any chance,
do you know Ms. Shin Ju-gyeong?

211
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,136
How do you know her?

212
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,138
So you do know her.

213
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,433
Can you come to the café
on the first floor for a second?

214
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,186
<i><font color="white">She's here,
and she wants to have lunch with you.</font></i>

215
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,146
No, I'll stay in my room.

216
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,360
You're not that close?

217
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,570
Not really.

218
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,198
I've met her a few times
at sneak preview after-parties.

219
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,324
<i><font color="white">I see.</font></i>

220
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,326
You see,

221
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,539
she attends all kinds of events
and after-parties using her background

222
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,290
to get cozy with celebrities.

223
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,251
<i><font color="white">She also promotes her fashion brand.</font></i>

224
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,628
<i><font color="white">And she bosses new actors around.</font></i>

225
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,213
<i><font color="white">I can't stand her.</font></i>

226
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,006
<i><font color="white">I'll just be rehearsing in my room.</font></i>

227
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,509
Don't stay with her for too long
and come up.

228
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,219
Okay?

229
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,555
Okay, I get what you mean.
I'll sort things out.

230
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,142
Oh, my.

231
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,979
Too bad. She's not feeling well.

232
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,565
She just got here and must be tired.

233
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,777
In that case,

234
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,865
she can come to my birthday party tonight.

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
Your birthday party?

236
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,620
She has interviews booked all evening,

237
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,664
so I don't think she can make it.

238
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,295
A-joong is starring in a new film, right?

239
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,508
You know that film is sponsored by my dad.

240
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,974
I'll send a car over later.
Bring her with you.

241
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,312
-I'm off.
-See you.

242
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,280
What's going on here?

243
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,032
Why are you being so serious?

244
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,826
She just wants A-joong to drop by.

245
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,163
It didn't sound like that to me.

246
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,586
C&G…

247
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,132
is planning to expand into Hollywood soon.

248
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,219
All the foreign filmmakers
in Busan right now

249
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,346
are under C&G control.

250
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,558
You got that dress through C&G too, right?

251
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,771
If you want A-joong to go global,

252
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,564
make sure to bring her to the party.

253
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,484
Play along with
a wannabe celebrity for a while,

254
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,653
and there will be a lot to gain.

255
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,279
Both A-joong

256
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,614
and you.

257
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,164
I'm thinking of taking
an early train tomorrow.

258
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,666
I have some work left.

259
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,084
All right.

260
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,919
You want some coffee tomorrow morning?

261
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,254
No, thanks.

262
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,339
I have a breakfast meeting.

263
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,553
-Eun-soo.
-Yes?

264
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,767
I appreciate that you always put me first.

265
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,564
But from now on,
I want you to put yourself first.

266
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,401
Okay.

267
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,198
Director Ma, we're late.

268
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,783
-Let's hurry.
-Okay, let's go.

269
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,702
Call me, Jin-hyeok.

270
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,871
-Hang in there.
-You can go next time, Jin-hyeok.

271
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,791
-Let's go.
-We're late.

272
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,960
You can always go next year.

273
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,128
Cheer up.

274
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,548
I'll catch up with you tomorrow morning.

275
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,591
See you tomorrow.

276
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,259
Cheer up, Jin-hyeok.

277
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,263
-Jin-hyeok.
-Yes?

278
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,514
Water the plants, okay?

279
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,272
I won't.

280
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,440
I won't!

281
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,864
This will be perfect.

282
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,163
That's a lovely dress.

283
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,414
How have you been?

284
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,503
Hello.

285
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,922
What brings you here?

286
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,592
Director Ma isn't here, I swear.

287
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,594
I know. He left for Busan.

288
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,890
I'm here today to see you, Eun-soo.

289
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,393
Me? Why?

290
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,312
Can you give me

291
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,690
his schedule and the name of his hotel?

292
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,652
But don't tell him anything.

293
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,573
Sure.

294
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,283
Just a second, please.

295
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,583
By the way,

296
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,962
is there a way to book a flight to Busan?

297
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,964
The train tickets are sold out.

298
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,594
I asked just in case, so never mind.

299
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,433
Are you going there to see Director Ma?

300
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,401
Yes.

301
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,364
I'd like to change the passenger's name.

302
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,912
The app isn't working currently.

303
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,956
Yes.

304
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,041
It's Yoo Eun-soo.

305
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,337
Please change it to…

306
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,508
Song Eun-ha.

307
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,638
No, it's Song Eun-ha.

308
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,350
Song Eun-ha.

309
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,858
<i><font color="white">Just pretend you're having
a meal with a fan.</font></i>

310
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,693
She's not my fan.

311
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,906
She just wants to brag
that she knows the host of the festival.

312
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,368
I doubt she even knows
what films I starred in.

313
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,331
She probably invited everyone she knows,
just to show off.

314
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,252
You know connections are important
in this line of work, don't you?

315
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,088
The party is thrown by C&G.

316
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,549
Many foreign filmmakers will be there.

317
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,678
We've been working so hard
for your American debut.

318
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,305
This is a great opportunity.

319
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,392
To get what we want,
the end justifies the means.

320
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,394
Is that what you mean?

321
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,194
It wouldn't hurt
to be on good terms with C&G.

322
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,948
Without C&G, the dress
wouldn't have been possible. Originally--

323
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,125
It was originally supposed to be worn
by another actress?

324
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,674
You know how fiercely actresses compete
for dresses for film festivals.

325
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:45,387
Every agent wants their actress
to wear the best dress.

326
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,600
Jane.

327
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,102
Yes?

328
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,439
Being an actress,

329
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,610
and working with great colleagues on set

330
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,072
are all I need to be happy.

331
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,201
Am I being too selfish?

332
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,997
I know

333
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,792
that you and everyone at the agency

334
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,294
work day and night to support me.

335
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,922
I know that.

336
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,135
A-joong.

337
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,603
I'll go.

338
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,690
I'll attend Ju-gyeong's birthday party.

339
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,401
Let me get ready.

340
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,194
See you in the lobby.

341
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,697
Okay.

342
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,885
What? Hey.

343
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,096
What are you doing here?

344
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,473
I've been invited
to the reception tomorrow.

345
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,684
Personally by the investors.

346
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,605
What? Did you think
I came here to see you?

347
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,904
Are you seeing that guy,
Lee Sang-uk, again?

348
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,948
-That's none of your business.
-But it is.

349
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,909
What if you get distracted
and can't get your job done?

350
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,621
Is everything okay with A-joong?

351
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,709
Rona Mikel is launching a brand
in Asia next year.

352
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,211
C&G will be investing,
and I'll be their broker.

353
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,591
You're trying to promote
the Rona Mikel brand…

354
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,760
Hey.

355
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,598
-You're using a client for personal needs?
-It's a win-win situation.

356
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,517
The whole world will notice A-joong
if she wears that dress.

357
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,604
Isn't that what you want?

358
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,191
Achieving your goal
by whatever means necessary.

359
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,113
Rona's investors
will be at the party tomorrow.

360
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,825
I'll send some outfits up,
so make sure she wears them.

361
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,395
What's going on? What are you doing here?

362
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,606
I sent the car away.

363
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,610
-Why?
-I made a mistake.

364
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,698
I thought I was doing this for your sake,

365
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,327
but I almost failed to protect
the most important thing.

366
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,622
"Important thing"?

367
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,374
My client's dignity

368
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,711
as an actress.

369
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,471
I told Ju-gyeong that you can't make it
because you're not feeling well.

370
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,224
So get some rest in your room.

371
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,936
I'm sorry you dressed up for nothing.

372
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,480
I'm really sorry. I'll get going now.

373
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,069
Chun Jane.

374
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,657
Yes, A-joong.

375
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,369
What's with you?

376
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,331
Why do you have to be so cool?

377
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,004
That was really touching.

378
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,552
Since I'm already dressed up,
let's go for a drink.

379
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,846
There's a bar downstairs. Okay?

380
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,516
Let's go.

381
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,441
Not going home?

382
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,568
Didn't you have an early train to catch?

383
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,278
I'm not going.

384
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,825
You're going to stay here all night
and go straight there?

385
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,578
No. I'm not going to Busan.

386
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,871
What?

387
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:26,418
I forgot I had booked
a meridian massage this weekend.

388
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,630
Oh, my.

389
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,926
Why does everyone pull my leg
all the time?

390
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,265
Take this ticket to the opening.

391
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,733
-For me?
-Be careful and have fun.

392
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,569
The train tickets are sold out,
so take the company car.

393
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,446
I'll get a ticket somehow.

394
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,031
Thank you so much.

395
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,117
Someone, please cancel their ticket.
I beg you.

396
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,160
Please.

397
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,205
What's wrong?

398
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,457
What do you mean?

399
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,750
Never mind.

400
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,379
Please. I just need one canceled ticket.

401
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,846
Thank you so much.

402
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,306
I'll have a great time.
I really appreciate it.

403
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,695
SEAT AVAILABLE

404
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,790
I can't believe this.

405
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,500
There isn't a single cancellation.

406
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,128
My goodness.

407
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,505
Just take the company car.

408
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,216
I can't. I have night blindness.

409
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,345
I guess I can't go.

410
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,513
I'll just

411
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,391
stay here with you.

412
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,935
Poor me.

413
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,110
What's wrong?

414
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,447
-Oh, my.
-Jin-hyeok.

415
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,324
What's going on?

416
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,827
Thank you, Jin-hyeok.

417
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,508
Who is it?

418
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,472
Honey.

419
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,064
Are you here for Eun-gyul?

420
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,107
Yes.

421
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,610
Partly.

422
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,364
And some other things too.

423
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,907
He's doing fine.

424
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,159
His acting is pretty good too.

425
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,995
He's doing fine on his own
even without my help.

426
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,373
Of course.

427
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,708
He's my son after all.

428
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,341
You're attending
the opening ceremony later, right?

429
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,803
I'll get you a seat.

430
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,888
While we were separated,

431
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,976
I gave it a lot of thought.

432
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,689
And I still couldn't forgive you.

433
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,609
You absolutely ruined our marriage.

434
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,031
But then…

435
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,702
this thought hit me.

436
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,415
"Did I ever see you for who you are?"

437
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,168
After everything that happened,

438
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:59,298
I think I finally understand
who you really are.

439
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,262
And that neither of us are perfect.

440
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,226
How about we accept that…

441
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,606
and start over?

442
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,446
And make up for each other's flaws.

443
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,036
Eun-gyul told me

444
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,705
that girl…

445
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,208
got in trouble while trying to help you.

446
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,796
I know you're hesitating.

447
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,673
You should…

448
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,969
stop neglecting her.

449
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,891
<i><font color="white">What do you mean, the dress is gone?</font></i>

450
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,476
That's what I want to ask you.

451
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,979
-C&G gave you that dress?
-Yes.

452
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,817
They barged in and took it away,
saying there had been a mistake.

453
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,158
Apparently, it's going back to Kang Cho-a.

454
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,160
What's going on?

455
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,457
Let me make a phone call.

456
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,134
Yes?

457
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,804
<i><font color="white">What do you think you're doing?</font></i>

458
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,723
-What do you mean?
-Cut it out and bring the dress over.

459
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,602
<i><font color="white">Jane, you don't seem to understand
the predicament you're in.</font></i>

460
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,730
This dress was supposed to be
worn by Kang Cho-a,

461
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,816
but I pulled some strings for you.

462
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,527
Rona and I are best friends, you see.

463
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,947
Is this about yesterday? Can't you keep
business and private separate?

464
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,492
The ceremony is in three hours.
Where are you? I'll come to you.

465
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,993
<i><font color="white">Bring A-joong with you.</font></i>

466
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,620
What?

467
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,164
I want her to apologize to me
for yesterday

468
00:31:56,248 --> 00:32:00,335
and promise to attend
the official party thrown by C&G

469
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,629
after the opening ceremony with me.

470
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,341
-Then I'll give you the dress.
-Apologize for what? What did she do?

471
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,220
Suit yourself.

472
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,142
But it seems like
there are a ton of foreign reporters

473
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,769
who came here to cover this dress.

474
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,563
Should I just give it to Star Media?

475
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,315
-Ms. Shin.
-I can't wait long.

476
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,415
The opening ceremony starts soon.
What will you do?

477
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,709
Let me think for a second.

478
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,793
I'll go.

479
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,467
She wants me to apologize, right?

480
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,135
So typical.

481
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,512
I'll do it. It's no big deal.

482
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,348
You jumped through hoops
to get that dress.

483
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,435
And we planned the whole look based on it.

484
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,313
I can take care of it.

485
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,399
-I'll go and--
-No.

486
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,235
She won't change her mind
unless I go personally.

487
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,488
Wait here.

488
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,948
I'll go and bring the dress back.

489
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,960
Ju-gyeong.

490
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,797
Did I upset you?

491
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,343
I was feeling lousy yesterday.

492
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,970
That's why I couldn't make it
to your party.

493
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,640
Are you sure that's why?

494
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,433
Yes, I'm telling you.

495
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,312
I didn't want to ruin the mood
at your party by being sick there.

496
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,939
-I see.
-Right?

497
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,650
That's why I didn't come.
It was for your sake.

498
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,695
This is why I like you.

499
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,907
You know when to give in.

500
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,581
I guess our little misunderstanding

501
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,001
has all been cleared up now.

502
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,228
I was afraid you'd turned into
one of those self-important actors.

503
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,109
-What?
-You know how it is.

504
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,444
Actors who think
filmmaking is oh-so-important

505
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,489
and refuse to care about anything
other than acting and movies.

506
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,701
Those who are stubborn
and idiotic for their own good.

507
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,998
They have to give in
when they run out of money anyway.

508
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,084
What's the point of being so proud?

509
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:52,424
By the way, about that agent of yours.

510
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,259
I think she needs a lesson.

511
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,595
She's so stuck up.

512
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,889
She must think
she's on the same level as her client.

513
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,894
In reality,
she just mooches off celebrities.

514
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,855
She needs to know that.

515
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,399
Shouldn't you talk to her?

516
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,570
I really wanted to keep to myself,
but I just can't do that with you.

517
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,739
What? Self-important actors?

518
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,074
Then what are you?

519
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,243
A self-important heiress?

520
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,787
An attention seeker
obsessed with connections?

521
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,999
And what?

522
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,753
My agent mooches off celebrities?

523
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,005
Gosh.

524
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,466
It takes one to know one.

525
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,634
-What?
-My goodness.

526
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,635
You're right.

527
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,429
You need money to make films, no doubt.

528
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,099
But we're not putting
our heart and soul into movies

529
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,267
just to make money.

530
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,603
Hey.

531
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,357
Here's a little advice
coming from me as your elder.

532
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,526
Learn to respect others
before you brag about your money.

533
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,737
Understand?

534
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,158
Hey, what's going on?

535
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,077
You don't need that dress?

536
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,621
You really shouldn't do this to me.

537
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,751
You want an apology?

538
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,090
Here you go.

539
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,218
Wear that dress yourself

540
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,596
and get a lot of thumbs-ups
from your social media friends.

541
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,809
But I'm not sure if it'll fit you.

542
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,562
It's been tailored to fit me.

543
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,524
Wait…

544
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,441
Hey!

545
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,610
Have you forgotten who I am?

546
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,238
I mean…

547
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,282
I just lost my cool
when I heard what she said.

548
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,162
I should've gone with you.

549
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:47,956
I should've gone and

550
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,001
showered her
with every Korean cuss I knew.

551
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,671
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

552
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,717
She says she lost her cool,
but she's just so elegant.

553
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,094
Don't you think so?
She's an actress after all.

554
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:05,515
We all should've gone and spat
a dozen English swear words at her too.

555
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,643
My client did so well.
That sure feels nice.

556
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,565
But…

557
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
what do we do now?

558
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,989
We'll figure something out.

559
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,160
-Hello.
-How about this?

560
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,828
-The thing is…
-Find out and get back to me.

561
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,205
-Hello. How have you been?
-Okay?

562
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,332
-I'm wondering…
-Please call me.

563
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,501
-Hello.
-By any chance…

564
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,921
I'm going to the department store.
To buy something off the rack.

565
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,882
No, that's not going to work.

566
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,218
There are a ton of reporters
from overseas.

567
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,138
We need something better than that dress.

568
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,603
I know some designers in Seoul,
but none in Busan.

569
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,607
Hold on a second.

570
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,485
Didn't you say
that <i><font color="white">hanbok</font></i> designer, Han Bo-reum,

571
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,904
has his atelier here in Busan?

572
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,072
Yes.

573
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,283
Is that right?

574
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,913
-This is nice.
-Yes, it is.

575
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,581
-This one is nice too.
-Right?

576
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,793
It'll go well with this.
So let's do these two and the skirt.

577
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,879
Let's try it out and see how it goes.

578
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,340
Hello.

579
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,676
Hey. I got a call from your mom.

580
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,847
I'm sorry about yesterday.

581
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,015
I brought this.

582
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,269
Oh, my. You didn't have to.

583
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,234
Have a seat.

584
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,656
So…

585
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,951
you were upset
because I gossiped about celebrities?

586
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,416
The celebrities you worked with
must be so lucky.

587
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,796
How reassured would they feel
to have an agent standing up for them?

588
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,424
Wait a second. I'll get you some tea.

589
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,519
I can't.

590
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,314
It'll be on the covers
of the most renown fashion magazines.

591
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,900
It'll be a great opportunity
for you as well.

592
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:25,822
You may not be aware,
but I don't need that kind of publicity.

593
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,365
I'm aware.

594
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,618
Your works are already being endorsed
by celebrities on social media.

595
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,830
But being in foreign magazines
is meaningful.

596
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,124
More so because it's <i><font color="white">hanbok</font></i>.

597
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,336
I beg you.

598
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,172
We really need your work.

599
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:47,677
My family has been in this business
for three generations.

600
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,722
And I've never been told
to hand over my work this way.

601
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,473
I understand your situation,

602
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,060
but my mother won't sit back
if I sold off my work

603
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,146
like it's an off-the-rack item.

604
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,272
I'm sorry.

605
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,034
Thank you for the tea.

606
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,704
Thanks for coming. Get home safe.

607
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,623
-See you.
-Bye.

608
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,836
Hyun-joo!

609
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,047
What are you doing here?

610
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,926
What about you?

611
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,802
Well…

612
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,181
-I…
-Son.

613
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,309
What time should we have dinner?

614
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,524
Did she just say "son"?

615
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,110
Yes.

616
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,783
So you're asking me to persuade my son
to give you his <i><font color="white">hanbok</font></i>?

617
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,034
Yes.

618
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,119
I beg you.

619
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,538
Do as they say.

620
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,000
Bo-reum always listens to you.

621
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,048
Why does it have to be my son's dress?

622
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,551
I'm sure you can easily find
a beautiful dress.

623
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:14,555
So why does it have to be his?
That's what I don't understand.

624
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,728
Your son's clothes
make the wearer stand out.

625
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,857
Every year, people talk about
how bold, revealing,

626
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,401
and unique each dress is.

627
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:31,364
But I want people to focus
on the actress than the dress itself.

628
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:36,995
That's why I need Mr. Han's work.

629
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,957
I get what you mean,

630
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,168
but there's nothing I can do
if the designer himself says no.

631
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,337
Please go back.

632
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,175
Wait, ma'am!

633

She's here. Hurry!

634
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,934
Be careful.

635
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,941
Take the bridge, then the mountain pass.
It'll be much faster.

636
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,902
Mountain pass?
I just need to follow the GPS, right?

637
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,865
Have you ever driven in Busan?

638
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,700
Follow the GPS and you'll be late.

639
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,721
Hold on tight.

640
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,067
Hey.

641
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:52,653

Hurry. You have less than an hour.

-Okay. I'll call you.
-All right.

Mr. Kim!

647
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,665
Do I look weird?

648
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,833
No.

649
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,379
Practice keeping your eyes wide open.

650
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,299
When the reporters see you,
their camera flashes will go off.

651

Thank you for bringing me here.

652

It's to cheer me up

after what happened
with Director Oh's movie, right?

654
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,022
I shouldn't have complained so much to you

655
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,399
when you've done nothing wrong.

656

I'm so sorry.

657

Don't be.

658
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,408
I'll try to shake it off
and work harder from now on.

659
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,746
Well…

I'm glad I listened to you

-We can see him up close.
-Right?

685
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,873
And it's nice with just the two of us.

686
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,755
I saw that Eun-gyul
shot a commercial for this.

Are you proud?

Of course.

I've quit coffee and switched to these.

690

You're kidding me.

691
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,228
It's true.

She's beautiful.

Gosh, you scared me.

706

Okay, everything's good now.

That's a lot of toppings.

Watch it on the big screen.

You brat.

713

Who's the host this year?

714
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:02,439
Kim A-joong.

715
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,442
Who's the male host?

716
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,903
There isn't any. She's the sole host.

Really?

718

Look at the cheese stretch.

00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,675
How is this possible?

Good evening, I'm Actress Kim A-joong.

I feel thrilled and nervous

738

to be the host of this honorable event.

739
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:44,750
For me, nothing is more touching

740
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,962
than seeing the end credits roll up.

741
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,006
Seeing the cast and crew list…

742
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:56,387
"The director of photography
filmed us so beautifully."

"The production manager

744

stood in the middle of the road
and stopped all the cars himself,

putting up with the drivers' complaints,

so that we could focus on acting."

747

I'm always reminded of their efforts.

748
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,360
But sometimes,

749
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:17,449
we overlook each and every act
of dedication that has been made for us.

750
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,123
And we're led to believe
that we deserve to take the shortcuts

offered by those who have
power and influence.

752

There are people who quietly support me

behind the scenes at all times.

754
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:44,059
Movies cannot be made
without their efforts.

Thanks to their passion and hard work,

756

Social media is blowing up.

Foreign fans are desperate to know
where A-joong's dress is from.

767
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,215
Who is it?

768
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:00,594
Ms. Chun wants me
to write a press release.

769

Do you feel sad
after watching the ceremony?

773

It's not like that.

774
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,630
It's just that…

775

00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,067
<i><font color="white">I had to guess your size.
I hope it fits you.</font></i>

789
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,535
Hyun-joo.

790
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,297
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

791
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,299
It's beautiful.

792
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,093
-Hey.
-Hi.

793
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,482
My goodness.

794
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,901
Here.

795
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,121
Mom.

796
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,832
Can I really go?

797
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,545
Even if I stop you,
you won't listen to me anyway.

798
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,423
Please

799
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,926
take good care of Hyun-joo.

800
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,930
Thanks, Mom.

801
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,724
Gross. Get off me. Jeez.

802
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,312
Right. The <i><font color="white">hanbok</font></i> lady called me earlier

803
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,439
and asked me
about Youngtak's concert tickets.

804
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,774
What's that about?

805
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,609
Oh, that…

806
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,487
It's nothing.

807
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,534
Hey! My goodness.

808
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,077
You can't go in there!

809
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,292
-Thank you.
-Sure.

810
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,252
-Mr. Kim. Hello.
-Hello.

811
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,130
-Director Jang.
-Thanks.

812
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,882
-She's lived in New Zealand.
-Excuse me.

813
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,051
She speaks perfect English.

814
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,015
Hello.

815
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,142
Thank you.

816
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:40,731
Excuse me for a second.

817
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,402
Sang-uk, have you gotten off work?

818
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,987
<i><font color="white">I'm getting off work now.</font></i>

819
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,365
But it's so late.

820
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,034
<i><font color="white">You're still outside too?</font></i>

821
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,161
<i><font color="white">-Is this a bad time?
</font></i>-No.

822
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,247
We're almost done here. It's fine.

823
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,625
I miss you.

824
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,336
I miss you too.

825
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,090
I saw the opening ceremony.
It was amazing.

826
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,843
You have no idea what I went through.

827
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,637
I'll tell you when we meet.

828
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,972
Won't you be tired when you get back?

829
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,933
Are you sure we can meet on Sunday?

830
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,644
-We can postpone.
-No.

831
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,855
We finally managed to book
a table at that restaurant.

832
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,148
<i><font color="white">Hold on.</font></i>

833
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,402
<i><font color="white">What's going on?
Is it our anniversary that day?</font></i>

834
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,697
<i><font color="white">Why are you laughing?</font></i>

835
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,699
It's a secret.

836
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,285
Anyway, I'll see you on Sunday.

837
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,955
Sang-uk, I'll call you back. Sorry.

838
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,042
You did great today.

839
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,710
You too.

840
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:48,715
Did I tell you that I used to work
at the Entertainment Department of KBB?

841
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,262
I worked my butt off for about ten years.

842
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,431
But then I reached my limit.

843
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:01,436
No matter how hard I worked,
I was nothing more than an employee.

844
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,398
So I started my own production company.

845
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,985
I guess Ju-gyeong helped you a lot.

846
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,278
And that's how you got to direct BIFF.

847
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,409
You're not going to stay
at Method, are you?

848
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:20,956
I doubt you'd be content
working under someone else.

849
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,419
My ex-husband

850
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,589
is running a talent agency
called ST in Los Angeles.

851
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,509
-Have you heard of it?
-Yes, I have.

852
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,554
He's planning to establish
a New York branch next year.

853
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:39,266
When I told him about you,
he wanted to meet you.

854
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,691
Think carefully…

855
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:54,072
which position would suit you better.

856
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,911
Hello, Director.

857
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,122
Have you been well?

858
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,504
Eun-gyul, say goodbye.

859
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,139
You must be tired. You can leave now.

860
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,141
No, I'm fine.

861
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,851
I need to stay next to you

862
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,146
for people to think the company
is paying special attention to you.

863
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,858
I don't think I'm that special.

864
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,151
You are.

865
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,277
What?

866
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,658
Should we

867
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,078
speak casually?

868
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,082
Sure.

869
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,810
Thank you.

870
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,030
Ms. Chun.

871
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:31,169
I was in a rush earlier,
so I didn't get to thank you properly.

872
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,256
Thank you so much.

873
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,382
Don't mention it.

874
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,219
How do you like being away from work?

875
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,720
Do you like it?

876
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,557
It's been awful.

877
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,643
If I'd quit over such a trivial matter,
I would've quit long ago.

878
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,769
You have a long way to go.

879
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,731
I…

880
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,027
want to become an agent like you.

881
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:02,701
I know I'm extremely inadequate
compared to you now.

882
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,244
Don't say that.

883
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:09,166
But until I become an agent like you

884
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,586
I won't ever be giving up

885
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,090
as long as you put your trust in me.

886
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,390
Can you speak English?

887
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,810
Yes, I can speak it a little.

888
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,190
Hyun-joo.

889
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,357
Yes?

890
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,777
Do you want to go to the US with me?

891
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,654
What?

892
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,119
It's not easy.

893
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:49,331
I have to sit at the desk all the time,

894
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,667
and some auditions are
during working hours.

895
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:56,546
But it's not all bad after all.
I get to audition,

896
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,839
and my profile…

897
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,551
Hee-sun, can we talk?

898
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,595
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

899
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,846
See you.

900
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,308
What's the matter?

901
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:14,981
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

902
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,318
Actually…

903
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,612
The thing is…

904
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,657
I…

905
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,660
Me too.

906
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,495
What?

907
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,121
I like you too.

908
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:36,461
I was going to tell you
after I starred in a movie.

909
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,800
DIRECTOR OH HUN

Coming here would only make you
more upset.

That's right. It's over.

She's a colleague. I'm looking for her.

947
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,055
She just checked out and left.

948
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:26,381
Have you heard of ST Agency in the US?

949
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,633
Isn't that a talent agency in LA?

950
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,303
I heard the CEO is Korean.

951
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,305
I'm thinking of taking it over.

952
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,516
You?

953
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,727
What? You don't think I can?

954
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,231
No, that's not it.

955
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,358
If that happens,

956
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,570
would you be interested in leading

957
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,780
Method Entertainment's LA branch?

958
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,445
Gosh.

959
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,782
I'm the worst

960
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,578
both as an agent and as a man.

961
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,124
I envy you.

962
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,752
You're successful

963
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,838
in both your career and your love life.

964
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,428
And I'm about to get another role.

965
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,932
What's that?

966
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,398
Let me enjoy the view for now.

967
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,416
By the way,

968
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,961
which direction is the US?

969
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,756
-Isn't it that way?
-It's that way.

970
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,092
Wake her up and ask her.

971
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,428
Do you know where the US is?

972
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,723
That's too far off.

973
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,308
She has no clue.

974
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,645
She must not be from the US.

975
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,192
Have a drink with me.

976
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:07,185
BEHIND EVERY STAR

977
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,853
It's true.

978
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,563
-What is?
-Hi, Hyun-joo.

979
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,649
-It's true, I swear.
-I mean, what is?

980
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,234
Nice. Do you like this?

981
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,586
Do it properly
or you won't get any presents.

982
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,928
Hyun-joo, do you know
how this thing works?

983
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,054
-This?
-Yes.

984
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,431
Like this.

985
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,852
-Nice.
-It's on!

986
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,732
It's working.
