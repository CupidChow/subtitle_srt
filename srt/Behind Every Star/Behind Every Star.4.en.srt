00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,953
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,872
EPISODE 4

3
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,881
I heard you've mostly worked with actors.

4
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,884
Could you tell me who?

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,886
I'm afraid not.

6
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,763
Client confidentiality, you know.

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,641
Right, of course.

8
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,897
As I said, you'll be working set hours.

9
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,191
How about you start at 9 a.m.?

10
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:10,445
I'd like to look at a few more places
and think it over first.

11
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:16,285
I tend to be quite picky
when it comes to working conditions.

12
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,370
Goodbye. I'll be in touch.

13
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,791
Why is hiring a nanny so difficult?

14
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,213
They say the stars have to align for you
to find a good nanny.

15
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,464
My goodness.

16
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,594
Have you had a look
at the synopsis I sent you?

17
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,432
I skimmed through it, but I'm not sure.

18
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,851
You can't delay your career any longer.

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,021
I want to get back to work too.
I get more anxious as time goes by.

20
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,734
Are there any action productions like
<i>My Name</i> available right now?

21
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,486
We should pick something
simple and popular instead.

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,905
You said you wanted to become
more famous in Korea.

23
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,159
They know you in the US because of
<i>The Avengers</i>, but not in Korea.

24
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,205
You need a role
that everyone remembers you by.

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,625
The best way to become popular in Korea

26
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,586
is to play a character
that's approachable and relatable.

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,714
Like a girl next door.

28
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,343
What about a girl next door
who can also kick ass?

29
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,472
I don't want them to think
I've gotten lazy after having a child.

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,682
I think I just need to
stick to what I do best

31
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,476
for people to start recognizing me.

32
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,561
Plus, niche genres are
in fashion these days.

33
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,564
It's going to be tough doing
action scenes after giving birth.

34
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,567
Not at all. I'm already back in shape.

35
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,944
Take a look.

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,989
And it'll take too long to prepare.

37
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,908
You don't even have a nanny yet.

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,036
Gosh, I'll find someone as soon as I can.

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,706
If you find a really good action film,
I can start right away.

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,791
What do you say?

41
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,549
-Mr. Kim!
-Yes?

42
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,220
I got some new headshots taken.
Can you take a look?

43
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,679
Right now?

44
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,515
If you're busy, it can wait.

45
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,642
No, it's okay. I'll take a look.

46
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,020
Great. I just did
what the photographer told me to do.

47
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,564
I'm worried they look a bit awkward.

48
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,776
Headshots can make or break new actors.

49
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,612
They have to be eye-catching…

50
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,573
and impactful.

51
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,327
Is it that bad? Should I take some more?

52
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,497
No, it looks amazing.

53
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,584
You look so natural.

54
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,921
I like your smile.

55
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,715
You look adorable.

56
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,095
You look a little stuck-up and stubborn,

57
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,805
but it also captures
your childlike innocence.

58
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,348
This is just perfect.

59
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,016
You look gorgeous.

60
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,352
I'll use the first three
as your profile photos.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,647
Okay. Thank you.

62
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,900
This is Method Entertainment.

63
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,654
Having fun raising false hopes?

64
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,114
I don't know what you mean.

65
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,199
She's a diamond in the rough.

66
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,243
Then why hasn't anyone cast her already?

67
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,203
We've had countless directors visit us.

68
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,415
She's now going after
an agent to become a star.

69
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,333
-I applaud her effort.
-You're wrong.

70
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,419
I was the one
who asked her to sign with me.

71
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,298
Will the data I requested be ready
by the end of this week?

72
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,675
Sure, if you say so.

73
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,184
They now call him "the Vacuum."

74
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,561
He doesn't miss
even the smallest speck of dirt.

75
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,898
He's just doing his job properly.

76
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,608
Just mind your own business.

77
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,573
"Lee Sang-uk."

78
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,995
Lee Sang-uk…

79
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,417
There you are.

INDOOR CLIMBING BECAUSE
THE WEATHER OUTSIDE IS BAD

82
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,979
Show mama what you're made of.

83
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,502
What do you want?

84
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't mind me.

85
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,059
Let's see.

86
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,437
Where did I put it?

87
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,818
What are you looking for?

88
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,987
A pain-relief patch.

89
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,366
Mr. Wang used to keep some in here
for his sore muscles.

90
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,454
I went rock climbing
for the first time in forever,

91
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,915
and now I'm sore all over.

92
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,629
Do you like rock climbing?

93
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,298
I love it.

94
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,553
You know how your whole body aches
when you take off your clothes

95
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,098
after rock climbing, right?

96
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,143
Then you step into a hot shower,
and it just feels heavenly.

97
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,027
Someone at my workplace
is also mad about rock climbing.

98
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,154
We share the same name.

99
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,658
I'm not that into climbing.

100
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,163
Why bother when you're
just going to come back down?

101
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,507
It's become quite chilly.

102
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,138
I'll leave you to it then.

103
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,457
MANAGER CHUN JANE

104
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,753
EXPENSE REPORT

105
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,674
Take a seat.

106
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,151
It's going to be a hit.

107
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,655
See? I told you it was amazing.

108
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,741
I heard it was highly sought after.
I can see why.

109
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,412
We're talking with Netflix
and Disney at the moment, but…

110
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,583
-I have to take this. May I?
-No problem.

111
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,751
Excuse me.

112
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,713
Casting's almost over, right?

113
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,631
Yes, for the lead roles at least.

114
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,967
Who's the lead actor?

115
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,427
Her name is Choi Hui-jin.

116
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,596
She exclusively performed on the stage,
so you wouldn't know her.

117
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,516
Bringing in new talent can be fun,
though it has its risks.

118
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,520
It seems the lead actress
will be in a lot of action scenes,

119
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,523
be charmingly intelligent,
and also speak fluent English.

120
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,445
What's the matter?

121
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,656
Someone just sprang to mind.

122
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,574
Who?

123
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,160
Soo-hyun. You know her, right?

124
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,705
Kim Soo-hyun from <i>My Love from the Star</i>?
But he's a man.

125
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,374
Soo-hyun, the actress from <i>the Avengers</i>.

126
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,335
<i>That</i> Soo-hyun? I do know her.

127
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,421
But is she in Korea?

128
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,299
Of course.
She's looking for new work in Korea.

129
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,468
I thought she was
only doing American projects.

130
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,517
Right, she had a child.

131
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,019
So she is in Korea.

132
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,646
She's also a big fan of yours.

133
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,899
I bet she's seen all of your films.

134
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,358
Really?

135
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,617
It's about a former CIA agent

136
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,369
who becomes a killer for hire in Korea.

137
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,955
It also has elements of comedy

138
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,999
and a lot of emotional scenes.

139
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,338
This is just what I was looking for.

140
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,216
Why didn't you show me this sooner?

141
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,511
I only got it just recently.

142
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,888
The director apparently
had you in mind all along.

143
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,057
-Really?
-Yes.

144
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,603
This will be a turning point
in your career.

145
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,107
Show the Korean audience
what you're made of.

146
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,076
-You haven't found a nanny yet?
-I did.

147
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,078
Something came up,
so she couldn't make it.

148
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,871
Don't worry. She'll be here tomorrow.

149
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,415
Can you make the meeting tomorrow then?

150
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,750
Of course. No problem.

151
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,462
I was wondering if you've had a look
at Ms. Kang Hee-sun's profile.

152
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,214
Her profile.

153
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,260
It's Kang, not Jang. It's Kang Hee-sun.

154
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,137
Don't you have her profile?

155
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,930
It's Kang.

156
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,640
What's wrong with being 171cm tall?

157
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,851
Have the co-star wear thick insoles.

158
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,352
Or she can do it barefoot.

159
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,856
Yes, she has perfect, straight teeth.

160
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,484
What makes you think
a slave can't have straight teeth?

161
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,111
That's your prejudice talking.

162
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,821
What about the courtesan role?

163
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,407
You think she looks too exotic for it?

164
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,075
Okay.

165
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,499
Everyone is in love with you.

166
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,711
Then how come no one wants me to audition?

167
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,338
That's how it is at the beginning
of any actor's career.

168
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,717
Guess how many times
Yeo-jeong got turned down.

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,510
She got turned down too?

170
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,178
You bet.

171
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,348
Half of an actor's job is waiting.

172
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,059
Those who can wait patiently
succeed in the end.

173
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,063
But I've already waited years.

174
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,609
Don't worry too much.

175
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,362
Someone is bound to see your worth
sooner or later.

176
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,491
Like I did.

177
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,620
<i>I sent you the revised script.</i>

178
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:49,042
You can find some of
the director's previous films on Netflix.

179
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,963
Fine. If you don't have time,
at least check out some reviews.

180
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,092
Anyway, I'm in a meeting right now.
I'll call you back. Bye.

181
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,220
Sorry about that.

182
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,056
Something came up at work.

183
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,351
That was Tae-ja's go-to excuse
when he was cheating on me.

184
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,564
I recently got a call from his mistress.

185
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,067
She asked if she had
any share in the company

186
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,695
while making a lame attempt
to fake morning sickness.

187
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,661
Someone offered to buy the company
for a fairly high price.

188
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,375
They must not know
there's a tax investigation going on.

189
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,127
Would they still want to
when the company's in shambles?

190
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,129
You don't have to worry about that.

191
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,342
The company is well enough
to survive some fines.

192
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,680
Could you tell me who wants to buy it?

193
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,139
New Shaolu Entertainment.

194
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,350
You've heard of them, right?

195
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,727
They're called
the SM Entertainment of China.

196
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,774
They promised to retain
the four top-level agents including you.

197
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,069
To keep them interested,

198
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,322
the tax investigation
will have to go well.

199
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,157
Employment retention, my ass.

200
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,201
We'll be fired as soon as they take over.

201
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,120
We need to do something.

202
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,122
Like what?

203
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,250
What?

204
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,502
Well…

205
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,089
We could go to the press
about our clients being bought by China.

206
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,049
Why not just advertise we're screwed?

207
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,551
We'll lose all our clients.

208
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,472
The tax investigation
is already bad enough,

209
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,058
but it's chaos both inside
and outside the company.

210
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,188
<i>Have you considered my offer?
I trust you'll make the right choice.</i>

211
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,946
Make sure this doesn't affect
our clients negatively.

212
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,867
Also, let's look for Korean investors
who share our vision.

213
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,243
With discretion.

214
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,372
Will any investors be interested,
knowing a tax investigation is underway?

215
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,542
The investigation will pass eventually.

216
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,170
Method is stronger than that.

217
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,591
<i>It was you who called
the National Tax Service.</i>

218
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,302
I looked into it since something felt off.

219
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,637
Apparently, the rumor about
Mr. Wang's tax evasion

220
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,140
began in Method Entertainment
and not Star Media.

221
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,975
And what makes you think it was me?

222
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,478
Jung-don is too much of a coward
to do such a thing.

223
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,523
Method is everything to Ms. Jang,
so it couldn't have been her.

224
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,776
That leaves you and me,

225
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,735
and it wasn't me.

226
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,613
It wasn't me either.

227
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,866
I'm screwed if Method goes under.
So why would I do that?

228
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,535
<i>You're being absurd.</i>

229
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,997
<i>Word has already spread everywhere.</i>

230
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,249
I met Min-ju today,
and that's what she told me.

231
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,585
You know her, right?

232
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,462
A director at Dragon Studio.

233
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,922
I do.

234
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,131
She said that?

235
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,925
That Method was being bought
by a Chinese company?

236
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,803
Yes, she said everyone knows it.

237
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,519
Did you hear any other rumors?

238
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,979
Other rumors? Like what?

239
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,899
Never mind.

240
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,067
Just a second.

241
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,281
With Mr. Wang gone and the company
being bought by a Chinese company,

242
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,867
are you going to stay there?

243
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,162
Didn't you get an offer from Star Media?

244
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,417
If I join a rival company now,
I'll be turning my back on everyone.

245
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,878
Once labeled as a traitor,
I won't be able to work in this field.

246
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,840
Are you sure
this isn't about your colleagues?

247
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,349
Eun-gyul says he'll be home late
and we should eat without him.

248
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,936
He's been coming home late recently.

249
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,271
Something is fishy.

250
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,481
Right.

251
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,026
You know, the new agent at your work.

252
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,737
Was it So Hyun-joo?

253
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,864
What is she like?

254
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,365
Is she nice?

255
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,908
Is she good at her job?

256
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,119
Well, I don't know.

257
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,913
Why not? You must see her every day.

258
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,207
We don't work together much.

259
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,127
Then can you ask around?

260
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,962
I have a feeling

261
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,798
Eun-gyul has a thing for her.

262
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,049
What are you saying?

263
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,761
What's with you?

264
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,556
I was just joking.

265
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,267
Is that something to be so upset about?

266
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,897
Imagine people gossiping about him
fooling around with an agent.

267
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,233
You should keep an eye on him.
He shouldn't be dating any random girl.

268
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,070
I will.

269

LEE SANG-UK

271
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,724
Yes?

272
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,018
Hello?

273
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,978
<i>This is Lee Sang-uk. Where are you?</i>

274
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,440
Hello.

275
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,068
I'm home. Why?

276
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,738
<i>I need you to confirm something.
When are you coming to work?</i>

277
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,408
Afternoon. In the afternoon.

278
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,954
<i>Can we meet now? I'm in a bit of a hurry.</i>

279
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,251
You can come over if that's the case.
I'll send you the address.

280
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,628
<i>All right.</i>

00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,524
There's no time.

283
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,404
Hello.

284
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,321
Mr. Lee.

285
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,239
Hey.

286
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,282
Hi, Sang-uk.

Hello.

COMPANY CREDIT CARD
TRANSACTION DETAILS

290
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,384
There are some transactions
that need to be clarified.

291
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,972
You visited J Hair four times a month,
early in the morning.

292
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,017
My client had to get her hair done
before her morning radio show.

293
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,643
But it's a radio show.

294
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,353
They stream the video too.

295
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,981
Radio but with video…

296
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,441
Yes.

297
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,989
You seem to be a regular
at Stanfirst Hotel.

298
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,325
That's where my client rests
in between shoots.

299
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,410
What?

300
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,872
You think I book hotel rooms
on a company card for personal use?

301
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,209
I can tell what kind of person you are
from your receipts.

302
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,294
Really?

303
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,296
Tell me.

304
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,589
What kind of person am I?

305
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,675
For starters, you're a picky eater.

306
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,720
You also drink more often than you eat.

307
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,182
You have meetings seven days a week.

308
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,433
-And…
-And?

309
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,435
You go through relationships very quickly.

310
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,104
Is that in the receipts?

311
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,317
So it must be true.

312
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,069
No.

313
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,236
It isn't.

314
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,532
Don't tell me you came over
because you wanted to ask me that.

315
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,830
You're not my type, Ms. Chun.

316
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,999
I ask you to respect my boundaries.

317
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,751
Are you really not interested in me?

318
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,632
You came all the way here
when you weren't even interested?

319
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,926
-It was for work--
-No, it wasn't.

320
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,641
We…

321
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,894
should be more honest…

322
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,647
with each other.

323
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,283
Who is it? Excuse me.

324
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,705
Who could it be?

325
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,459
What?

326
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,172
Someone must have the wrong apartment.

327
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,299
Chun Jane!

328
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,386
I know you're home. Open the door.

329
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,265
My bad. Just a second.

330
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,434
Yes?

331
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,940
Alex, it's been a while.

332
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,861
You're already seeing someone new?

333
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,487
Be quiet. Let's talk outside.

334
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,033
You're the one who came on to me,

335
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,369
and you dump me
now that you're bored of me?

336
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,083
After dating you, my soul…

337
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,669
was shredded to pieces.

338
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,005
Be quiet. It was just a month-long fling.

339
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,215
No, it wasn't a fling. I was serious.

340
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,593
I even thought of marrying you.

341
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,846
But you lied to me
about marrying another guy

342
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,056
just to break up with me.

343
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,558
I don't need you in my life.

344
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,727
-That's a relief.
-So that's it.

345
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,441
Are you out of your mind?

346
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,318
This is the current state of my mind.

347
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,444
Chaos.

348
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,321
You clean it up.

349
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,033
You crazy bastard!

350
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,912
Gosh, this is gross.

351
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,292
The world is full of weirdos.
Right? Sang-uk?

352
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,212
Do you want to ask me something?
I can answer anything.

353
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,297
How about some wine?

354
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,757
Or do you prefer coffee?

355
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,468
Do you want to eat?

356
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,137
Ask me anything. What do you want to do?

357
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,431
Sang-uk. Wait a second.

358
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:48,808
Sang-uk.

359
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,601
Sang-uk!

360
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,233
Soo-hyun.

361
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,029
What's going on?
You haven't found a nanny yet?

362
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,657
She quit out of the blue this morning.

363
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,618
I found a new one,
but she couldn't start right away.

364
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,663
This is driving me nuts.

365
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,915
Still, you can't just bring
your baby to work.

366
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,959
I can't just leave the baby home alone.

367
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,089
I barely slept last night.

368
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,302
When the person she helped
murders her entire family,

369
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,974
the main character becomes a hired killer.

370
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,934
I'm so excited.

371
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,770
I've always wanted to star
in an emotional action film.

372
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,775
I knew we'd hit it off
when I heard you were a fan of my films.

373
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,443
Sorry?

374
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:44,947
Right.

375
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,702
By the way,
your Korean is better than I thought.

376
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,538
Of course. I'm Korean.

377
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,085
Look at this star.

378
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,671
Peekaboo. Don't cry.

379
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,548
Then how about this?

380
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,717
A teddy bear.

381
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,510
There, there.

382
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,015
Here you go. Play with the star.

383
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,269
Hello, sir.

384
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,148
Pardon?

385
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,652
Yes, I've made my decision
to join Star Media.

386
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,904
The first shoot will be in LA.

387
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,239
LA?

388
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,577
I thought we start in Seoul
and then fly out to the States.

389
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,621
Oh, you didn't hear?

390
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,707
The American team
couldn't adjust their schedule.

391
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,878
By any chance, is this about your baby?

392
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,921
Do you feel uncomfortable
leaving her here?

393
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,256
No, that's not it.

394
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,594
The most crucial part of this film
is the action.

395
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,263
I want it to be really wild.

396
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,931
Like the movie, <i>Kill Bill</i>.

397
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,561
Only, our main character fights
with her whole body, not just her sword.

398
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,855
One shot, one kill.

399
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,106
Soo-hyun?

400
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,941
Yes?

401
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,943
That sounds awesome.

402
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,322
But it'll be much wilder than you think.

403
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,366
Would that be okay?

404
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,493
Don't worry. I'm made of steel.

405
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,455
If I'm going to do an action film,
I want to do it properly…

406
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,419
Who's this?

407
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,341
It's a misconception that people
become good with babies at my age.

408
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,009
What?

409
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,553
Director Jang,
she's not your baby, is she?

410
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,888
What?

411
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,266
There, there.

412
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,104
-Mommy!
-Anyway,

413
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,855
to pull these action scenes off,

414
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,483
you should start preparing immediately.

415
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,694
Do you have time for that?

416
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,445
I can always make time for work.

417
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,699
If it's inconvenient,
we can make adjustments too.

418
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,243
You know, your kid is still little--

419
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,744
Enough about my kid!

420
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,498
I do understand your concern,

421
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,670
but I'll make sure not to be a nuisance
to you and the team in any way,

422
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,880
so don't worry.

423
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,469
By the way, am I the only one
hearing a baby crying?

424
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,681
Did someone bring their baby to work?

425
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,350
Sir, will you excuse me for a second?

426
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,362
-It's okay.
-Here's Mommy.

427
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,072
Mommy's right here.

428
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,158
-She's right here.
-There, there.

429
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,326
What do we do? She won't stop crying.

430
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,162
-Look at Mommy.
-She's right here.

431
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,330
You're here.

432
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,389
I can't believe she stops crying
as soon as she sees her mom.

433
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,642
You must not be able
to go anywhere without her.

434
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,485
Excuse me.

435
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,029
Hello.

436
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,699
Really?

437
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,494
That would be absolutely great.

438
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,538
Okay, see you later.

439
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,373
Bye.

440
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,005
The nanny is on her way.

441
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,725
Thank you, nanny.

442
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,070
-Did she fall asleep?
-I think so.

443
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,308
Excuse…

444
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,771
What do I do about him?

445
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,401
-Did you want to see me?
-Gosh.

446
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,611
Yes.

447
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,448
The production asked
for a client's childhood photos.

448
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,200
-Can you go and bring--
-Sure.

449
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,994
I'll do that.

450
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,787
He's here.

451
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,331
You know Ko Eun-gyul, right?

452
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,794
The photos will be used in his new series.

453
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,464
Go to his house
and bring five or six photos.

454
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,883
Go where?

455
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,426
His home.

456
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,265
I reviewed Ms. Soo-hyun's contract,
and it looks fine.

457
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,558
Okay, thanks.

458
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,643
I'm stepping out now
and won't be back today.

459
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,561
Good work.

460
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,693
Director Ma!

461
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,283
<i>Check the contract. I sent it to you.
I look forward to working with you.</i>

462
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,618
What's the matter?

463
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,330
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

464
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,341
CONTRACT WITH STAR MEDIA

465
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,677
THANKS, DIRECTOR MA.
I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU JOIN STAR MEDIA.

466
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,397
Oh, my goodness! What do I do?

467
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,317
Wake up!

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,944
What do I do?

469
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,079
Are you okay?

470
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,539
Are you all right?

471
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,460
What's wrong?

472
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,753
It's okay.

473
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,214
Director Ma…

474
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,801
Director Ma? What about him?

475
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,428
He's joining…

476
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,018
Star Media with all his clients.

477
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,270
How could he…

478
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,481
How could he leave me like this?

479
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,567
How could he do this?

480
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,905
What the heck are you talking about?

481
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,657
Look at that.

482
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,284
My goodness.

483
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,611
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

484
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,697
-Great work.
-Let's take five.

485
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,699
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

486
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,409
Let's take a break.

487
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,011
Soo-hyun must be running late.
I apologize.

488
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,763
-Try calling her.
-Okay.

489
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,432
She's not picking up.

490
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,934
When is she coming?

491
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,937
Have you heard anything?

492
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,940
Where are you? Everyone's waiting.

493
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,318
Try calling her again.

494
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,402
What?

495
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,910
Have a seat. I'll go bring the photos.

496
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,495
Okay.

497
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,652
What are you doing?

498
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,909
Here. I already picked some out.

499
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,078
Are your parents going to be home late?

500
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,996
Why?

501
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,374
No reason.

502
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,710
How about this one?

503
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,504
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes.

504
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,089
This one would work too.

505
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,679
Who's this?

506
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,847
My grandma.

507
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,433
She passed away two years ago.

508
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,229
I guess you take after her.

509
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:24,401
I can see from these photos
that you were raised with love.

510
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,611
Do you have anything to tell me?

511
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,532
Like what?

512
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,159
You're hiding something from me.

513
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,371
I'm not.

514
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,457
I think we're done, so I'll be going.

515
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,335
-Let's talk.
-About what?

516
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,045
It won't take long.

517
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,468
Ms. So?

518
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,388
Hello.

519
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,726
What brings you here?

520
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,938
I'm here to get props for work.

521
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,024
I'll be on my way.

522
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,109
You're leaving like this?

523
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,946
-Join us for dinner.
-No, I'm fine.

524
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,239
Is that okay, Eun-gyul?

525
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,782
I don't mind.

526
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,619
Are you worried my husband
might scold you?

527
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,746
Don't worry.

528
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,373
He's going to a sneak preview,
so he'll be late.

529
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,501
Come on in. Please.

530
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,920
Okay. Let's go.

531
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,256
The nanny fell asleep in the room,
leaving the kid alone.

532
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,843
And the kid wandered into the kitchen,
where water was boiling.

533
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,556
It would have been really bad
if I'd been a minute late.

534
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,478
I'll find a new nanny,

535
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,897
so this won't happen again.

536
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,774
You'll find another nanny?

537
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,568
What can I do?
I can't trust the one I have now.

538
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,072
You just missed
a really important meeting.

539
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,407
You could've sent Won-jae here instead.

540
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,243
I know how important the meeting was.

541
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,328
Nothing else came to my mind
at that moment.

542
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,038
My kid almost suffered a burn.

543
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,584
How long are you going to use
your kid as an excuse?

544
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:05,585
"Excuse"?

545
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,212
You wanted this action film.

546
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,131
You wanted Korean audiences
to know your name.

547
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,967
So I got you the perfect role.

548
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,680
It was originally meant
for another actress.

549
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,974
I persuaded the director.

550
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,059
That you'd be much better.

551
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,978
That your childbirth won't be an issue,

552
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,980
and that it'll only make you try harder.

553
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,816
But if your kid keeps you busy,
how does that make me look?

554
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,776
I want to do well too!

555
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,988
But things just keep going wrong!

556
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,700
With my family abroad,
I'm struggling alone here.

557
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,706
I look after the kid and do chores all-day
and have no free time.

558
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,334
All I get to do is work out every day
so I can get back to work.

559
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,339
What's the point?

560
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,509
You can't even find a proper nanny.

561
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,932
If you're going to stay tied to your kid,

562
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,852
maybe you should take some more time off.

563
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,673
Go home!

564
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,966
Damn it, seriously. What's his deal?

565
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,677
Guys.

566
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,389
You shouldn't be riding motorcycles here.

567
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,683
Sirs.

568
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,935
You could've hurt my baby!

569
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,604
Sirs.

570
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,065
Just be on your way, lady.

571
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,900
You don't want to mess with us.

572
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,485
Ma'am.

573
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,611
Jeez.

574
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,280
By any chance,

575
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,409
do you guys recognize me?

576
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,162
-Let me see.
-I know.

577
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:47,747
You're a total drama queen.

578
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,082
That's what you are, right?

579
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,834
Let me see your baby.

580
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,585
Ms. So.

581
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,463
-Just give me a minute here.
-Sure.

582
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,144
You're home early.

583
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,604
-Yes.
-I thought you were going to be late.

584
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,565
But…

585
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,526
I begged her to stay for dinner.

586
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,779
She won't get in trouble with you later,
will she?

587
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,907
Go wash up. Dinner's almost ready.

588
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,288
Ms. Chun told me

589
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,207
to bring some photos of Eun-gyul
for the show he's on.

590
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,294
Hi, Dad.

591
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,129
Hey.

592
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,923
Mom insisted she should stay for dinner.

593
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,932
It's usually me and these two cold men,
so I love having you here, Ms. So.

594
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,144
What was your major?

595
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,229
Library science and literature.

596
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,397
I see.

597
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,193
You said you were from Busan.
Where in Busan?

598
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,195
Honey.

599
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:01,946
Oh, my.

600
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,533
I'm sorry. Dig in.

601
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,995
I'm not usually the nosy type.

602
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,455
What's gotten into me?

603
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,669
How's work as an agent?

604
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,296
It's good.

605
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,925
What's my husband like at work?

606
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,384
They all hate him, don't they?

607
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,969
Honey.

608
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,221
No.

609
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,682
They all look up to him.

610
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,478
They also strive to be like him.

611
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,064
As do I.

612
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,327
Please take good care of Eun-gyul.

613
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,578
Sorry?

614
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,667
Right. Okay.

615
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,127
Thank you for dinner.

616
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,547
I'll see her off.

617
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,799
-Will you?
-I'll go. I left something in my car.

618
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,057
Ms. Chun sent me here, I swear.

619
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,268
-Look at this.
-You should've left right away.

620
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,728
I won't stop you from becoming an agent,

621
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,522
so stay away from Eun-gyul, got that?

622
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,899
Then don't pester me about it.

623
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,527
Go tell your son to stay away from me.

624
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,739
Stop working with him.

625
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,828
Or…

626
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,499
you can just tell them who I am.

627
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,056
What's wrong? Did something happen?

628
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,474
How could you do this?

629
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,560
You're joining Star Media,
of all companies?

630
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:40,730
And you started playing president
acting like you'd save the company.

631
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,982
But then again,
people don't change that easily.

632
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,568
You were also the whistleblower, right?

633
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,695
A whistleblower? What do you mean?

634
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,323
He's the one who reported us
to the National Tax Service.

635
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,241
Really?

636
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,952
Is that true?

637
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,001
Is what she said true?

638
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,588
Are you really the whistleblower?

639
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,093
Director Ma.

640
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,387
Look me in the eye.

641
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,855
Do you have anything to say?

642
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,653
Yes, I'm the one who reported
Mr. Wang's tax evasion.

643
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,739
But it was…

644
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,993
to save Method Entertainment.

645
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,787
To prevent the company from being sold.

646
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,749
-Who would believe that?
-You don't have to.

647
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,168
Anyway, I did my best.

648
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,213
Don't mess with our clients,
or I'll sue you right away.

649
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,882
Go ahead if you can.
I've done nothing illegal.

650
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,648
What is it?

651
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,734
Do you want another blow?

652
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,318
Mr. Wang…

653
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,947
rented a Spinel Hotel suite
for two years using company funds.

654
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,367
His wife told me yesterday.

655
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:20,246
I was going to sort it out,
but I guess I don't have to anymore.

656
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,207
I wish you all good luck.

657
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,089
The general manager is on his way down.

658
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,299
Please wait a moment.

659
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,508
Thank you.

660
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,055
Do you think he'll take our request?

661
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,766
We'll have to beg him.

662
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,977
We just need him to testify
it was rented for work.

663
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,479
What if he refuses to help?

664
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,814
-Act natural.
-What's wrong?

665
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,525
Why, hello.

666
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,028
-Fancy seeing you here.
-What brings you by?

667
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,906
I have some business here.

668
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,450
Please go about your business.

669
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,669
I'm from the National Tax Service.
I'd like to see the manager.

670
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,506
I'm afraid he has an appointment.

671
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,801
Actually, it just got canceled.

672
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,345
Will you have a seat and wait over there?

673
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,140
Are we checked out then?

674
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,975
Yes, you are.

675
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,435
Let's go, sweetie.

676
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,187
Mr. Lee.

677
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:30,024
No one can know you saw us here.

678
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:32,777
Let's go.

679
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,053
ACTRESS SOO-HYUN

680
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,816
MOOD CURATOR

681
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,442
RELAX WITH SOOTHING MUSIC,
LIGHTING, AND A MASSAGE

682
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,711
My goodness. This is unbelievable.

683
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,588
<i>Let me see.</i>

684
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,715
<i>Move it.</i>

685
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,716
Give it here.

686
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:42,930
Damn it.

687
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,391
That startled me.

688
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:47,935
Are you okay?

689
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:50,938
What the hell was that?

690
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,405
Why you…

691
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:02,742
-You old hag.
-Come on!

692
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,997
Damn it.

693
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,087
Jeez.

694
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,923
Man, that hurts.

695
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,512
ACTOR SOO-HYUN GETS
INTO STREET FIGHT WITH MINORS!

696
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,680
Gosh.

697
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,772
How far has it spread?

698
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,649
It's spread to all the big forums

699
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,901
and already has over 300,000 views.

700
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,402
What's worse is that

701
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:43,407
people are posting that
they saw her being taken by the police.

702
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,450
-What?
-What?

703
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,497
WHAT A DISGRACE
THOSE ARE HIGHSCHOOLERS GETTING BEATEN

704
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,165
-My goodness.
-Oh, boy.

705
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,086
What's going on?

706
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:59,715
Are you too busy to even keep track
of what's happening to your client now?

707
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,430
She was taken by the police yesterday.

708
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,723
You didn't know?

709
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,017
What?

710
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,811
-Is she still not picking up?
-No.

711
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:13,854
I'll go to her place.

712
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,022
-I'll go.
-I'll go.

713
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,315
-I can go.
-No, I'll go.

714
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,609
Why? To talk her into joining Star Media?

715
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:21,821
Ms. Chun.

716
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,912
Let him be.

717
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,580
He's her agent after all.

718
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,833
He wouldn't let anything happen to her.

719
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,422
Ms. Chun, something seems off.

720
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,215
-What do you mean?
-<i>Move it.</i>

721
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,883
<i>Give it here.</i>

722
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,724
It didn't hit him.

723
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,729
Oh, my. It really didn't.

724
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,105
<i>-He didn't get hit.
-No.</i>

725
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,024
<i>-Not this time either.
-What's going on?</i>

726
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,109
Gosh, what is this?

727
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,070
These guys are a bunch of con artists!

728
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,827
Look what they've done!

729
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,704
It's just a graze.

730
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,832
I've had worse injuries while training.

731
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,292
So this is a good thing?

732
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,711
I'm saying I won't be
in trouble with the law.

733
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,962
I'm not stupid.

734
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,923
I knew I'd be in trouble
if I laid a finger on them.

735
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,720
The police let me go
after checking the CCTV footage.

736
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,096
Hello, sir.

737
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,935
Okay. I'll call you back.

738
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,355
What is it?

739
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,442
It's the <i>Amazones</i> production.

740
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,238
They feel uncomfortable about casting you
after your assault rumors.

741
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,367
Oh, no.

742
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:54,914
What?

743
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,540
Did you skip lunch?

744
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,251
I wanted to finish this first.

745
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:03,714
I posted the video of Soo-hyun
in slow motion on mom forums,

746
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,925
and it's getting
a ton of favorable comments.

747
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,886
SOO-HYUN'S A TOTAL GIRL CRUSH
SHE DESERVES THE GOOD CITIZEN AWARD

748
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,679
It's getting so many views too.

749
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,973
They think she deserves
the Good Citizen Award.

750
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,352
"It's like a scene from a movie."
"You're so cool."

751
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,401
Welcome.

752
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,779
IT'S SO MOVING HOW SHE FIGHTS FOR HER BABY

753
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,448
LOOK AT HER EASILY FIGHTING THEM OFF!

754
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,628
Excuse me. Aren't you the lady
who beat those punks to a pulp?

755
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,256
-Yes, that's me.
-It is her.

756
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,550
I watched your video over a hundred times.

757
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,051
Can I get a selfie?

758
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,553
I'm a huge fan.

759
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,931
One, two, three.

760
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,643
-You look gorgeous!
-I love you!

761
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,812
-Can you show me a kick?
-Just once. Please.

762
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,230
-Please. Yes.
-Here?

763
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,608
-Show us!
-Show us!

764
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,361
-Show us!
-Show us!

765
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,048
That was great! You did really well.

766
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,800
Let's move on.

767
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,845
-She's amazing.
-That was really nice.

768
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,849
Mr. Ma, Soo-hyun is
the talk of the town these days.

769
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,561
Thank you for offering to shoot
an ad based on her viral video.

770
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,979
I appreciate it.

771
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:46,275
Her image fits perfectly
with our game character.

772
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,819
<i>You said I should take more time off.</i>

773
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,321
Isn't this nice?

774
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,948
The shoots are short
without having to go overseas

775
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,533
and there are action scenes.

776
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,704
I'm planning to donate profits from the ad
to a women's organization.

777
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,830
Donate?

778
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,333
All right.

779
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,752
You can donate a part of it.

780
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,712
About 20 percent--

781
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,838
All of it.

782
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:09,965
All of it?

783
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,802
I already told their PR team
my agency would approve of this

784
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,138
since it's for a great cause.

785
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,183
Sir!

786
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,435
Soo-hyun, you're the best!

787
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,895
Mr. Ma, way to go.

788
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,188
-You're awesome!
-Good job!

789
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,940
-You're the best!
-Well done!

790
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,691
-You rock!
-Way to go!

791
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:28,901
He's amazing.

792
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,695
All right, everyone.
Let's get ready for the next shot.

793
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,281
-Let's get ready!
-They're donating all the profits.

794
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,367
Mr. Kim--

795
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,329
Jin-hyeok.

796
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:42,831
Yes?

797
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:46,252
A film studio wants Hee-sun to audition.

798
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,670
Really?

799
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,464
Oh, my. For real?

800
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,050
That's great news.

801
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,929
But why are you here, brooding?

802
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,348
The role is a maid.

803
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,101
She'll have lines with Park Ho-san.

804
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,311
If she has scenes with the lead role,

805
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,522
it's great since she'll get
a lot of screen time.

806
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,111
Because she's a maid,
she has to bend down the whole time.

807
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,320
She can't lift her head.

808
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,243
She'll be extremely disappointed, right?

809
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,620
Maid Number Three?

810
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:25,040
-Yes.
-They want me to play a maid?

811
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,084
Buttering up Park Ho-san, her master?

812
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,919
You have lines too.

813
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,672
"How dare you speak that way to my lady?"

814
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,886
-Mr. Kim, this is awesome!
-Wait!

815
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,680
-I'm so happy!
-Hold on.

816
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,558
-This is awesome!
-So you're happy?

817
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,435
I couldn't be happier!

818
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,357
I can't believe it!

819
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,526
Can you get down?

820
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:11,628
Mr. Kim and I are university friends.

821
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,134
I'm not sure that's what he thinks.

822
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,433
I had an important meeting
with a production company at the hotel.

823
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:31,148
Is that why you booked a room
with your friend?

824
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:41,492
When you want a guy, you seduce them.
When you get bored, you dump them.

825
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,994
Is that what you've always been doing?

826
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,664
That Alex guy, me…

827
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,168
and now Mr. Kim too.

828
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,544
That's not true.

829
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,632
-What happened is…
-You don't have to explain.

830
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,176
It doesn't matter anymore.

831
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,305
Okay, here's the truth.

832
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,852
Mr. Kim and I were
putting on an act that day.

833
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,271
We were just pretending.

834
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,154
Mr. Wang had rented a hotel room
long-term with company money,

835
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,864
and we only recently found out.

836
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,660
And I panicked
when you suddenly showed up.

837
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,210
You tried to cover up embezzlement?

838
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,129
Yes, that's right.

839
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,256
I did that because…

840
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,260
I need to save the company.

841
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,055
What?

842
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,307
Do you think I'm lying again?

843
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,483
You're finally being honest.

844
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,197
I didn't realize Mr. Ma
made this much money.

845
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:10,284
To be precise, the actors
that he's in charge of make a lot.

846
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,663
We need to stop them
from joining Star Media.

847
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,664
Otherwise…

848
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,042
There's more?

849
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,253
There's more, right?

850
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,130
What is it?

851
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,965
Nothing more can surprise us.

852
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,475
I just…

853
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,520
got off the phone with Mr. Wang's wife.

854
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,774
The Chinese investors…

855
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,819
-canceled the acquisition!
-What?

856
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:46,778
-What?
-What?

857
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,283
They heard the rumor
that Ma Tae-oh is joining Star Media.

858
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,911
And without Director Ma,
they're not interested in taking over.

859
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,125
Isn't that good news? Isn't it?

860
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,252
Hold on. What did Mr. Wang's wife say?

861
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,130
She's furious that
the company is worth crap now.

862
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,299
She's putting all the blame
on Director Ma.

863
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,551
In any case, I guess we all owe him.

864
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,677
You're right.

865
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,098
What? Is something wrong?

866
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,350
Could Director Ma…

867
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,103
have done this on purpose?

868
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,313
What?

869
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,900
Maybe he spread the rumor about him
leaving the company on purpose…

870
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,278
He did that on purpose?

871
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,615
Does he care about Method that much?

872
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,412
Come to think of it,

873
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,917
he didn't have to let us know
about Mr. Wang's hotel room.

874
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,461
If he was really going to leave, that is.

875
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,923
We have to admit that he tried harder
than anyone to save the company

876
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,217
after Mr. Wang's death.

877
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,761
That was in his own best interests,
not for Method.

878
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:53,929
What?

879
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,682
Did he also leave
his cell phone on purpose?

880
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,892
So I could see the message?

881
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:02,688
I think he expected you to check
the contract that was emailed to him.

882
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,398
-Since you know his password.
-I do.

883
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,316
I'm the only one who knows it.

884
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,609
So Hyun-joo.

885
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,237
You're acting suspicious.

886
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,198
Why do you seem to keep defending him?

887
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:19,538
I'm not. It's just that I remembered
what he said the other day.

888
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,459
He said that he reported us
to the National Tax Service on purpose.

889
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,503
My word…

890
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,089
The job offer was on purpose too.

891
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:34,177
He's always been clever
in his own sneaky way.

892
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,638
Right, he did all of that on purpose.

893
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,807
He even let Director Jang
slap him in the face.

894
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,600
They canceled the acquisition?

895
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,981
No. Why would I tell them
I was joining Star Media?

896
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,941
I have no idea how they--

897
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,529
Please, calm down first.

898
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,283
I'll call you back.

899
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,451
All right.

900
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,412
Director Ma.

901
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,206
You really are amazing.

902
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:25,896
Director Ma.

903
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,900
-Thank you.
-He saved our company!

904
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:33,945
Thank you!

905
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,248
STAR MEDIA CHO GI-BONG

906
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,175
Yes!

907
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,219
-Let's celebrate!
-Come on, everybody!

908
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,637
Come on in!

909
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,723
Don't be shy.

910
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,520
-Come on!
-We should celebrate!

911
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,363
How's your face?

912
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,115
It's okay.

913
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,369
Still, you could have given us a heads-up.

914
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,288
No, you did well.

915
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,209
Word spreads quickly around here.
You played it right.

916
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:34,506
I guess no one will mess with Method
for some time.

917
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,467
I guess the storm has passed then.

918
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,845
Of course, it's completely over.

919
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:40,762
Right?

920
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,849
But apparently not for this one here.

921
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:46,518
What's wrong?
Are you still suspecting him?

922
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,061
That's enough.

923
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,646
You should learn to trust people.

924
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,148
That's not it.

925
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,440
Then what is it?

926
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,777
Take a look.

927
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,697
It's what Mr. Lee Sang-uk had.

928
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:00,866
What is it?

929
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,077
That's the amount that Mr. Wang embezzled.

930
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,585
How many zeros…

931
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,628
Hey.

932
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,186
Method Entertainment…

933
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,942
might really go under.

934
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,294
BEHIND EVERY STAR

935
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:18,902
<i>Are those two fighting again?</i>

936
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,446
<i>-I can't take it anymore.
-Look who's talking!</i>

937
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,448
<i>You two are responsible
if we can't shoot the scene tomorrow.</i>

938
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,534
<i>It's no use if you came
to get us to make up.</i>

939
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:29,579
-The most popular character on the show…
<i>-I'll kill him no matter what!</i>

940
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,082
-We might be able to stop him.
-<i>You want to threaten him?</i>

941
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,751
Stop trash-talking Director Ma
and try reflecting for once.

942
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,877
<i>You're always thirsty for guys!</i>

943
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,797
-Who was it? You good-for-nothing.
-Youngtak, what were you doing in there?

944
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,216
I found a surefire way
to save Method Entertainment.

945
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,634
He was planning this from the start.

946
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,512
<i>I've always wanted to try this.</i>

-Hey!

-Are you two having an affair?</i>
