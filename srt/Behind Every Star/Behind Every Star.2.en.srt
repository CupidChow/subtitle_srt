1
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,953
BEHIND EVERY STAR

2
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,498
EPISODE 2

3
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:45,212
This is where I had
a drink with Tae-ja for the first time.

4
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,173
I wanted to treat him at a fancier place,

5
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,133
but he insisted on coming here.

6
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,178
And he promised me

7
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,348
that he'd make me win
an award within ten years.

8
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,350
So I told him

9
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,604
that I'd begin my acceptance speech
by shouting his name three times.

10
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,731
But when I won the award
for <i><font color="white">The Man Standing Next</font></i>,

11
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,817
-I forgot all about that.
-Oh, no.

12
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,946
So I told him I'd shout his name ten times
if I won another award

13
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,490
and told him I was sorry.

14
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,039
So why did he go on a vacation
so suddenly in the first place?

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,625
I heard he died mid-coitus.

16
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,751
That's not true.

17
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,799
What happened is he slipped by a pool
and hit his head really hard.

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,180
I lost a great mentor
to my acting career overnight.

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,354
Hee-jun, though I probably
wouldn't be as good as him,

20
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,940
let me help you in his place from now on.

21
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,775
Thanks.

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,902
But you see,

23
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,196
I think…

24
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,866
I need some time off.

25
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,242
Of course.

26
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,202
Take a few days to get yourself together.

27
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,829
About Director Byun's film--

28
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,207
The one you'll be starring in?
Isn't the script amazing?

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,085
I heard she had you in mind
from the get-go.

30
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,629
It's perfect for you.

31
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,881
I know. But the thing is…

32
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,967
I don't think I can do it.

33
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,846
Can you talk things out with her?

34
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,268
What are you saying?
The shooting begins in three weeks.

35
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,562
You can't bail out now.

36
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,105
I know.

37
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,231
I know that,

38
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,942
but I'm just too heartbroken.

39
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,446
Regardless, you still have to work.
It's a promise you made.

40
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,865
I'll help you as much as I can.

41
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,659
-Okay?
-Right.

42
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,746
Someone like you
who devotes their life to their work

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,456
probably wouldn't get it.

44
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:49,002
You wouldn't relate to it
because you live alone without any family.

45
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,547
I'm grieving over Mr. Wang too.

46
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,804
Still, you can't bail out of the film now.

47
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,974
Think of all the people
who worked years for this film to happen!

48
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,562
You can't just leave this shit behind you.
That's so selfish of you!

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,816
"Shit"?

50
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,492
I didn't mean you actually did that.

51
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,037
I'm just worried
some people would think that.

52
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,288
Chun Jane.

53
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,251
Yes, Hee-jun?

54
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,923
I guess I shouldn't expect
all agents to be like Tae-ja.

55
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,717
I'm taking home the leftovers.

56
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,261
-Hee-jun.
-Could you box this up?

57
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,762
That's not what I meant.

58
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,680
Hee-jun.

59
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,104
Gosh, I screwed up.

60
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,233
Damn it!

61
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,742
<i><font color="white">Send Tae-hyeon the script
no matter how late,</font></i>

62
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,243
<i><font color="white">so he can decide for himself.</font></i>

63
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,538
All right. See you on Thursday.

64
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,669
Ms. Jang, please sort out
the funeral guest list

65
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,504
since you knew him the longest.

66
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,547
Sure.

67
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,758
Isn't that Mr. Wang's seat?

68
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,177
Coffee break--

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,596
It's always been that way since day one.

70
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,014
Your seat is over here.

71
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,767
We never had assigned seats.
Just take any empty one.

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,144
Exactly.
This seat is empty too, so why sit there?

73
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,316
Ms. So can sit there

74
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,734
and take the minutes down.

75
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,819
Me?

76
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,074
Okay.

77
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,373
Here's the list of actors
assigned to each team.

78
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,799
The talents Mr. Wang managed personally
will be offered formal contracts.

79
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,301
Ms. Jang,
you'll keep managing the senior actors.

80
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,806
Team 1 will be
in charge of A-list clients.

81
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,975
Teams 2 and 3 will be in charge
of the clients on that list.

82
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,604
Team 3, pay attention to
Oh Na-ra and Kim Joo-ryoung's new works.

83
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,772
Team 2, as noted here--

84
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,690
Will you be in charge of Hee-jun?

85
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,193
But it's already been decided that I will.

86
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,570
Who are you to decide that?

87
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,116
It wasn't my decision.
Hee-jun contacted me and asked me.

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,747
Then have him sign
a formal contract with the company.

89
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,916
Also, pay special attention
to his new film.

90
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,966
What? Is there a problem?

91
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,388
He wants to drop out of the film.

92
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,098
He's too shaken up about Mr. Wang.

93
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,599
I'll persuade him in person.

94
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,809
I can take care of it.

95
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,311
You should stay away
from the actors for now.

96
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,022
At a devastating time like this,

97
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,191
they need someone rational and reassuring

98
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,235
rather than someone who's emotional
and impulsive like you.

99
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,821
And you're someone rational
to hand out a list of actors

100
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,240
with their earnings
written next to their names?

101
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,616
That's enough.

102
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,619
We have Mr. Wang's funeral ahead of us.

103
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,833
But weren't you going to
leave the company, Director Ma?

104
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,085
You'll be out of here soon.

105
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,671
I don't understand
why you're getting so involved.

106
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,548
I'm not leaving.

107
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,634
What?

108
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,969
I'm not leaving.

109
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,178
I've decided to stay.

110
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,433
I can't rest assured
leaving the company in such a mess.

111
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,685
My top priority is
to protect Method Entertainment.

112
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,437
That's what Mr. Wang would want too.

113
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,399
Let's wrap up the meeting here.

114
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,325
Since you sounded so confident,
I'll leave Hee-jun to you.

115
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,119
Either persuade him or find a replacement.

116
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,043
<i><font color="white">Shouldn't you hurry
and find a replacement?</font></i>

117
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,753
<i><font color="white">They'll go nuts when they find out.</font></i>

118
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,922
Find a replacement in three weeks?
I'll just have to persuade him.

119
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,467
Hey.

120
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,637
Do you agree with what Director Ma said?

121
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,891
Am I too emotional and impulsive
to support my clients properly?

122
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,601
No way.

123
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,313
I mean, you do tend to get upset easily,

124
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,856
but that's a part of your charm.

125
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,816
Do you think I was born this way?

126
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:26,363
People in this field walk all over you
unless you stand up for yourself.

127
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,989
This is just me trying to survive.

128
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,325
I used to be gentle and soft-hearted too!

129
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,952
This is annoying.

130
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,663
I get it, don't get so upset.

131
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:36,748
Do you want more beer?

132
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,547
Why do you always offer me beer
when I come over?

133
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,716
Serve up some of your treasured liquor.

134
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:53,181
Hye-yeong took all of them with her
when she broke up with me.

135
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,893
You know what?

136
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,062
-I'm glad you two broke up.
-Why?

137
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,731
I never liked her.
She was so sneaky and selfish.

138
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:08,488
Come to think of it, you've always had
the worst taste in girls since university.

139
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,741
Look who's talking.

140
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,994
Your relationships never last
over three months.

141
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,246
It's not that I can't. I choose not to.

142
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,999
They just end up getting needy
the longer I date them.

143
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sick of it.

144
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,377
At this rate, you'll grow old alone.

145
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,755
No. I have you, my best friend.

146
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,135
Jeez. Cut it out.

147
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,763
Hey.

148
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,683
Do you want to have a kid with me?

149
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,851
What?

150
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,895
I'm not too keen on growing old alone,

151
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,607
so I've lately been entertaining
the idea of having a kid.

152
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,111
I think you'd make an okay dad.

153
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,742
But to have a child,
you and I would have to--

154
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,909
Right.

155
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,786
Maybe not.

156
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,790
Is it illegal to use a friend
as a sperm donor?

157
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,375
A sperm donor?

158
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,086
So you need my sperm, not me.

159
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,591
I'd love to offer you my sperm

160
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,301
if that's what you want.

161
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,886
Thanks for the gesture.

162
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,236
ACTOR LEE HEE-JUN

163
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,911
Come in.

164
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,543
Ms. Chun.

165
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,922
Youngtak just called.

166
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,715
He said he couldn't reach you.

167
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,050
Tell him I'm busy.

168
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,927
Sorry?

169
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,679
He calls me every time
he reads comments about him online.

170
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,726
He sounded pretty distraught.

171
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,062
He was criticized for his poor acting.

172
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,730
All actors are like that.

173
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,108
They're all drama queens.

174
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,319
Don't let them walk all over you
or befriend them.

175
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,320
Keep your distance.

176
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,656
-Got that?
-Yes, ma'am.

177
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,574
Did you do what I asked?

178
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,785
Yes. I went to the shop
that you told me about

179
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,079
and had it delivered
to Mr. Hee-jun's home.

180
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,665
I asked for gift wrapping.
Here, I even took a picture.

181
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,375
That was the prettiest.

182
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,422
This is what you sent him?

183
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,341
Yes, it was the most popular.

184
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,513
This scarf…

185
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,683
put Hee-jun through hell.

186
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,477
He asked the reporters personally
to take the pictures down,

187
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,645
but they're still up.

188
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,063
RIDICULOUS PHOTO
OF LEE HEE-JUN'S PAST SURFACES

189
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,865
Taxi!

190
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,076
Wait! Taxi!

191
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,692
Damn it.

192
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,084
Sir, did you get any deliveries
from a department store?

193
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,007
Yes.

194
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,008
Why?

195
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,554
That scarf…

196
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,806
This?

197
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,516
Isn't it nice?

198
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,852
I got it as a present
from one of the residents.

199
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,481
Celebrities sure are generous.

200
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,401
I can't believe he just gave me
a luxury brand scarf.

201
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,280
It feels so soft.

202
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,324
It's incredibly soft.

203
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,968
-Hey.
-Hi.

204
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,428
-You're early.
-Yes.

205
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,222
Were you on your scooter again?

206
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,557
-Yes.
-Always be careful.

207
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,642
I will.

208
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:53,606
Tae-ja and I were regulars here.

209
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,483
It was this very table.

210
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,111
Sorry to call you so suddenly.

211
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:03,157
But I really wanted you to join me today.

212
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,118
I'm glad you did.

213
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,328
I still can't believe what happened.

214
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,748
He passed away so suddenly.

215
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,586
He liked you very much, Jung-don.
You know that, right?

216
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,796
Of course.

217
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,716
He treated me like his little brother.

218
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,759
You two were close too.

219
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,761
We were.

220
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,847
He was such an amazing person

221
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,392
both personally and professionally.

222
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,770
I would talk to him all night
about my life and acting.

223
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,065
He was the only friend I could open up to.

224
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,944
By the way…

225
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,074
did he really pass away mid-coitus?

226
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,036
Why is everyone saying that?

227
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,537
It's not true.

228
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,248
If he had kept it,

229
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,335
I would have apologized
and exchanged it at the store.

230
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,255
I'm so sorry.

231
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,424
It was really expensive.

232
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,177
Just go and make copies

233
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,012
all day.

234
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,014
Tomorrow and the day after that too.

235
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,767
Until I tell you to stop.

236
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,896
Yes, ma'am. I'm really sorry.

237
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,855
SCANNING

238
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,549
I left the synopsis here.

239
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,517
I haven't seen you before.

240
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,852
Are you new?

241
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:43,025
I'm So Hyun-joo,
the new agent that just got hired.

242
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,486
I see. You're an agent.

243
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,571
Yes.

244
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,121
Here. You can use this.

245
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,333
Thank you.

246
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,177
Your forehead…

247
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,805
Not that side. The other side.

248
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,432
This side?

249
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,607
There you go.

250
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,777
Thank you.

251
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,239
Do you work here?

252
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,701
Well, not an employee.
I'm an actor. My name is Ko Eun-gyul.

253
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,622
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

254
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,708
It's all right.
Not many people know me anyway.

255
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,128
You look busy.

256
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,505
Do you need a hand?

257
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,594
No, I'm okay.

258
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,763
You look hot. Want a drink?

259
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,057
No, don't mind me.

260
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,892
You can go about your business.

261
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,686
Okay. See you then.

262
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,539
After <i><font color="white">The Outlaws,</font></i> everyone told me

263
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:24,043
that I should play stronger characters
in bigger projects.

264
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,922
But what I always wanted was
to work on small but meaningful projects.

265
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,676
Tae-ja was the only person
who understood me.

266
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,844
That was when he got me
a role in <i><font color="white">Extreme Job</font></i>.

267
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,014
You and Ha-nee were amazing together.

268
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,351
Mr. Wang must have known
you'd be great at romance.

269
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,814
It's all thanks to Ha-nee and Mr. Wang.

270
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,692
Ha-nee shot a romance film with me.
I should be thankful.

271
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,193
But you know,

272
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:54,490
as I shoot more films,
the more I miss acting on stage.

273
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,951
Compared to screen acting,

274
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,955
stage acting is a lot livelier.

275
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,124
I try to bring that feeling
into screen acting.

276
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,960
But it's not so easy
in front of the camera.

277
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,754
-Sun-kyu.
-Yes?

278
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,257
There's a script that's perfect for you.

279
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,300
Really?

280
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,551
It's by Byun Young-joo.

281
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,386
-Director Byun?
-Yes.

282
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,805
It's about a poor stage actor

283
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,726
-who cons a wealthy woman.
-Go on.

284
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,728
It's Korea's very own
<i><font color="white">The Talented Mr. Ripley</font></i>.

285
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,439
It'll be shot exclusively in long takes.

286
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,857
-Long takes?
-Yes.

287
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,944
So you have to maintain your rhythm
while you act as if you're on stage.

288
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,448
-That sounds really fun.
-Right?

289
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,366
Can I see the script?

290
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,244
-I'll send it over right away.
-You know what?

291
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,915
I loved working with Director Byun
on <i><font color="white">Helpless</font></i>,

292
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,667
although it was for a short while.

293
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,669
I've always wanted to work with her again.

294
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,464
She'll be so happy when she hears this.

295
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,431
<i><font color="white">I can't seem to reach Hee-jun.</font></i>

296
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,350
<i><font color="white">Is everything okay?</font></i>

297
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,395
Well, you know how serious
he is about his acting.

298
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,690
He's just confused right now
because he's trying to get into character.

299
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:10,650
So don't worry.

300
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,111
He used to message me day and night

301
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,697
about his ideas about the plot.

302
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,493
But he didn't show up at the reading,
and I can't even reach him.

303
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,996
I know Hee-jun
would never cause any trouble,

304
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,626
but since we're about to begin the shoot,
I can't help but feel anxious.

305
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,297
Is Method having difficulties
managing its clients without Mr. Wang?

306
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,965
I also heard that.

307
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,179
You know how close he was to Mr. Wang.

308
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,764
Please give him a little time.

309
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,641
As you know,

310
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,520
the livelihood of many people
depends on this film.

311
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,981
And this is my first film in many years.

312
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,900
I risked everything

313
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,237
when I decided to do
this project with Hee-jun.

314
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,156
I don't usually do this,
but if you keep this up,

315
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,784
I'll have to look for a substitute.

316
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,412
-I'm serious.
-Hee-jun is going to do it.

317
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,789
I'll talk to him and make sure he does.

318
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,502
Failing to meet the schedule
also counts as a breach of contract.

319
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,968
Go away.

320
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,304
You can relax now.

321
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,807
Sun-kyu is going to do it.

322
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,517
-Do what?
-What else?

323
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,728
Director Byun's new film.

324
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,022
I told him shooting starts in three weeks,

325
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,691
and he said yes right away.

326
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,984
It's done.

327
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,945
I've sorted everything out,
so you don't have to worry anymore.

328
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,030
If you really want to thank me…

329
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,408
Fine. I'll let you buy me beef.

330
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,493
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

331
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,122
Do you really think Sun-kyu
is suited for that movie?

332
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,124
Why not?

333
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,208
What's wrong with him?

334
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,127
The film doesn't suit his image at all.

335
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,962
-You must be kidding me.
-His image…

336
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,047
That's what you think.

337
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,175
The shooting starts next month.

338
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,720
Hee-jun wants to bail out
and Sun-kyu is up for it.

339
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,264
Isn't it obvious
that Sun-kyu should do it?

340
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,724
Did you not read the synopsis?

341
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,145
The character is macho on the outside
but soft on the inside.

342
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,355
Only Hee-jun can pull this off.

343
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,818
Then again, you just work like a machine
and only concern yourself with schedules.

344
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,156
You have no vision and no goals.
You do everything half-heartedly.

345
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,575
Like a machine? Half-heartedly?

346
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,285
You think I do this half-heartedly?

347
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,579
Take what happened
with Yeo-jeong and her role.

348
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,039
Why are you bringing that up?

349
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,125
Anyway, I'm different from you.
I never quit once I start.

350
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,128
I'll make sure Hee-jun does this film.
You go talk to Sun-kyu.

351
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,507
<i><font color="white">It's not that I changed my mind.</font></i>

352
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,092
I just think it was rash of me.

353
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,765
If you start another film right away,
it might affect your health negatively.

354
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,809
<i><font color="white">I get what you mean.</font></i>

355
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,477

356
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,354

357
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,440
<i><font color="white">Let's talk more later. I'm due on set now.</font></i>

358
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,485
All right. I'll take care of it then.

359
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,279
Hello?

360
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,290
Man, I'm tired.

361
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,052
What's bothering you now?

362
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,388
Jin-hyeok.

363
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:32,851
Do you think I work half-heartedly
without any goals or plans?

364
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,357
You can be honest with me.

365
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,950
A little, to be frank.

366
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,082
But nothing goes as planned
in this line of work anyway.

367
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,793
Not a day goes by without an accident.

368
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,548
Don't take what Ms. Chun said to heart.

369
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,718
Also, I don't think there's an agent

370
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,596
who's more dedicated
to their clients than you are.

371
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,518
Jin-hyeok.

372
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,576
<i><font color="white">Emergency meeting.</font></i>

373
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,287
<i><font color="white">Wine bar on the 13th floor
of Roel Hotel. 8 p.m.</font></i>

374
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,089
You can leave the funeral to us.

375
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,508
You must still be shaken up.

376
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,635
I appreciate it.

377
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,763
I called this meeting

378
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,098
to inform you of news
concerning the company.

379
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,271
I've inherited my late husband's shares,

380
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,273
so I'm legally in charge of the company.

381
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,942
But I'm not interested in running it.

382
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,944
Then what would you like to do?

383
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:10,032
I'll have to find someone
who will run the company in my place.

384
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,288
So I'm thinking of selling the company.

385
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,629
I heard a few actors had already left
after my husband's death.

386
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,799
I think I should sell the company
before things get any worse.

387
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,343
Who are you planning to sell it to?

388
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,511
I'm not sure.

389
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,932
Whoever makes the highest bid, I guess.

390
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,558
You can't do that.

391
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,105
Mr. Wang built this company from scratch.

392
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,857
He went through a lot to make it this big.

393
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,819
You can't hand it over to a stranger.

394
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,196
Then you could buy it yourself.

395
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,743
I've already made up my mind,
so take it or leave it.

396
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,621
We'll buy it.

397
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,546
We'll buy…

398
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,632
all of Mr. Wang's shares.

399
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,593
"We"?

400
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,263
Who do you mean by that?

401
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,992
<i><font color="white">What do you mean, we'll buy the company?</font></i>

402
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,327
It's not impossible.

403
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,582
Ms. Jang and I own
about 20 percent of the shares.

404
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,418
We'll buy as many shares as we can
to protect the company.

405
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,255
It's not like I have kids
to support or anything.

406
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,426
All I need is space for my plants
and a retirement plan.

407
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,512
What about you two?

408
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,725
How much can you pitch in?

409
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,146
My parents left me their apartment
when they moved out of the city.

410
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,815
-If I put that up as collateral…
-Have you lost your mind?

411
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,151
Listen.

412
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,404
You might think it'll be fine as long as
the company ends up in good hands,

413
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,615
but we might end up
being acquired by a larger company.

414
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,700
Then it's the end
for Method Entertainment.

415
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,826
Are you okay with that?

416
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,621
I'll chip in.

417
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,122
We have to protect the company.

418
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,169
You don't have to join us
if you don't want to, Ms. Chun.

419
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,462
I'm not forcing you.

420
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,219
Kim Jung-don, come to your senses.

421
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,513
Don't play into his game.

422
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,432
He's just trying to use us
so he can become the CEO.

423
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,768
What's so wrong with that?

424
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,561
What?

425
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,398
I don't care who becomes CEO
as long as we can keep the company.

426
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,276
You see, I don't have any goals or plans

427
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,694
unlike a certain someone.

"The first time always is."

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,234
THE FIRST TIME ALWAYS IS

00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,152
DO YOU MEET PEOPLE HERE OFTEN?

438
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,117
"Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no."

439
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,537
I'M LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP,
RATHER THAN JUST A FLING

440
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,294
I don't want anything serious.

441

YUSEONG85: CAN WE TALK?
YOU'RE JUST MY TYPE.

442
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:54,715
Nice.

HI. I LOVE YOUR PICTURE.
YOU'RE TOTALLY MY TYPE.

YOU LOOK GREAT TOO

445
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,273
I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU IN PERSON

446
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,986
WANT TO MEET UP?

447
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,571
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

448
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,826
PINETREE86: ARE YOU STILL THERE? HELLO?

449
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,620
"You want to come over?"

450
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,996
Shoot.

451
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,955
Damn it.

452
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,916
PINETREE86: HELLO?
STORMYJANE83: YOU WANT TO COME OVER?

453
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,337
I KNOW WE'RE ONLINE,
BUT JUST IGNORING ME?

454
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,880
HOW ABOUT AN APOLOGY?

-Welcome.
-Hello.

459
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,494
Hi.

460
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,538
-A double shot espresso, please.
-Sure.

461
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,335
Why do you look so tired?

462
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,130
Who did you spend the night with?

463
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,217
I stayed up all night looking into loans.

464
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,684
Are you really going to do
as Director Ma said?

465
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,103
Will you be okay?

466
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,357
Just like you, I stayed up all night
racking my brain over it.

467
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:40,028
To figure out if it would be okay
to put all my money into the company.

468
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,365
When I was in my twenties and naive,

469
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,952
I got on the wrong side of
the TV station's dance director,

470
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:47,995
and Mr. Wang…

471
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,414
I mean…

472
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,542
Tae-ja took me under his wing.

473
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,005
Method Entertainment

474
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,759
is a legacy, home, and family

475
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,886
that he left behind.

476
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,315
Jung-don wants to replace
Lee Hee-jun with Jin Sun-kyu?

477
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,321
Hee-jun will go nuts
if he finds out Sun-kyu got the offer.

478
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,072
What?

479
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,451
Don't you know about Sun-kyu and Hee-jun?

480
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,286
What do you mean?

481
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,748
The two of them used to compete
for Mr. Wang's attention.

482
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,542
What? That's absurd.

483
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,210
It's true.

484
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,673
Was it 15 years ago?

485
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,010
<i><font color="white">Mr. Wang heard a rumor
about this amazing stage actor</font></i>

486
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,845

487
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,889

488
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,474
<i><font color="white">I know that much.</font></i>

489
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,185
<i><font color="white">Mr. Wang offered him
a contract right away, didn't he?</font></i>

490
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,189
<i><font color="white">But it turned out that the rumored actor</font></i>

491
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,483
<i><font color="white">wasn't actually Hee-jun.</font></i>

492
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,525
<i><font color="white">What?</font></i>

493
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,195
<i><font color="white">No way.</font></i>

494
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,405
<i><font color="white">That's right. It was Jin Sun-kyu.</font></i>

495
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,909
<i><font color="white">You know they were both
in Ganda Theater Company, right?</font></i>

496
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,206
<i><font color="white">Hee-jun happened to have filled in
for Sun-kyu, who was sick that day.</font></i>

497
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:19,503
<i><font color="white">As you know, Sun-kyu got his breakthrough
much later than Hee-jun.</font></i>

498
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:25,300
<i><font color="white">Mr. Wang felt he was responsible
and paid extra attention to Sun-kyu.</font></i>

499
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,676
<i><font color="white">You know how it is.</font></i>

500
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,846
<i><font color="white">Actors get anxious and jealous
when they think their agent</font></i>

501
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,432

502
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:34,976
<i><font color="white">Anyway…</font></i>

503
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:40,732
there's always been a strange tension
between the two of them.

504
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,944
Whoever gets the role,

505
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,571
neither of them should know
that the other got the offer.

506
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,119
What are you doing?

507
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,579
I just remembered
that I needed to be somewhere.

508
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,416
I'll see you at the office.

509
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,837
<i><font color="white">We appreciate it
but we do not accept wreaths.</font></i>

510
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,171
Thank you.

511
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,799
This is Method Entertainment.

512
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,760
It's Ilsan Funeral Home.
The casket will be borne out at 7 a.m.

513
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,761
Thank you.

514
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,763
This is Method Entertainment.

515
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,306
These were piled in the mailbox…

516
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,851
Give me your name,
and I'll send it to you again.

517
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,520
-Yes.
-Hee-sun, I know you're busy,

518
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,563
but can you help me?

519
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,523
I'll call you back.

520
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,484
How can I help?

521
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:28,822
These are film contracts
and profiles of our new actors.

522
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,658
Could you give them to the courier later?
I have to run.

523
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,618
Profiles of new actors?

524
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,121
They're for Director Yoon Jong-bin,

525
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,914
so please take good care of them.

526
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,422
Hee-jun!

527
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,173
Hee-jun.

528
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,133
I'm sorry.

529
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:19,057
I return to the Buddha with sincerity.

530
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,568
I return to Buddha's laws with sincerity.

531
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,995
I have sinned by living without asking

532
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,664
where I came from and where I am headed,

533
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,082
thus I bow in repentance.

534
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,717
I have sinned by living without asking

535
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,386
who I am and where my true self is headed,

536
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,846
thus I bow in repentance.

537
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,230
I've never seen anyone fall asleep

538
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,815
-during their 108 bows.
-Hee-jun.

539
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,944
Why are you being a nuisance here?

540
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,572
I'm sorry about the other day.

541
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,284
No, I should be the one to apologize
for changing my mind so suddenly.

542
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,330
I'll talk to the director
and the production company

543
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,581
and apologize to them.

544
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,832
I already talked to them.

545
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,501
-You did?
-Yes.

546
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,752
What did they say?

547
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,962
When I explained your situation to them,

548
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,882
they understood,
so you don't have to worry.

549
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,926
That's a relief.

550
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,346
-Director Byun must have been startled.
-Yes, a bit.

551
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,265
But you know how things are.

552
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,060
The show must go on whatever happens.

553
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,978
You did well.

554
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,150
This is confidential,
but the role you were going to play

555
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,655
will be offered to Sun-kyu.

556
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,949
-Sun-kyu?
-Yes.

557
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,953
It turns out Mr. Wang was debating

558
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,790
whether he should give the role
to you or Sun-kyu.

559
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,999
I see.

560
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,335
Luckily, he's free to do it.

561
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,671
He's perfect for the role in some ways.

562
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,801
I haven't told him yet,

563
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,970
but I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

564
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,598
I didn't know Mr. Wang
considered Sun-kyu too.

565
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,064
Hee-jun wants to do the film again?

566
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,441
-Yes.
-How?

567
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,609
I let him in on the scoop

568
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,738
saying that Sun-kyu might play the role
if he doesn't.

569
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:24,159
I sparked his competitive spirit
to motivate my despondent client.

570
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,286
Now, that's what I call
great mental support.

571
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,621
I'm starting to hate you.

572
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,207
Jung-don, didn't I tell you?

573
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,794
Unlike you, I can overcome anything
if I put my mind to it.

574
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,758
Hey.

575
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,260
What are you going to tell Sun-kyu now?

576
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,805
Well? Do you need my help?

577
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,641
Do you?

578
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,769
Come in.

579
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,062
-Sun-kyu.
-Hello.

580
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,608
I just talked to Director Byun Young-joo.

581
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,570
She said…

582
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,658
she was excited to work with me.

583
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,160
She's absolutely thrilled!

584
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,704
But it doesn't seem like
you told her about me yet.

585
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,705
Right?

586
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,249
Why not? Were you worried about my health?

587
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,793
Jung-don.

588
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,962
I really appreciate your concern.

589
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,924
I'll do my absolute best on this film.

590
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,550
You have my word. Thank you.

591
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,553
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

592
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,347
Really!

593
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,516
What will people say when they find out?

594
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,477
Two actors in the same agency
competing for a role?

595
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,271
-I was only trying to help.
-I didn't ask for your help.

596
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,357
Why meddle in other people's business?

597
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,150
That's why you never get anywhere.

598
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,362
That role belongs to Hee-jun,
so make Sun-kyu give it up!

599
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,823
If you're so great,
why don't you do it instead?

600
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,992
-You said you don't need my help.
-Okay, I will. So stay out of it!

601
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,833
This isn't about Hee-jun.

602
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,377
You're doing this
because you don't want to lose to me.

603
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,670
You selfish brat.

604
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,506
You only care about yourself.

605
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,925
What?

606
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:08,054
This is why Mr. Wang brought Director Ma
instead of making you the director.

607
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,180
Try being kind.

608
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,683
And you want a kid?
I already feel sorry for that kid.

609
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,602
-It's my child, so mind your own business.
-But it's my sperm.

610
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,063
I'm not giving them up, so forget it.

611
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,315
Don't ever ask for them again!

612
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,360
I don't need your sperm anyway!

613
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,922
What brings you here?

614
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,843
Has Ms. Chun already left?

615
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,851
She left a while ago.

616
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,021
That's bad.

617
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,399
I have to speak in a Busan dialect
for my next audition,

618
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,777
and Ms. Chun promised to send me
a recording of a local.

619
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,405
But I haven't gotten any emails,
and she won't pick up.

620
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,407
Let me try calling her.

621
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,366
Sure.

622
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,289
Just a second.

Please leave a message after…</font></i>

624
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,756
She's not picking up.

625
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,009
Too bad. I'll call her again later.

626
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,052
Bye.

627
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,053
Okay.

628
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,100
Wait!

629
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,770
I…

630
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,356
happen to be from Busan.

631
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,569
"One blueberry smoothie, please."

632
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,988
"Blueberry smoothie."

633
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,074
"Blueberry smoothie."

634
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,034
Try "smoothie" again.

635
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,827
Hold on. I'm getting confused too.

636
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,247
I really can't tell the difference.

637
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,001
I guess I'll be failing this audition too.

638
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,130
Then…

639
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,716
I'll make a recording and send it to you.

640
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,302
Think of it as a song and memorize it.

641
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,262
-Really?
-Yes.

642
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,722
Thank you so much.

643
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,642
Then let me buy you dinner.

644
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,979
As a thank you.

645
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,235
Sure. That sounds good.

646
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,997
Seriously, I've auditioned
more than 50 times this year.

647
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,500
My mom said I should quit
if I fail this one too.

648
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,086
Does she not like you being an actor?

649
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,131
-Yes. She despises it.
-I see.

650
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,343
My job choice wasn't welcome either.

651
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,262
By your mom?

652
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,513
What?

653
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,811
Yes.

654
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,358
I want to prove that I can do it,

655
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,486
but it's not easy.

656
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:14,532
Cheers.

657
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,376
-In my opinion,
-Yes?

658
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,795
you'll be an amazing agent.

659
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,175
How do you know that?

660
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,761
I have a sixth sense.

661
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:35,803
Really?

662
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,390
When I first saw you, this thought hit me.

663
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,060
"She'll be a great agent."

664
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,147
"I hope I get to work
with an agent like her in the future."

665
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,816
I'll think about it
if you pass this audition.

666
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,195
-That's a promise.
-Of course.

667
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,198
Now, try that line again.

668
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,325
"Blueberry smoothie."

669
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,703
-"Blueberry smoothie."
-No.

670
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,413
Each syllable is a different pitch.

671
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,749
"Blueberry smoothie."

672
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,335
-"Blueberry…"
-No.

673
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,670
"Blueberry."

674
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,380
-"Blueberry."
-"Blue."

675
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,216
-"Blue."
-"Blue."

676
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,133
"Blue."

677
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,718
-"Blue."
-"Blue…"

MANAGER CHUN JANE

689
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,992
Here.

690
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,620
This way, please.

691
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,096
Why do we have to keep a schedule
for visitors to the funeral?

692
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,973
We have no choice.

693
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:10,643
The higher-ups don't want
Sun-kyu and Hee-jun to meet each other.

694
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,436
-How is it going?
-Hello.

695
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:13,813
Nice to see you.

696
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:21,028
JIN SUN-KYU

697
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,657
You shouldn't say that at a funeral.

698
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,910
Keep up the good work.

699
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,588
Where have you been?

700
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,966
Mr. Jin Sun-kyu just arrived.

701
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,051
-Already?
-But the problem is…

702
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,888
Mr. Lee Hee-jun is already here.

703
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,140
What?

704
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,018
-Where is he?
-Over there.

705
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,981
Jung-don.

706
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,649
I'm here.

707
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,901
Sun-kyu. I thought you were coming later.

708
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,695
Plans got canceled, so I came early.

709
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,946
-I see.
-Let's go in.

710
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,532
This room is too crowded.
Let's go to another room.

711
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,950
-Should we?
-That way.

712
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,661
-There really are so many people here.
-I know.

713
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,540
Hold on. That's Hee-jun over there.

714
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,541
Let's sit with them.

715
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,501
Why don't you say hi to the others first?

716
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,920
-I haven't seen him in so long. Let's go.
-Really?

717
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,593
-Hee-jun.
-Hey.

718
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,471
Hey, Sun-kyu.

719
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,014
Fancy seeing you here.

720
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,516
It's been so long.

721
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,726
When did he get here?

722
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,269
-Perfect timing.
-Is that so?

723
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,229
-How have you been?
-I just got here.

724
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,647
I see.

725
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:39,982
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

726
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,069
-I'm glad you made it.
-My plans got canceled.

727
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,737
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

728
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,073
-What about you?
-It's the same for me.

729
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,662
I'll have soda.

730
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,582
I actually talked about you
with Jung-don yesterday.

731
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,627
You did? What about me?

732
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,379
-It was nothing serious.
-That you work too much.

733
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,007
I scolded Jung-don for overworking you.

734
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,136
You're the one who needs a break.

735
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,888
-What?
-Your face looks gaunt.

736
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:11,806
My face?

737
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,226
-What's wrong with it?
-Come on.

738
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,062
He's sensitive about
what people say about his face.

739
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,688
No, I'm not.

740
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,398
Stop doing that.

741
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,275
He might not look like it,

742
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,487
but he was really popular
with girls back in university.

743
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,740
He would gather up all the girls
and start talking about acting.

744
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,619
Then the girls would go,
"I'm so touched. You're amazing."

745
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,745
Some even cried.

746
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,914
Then he'd be dating one of them.

747
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,707
He's not a looker, but a good talker.

748
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,879
Was I like that? That reminds me.

749
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:48,050
There was this girl you followed around
for a year. Mi-jin, right?

750
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,344
I had no idea she had a thing for me.

751
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,555
Hee-jun kept pestering me,

752
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,474
so I tried really hard
to set the two of them up.

753
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,810
I still feel bad for what I did to her.

754
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,354
But I guess it's all in the past now.
Isn't it?

755
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,484
You must be free
now that you're done shooting.

756
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,194
No, I'm starting a new film.

757
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,821
You are? So am I.

758
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,780
What film is it?

759
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,240
My gosh, Hee-jun.

760
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,201
I'm sorry but you have a meeting
with the production company.

761
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,203
I had a meeting today?

762
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,123
Yes. We have to go now.
Let's come back tomorrow.

763
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,292
-I'm sorry, Sun-kyu.
-No problem.

764
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,877
Gosh, but I'm not done eating.

765
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,587
We should go too. It's crowded.

766
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,963
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

767
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,174
-Let's go.
-Let's go too.

768
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,843
-Let's head out.
-Nice running into you.

769
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,886
Hey.

770
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,139
-Hello.
-Thank you for accepting the role.

771
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,017
Mr. Kim played a big role in this.

772
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,229
It's an honor to take part
in such a great film.

773
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,024
-I really admire Director Byun--
-Director Byun Young-joo?

774
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,318
Hee-jun, the thing is…

775
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,988
It's a shame we can't work together,
but I hope we'll get another chance.

776
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,073
-I hope we do well.
-Thank you.

777
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,743
-Wait. What's going on here?
-I'm sorry.

778
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,913
-I thought I had that part.
-I was working on it. Let's talk outside.

779
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,207
-Let's go. I was…
-Hold on.

780
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,626
-Did I steal his role?
-It's not like that.

781
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,503
I can't do that to him.
I can't steal his role.

782
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,422
Sun-kyu, it's not like that.

783
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,675
You didn't steal anything.
You were their second choice.

784
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,094
No wonder.

785
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,430
You should've come clean with me.

786
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,806
I'm sorry, Sun-kyu.

787
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:19,767
I'll give it up.

788
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,936
Hee-jun should take the role.

789
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,521
-That's that then.
-Sun-kyu, what are you talking about?

790
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,483
-It was mine to start with.
-I get it.

791
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,360
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

792
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,195
I believe in you, Hee-jun.

793
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,655
Sun-kyu, didn't you hear me?

794
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,990
You were my replacement.

795
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,410
You're offended, aren't you?
Stop pretending to be okay with it.

796
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,538
I'm not pretending. I mean it, Hee-jun.

797
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,291
-Don't be such a hypocrite.
-Stop, Hee-jun.

798
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,543
Isn't he ridiculous?

799
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,879
You said you prefer
small but meaningful films

800
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,674
to blockbusters with star directors

801
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,300
but look at what you're doing now.

802
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,219
Then why did you do <i><font color="white">Space Sweepers</font></i>?

803
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,180
-You wanted to make it big too!
-That's enough. Let's go.

804
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,306
Hee-jun.

805
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,352
You're too greedy.

806
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,395
What?

807
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,648
Take a look.

808
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,193
He dragged all the dishes
close to himself.

809
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,822
Your greed even shows in your acting.

810
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,323
Let's leave the acting out of this.

811
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,284
You always try to stand out.

812
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,160
Hee-jun.

813
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,580
Let's put being good people
before being good actors.

814
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,541
Do you think this is what Tae-ja wanted?

815
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,418
-See that?
-Yes.

816
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,169
He spits on your face
with his patronizing.

817
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,713
That's his true nature.

818
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,048
You're all being fooled by him, see?

819
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,343
-That's enough.
-It makes you upset, doesn't it?

820
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,886
-Hit me. Go on.
-No.

821
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,430
-Hee-jun!
-I know you want to.

822
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,181
-You're upset.
-Stop!

823
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,808
-You should stop.
-Don't do this!

824
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,435
-You're pissed, right?
-Stop!

825
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,644
-Hit me!
-Stop.

826
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:46,979
-I said, stop.
-Let's go.

827
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,480
I'm greedy?

828
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,316
Who are you to judge my acting?

829
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,817
Please. Let's go, Hee-jun!

830
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,611
Do you think Mi-jin liked you
because of your acting?

831
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,572
She doesn't care about people's looks.

832
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,407
She does care about looks, you punk!

833
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,034
Don't speak that way about her!

834
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:00,951
Sun-kyu.

835
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,039
She loved how I looked.

836
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,585
-I apologize. Enjoy your meal.
-Wait.

837
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,796
-Sun-kyu.
-I won't let this slide.

838
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,089
<i><font color="white">You want to do the film?</font></i>

839
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,384
Yes. I'm going to do it.
I'm doing it no matter what.

840
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,637
What? I'm greedy?

841
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,807
What's wrong with
an actor wanting to stand out?

842
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,226
Of course, I do.
Wouldn't it be strange if I didn't?

843
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,563
Tell the director I'm doing it.

844
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,066
Call her right now and schedule a meeting.

845
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,902
I'm never going to see that guy again.

846
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,864
How dare he bring up Mi-jin
in front of me!

847
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,291
Damn it.

848
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,919
What are you talking about?

849
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,253
Why are you so surprised?

850
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,214
I'm doing Director Byun's film.

851
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,926
-You said you were going to give it up.
-No. I won't. I can't.

852
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,803
Seriously? I'm a hypocrite?

853
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,097
Do you think so too?

854
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,601
That's how he must have
always thought of me, right?

855
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,061
I'm sure that's not it.

856
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,481
Let me set this straight.
Mi-jin did care about people's looks.

857
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,316
Seriously.

858
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,860
I should've gotten a nose job
before <i><font color="white">The Outlaws</font></i>.

859
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:20,406
-I was so heartbroken over her.
-Mi-jin cared about looks, got that?

860
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,574
-Lee Hee-jun. Jab.
-Sun-kyu.

861
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,869
-I'm just so angry.
-Calm down.

862
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,873
-Why am I so worked up?
-Come on, Sun-kyu.

863
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,629
How could you let this happen?

864
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,507
I'm running around
trying to save the company,

865
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,800
and the two of you…

866
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:46,849
When we get back to the office,
we'll see which one of you is responsible.

867
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,308
Got that?

868
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,027
Should we ask the director
to make the movie in two parts?

869
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:02,239
Maybe we should split
the director in half.

870
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,783
What would Mr. Wang have done?

871
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,328
"Gosh, whatever."

872
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,581
"Just cast both of them."
That's what he'd say.

873
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,665
Right.

874
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,462
Then we'd run around cleaning up the mess.

875
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,822
Next, Actor Jin Sun-kyu
will share a few words.

876
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,632
LIFE AS TRANSIENT AS DEW

877
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,218
I remember what Mr. Wang told me

878
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,347
when we first met.

879
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,892
"I'm not sure if you'll become a star,

880
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,687
but I do know one thing for sure."

881
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,400
"You're an irreplaceable actor."

882
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,320
I promised him then

883
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,031
that I'd repay his trust

884
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,785
within ten years.

885
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,373
I'm not sure if I kept my promise,

886
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,126
but what I do know is that Mr. Wang Tae-ja

887
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,005
was an irreplaceable agent.

888
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:45,759
He was kind,

889
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,470
humane…

890
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,141
and had nothing
but love and respect for his actors.

891
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,488
What would Mr. Wang say
if he saw you spoiling everyone's mood?

892
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:11,952
Right.

893
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,163
Mr. Wang was always cheerful,

894
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,960
so I'd like to say goodbye to him
in a cheerful way

895
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,505
by singing his favorite song.

896
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:27,009
Please, sing along if you know the song.

897
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,386
Goodbye, Tae-ja.

I'm sorry, Sun-kyu.

926
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,438
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry too.

927
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,316
Let's not fight anymore.

928
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,032
Tae-ja…

929
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,287
I'm sorry.

930
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,337
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

931
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,216
Hee-jun and I will remain good friends,
so don't worry.

932
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,138
<i><font color="white">So, you're saying</font></i>

933
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:03,350
I should cast
both Jin Sun-kyu and Lee Hee-jun?

934
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,309
-Yes.
-Yes.

935
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,353
That's just ridiculous.

936
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,813
Just hear me out.

937
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,274
A poor stage actor ends up conning

938
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,151
another poor stage actor.

939
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,862
Instead of a romance
between a man and a woman,

940
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:19,699
it'll be a romance between two men.

941
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,368
Think about it.

942
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,455
Changing the gender removes
the problem that's been bothering you.

943
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,457
You said the other day

944
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,418
that you were worried
the romance was too conventional.

945
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,757
You should've seen
Sun-kyu and Hee-jun together.

946
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,634
Their chemistry was out of this world.

947
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,344
It won't be easy changing the plot.

948
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,805
-It takes a lot of work.
-No, wait.

949
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,057
Two men in love.

950
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,061
A passionate romance
between Sun-kyu and Hee-jun.

951
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,147
What?

952
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,815
It's progressive. This might work.

953
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,109
How did you come up
with such a brilliant idea?

954
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,986
There's a reason they're called Method.

955
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,281
They know the method
to make a film fun and successful.

956
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:02,242
Just give me one month.

957
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,870
No, not even that long.
Just give me two weeks.

958
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,455
From Monday to Friday, just two weeks.

959
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,666
I'll come up with something
never-before-seen.

960
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,168
Something truly unconventional.

961
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,712
I'll bring you something
that's totally new.

962
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,255
What about the costs?

963
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,840
We can't afford both of them.

964
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,884
I'll take care of that.

965
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:26,016
I'll take responsibility
and work out the actors' fees.

966
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,001
Good job.

967
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:54,878
You did great too.

968
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,671
Should we celebrate at my place?

969
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:57,923
That sounds good.

970
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,674
-I have some wine.
-Mr. Kim.

971
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,010
The film studio just called.

972
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,305
They asked whose name
should appear first in the movie.

973
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,681
It's obviously Hee-jun.

974
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,600
Come on. They both play lead roles.

975
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,102
Hee-jun made his debut first.
Go with Hee-jun.

976
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:13,355
Sun-kyu made his stage debut first
and is older.

977
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,482
-This isn't a play. It doesn't count.
-Well--

978
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,858
-But--
-Is this a play?

979
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,109
-It isn't.
-Right?

980
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,569
Get a grip, will you?

981
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,155
-How about simultaneously?
-What? That's ridiculous.

982
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,032
-Have their names appear together.
-Get out.

983
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:24,950
Both--

984
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,246
They can appear simultaneously.

985
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:37,712
This is what Mr. Wang did
when there was cause for celebration.

986
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,298
Shall we drink on his behalf tonight?

987
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,682
Here.

988
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,476
-Good job.
-Thank you.

989
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,321
All done.

990
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,073
Hello.

991
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,702
Hello.

992
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,665
Hello.

993
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,292
I haven't seen you around.

994
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,254
I'm Director Ma Tae-oh's wife.

995
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,677
-I see. I'm--
-Honey.

996
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,430
I didn't know you were coming.

997
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:32,017
You haven't had enough sleep
because of the funeral.

998
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,438
I thought you'd be too tired to drive,
so I came to pick you up.

999
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,107
You didn't have to.

1000
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,068
Eun-gyul kept me company on the way.

1001
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,570
Dad.

1002
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,573
-Hey.
-What should we have for dinner?

1003
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,451
-You'll be joining us, right?
-Sure.

1004
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,369
Hi.

1005
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:53,788
Hi.

1006
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:56,082
You two know each other?

1007
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,211
She's a new agent and also a friend.

1008
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,799
But your last name is Ko.

1009
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,177
Didn't I tell you?

1010
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,721
Ko Eun-gyul is my stage name.
My real last name is Ma.

1011
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:10,889
Ma Eun-gyul.

1012
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,768
If she's your friend,
why don't we invite her to dinner?

1013
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,685
Is that okay?

1014
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,687
-Well…
-What do you say?

1015
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,522
-Sure.
-No, I…

1016
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,943
I have a lot to do. Sorry.

1017
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:30,950
Hyun-joo.

1018
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,579
What's wrong? Did something happen?

1019
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,791
Why didn't you tell me
that Director Ma was your dad?

1020
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,378
Is that so important?

1021
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:47,342
Is there a problem with him being my dad?

1022
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:49,677
Listen.

1023
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,680
Just ignore me
from this moment on. Please.

1024
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:53,765
Why?

1025
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,186
-Did my dad scold you or something?
-That's not it.

1026
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,604
Then why are you doing this?

1027
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,688
Just because.

1028
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,191
Let's just remain strangers.

1029
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:04,692
Please.

1030
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,546
How do you know Eun-gyul?

1031
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,840
-Well…
-What's going on between you two?

1032
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,633
-We're just friends.
-Just friends?

1033
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,262
I was helping him with his audition.
I had no idea he was your son.

1034
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,513
You expect me to believe that?

1035
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,015
Stay away from him.

1036
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,393
Don't you dare mess with my family,

1037
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,061
or I'm going to make you pay.

1038
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,157
What about me?

1039
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,913
What am I if not family?
