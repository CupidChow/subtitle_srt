Because of that,

172

they prefer to align themselves

Those forces and organizations

are happy to take them in

176
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,430

a chance to get their hands on valuable items.

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,830
She wants to be a person named Chen Duo.

343
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,790
And I

344
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,590
will give her that chance.

345
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,270
Do you think I'll hand her over to you?

346
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,310
This is bad.

347
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,720
The worst-case scenario has come true.

348
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,200

356

357
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,350
I'll stay in your village for a few days,

358

if there's a peaceful way

360
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,440
to resolve this issue.

361
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,960
All right.

362
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,880
But can you ensure those outside

363
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,550
won't make any trouble?

364
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,480
I can't speak for those outside,

365
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,960
but don't worry.

366
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,440
If they stir up trouble

367
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,270
in this village

369

you can handle them however you like.

Their target is Chen Duo,

403
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,070
so as long as they don't make a move on her,

404
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,790
leave them alone.

405
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,720
There are two updates.

406
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,750
The good news is that Ma Xianhong has admitted

407
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,240
that Chen Duo is in the village.

408
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,440
The bad news is

409
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,830
that he'll never hand her over.

410
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,400
If we take action,

411
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,510
both he and the entire Biyou Village

412
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,310
will become our enemies.

413
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,440
Their power

414
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
has far exceeded our expectations,

415
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,440
especially since Ma Xianhong

416
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,160
is the successor of Divine Forge.

417
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,400
No wonder the Outsiders we've been fighting

418
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,070
have so many powerful magic weapons.

419
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,440
It turns out this village is home

420
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,440
to the heir of the Eight Supremes.

421

This trip has been worth it.

422
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,110
I've always wanted to see

423
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,030
the Eight Supremes which caused the Jiashen Calamity.

424
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,200
Once we're done with Chen Duo,

425
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,830
I'll pay Chief Ma a proper visit.

426
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,480
Are the Eight Supremes

427
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,200
truly as formidable as the rumors suggest?

428
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,070
Aren't you also an heir of the Eight Supremes?

429
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,640
He is the real deal.

430
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,350
The legend of the Eight Supremes

431
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,160
must have been exaggerated.

432
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,030
Still, we shouldn't take it lightly.

433
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,440
Here's the thing.

434
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,920
The Eight Supremes aren't as formidable as they're made out to be,

435
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,880
and the situation isn't as bad as it looks.

436
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,790
As long as we don't harm Chen Duo,

437
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,640
we can stay in the village.

438

439
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,510
I'll handle the village banquet

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,310
and keep a close eye on Ma Xianhong.

441

511
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,790
but what were these Outsiders

512
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,240
truly fighting for?

513
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,200
It all stemmed from two sects of Outsiders

514
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,920
with differing views

515
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
on how their superpower should be passed down.

516
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,030
The Outsiders of the Chan Sect believe

517
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,550
in following the will of heaven

518
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,200
and explaining the law of nature.

519
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,070
They categorize all things into different ranks,

520
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,880
emphasizing the importance of teaching according to one's talents.

521
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,640
Those of the Jie Sect, however,

522
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
advocate the concept of fifty paths to Tao,

523
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,310
and that fate can only be predicted in forty-nine of them.

524
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,750
They believe that all beings have an unpredictable chance at life

525
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,480
and promote equality for all.

526
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,640
They seek the way of formlessness.

527
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,790
Their disciples are often beasts, birds, and other extraordinary creatures.

528
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Compared to the Chan Sect's self-proclaimed orthodoxy,

529
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,240
where teachings are only passed on to the greatest,

530
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,640
I align more

531
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,160
with the Jie Sect's pursuit of formlessness.

532
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,550
Look.

533
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,310
Our lives

534
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,110
are like those puppets on the stage,

535
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,920
lost in illusions.

536
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,750
Others,

537
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,310

539
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,480
life, and death

540
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,920
are all constantly pulling

541
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,510
and manipulating us.

542
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,750
Gradually,

543
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,920
we grow weaker

544
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,680
and numb,

545
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,720
silently enduring

546
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
the manipulation of fate.

547
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,110
We lose ourselves

548
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,070
and our control over our own destiny.

549
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,310
Aren't you here

550
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,720
to break free from all of this?

551
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,200
Here in Biyou Village,

552
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,510
I hope everyone gets the chance

553
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,270
to realize their vision.

554
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,680
I will help you,

555
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,880
and all the suffering

556
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,480
will cease to exist.

557
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,030
This is all too bizarre.

558
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,750
Ma Xianhong,

559
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,270
who exactly are you?

560
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,070
What are you doing here?

561
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,240
And what does Chen Duo

562
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,000
mean to you?

563
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,640
You've all been wandering around the village for quite some time.

564
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,110
What have you discovered?

565
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,350
Share with us.

566
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,550
I haven't discovered anything.

567
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,640
I've discovered something.

568
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,030
I now know the identities of the two pig castrators.

569
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,310
One is Du Yongbo,

570
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,310
35 years old, an architect.

571
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,720
The other is Zhang Jiang, 42 years old,

572
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,640
who runs an entertainment company.

573
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,510
They're both ordinary people

574
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,000
and arrived in the village two months ago.

575
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,110
I actually found something.

576
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,110
The two Outsiders

577
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,270
on the company's wanted list

578

disappeared

579
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,110
a few months ago.

580
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,310
I didn't expect them

581
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,640
to end up here.

582
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,830
Me?

583
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,340

You guys are too slow.

[Details of Biyou Village's residents]
Here are all the villagers' details.

The details are pretty thorough,

the girl from the Northeast Region. Are you here too?

592
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,520
[Northeast Region]
I am.

593
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,720
This girl from the Northeast Region is interesting.

594
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,510
She hasn't appeared

595
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,680
but knows everything about our progress.

596
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,960
I'm with you on this.

597
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,850
[Southwest Region]
Erzhuang,

598
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,630
we won't be able to trust you unless you clearly explain

599
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,080
how you got this information.

600
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,870
[Northeast Region]
What do you mean by that?

601
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,750
Not showing up at the start of the mission

602
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,110
was understandable.

603
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,110
But we've come this far,

604
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,310
and there's still no face-to-face communication.

605
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,480
I'm afraid I can't trust you.

606
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,160
[Northeast Region]
Xiao, are you also ganging up on me

607
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,680
with them?

608
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't really mind

609
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,880
whether it's face-to-face or not,

610
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,350
but simply throwing this info at us

611
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,640
is quite suspicious.

612
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,730
[Northeast Region]
Do you think

613
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,420
being left out all alone feels good?

614
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,680
This is me. Feel free to take a look.

615
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,310
I don't mind revealing my identity.

616
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm the daughter of the Northeast Region's Supervisor,

617
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
but you can just call me Erzhuang.

618
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,750
I'm sorry.

619
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,680
I don't mean to avoid you all.

620
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,830
It's just that I don't even have

621
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,790
what it takes to sit with you all.

622
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,070
My superpower allows me to observe and manipulate electromagnetic waves.

623
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,550
I once trained under the Wuliu Sect

624
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,590
to master the Out-of-Body Technique.

625
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,960
Back then, I was still whole.

626
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,880
But an accident

627
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
left me like this.

628
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,400
I never expected those two skills

629
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,350
would later become the means for my survival.

630
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,680
Now, my consciousness can detach from my body

631
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,720
and exist as electromagnetic waves for extended periods.

632
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,440
Perhaps it's fate,

633
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
a blessing wrapped in misfortune.

634
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,750
By controlling electromagnetic waves,

635
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,270
I can join your conversations.

It's all right.

I feel much lighter after telling you the truth.

Now, you can understand

641
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,920
why I was able to gather

all the villagers' details so quickly, right?

643

The number you have dialed...

679
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,070
He doesn't answer the phone,

680
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,110
and he doesn't reply to messages either.

681
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,630
Looks like he's guilty.

682
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,590
We haven't even asked anything yet.

683
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,670
I've found

684
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,400
a familiar face here too.

685
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,110
[Qiu Rang]

686
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,280
Isn't this the guy

687
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,800
who saved Chen Duo that day?

688
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,400
Qiu Rang?

689
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,710
The situation in this village appears

690
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,670
to be even more complicated than I had anticipated.

691
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,760
Based on the information gathered by Erzhuang,

692
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,510
the people in this village

693
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,400
can be roughly divided into three categories.

694
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,550
The first category is the most ordinary villagers,

695
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,510
like the two people I met

696
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,150
when I was castrating pigs.

697
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,320
They are the most ordinary people

698
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,550
and don't pose any threat to us.

699
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,230
They are too weak to fight.

700
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,320
The second category is the early-stage Outsiders.

701
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,510
They have a lot of magic weapons,

702
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,880
like the ones who fought you in the warehouse

703
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,510
and injured Xia Liuqing.

704
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,550
These Outsiders have superpower

705
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,070
that don't match their combat experience.

706
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,480
Their origins are somewhat strange,

707
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,280
but they aren't too hard to handle

708
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,030
in actual combat.

709
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,510
The third category

710
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,510
is the Outsiders who have been in the village the longest

711
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,710
and are closest to Ma Xianhong.

712
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,440
According to the information,

713
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,280
each of them has skills

714
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,510
similar to that of Qiu Rang.

715
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,440
They are a little harder to deal with,

716
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,510
but we can launch sneak attacks

717
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,800
and take them down one by one.

718
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,630
Is there anything you want to add?

719
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,510
Impressive, Bao.

720
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,710
Bao's analysis is spot on.

721
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,000
This village has taken in

722
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,400
a lot of Outsiders on the run.

723
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,710
Take a look at this file

724
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,670
on a girl named Fu Rong.

725
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,150
[Fu Rong]
She looks clean and refined,

726
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,920
with a good job

727
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,030
and education.

728
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,920
She was even a disciple of a renowned swordsmanship master.

729
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,800
But when you keep scrolling down,

730
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,000
that's when things get interesting.

731
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,670
Zhang Chulan,

732
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,590
looks like your player...

733
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,070
friend

734
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,670
has hit the jackpot.

735
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,760
Xiao,

736
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,230
why are you smiling?

737
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,710
Did you find something?

738
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,480
This Zhao Guizhen

739
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,110
is quite interesting.

740
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,710
Guys,

741
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,440
I'll call dibs on him first.

742
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,510
This person doesn't have any criminal record.

743
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,000
Xiao,

744
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,880
do you know him?

745
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,230
I don't.

746
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,760
Zhang,

747
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,550
can you tell me

748
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,070
your first impression on this person?

749
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,230
He looks righteous,

750
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,150
quite serious,

751
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,840
and even a bit rigid.

752
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
How about now?

753
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,280
Can you still see righteousness in his eyes?

754
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,630
Sometimes,

755
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,590
people can be judged by their appearance.

756
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,510
A person's true nature is hidden

757
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,800
in the subtleties of their facial expressions,

758
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,670
which need to be broken down and carefully analyzed.

759
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,800
Take Heiguan, for instance.

760
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,150
At first glance, he appears

761
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,030
to be just a rugged middle-aged man,

762
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,280
with clear signs of age

763
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,480
marked on his face.

764
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,670
His habit of raising his eyebrows

765
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,510
creates wrinkles,

766
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,760
and the long-term marks of his constant vigilance

767
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,110
suggest that he's more meticulous than he appears.

768
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,840
His reluctance to show his teeth

769
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,150
shows

770
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,440
that he's tight-lipped

771
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,230
and prefers to conceal his thoughts.

772
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,400
His strong and jutting chin

773
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,550
is a symbol of toughness and aggression,

774
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,280
but the relaxed facial muscles suggest

775
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,630
that he's not prone to extremes.

776
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,400
So,

777
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,000
Heiguan is someone

778
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,070
who won't put too much pressure on himself

779
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,710
even when faced with a challenging task.

780
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,320
Zhang,

781
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
based on what I've just explained,

782
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,960
take another look at this face

783
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,190
and tell me how you feel now.

784
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,320
He seems sullen

785
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,510
and indifferent.

786
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,920
Now, focus on the corners of his mouth.

787
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,920
I can't pinpoint it,

788
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
but something feels strange.

789
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,760
He's ruthless

790
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,670
and brutal.

791
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,630
I don't usually care about such features in ordinary people,

792
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,070
but these details

793
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,710
shouldn't appear on the face

794
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,400
of someone who collects herbs to cure others.

795
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,590
Guys,

796
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,440
as you all know,

797
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,150
I'm a patient,

798
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,230
and I'm especially sensitive

799
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,760
to the presence of fellow patients.

800
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,880
And Zhao Guizhen here

801
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,550
likely shares

802
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,400
the same condition as mine.

803
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,280
Fellow patients, huh?

804
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,440
Exactly,

805
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
he's a fellow patient.

806
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,000
What kind of condition is it?

807
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,960
Should we give them a beating?

808
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,710
I've never been scared

809
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,320
of a fight.

810
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,150
Bao,

811
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
enough with the beating and fighting.

812
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,480
We're here for Chen Duo this time.

813
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,280
Right,

814
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,150
we've got all the info on the village,

815
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,110
but how are we supposed to find Chen Duo?

816
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,150
That's easy.

817
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,150
Bao,

818
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,230
tell them

819
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,880
what to do when problems arise.

820
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,110
If there's a problem,

821
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,360
talk to Si.

822
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,480
That's the way to do it!

823
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,590
We must respect our leaders.

824
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,110
As those working under them,

825
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,920
we must constantly seek their advice.

826
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Our leaders are always wise

827
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,880
and visionary.

828
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,440
For minor issues,

829
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,920
we must avoid bothering them.

830
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,760
We must always ease their burdens.

831
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,320
For larger issues,

832
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,070
we must follow their guidance.

833
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,480
Only under their leadership

834
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,800
can we overcome

835
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
our confusion.

836
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,550
Only under Xu Si's leadership can the Lubei Region

837
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,800
enter a new phase.

838
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,920
Cut it out, Zhang Chulan.

839
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,480
Your leader Xu Si isn't here,

840
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,630
so stop buttering him up.

841
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,280
Besides,

842
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,920
the headquarters

843
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,480
is the one in charge now.

844
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,110
I know that.

845
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,920
We're just used to

846
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,710
rehearsing

847
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,840
for the year-end party.

848
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,920
Bao!

849
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,920
Why is it still running without a head?

850
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,400
I saw it.

851
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,280
Its head fell off.

852
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,000
I saw it already.

853
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,920
This thing has quite some skill.

854
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,670
Everyone, use your abilities to capture it.

855
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,800
Got it.

856
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,510
Boulder Toss.

857
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,400
Boulder Toss?

858
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,320
Wang Ye?

859
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,630
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

860
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,360
Good evening, Wang Ye.

861
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,630
Good evening.

862
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,320
Break.

863
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,630
Wang Ye?

864
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,030
Why are you also here?

865
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,030
Lian,

866
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,820
how come you're always around?

867
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,420
[Wang Ye, Gate of Gale]

868
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,000
Is that your friend?

869
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,400
It's complicated.

870
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,440
I'll explain it to you later.

871
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,590
Come with me.

872
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,320
Mr. Ye.

873
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,320
Wait for me!

874
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,110
What's the situation?

875
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Watch out.

876
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,800
That person is hiding in there.

877
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,150
A person?

878
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,510
Where's the person?

879
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,150
Wait.

880
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,920
The person...

881
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,000
Where is the person

882
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,440
you were talking about?

883
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,510
Are you sure that's a person?

884
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,280
Where is it?

885
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,230
It seems like NDT Express

886
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,710
doesn't know everything.

887
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,960
At least you know nothing

888
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,400
about Biyou Village.

889
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,440
Bao,

890
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,110
where are you going?

891
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,150
Come back.

892
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
This puppet appears to be moving.

893
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,710
The puppet didn't move.

894
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,400
Come back and join the team. It's time to wrap things up.

895
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,920
You must have been mistaken.

896
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,710
We can call it a day now.

897
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,510
Well.

898
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,360
Why are you scared?

899
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm not scared.

900
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,230
What could possibly scare me?

901
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,440
Let go of me.

902
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,280
Come on.

903
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,630
What's there to be scared of?

904
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,920
I'm not scared.

905
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,550
Did you really not move?

906
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,480
Caught you.

907
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,190
These guys

908
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,760
ruined my Ruhua!

909
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,710
Zhang Chulan.

910
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,510
Is this thing alive?

911
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,030
Alive?

912
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,280
You could say it's alive,

913
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,710
or you could say it's not.

914
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,280
These are all magic weapons

915
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,590
empowered with the ability to use qi.

916
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,320
Wang,

917
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,880
have you also crossed paths with Ma Xianhong before?

918
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,710
Not only have we crossed paths,

919
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,880
but he also invited me here.

920
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,230
No wonder it can't be killed.

921
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,590
For someone to make a puppet this strong,

922
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,760
this person's skills

923
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,880
are certainly praiseworthy.

924
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,880
It looks quite real.

925
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,360
They actually moved.

926
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,400
Who moved?

927
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,230
Behind you.

928
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,190
What's going on?

929
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,840
I was just getting to the most crucial part

930
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,230
when you interrupted me.

931
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,590
Qing?

932
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,480
Zhang Chulan?

933
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,110
What brings you guys here?

934
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,670
Qing,

935
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,760
we tried calling and messaging you,

936
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,150
but you didn't answer.

937
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,630
This is just too crude.

938
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,510
Your friend here seems to know

939
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,550
a lot about these things.

940
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,710
They're not just things.

941
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,360
They have names.

942
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,550
They're called Ruhua.

943
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,230
Don't wander around the village.

944
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,230
This isn't a place for people like you.

945
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,880
That's strange.

946
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,320
This Zhuge Qing seems different

947
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,710
from the one I knew before.

948
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,360
He managed to control Ruhua in just a few days.

949
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,280
What are he and Ma Xianhong plotting?
