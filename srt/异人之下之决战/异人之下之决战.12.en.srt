Alright, Meng.

38

Now,

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,200
you can no longer do anything for Chen Duo.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,480
At least,

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,870
give her your respect.

Today, sending her away

46

is your responsibility.

47

Chen Duo,

48
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,960

Under the premise of not harming anyone,

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,080

53

Really?

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,470
I get to choose?

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,590
Yes.

56
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,000
Can I choose to do it

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
myself?

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course,

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
you can.

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Since Xiao has said so,

61
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,520
let me add

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
one more thing.

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,240
First,

64
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,960
you must not directly or indirectly

65
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
harm anyone.

66
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,000
Second,

67
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,750
we need to witness your final moments.

68
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,520
As long as these two conditions are met,

69
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,400
you are free

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
from now on,

71
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,360
within the next 24 hours.

72
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,120
No matter what choice you make,

73
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,520
no matter what you need,

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,030
I guarantee that

75
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,150
everyone here

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,240
will not reject you.

77
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,590
Anything

78
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,680
can be done?

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,590
As long as it meets those two conditions,

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,470
yes.

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,710
Bao,

82
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,710
stay away from her.

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't be afraid.

84
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,430
It's fine.

85
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,120
You can turn around now.

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,950
It's really solid.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,120
Can I take it?

88
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,870
Won't your poison leak out?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,560
It won't.

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,310
I'm suppressing it.

91
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,680
What if it can't be suppressed?

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,830
Once I can't control it,

93
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,830
the original poison won't spread outward.

94
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,680
It will spread upward,

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,430
following the lower,

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
middle, and upper levels

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,040
of the elixir.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,920
In the end,

99
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,000
it will disappear along with me.

100
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,830
So it won't cause you trouble.

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,390
Well,

102
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,510
since that's the case,

103
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
we'll wait with you.

104
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,000
I still don't get it.

105
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,390
She's just a young girl,

106
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,430
why does she have to suffer like this?

107
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
She's just unlucky.

108
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,430
Unlucky?

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,270
Does being unlucky mean she has to suffer like this?

110
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,870
Whether unlucky or not, it will end now.

111
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,190
Why can't she leave happily?

112
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Why can't she have a happy ending?

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,120
Aren't you happy now?

114
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,830
Now do you understand

115
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,120
why I hate him?

116
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,240
This person is unreasonable.

117
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm actually very happy now.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
Staying here

119
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,310
will only bring trouble to everyone.

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,480
My world

121
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,190
is completely different from here.

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,040
Although I really want to stay,

123
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,870
that place

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,070
is where I truly belong.

125
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,190
I will have to go back eventually.

126
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,270
There's just

127
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,390
a little regret lingering.

128
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
This...

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,750
Alright, Meng.

130
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,480
Don't you understand yet?

131
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,800
Let go.

132
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,390
She's just a guest in this world.

133
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,630
Stop trying to apply

134
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,270
the thinking of this world to her.

135
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,920
If you really want to be good to her,

136
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,750
then send her off properly today.

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
By the way,

138
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,190
Duo,

139
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,600
you said there's a little regret.

140
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,270
What's wrong?

141
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,750
Can I say it?

142
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
Of course, you can say it.

143
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,310
I want to

144
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,560
go shopping.

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,870
When I was studying at the company, I went shopping,

146
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,750
but it was just for learning basic knowledge.

147
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,160
All my actions were restricted.

148
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,800
Later, when I went to the village,

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,870
Chief Ma also said

150
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,870
I should try to avoid crowded places.

151
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,510
He wanted to

152
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,870
cure me.

153
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,190
I wanted to repay him,

154
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,160
so I listened to him.

155
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,070
You can.

156
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,560
Duo,

157
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,830
but going into the city will take quite a bit of time.

158
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,030
Do you still have time?

159
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,910
In these years,

160
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,550
the time I can suppress the poison has also increased.

161
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,200
At its peak, I could last for twenty hours.

162
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,630
I just don't know

163
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,360
if I can still hold on that long now.

164
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,790
I oppose it.

165
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,030
Everyone,

166
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,670
other matters are negotiable,

167
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,390
but this one is absolutely not.

168
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,270
Taking Chen Duo, with no protective measures,

169
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,120
into a crowded area is too risky.

170
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,840
And the self-limitation she mentioned

171
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,320
is just one side of the story.

172
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,960
Who will take responsibility if something goes wrong?

173
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,080
Chen Duo,

174
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,000

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,510
If my poison spreads here,

350
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,960
it'll be a huge problem for all of you.

351
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,160
I know what you're

352
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,030
afraid of about me.

353
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,000
And I know

354
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,880
what you're expecting.

355
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,720
Mr. Liao has been kind to me.

356
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,830
You also wanted to be kind to me.

357
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,480
You've been kind too.

358
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,720
And many others have, too.

359
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,440
I want to repay you all.

360
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,640
What I can do,

361
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,750
I've done my best.

362
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,720
But I really can't

363
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,790
live like these people.

364
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,400
The place you brought me to

365
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,880
is great.

366
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,310
But

367
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,400
I can't cope with it.

368
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,880
Mr. Liao always said

369
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,480
you're a smart girl.

370
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,070
You understand everything.

371
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,200
You're clear in your heart.

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,920
But I'm the fool.

373
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,240
Look at her skin.

374
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,240
It's not contagious, is it?

375
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,960
Ugly freak,

376
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,790
keep away from me!

377
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,070
Why are there such weird things?

378
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,640

379

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,350
Let's go.

do you remember Golden-Tooth Black Bear?

396
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,310

But

405
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,510
he disappeared.

was captured by me.

409
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,960
Well done, Duo.

410
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,110
Earlier, Ren Fei had plans to work with us

411
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,160
to take him down.

412
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,830

Now her wish has finally come true.

416
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,960
So this time,

417
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,960
since you guys didn't take me back,

Maybe.

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,000
