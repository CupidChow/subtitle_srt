1
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,710
What happened to the house?

2
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,230
Why is it gone?

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,950
Meng, Qiu,

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,590
is there any signal left on your phones?

5
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,430
I have no signal.

6
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,070
Same here.

7
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,680
Looks like Ma Xianhong has stepped in,

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,200
hiding Chen Duo

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,480
and blocking our signal.

10
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,030
As expected of one of the Eight Supremes,

11
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,240
Ma Xianhong's Divine Forge

12
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,080
can even make a house disappear into thin air.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,150
All right, Meng,

14
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,030
you and Qiu figure out a way to contact the company.

15
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,910
I'll go find someone to break his Divine Forge.

16
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,910
The signal was suddenly cut off,

17
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,080
and all the temporary workers are unreachable.

18
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,240
We've gathered concrete evidence

19
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,000
that Ma Xianhong and the Refining Furnace

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,910
will bring a great disaster to the Outsiders' world.

21
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,000
But now, with the temporary workers missing,

22
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,430
the worst-case scenario

23
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,800
is that they've been swayed by Ma Xianhong,

24
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,430

That Chen Junyan who taught you basketball?

Why didn't you go find him after you left the Bunker?

82

but couldn't find him.

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,750
He's an alien.

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,120
He's probably already left Earth.

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,830
An alien?

Fierce?

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,480
It means you are impressive.

103

You are so impressive.

104

It's a call from the Northeast Region's Gao Lian.

119
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,920
Got it.

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,240
Gao Erzhuang's consciousness must always

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
stay connected to her body,

122
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,830
or it could be dangerous.

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,870
She has never lost

124
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,120
this connection

125
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,680
with her body before.

126
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,310
But according to Gao Lian's information,

127
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,120
just as we lost track

128
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
of the temporary workers,

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,480
Gao Erzhuang also lost

130
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,870
connection with her body.

131
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,190
There are only two possibilities.

132
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,000
First,

133
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,240
she decided to commit suicide

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,830
and voluntarily severed the electromagnetic connection.

135
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,240
Second,

136
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,600
someone cut off the electromagnetic waves

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,750
by some means,

138
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,000
leaving Erzhuang

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
unable to break free.

140
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,600
How much time does Erzhuang have left?

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Half an hour at most.

142
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,240
If Gao Erzhuang can't reconnect

143
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,720
to her body through the electromagnetic waves

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,830
within that time,

145
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,560
she'll surely die.

146
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,510
This village seems suspicious.

147
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,720
Someone's blocked our signal.

148

149

There's a ghost!

150
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,430
A ghost!

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,950
Open the door!

152
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,860

154

Er...Erzhuang?

155
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600

156

Ma,

157
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,390
what's the meaning of this?

158
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,390
Why did you hide

159
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,840
Chen Duo and Feng Baobao?

160
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,550
Are you declaring war on us?

161
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,440
You don't need to worry.

162
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
Feng Baobao won't be in any danger.

163

167
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
What's this?

168
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,030
The truth.

169
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
What is she trying to say?

170
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,550
I understand now.

171
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,080
You don't have to swear.

172

Are you saying that your surname

173
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,870
is Gao?

174
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
She's saying

175
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,630
that you're not right in the head

176
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,390
and should spend more time in the sun.

177
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,750
She didn't say anything.

178
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,790
How do you know?

179
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,980
[Someone's trying to kill me.]

180
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,060
[Help me.]

181
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,360
Check it out.

182
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,480
Do you think the headquarters

183
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,360
fully entrusted Liao Zhong with the power

184
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,030
to end Chen Duo?

185
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
This

186
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,480
is the real ending they planned

187
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,750
for her.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
To be honest,

189
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,000
I was there the night Chen Duo

190
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,960
killed Liao Zhong.

191
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
I was worried about her

192
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,440
going to see him alone.

193
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,790
And it turned out I was right to follow her.

194
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,320
What have you

195
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,360
done to me?

196
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,480
Now,

197
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,670
Mr. Liao,

198
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,960
end my life.

199
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
No.

200
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,240
Bi,

201
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,720
you have the switch in your hand too?

202
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,630
Everyone,

203
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,320
as the person responsible for this incident,

204
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,910
Liao Zhong has completely failed in his duties.

205
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,630
If possible,

206
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,670
I wouldn't want to intervene.

207
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,360
Just as I thought.

208
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,960
The headquarters pressed the switch,

209
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,870
but why is Chen Duo unharmed?

210
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,390
When I returned the collar,

211
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,840
I also took

212
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,320
their control over it.

213
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,150
So,

214
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,510
at that moment, Chen Duo

215
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,910
was already dead as an NDT Express employee.

216
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,360
Now, the girl

217
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,240
called Chen Duo who survived

218
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,550
should live a different life.

219
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,200
Zhang Chulan,

220
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,150
I can understand

221
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,240
NDT Express's lack of sympathy

222
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,870
for Chen Duo,

223
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,630
but you're in the same situation as her,

224
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,270
yet you side with them.

225
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,480
I don't get it.

226
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,910
Have you ever thought

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,750
about how the company would treat Feng Baobao

228
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,720
if she were the one who made a mistake?

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,510
What choice

230
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,000
would you make then?

231
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,480
Since you've come to Biyou Village,

232
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,270
stay here

233
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,030
and break free from NDT Express's control,

234
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,750
just like Chen Duo.

235
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,150
I'll help you.

236
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,840
Ma Xianhong,

237
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
your self-righteousness

238
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,720
has completely clouded your judgment.

239
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,120
You keep saying

240
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,750
that NDT Express is manipulating us,

241
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,080
but your presenting your so-called kindness and justice

242
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
in such an eloquent manner

243
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
is just another way for you to try to control me.

244
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,630
Ma,

245
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,030
I truly can't see through you.

246
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,320
Are you a madman

247
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,320
or a sage?

248
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,150
People like you are the hardest to deal with.

249
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,480
On the surface, it seems like you have no weaknesses,

250
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,790
but a person's desires

251
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,600
are their weaknesses.

252
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,910
I saw you cry when watching

253
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,670
the puppet show,

254
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,390
but you

255
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,720
are not nearly as powerful as you think you are.

256
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,480
So?

257
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,360
Don't go head-to-head with the company.

258
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
You don't stand a chance.

259
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,150
Ma Xianhong,

260
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,000
have you thought

261
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,550
about what kind of consequences

262
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,870
your actions will bring to the Outsiders' world?

263
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,720
Watch me roll.

264
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,200
Electromagnetic waves transfer.

265
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,720
Easy as pie.

Here I come!

267
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,790
Oops, I've been spotted.

268
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,390
Let me transfer the waves again.

269
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,160
What's going on?

270
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,920
Seriously? My teammate's a total disaster.

271
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,160
Why did you shatter them all?

272
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,880
I might as well be dead.

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,550
These two are complete fools.

274
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
What happened to her?

275
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,550

276
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,590

Who said I was dead?

278
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,590
There are still faint traces of electromagnetic waves

279
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,680
lingering in Ruhua's limbs.

280
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,510
I'll gather them

281
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,110
and reassemble a new body.

282
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,240
Is this Erzhuang?

283

What is she trying to do?

284
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,590
She's heading upwards.

285
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,680
Maybe she's trying to break the blockade

286
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,830
and find a signal?

287
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,270
The signal's cut off,

288
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,480
and the exit's blocked.

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:01,920
Yay.

347
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,200
Guan.

348
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,240
Wow, this place had quite some action going on.

349
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,310
Meng,

350
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,640
looks like we missed out on something.

351
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,270
As I suspected, the sun is fake.

352
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
I knew something was off.

353
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,830
If we didn't have to eliminate Ma Xianhong,

354
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,960
I'd really like to learn a few moves from him.

355
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
It looks like Biyou Village

356
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,310
was all conjured by Ma Xianhong.

357
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,960
Now, we're stuck in a situation

358
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,960
where he's got us trapped.

359
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,110
We've reached the designated coordinates.

360
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,400
Thermal imaging shows unusually active readings.

361
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,640
Biyou Village is probably hidden in the area,

362
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,110
but we cannot locate the exact target.

363
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,030
The village has always

364
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,510
been right under our noses,

365
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,030
but we never saw it.

366
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,200
Thanks to the coordinates

367
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,510
sent by Erzhuang,

368
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,750
we can now confirm

369
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,590
that the village

370
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,400
is hidden within this mountain.

371
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,440
Ma Xianhong must have used some kind of illusion

372
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,550
to hide it,

373
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,920
and we still cannot confirm

374
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
its exact location.

375
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,400
Looks like

376
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,000
it's time to deal with

377
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,880
the threat posed by Biyou Village.

378
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
What's the situation with the temporary workers now?

379
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,240
They are still waiting for our instructions.

380
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,790
Waiting?

381
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,110
The situation is already so clear.

382
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,030
What are they still waiting for?

383
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,070
They should take action.

384
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,270
Such an unclear command to take action

385
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
could lead these special agents

386
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,070
to think that headquarters has abandoned them.

387
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,640
How are they supposed to proceed

388
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,680
without any support?

389
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,030
You were pretty hard

390
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,200
on the special agents before.

391
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,920
What made you soften up now?

392
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,110
The reason I was hard on them

393
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,920
was due to my lack of trust.

394
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,000
Despite that, I know

395
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,640
that we shouldn't play games with the brothers on the front line.

396
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,510
Right now,

397
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,110
they need a clear response from us,

398
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,720
and our instructions mustn't be ambiguous.

399
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,960
Is there any need to ask?

400
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,880
They should eliminate all evil

401
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,070
to prevent any future complications.

402
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,640
Good.

403
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,480
That's an excellent decision.

404
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,200
I support you, Huang.

405
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,070
The official order

406
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,200
will bear your signature and be issued by you.

407
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,640
We're still discussing it here, aren't we?

408
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,270
Huang,

409
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,270
I've already said it.

410
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,310
I support you.

411
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,310
Fine.

412
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,880
If you won't issue the order,

413
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,480
I will.

414
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,110
Exterminate Biyou Village,

415
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,830
bring the Divine Forge back to the company,

416
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,070
and no personnel involved in the operation

417
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,240
are allowed to keep anything for themselves.

418
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,510
Upon returning,

419
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,720
they must undergo an integrity investigation.

420
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,480
This order

421
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,240
only needs my signature.

422
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,030
If anything goes wrong,

423
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,750
I, Bi Youlong, will take full responsibility.

424
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,350
Great.

425
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,720
Mr. Bi, you are a man who steps up when needed.

426
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,110
I respect you for that.

427
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,750
Gentlemen,

428
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,000
calm down.

429
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,350
There are over eighty Outsiders in Biyou Village.

430
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,550
You want to take responsibility?

431
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,070
I'm afraid you aren't able

432
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,960
to shoulder such a responsibility on your own.

433
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,550
If anything goes wrong,

434
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,510
wiping it all out

435
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,750
might seem like a quick and efficient solution.

436
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,790
Destruction

437
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,310
is, indeed, an effective method,

438
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,270
but gentlemen,

439
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,960
think carefully.

440
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,790
How many problems

441
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,640
have humans faced throughout history?

442
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,790
And even now, the world

443
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,920
still faces countless issues.

444
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,350
When you look deeper,

445
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,310
you'll see

446
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,440
that humanity

447
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,750
is the true root of the problems.

448
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,830
So, what now?

449
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,350
Are we to destroy everything?

450
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,550
What we need is stability and harmony.

451
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,200
Problems should be addressed promptly,

452
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,680
but the methods we use must be chosen wisely.

453
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,200
What truly brings about collapse is going to extremes.

454
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Exterminating Biyou Village

455
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,590
is way too extreme.

456
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,750
If that's the solution

457
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,640
going forward,

458
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,400
then what's the point of us even being here?

459
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,310
We might as well just hire a group of assassins

460
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,680
to handle everything.

461
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,440
Don't you think?

462
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,480
The following

463
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,000
is the official order from headquarters.

464
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,880
Ma Xianhong has lost all sense of right and wrong,

465
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,680
resorting to extremism.

466
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,070
Within Biyou Village,

467
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,830
he is sheltering a large number of criminal Outsiders,

468
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,920
refusing to change.

469
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,200
He's also utilizing the Refining Furnace

470
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,480
to create and transform Outsiders,

471
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,240
ignoring the balance of the Outsiders' world

472
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,880
and breaking the population cap.

473
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,240
If not stopped immediately,

474
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,750
it will cause catastrophic consequences.

475
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,690
The Refining Furnace must be destroyed at once,

476
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,580
and the Divine Forge should be brought back to the company.

477
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,200
Ma Xianhong and his associates should be captured if possible.

478
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,480
All relevant villagers of Biyou Village should be rounded up

479
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,130
and taken back to the company for a thorough investigation.

480
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,880
The temporary worker Chen Duo

481
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,350
has confessed to killing Liao Zhong

482
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,640
