Bi,

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
this time, they didn't give us

45
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,710
any chance to find fault.

46
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,000
But this report...

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,920
I don't believe a single word of it.

50
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm afraid we made a huge mistake.

51
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,470
Bi,

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
what do you mean by that?

53
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,840
They were originally lone wolves,

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,520
but now we might have turned them

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,080
into a pack of wolves.

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,840
They're much harder to deal with now.

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,870
An integrity investigation

58
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,470
must be conducted at the hidden fortress.

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,120
Anyone found with issues

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,470
shouldn't come back out.

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,910
This mission,

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
the temporary workers,

63
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,280
had too many interactions

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,630
with Chen Duo and Ma Xianhong.

65
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Behind all this,

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,520
there are still many issues

67
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,120
we need to thoroughly investigate.

68
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,960

69
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,280
they

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,630
should head straight to the hidden fortress.

71
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,910
When accepting this mission,

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,680
what I cared about most

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,240
was Bao's safety.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,910
What I really need to think about is

75
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,280
what consequences this operation

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,430
will bring for Bao.

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,960
Bao

78
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,280
might even lose

79
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,000
the protection of her special squad member status.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,470
Just safely completing this mission isn't enough.

81
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,360
The secret of Bao's identity

82
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,870
is still under threat of exposure.

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
It wasn't until Lao Meng appeared

84
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,960
that I saw a glimmer of hope.

85
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,710
Lao Meng's attitude toward Chen Duo...

86
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,680
Don't hurt her yet.

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,080
Let me talk to her first.

88

[Northeast]

89
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,660
Supporting Lao Meng,

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,350
this command actually left some room.

91
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,950
Figuring out a way to capture her alive,

92
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
I had no objections.

93
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,800
Capture her alive, then.

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
And you all agreed,

95
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,560
making it clear that capturing her alive was the priority.

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,680
What this reveals,

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
I believe,

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,910
might be the key to my success.

99
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,160
I have to admit,

100
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,360
not only in strength,

101
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,720
but in every aspect,

102
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,070
you all are very seasoned.

103
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,870
But apart from Lao Meng,

104
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,720
none of you seem to

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,750
have deeply considered Chen Duo.

106
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,070
To you, Chen Duo is just

107
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,190
prey,

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
another mission.

109
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,070
But at this moment,

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I can no longer ignore Chen Duo.

111
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,800
How to handle her

112
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,040
is crucial to whether Bao and these temporary workers

113
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
can truly become friends.

114
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,190
Fortunately,

115
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,390
I had two strokes of incredible luck.

116
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,120
The first stroke of luck...

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
if Chen Duo had still been

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,000
wrestling with her fate at that time,

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,600
I would've been in real trouble.

120
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,920
However,

121
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,160
Chen Duo had already made her choice.

122
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,190
When she went to see Liao Zhong with that collar,

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
she had already decided.

124
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,920
Next,

125
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,630
it was my turn to choose.

126
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,750
Should I push Chen Duo toward Lao Ma,

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
or step away from this battle?

128
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,870
The conclusion was clear:

129
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
being killed

130
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,390
or captured

131
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,630
would do Chen Duo no good at all.

132
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,950
You would simply

133
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,680
complete the mission without any burden.

134
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,750
You are impressive,

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,310
far more capable than I am.

136
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,000
Since that's the case,

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,310
I'll ask you to bear more for me.

138
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,510
I want you to stand fully

139
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,160
with Bao.

140
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,000
For Bao,

141
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,160
I must pull you down

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,750
from your lofty position as hunters.

143
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,190
I need you to see Chen Duo's situation

144
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,950
as your own.

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,830
And to empathetically understand

146
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,160
Chen Duo's choice.

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,870
I've made my choice.

148
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,720
Actually,

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,270
I had another stroke of luck.

150
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,830
Never mind.

151
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,560
Anyway, I've already completed the harvest.

152
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,430
I'm not worried about you figuring out

153
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,240
the calculations I've made behind the scenes,

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
because you can't see what I truly want.

155
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,190
And that,

156
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,390
is precisely what you're willing to give.

157
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,630
What I want to harvest

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
is your amplified empathy.

159
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
Not pity,

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,720
not that condescending,

161
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,270
lofty kind of sentiment.

162
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,040
It has to be empathy,

163
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,600
the kind that mourns when one of your own suffers.

164
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,680
If I let you fight freely,

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,630
the winner's emotions

166
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,310
might degrade into pity.

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
That won't work.

168
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,190
Empathy requires

169
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,560
finding common ground with the other person.

170
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,190
When you've developed

171
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,870
enough empathy for Chen Duo,

172
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,950
the time for the harvest arrives.

173
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,560
The one to reap it won't be me...

174
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,870
it'll be Bao.

175
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,630
Treat the mission on two levels:

176
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
emotionally, offer empathy;

177
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,120
rationally,

178
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,480
weigh the pros and cons.

179
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,510
On the first day of the operation,

180
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,190
I asked Bao,

181
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,430
Bao,

182
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,600
I remember Xu Si said

183
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
you can't lie.

184
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,480
If you're given

185
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,920
a carefully designed lie,

186
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,070
you'll treat it as truth and follow through.

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,480
Is that right?

188
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,270
No problem.

189
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,870
Of course, Bao will play the same role as you,

190
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,310
offering empathy.

191
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
But to expect you to naturally reach

192
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,720
a deep understanding with Chen Duo

193
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,560
in the short time at Biyou Village...

194
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,430
I'm not that naive.

195
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,800
So,

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,950
I chose to play the rational role.

197
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,430
I detached myself

198
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,830
from the Lubei special team.

199
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,510
Perhaps in ordinary times,

200
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,600
you're all outliers in this world.

201
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,920
But,

202
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,310
in this small group,

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,800
the carefree,

204
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,000
unrestrained ones

205
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,070
who show empathy for Chen Duo...

206
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,800
you are the majority.

207
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,560
Then let it be this way.

208
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,070
You exclude me,

209
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,480
the mundane one,

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,950
bound by rigid rules.

211
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,870
The cautious one,

212
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,040
always calculating gains and losses...

213
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,310
I am the true outlier in this group.

214
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,270
Our own issues

215
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,000
should be resolved by ourselves.

216
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,360
So, please,

217
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,120
stop interfering.

218
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,600
By excluding me, the outlier,

219
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,560
you'll come to realize more deeply

220
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,070
the commonality among yourselves.

221
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,190
In this way,

222
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,360
the empathy you feel for Chen Duo

223
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
can be more effectively

224
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,270
transferred to Bao.

225
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,430
This,

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
is the true gain from this mission.

227
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,440
As for what happens next, no one can say.

228
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,750
I don't know how long

229
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,960
this relationship between Bao

230
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,270
and the company will last.

231
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,150
I must prepare for the worst.

232
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,480
If one day you break with the company

233
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,150
and become its enemy,

234
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
the most likely force

235
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
the company will use against you

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,150
is this group of people.

237
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,510
Bao,

238
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm weak.

239
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,550
I'm just a minor character.

240
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,440
I don't have the strength to sweep through the world,

241
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,150
nor the wisdom to plan strategies.

242
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,600
So,

243
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
I can only work harder.

244
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,910
I can only try to push

245
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,440
all the uncertain factors I notice

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
as much as possible

247
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,390
in a direction that benefits you...

248
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,360
even if it's just a little bit closer.

249
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,600
As for all of you,

250
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,720
I don't expect that when the worst moment comes,

251
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,150
you'll break with the company for Bao

252
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,910
or even turn against it.

253
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,600
You've carried guns together,

254
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,840
endured wounds together.

255
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,360
All I hope is that when that moment comes,

256
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,390
you'll firmly recall

257
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,790
that day.

258
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,440
Chen Duo,

259
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
farewell.

260
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,510
Though I can't attend this farewell gathering,

261
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,790
consider this my gift to you.

262
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
I hope you like it.

263
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,360
As for me,

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,320
whatever.

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,670
I don't need you to accept me,

266
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,720
or to like me.

267
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,550
Liking Bao

268
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,240
is enough.

269
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
This Qiu Rang,

270
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,320
he's Ma Xianhong's most loyal follower.

271
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,510
He doesn't even try to hide it.

272
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,510
As soon as he got on the Truth Chair,

273
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,550
he openly admitted that he had mastered Shenji Bailian.

274
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,630
Since that's the case,

275
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,600
we can't let him leave.

276
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,510
It's about time.

277
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,960
All the temporary workers have gathered.

278
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,360
Next,

279
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,750
it's their turn to get on the Truth Chair.

280
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,870
[Truth Chair]

281
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,510
The Truth Chair...

282
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,600
what is it?

283
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,480
The Truth Chair is a device used by headquarters for lie detection.

284
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,910
Once you're on that chair,

285
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,550
it's like opening everything about you

286
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,720
to headquarters.

287
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,750
You won't be able to hide a thing.

288
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,080
In other words,

289
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,320
all your secrets

290
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,600
will no longer exist.

291
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
Even Bao's secret

292
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,200
might end up exposed.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,270
Then all my efforts for Bao

294
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,960
would have been for nothing.

295
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,840
Is it still possible to escape now?

296
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,390
Escape isn't an option anymore.

297
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,390
So,

298
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,240
I've prepared a guide.

299
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,080
Bao,

300
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,480
look at this carefully.

301
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,240
Memorize these answers.

302
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,320
Once you're on the chair,

303
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,270
say them as if they're the truth.

304
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,790
How much time do I have?

305
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,910
Fifteen minutes at most.

306
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,150
So make the most of it.

307
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,270
By the way, Chulan,

308
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,670
your performance during the Biyou Village operation

309
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,750
was excellent.

310
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,790
But some things

311
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,550
are beyond human control.

312
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,600
Because,

313
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,600
you also need to get on the Truth Chair.

314
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,550
San-ge,

315
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,480
can you help me look into someone's information?

316
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,720
Whose information?

317
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,480
Take a seat.

318
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,670
This is from the Lubei District...

319
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,790
a temporary worker assistant,

320
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,670
Zhang Chulan.

321
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,080
Starting with him

322
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
might lead to a breakthrough.

323
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,240
Let me do it.

324
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,790
Then let's get started right away.

325
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,790
Answer us...

326
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,630
how exactly did Chen Duo die?

327
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Leader,

328
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,080
it's all clearly written in the report.

329
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,270
Didn't you receive it?

330
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,510
During the operation to annihilate Biyou Village,

331
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,790
Chen Duo refused to surrender

332
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,510
and attempted to escape again.

333
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,000
We pursued her relentlessly,

334
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,720
and in the end,

335
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,670
Chen Duo died from her own poison.

336
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,870
If you're not truthful

337
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,390
while sitting on the Truth Chair,

338
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,030
you won't pass the test.

339
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,240
This is

340
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,600
the full truth

341
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,390
about Chen Duo's death.

342
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
During this operation,

343
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,750
there were disagreements among the special team members.

344
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,510
The team was not united.

345
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,360
I'm a coward.

346
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,150
I couldn't protect Chen Duo.

347
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,510
In this place where

348
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,360
Chen Duo once lived,

349
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,360
being interrogated like this...

350
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,790
you higher-ups in the company

351
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,670
are truly cruel.

352
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
I tried to stop

353
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,550
how they handled Chen Duo,

354
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,840
but I failed.

355
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,200
It's not my fault.

356
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,550
Chen Duo simply didn't belong to this world.

357
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,670
She didn't do anything wrong.

358
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,000
In my life,

359
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,790
I've never been one for persistence.

360
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,150
But when it comes to Chen Duo,

361
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,120
I believe I did what I had to do.

362
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,750
The ones who sent Chen Duo away

363
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,630
were them.

364
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,390
Yes,

365
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,120
it was us.

366
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,120
It was us.

367
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,150
It was us.

368
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,510
It was us.

369
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,670
Next question.

370
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,270
Tell us,

371
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,440
what's your opinion

372
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,480
of Ma Xianhong?

373
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,240
He's capable, a true man of character.

374
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,870
Just like those other special agents,

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,390
he's someone I respect.

376
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,320
Ma Xianhong?

377
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,600
He's a good man.

378
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,910
But compared to him,

379
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,550
headquarters is more concerned about us,

380
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,390
isn't it?

381
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,480
I'm

382
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,030
not smart,

383
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,510
not good at judging people.

384
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,240
It's beyond me.

385
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,960
He's a patient,

386
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,600
but the difference is

387
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,960
he doesn't even know

388
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,840
what illness he has.

389
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,960
I admire him...

390
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,270
he's a true man.

391
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,030
But his thinking went in the wrong direction.

392
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,390
The outcome he faces now is deserved.

393
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,870
I can understand

394
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,320
his distrust of headquarters.

395
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,750
After all, our identities are secretive.

396
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,030
But I believe

397
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,150
we carried out the right mission this time.

398
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,550
It should change the way you see us.

399
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,720
Village Chief Ma, like me,

400
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,080
genuinely wanted to protect Chen Duo.

401
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,550
But such people

402
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,720
are more dangerous than someone like me.

403
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,150
To be honest,

404
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,720
after this mission,

405
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,790
I finally understood what righteous intent means.

406
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,870
During the siege,

407
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,720
I chose not to attack.

408
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,120
Ma Xianhong is

409
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,440
arrogant and obsessive.

410
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,790
His ambitions are too grand.

411
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,240
Either he'll destroy himself,

412
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,200
or,

413
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,750
he'll destroy the world.

414
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,750
I think the company's

415
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,640
handling of him is appropriate.

416
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
Even if the company didn't deal with him,

417
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,200
I'd have taken him down myself.

418
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,750
Such people should be locked away.

419
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,200
I think the company did the right thing.

420
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,030
Zhang Chulan,

421
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,310
you only have one

422
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,920
chance left to trigger the red light.

423
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,000
Leader,

424
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not done talking yet.

425
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,160
I think

426
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,240
the matters of Biyou Village and Chen Duo

427
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,680
have been resolved.

428
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,070
But this mission

429
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,720
is far from over.

430
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,640
The road to the company is a long one, right?

431
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,720
In our village,

432
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,830
there are often puppet theater performances.

433
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
Whenever I watch one,

434
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I can't stop myself from tearing up.

435
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,750
I don't even know why.

436
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,590
This question has bothered me for a long time.

437
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,400
Those puppets remind me

438
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,720
of an old painting at my sister's house,

439
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,830
called

440
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,480
The Dance of Skeletons.

441
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,960
I could never understand it,

442
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,590
but now I do.

443
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,590
In the painting,

444
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,270
it's dusk.

445
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,880
A child follows their mother

446
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,310
to the outskirts of the village

447
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,270
to watch a puppet show.

448
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,720
The performance was simple...

449
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,350
just a small wooden puppet,

450
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,200
suspended by threads, dancing.

451
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,030
The child watching the show was completely captivated.

452
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,160
He crawled toward the little puppet,

453
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,110
getting closer and closer.

454
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,830
He was filled with excitement,

455
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,480
until he saw the puppet's face.

456
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
He was startled.

457
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,880
It wasn't a wooden puppet at all.

458
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,350
It was a small skeleton,

459
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,750
about the same size as the child.

460
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,510
When he looked up further,

461
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
he saw that the one holding the small skeleton

462
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,110
was a much larger skeleton.

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
All along, I thought

464
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,920
I was that child watching the show...

465
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,960
an observer,

466
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
seeing how the world was being controlled.

467
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,640
But I realized I was wrong.

468
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,070
I, too, was part of this game

469
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,480
of control and being controlled.

470
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,830
I was the skeleton puppet,

471
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,720
suspended by threads.

472
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,270
So I tried to struggle free,

473
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,750
to cut the strings.

474
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,510
But in the end, I found

475
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,310
what I thought was freedom

476
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,070
was just falling into another layer of control.

477
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,750
Just like how behind that large skeleton,

478
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,160
there were still hands...

479
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,920
invisible strings,

480
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,550
secretly pulling everything.

481
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,440
In your life,

482
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,110
there is someone who has a great influence on you.

483
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,590
If you want to live

484
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,750
a peaceful life,

485
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,200
stay away from her.

486
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,400
What right does someone,

487
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,110
whose very memories have been altered,

488
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,550
have to talk about controlling their destiny?

489
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,440
So, take a guess...

490
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,960
what do you think will happen next?

491
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,310
I knew you'd come.

492
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,880
Sister.

493
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,220
[Qu Tong]

494
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,200
Ma Xianhong has escaped.

495
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,590
Let me ask the next question.

496
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
Zhang Chulan,

497
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,310
tell us,

498
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,070
why do you think

499
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,200
this mission isn't over yet?

500
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,070
Ma Xianhong is actually being controlled.

501
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,160
He has no clarity about his own situation.

502
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,070
The real danger

503
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,160
is the person behind him.

504
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,920
All right,

505
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,070
keep talking then.

506
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,640
Leader,

507
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,920
why did someone else start questioning me?

508
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,640
Did something happen?

509
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,830
Zhang Chulan is always slippery.

510
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,790
Don't waste any more words with him.

511
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,160
Director Zhao,

512
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,750
let me.

513
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,550
No, I'll handle this.

514
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,240
Zhang Chulan,

515
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,160
answer my question.

516
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,030
Answering questions? No problem, Leader.

517
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,830
But you know,

518
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
this seat...

519
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,790
it's not very comfortable.

520
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,160
Can we move to a more comfortable spot

521
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,640
for a private chat?

522
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,440
The people keeping an eye on you are the company's best.

523
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,640
This is the only way to save you.

524
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,880
It hurts, doesn't it?

525
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,500
[Fifteen days ago]

526
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,480
I can finally recover my memories.

527
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Xianhong, you're so clever.

528
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,750
The Ma family's craft

529
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,720
has been passed down.

530
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,440
But remember this...

531
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,680
the Ma family's craft

532
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,720
must never be revealed to outsiders.

533
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,240
Xianhong, run!

534
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,110
Grandpa!

535
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,750
Grandpa!

536
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,440
Run!

537
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,070
Run, Xianhong!

538
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,640
Forget

539
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,750
everything I taught you.

540
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,790
Live well.

541
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,830
It's you.

542
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,000
You've loved this painting

543
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,310
since you were a child.

544
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,960
[Fifteen years ago]

545
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,880
Haven't you had enough of it after all these years?

546
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,510
Who are you?

547
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,550
Why am I here?

548
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,790
You encountered some trouble,

549
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,510
and I brought you back.

550
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,070
You can call me

551
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,830
sister.

552
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,350
This will be your home from now on.

553
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,000
Home?

554
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,000
Why can't I remember anything?

555
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,270
Because you were injured here.

556
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,440
It's okay.

557
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,160
Sister will help you remember.

558
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,830
Your name is Ma Xianhong.

559
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,440
You're from Ma Village.

560
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,200
You're the sole inheritor of Shenji Bailian.

561
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,350
Creating this small Self-Discipline Furnace

562
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,350
is proof of that.

563
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,830
Does this thing really

564
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,880
help me recover my memories?

565
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,200
Of course it can.

566
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,640
But you need to create a bigger furnace...

567
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,000
one large enough to contain you.

568
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,590
Don't worry.

569
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,510
Sister will help you.

570
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,960
[Six months ago]Sister,

571
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,030
I think I know what I should do.

572
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,310
I want to regain my memories,

573
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,790
but that's not what I want most.

574
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,200
I want to become someone like you.

575
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,830
I want to use the Self-Discipline Furnace to help more people.

576
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,680
That's the real purpose of my creation,

577
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,350
isn't it?

578
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,640
This is my gift to you.

579
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,400
You once told me

580
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,960
that the Self-Discipline Furnace was incomplete.

581
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,200
You were right.

582
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,720
With this,

583
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,790
it's now a complete Self-Discipline Furnace.

584
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,030
What is this?

585
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,480
I call it a crack.

586
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,920
Because it doesn't belong

587
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,590
to this world we live in.

588
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,270
It came through a rift-like channel

589
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,680
between two worlds.

590
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,510
It holds immense power.

591
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,350
As your understanding of the Self-Discipline Furnace deepens,

592
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,200
it's time for me to hand this to you.

593
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,070
This thing...

594
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,920
why does it look so familiar?

595
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,830
The day I smashed the Self-Discipline Furnace,

596
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,790
I think I saw something just like it.

597
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,000
This is what we found

598
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,030
in the wreckage of the Self-Discipline Furnace

599
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,070
that you destroyed.

600
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,350
It doesn't match

601
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,790
any known biological organ.

602
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,070
Experts have confirmed

603
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,030
it's not a lump of flesh.

604
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,920
It's a complete lifeform,

605
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,110
sustained by qi.

606
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,240
Without the furnace,

607
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,920
it has completely died.

608
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,640
Ma Xianhong owns Shenji Bailian,

609
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,920
but this thing doesn't originate from Shenji techniques.

610
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,790
It's a foreign object.

611
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,680
And based on this,

612
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,640
we discovered

613
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,830
that behind Ma Xianhong

614
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,510
there must be a powerful force,

615
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,240
or

616
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,400
an individual.

617
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,480
So,

618
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,310
we decided

619
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,920
to use the opportunity of sending Ma Xianhong to the hidden fortress

620
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,830
to use him as bait

621
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,830
to draw out whoever's behind him.

622
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,680
But,

623
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,350
we underestimated their capabilities.

624
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,680
Just an hour ago,

625
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,160
Ma Xianhong was broken out.

626
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,960
And the entire team escorting him

627
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,720
was wiped out.

628
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,510
Director Zhao,

629
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,960
this is why

630
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,070
I was able to come in and talk to you, right?

631
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,590
Besides headquarters,

632
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,440
you're the only one who realized

633
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,960
that Ma Xianhong has someone helping him.

634
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,400
Can you tell me now

635
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,790
how you figured this out?

636
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,160
Ma Xianhong told me.

637
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,640
Chulan,

638
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,640
this matter is extremely important to headquarters.

639
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,240
I've told you so much just now

640
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
to ease your concerns.

641
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,240
Although there's no Truth Chair here,

642
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,440
I hope you'll tell me the truth.

643
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,110
Tell me...

644
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,440
how did you really figure it out?

645
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,480
Director Zhao,

646
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,400
it was really Ma Xianhong who told me.

647
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,880
Ma Xianhong said...

648
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,590
as for Granny Jin Feng,

649
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,550
I brought her back because someone asked me to,

650
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,960
someone I couldn't refuse.

651
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
This Mei Jin Feng...

652
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,920
though she's an old Quanxing member

653
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,790
who retired over forty years ago...

654
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,760
has never done anything

655
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,400
out of line.

656
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,280
She's had no presence

657
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,510
in the entire world of outsiders.

658
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,320
Yet this person,

659
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,550
with no presence at all,

660
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,920
caught the attention of the person behind Ma Xianhong.

661
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,000
I couldn't make sense of it.

662
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,440
So, after meeting with Ma Xianhong,

663
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,710
I secretly started investigating

664
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,320
everything about Mei Jin Feng.

665
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,280
San-ge,

666
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,510
can you help me look into someone's information?

667
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,000
Whose information?

668
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,070
Mei Jin Feng.

669
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,150
This seemingly

670
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,550
inconspicuous old woman

671
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,440
turns out to have been

672
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,150
the closest follower of Wugensheng,

673
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,670
the Quanxing leader who caused the Gengshen Chaos years ago.

674
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,800
The person trying to capture Mei Jin Feng

675
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,320
has far greater ambitions than Ma Xianhong.

676
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,190
What they're planning

677
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,840
is very likely

678
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,710
connected to the Gengshen Chaos.

679
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,110
This person

680
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,630
is the real threat to the company.

681
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,000
It's been a long time since we've

682
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,590
sat together like this to have a meal.

683
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,440
Sister is so happy.

684
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,360
I've never asked you this...

685
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,110
Sister,

686
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,190
why did you want me to bring back Mei Jin Feng?

687
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,400
Mei Jin Feng is useful to me.

688
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,880
You did very well with this task.

689
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,510
As for the reason,

690
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,030
Sister will tell you later.

691
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,960
What I want to know now is...

692
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,480
Xianhong,

693
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,760
we've discussed this.

694
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,400
Don't ask about Sister's matters.

695
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,590
It's for your own good.

696
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,070
Trust Sister.

697
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,440
But why should I trust you?

698
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,760
You want to erase my memories again, don't you?

699
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,880
This scar on my face...

700
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
you left it.

701
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,230
I'm giving it back to you now.

702
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,550
You remember.

703
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,670
How much have you deceived me?

704
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,630
You're with the people

705
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,800
who killed my family,

706
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,590
aren't you?

707
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,400
If I killed your family,

708
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
would I have given you the Refining Furnace?

709
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,550
Then why did you erase my memory?

710
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,230
Answer me.

711
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,480
It hasn't fully recovered yet,

712
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,440
has it?

713
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,110
Memories can distort a person.

714
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,360
You asked me

715
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,440
why I erased your memory.

716
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,030
Because the last thing I wanted

717
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,880
was for you to become the person you are now.

718
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,800
I feel so sorry for you.

719
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,880
When you were little,

720
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,880
you often had nightmares.

721
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,760
You would wake up crying in the middle of the night,

722
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,190
run to me for comfort,

723
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,590
and I'd stay with you

724
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,710
until dawn.

725
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,110
Now you know

726
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,840
those weren't just dreams.

727
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,480
They were fragments of memories lingering in your mind.

728
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,230
Later, you stopped having those dreams

729
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,150
because I erased them

730
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,960
from your memory.

731
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,590
Just those fragments

732
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,000
caused you so much pain.

733
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,400
What you actually went through

734
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,840
was a thousand times more terrifying.

735
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,550
Living with such memories,

736
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:53,960
Ma Xianhong,

737
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,710
are you sure that's what you want?

738
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,440
I never harmed anyone from the Ma family.

739
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,360
My hands have never been stained with the blood

740
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,840
of any member of the Ma family.

741
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,070
I only wanted to help you.

742
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,840
Trust me.

743
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,280
The Skeleton Puppet...

744
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,630
Am I the skeleton in the story?

745
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,800
We've relied on each other for so many years.

746
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,440
I know what's most important to you.

747
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,110
You want to perfect the Refining Furnace

748
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,480
to help more people.

749
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,710
You almost succeeded.

750
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,510
Ma Xianhong,

751
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,960
things went wrong this time, and we failed.

752
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,920
But we still have a chance to start over.

753
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,670
Why don't you trust me?

754
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,480
You gave me the plan for the Refining Furnace.

755
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,550
You gave me the chance to make it all happen.

756
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,760
I was so grateful to you at first.

757
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,400
But then I realized

758
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,800
it was all a lie from the beginning.

759
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,920
To you, I'm nothing but a tool,

760
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,760
a puppet you've been controlling all along.

761
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,400
What is the Refining Furnace really?

762
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,880
What is the Crack?

763
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,150
What exactly are you trying to do?

764
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,320
Tell me.

765
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,000
Come with me.

766
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,400
This is your own home.

767
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,150
There's nothing to worry about.

768
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,760
She's fine.

769
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,030
She just passed out.

770
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,800
Inside this old woman's memory

771
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,000
are many secrets.

772
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,230
You'll be interested.

773
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,440
The Crack comes from the Valley of 24 Terms.

774
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,510
What it can do

775
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,550
is far beyond your understanding.

776
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,760
If you can truly

777
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,280
create a perfect Refining Furnace

778
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,000
and unleash the Crack's full power,

779
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,150
not only will you regain all your memories,

780
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,670
but you'll also have the strength to rebuild Biyou Village.

781
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,030
If you wish,

782
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,440
you could even reshape the entire world

783
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,110
into whatever you desire.

784
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,070
So she's Feng Baobao.

785
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,480
It seems to be true.

786
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,190
I heard Xu Ye likes

787
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,840
the pale, long-straight-haired type.

788
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,230
Alright, Huang, enough.

789
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,150
So boring.

790
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,710
Ladies and gentlemen,

791
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,550
you are now witnessing

792
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,110
the third Feng Baobao.

793
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,440
The first two Feng Baobaos

794
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,800
have already sacrificed themselves.

795
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,710
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

796
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,920
It's alright.

797
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,480
Now that everyone's here,

798
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,440
let's begin.

799
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,960
Baobao,

800
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,280
do you know

801
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,800
what we need you to do?

802
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,630
I know.

803
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,630
Then hurry up

804
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,800
and sit in the chair.

805
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,800
The one being questioned

806
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,000
is the third temporary worker

807
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,360
of the Lubei District,

808
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,960
Feng Baobao.

809
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,710
Is that correct?

810
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,800
Yes, that's me.

811
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,670
Did I pass?

812
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,960
Why aren't you asking anymore?

813
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,550
Director Zhao,

814
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,670
you don't need to see us off.

815
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,590
For the remaining steps,

816
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,000
we can walk ourselves.

817
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,920
Zhang Chulan,

818
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:27,800
why do you

819
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,030
still seem so nervous?

820
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,710
Well, isn't it because

821
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,510
you're Director Zhao of Tongtian Corporation?

822
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,280
How could I not be nervous around you?

823
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,550
Baobao,

824
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,550
I have a question.

825
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,280
While you were on the chair earlier,

826
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
I didn't get to ask you.

827
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,070
How old are you this year?

828
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,440
Director Zhao,

829
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,960
let's make a deal.

830
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,510
I'll help you bring back Ma Xianhong

831
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,880
and uncover the person behind him.

832
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,920
And what's your condition?

833
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,480
It's not really a condition.

834
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,510
It's just that this mission

835
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,360
is quite complicated.

836
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,190
I want to work on it

837
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:02,920
together with Feng Baobao.

838
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,480
You truly are someone

839
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,070
Xu valued highly.

840
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,880
Back in the day,

841
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,550
Xu had already become

842
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,800
a regional director.

843
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,550
That position

844
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,960
wasn't low in the company, was it?

845
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,960
Do you really think Xu,

846
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,880
when he wanted to establish

847
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,760
the temporary worker position,

848
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,550
could've done it

849
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,880
without my support?

850
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,440
Director Zhao,

851
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,190
you...

852
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,400
Back then, I thought very highly of Xu.

853
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,550
I made him the director of the Lubei region.

854
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,000
But out of personal interest,

855
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,070
he secretly fabricated

856
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,360
fake identities for those special agents.

857
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,670
Did he really think I didn't know?

858
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,510
Actually, I was waiting for him

859
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,880
to come forward and confess.

860
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,190
Your current expression...

861
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,360
when Xu found out

862
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,480
that I knew about it back then,

863
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,150
he had the exact same expression.

864
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,510
In fact,

865
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,800
he even wanted to kill me to silence me.

866
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,800
Chulan,

867
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,320
you wouldn't do that now, would you?

868
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,840
Rest assured, Director Zhao,

869
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,550
I have absolutely no such intention.

870
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,510
Actually, he misunderstood me.

871
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,920
Think about it...

872
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,670
we were friends for over a decade,

873
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,880
and we had risked our lives for each other.

874
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,670
Do you think

875
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,030
I'd care about such a trivial matter?

876
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,840
I grew up in a chaotic time

877
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,400
for the outsider world

878
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,030
and matured during an era of order.

879
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,150
My whole life,

880
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,070
I've worked to maintain

881
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,150
peace in the outsider world.

882
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,760
Feng Baobao

883
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,880
was someone Xu valued deeply.

884
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,800
Out of our shared identity as outsiders

885
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,030
and out of empathy,

886
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,000
I truly don't want

887
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,070
to see anything happen

888
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,590
to Feng Baobao again.

889
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,360
But,

890
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,400
as the highest guardian of order

891
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,440
in the outsider world,

892
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,840
I also don't want to see

893
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,070
any more chaos in the outsider world...

894
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,670
whether it's caused by Feng Baobao,

895
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,030
Ma Xianhong,

896
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,440
or the person behind him.

897
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,320
I don't want to see it anymore.

898
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,400
Do you understand?

899
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,630
I understand.

900
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:02,630
Good.

901
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,510
I agree to your terms.

902
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,400
As for Feng Baobao's identity,

903
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,920
I'll keep it a secret for now.

904
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,400
But,

905
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,230
if the secret can't be kept one day,

906
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,030
or if

907
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,280
chaos arises because of Feng Baobao,

908
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,590
then my position

909
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,760
will absolutely not be on your side.

910
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,630
Rest assured, Director Zhao,

911
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,230
that day will never come.

912
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,670
Director Zhao,

913
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,710
didn't we just agree on this?

914
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,960
I clearly saw it was destroyed.

915
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,070
How could it still be?

916
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,840
Everything can start over again.

917
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:15,550
Trust me.

918
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,400
The ones from Lubei have come out, too.

919
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,590
Looks like everyone made it through this time.

920
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,440
Bao,

921
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,030
Er Zhuang, you're here too!

922
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,840
Thanks to everyone's help,

923
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,190
I managed to survive.

924
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,920
This time,

925
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,070
I can finally thank you all face to face.

926
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,960
So smoothly...

927
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,070
could it be that headquarters

928
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,400
is really letting us go this time?

929
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,280
Qiu, stop being so paranoid.

930
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,440
The mission's over.

931
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,880
At least we're all here...

932
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,000
isn't that enough?

933
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,710
Yes,

934
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,400
the mission's over.

935
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,880
It's time for all of us to start anew.

936
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,880
All right,

937
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:01,880
everyone.

938
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,230
farewell.

939
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,670
We'll...

940
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,880
meet again,

941
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,670
won't we?

942
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,190
Of course.

Bao,

00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:49,880
let's go too.

963
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,860
♪Breaking through the shackles that confine me♪

964

00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,000
Lao Bi,

969
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,710
your earlier analysis was quite reasonable.

970
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,190
The lone wolves have indeed turned into a pack.

971
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,110
But they're still not the company's biggest problem.

972
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,150
The most urgent matter now

973
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,320
is Ma Xianhong

974
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,590
and the person behind him.

975
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,670
Then why let Feng Baobao go?

976
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,760
She didn't even pass the Truth Chair.

977
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,550
To find Ma Xianhong

978
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,920
and the person behind him,

979
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,880
Feng Baobao is the most suitable bait.

980
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,460
[The End]

981
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,070
Grandpa,

982
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,960
run!

983
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,280
From the moment I left the mountain,

984
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
my understanding of Zhang Chulan

985
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,670
may have been wrong all along.

986
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,230
And also,

987
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,960
Ma Xianhong...

988
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,880
at the village entrance, facing Zhuge Qing,

989
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,760
and taking on Ma Xianhong's followers,

990
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,480
while holding back seven or eight at once...

991
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:02,670
with Chaos Bell,

992
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,030
I still managed to use my last bit of strength

993
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,320
to restrain Ma Xianhong.

994
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,030
From this, I concluded

995
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,480
that his impact on this world

996
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,710
was negligible.

997
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,920
But it wasn't until I observed Ma Xianhong

998
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,320
that I realized he was as problematic as Zhang Chulan.

999
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,670
Given his destiny,

1000
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,150
there's no way he could cause such a huge disturbance.

1001
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,510
When I subdued Ma Xianhong in the end,

1002
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,190
I also, in passing, restrained

1003
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,550
Zhang Chulan for a brief moment...

1004
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,920
just for an instant.

1005
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,800
He didn't notice at all,

1006
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,400
but it was enough to confirm my theory.

1007
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,320
Zhang Chulan carries far more weight

1008
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,840
than Ma Xianhong.

1009
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,440
From this perspective,

1010
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,960
they are the same type of person.

1011
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,110
But still, the severity of their issues

1012
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,920
doesn't match.

1013
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,920
I hypothesize that Zhang Chulan is not the one

1014
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,150
causing the problems.

1015
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,320
Everything surrounding him

1016
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,590
is because his fate

1017
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,920
is influenced by the true core of the issue.

1018
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,070
The real instigator

1019
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,510
is Feng Baobao...

1020
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,280
the one I couldn't influence

1021
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,190
in my Fenghou Bureau.

1022
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,400
Ma Xianhong is the same.

1023
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,000
He has no connection with Feng Baobao.

1024
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,670
So there's another...

1025
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,590
Feng Baobao behind Zhang Chulan,

1026
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,150
and someone else behind Ma Xianhong.

1027
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,070
They are the real key to everything.

1028
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,480
Today, here,

1029
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,590
it's just wine

1030
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,360
and friends.

1031
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,070
To hell with the Tianshi Mansion,

1032
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,070
