00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,440
I am happy?

177
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,920
Chen Duo.

178
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,400
You must have misunderstood Liao.

179
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,960
Come back to the company with me.

180
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
There must be room for maneuver

181
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,350
in this matter.

182
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,110
No need.

183
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,400
Wait.

184
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,280
Your voice...

185
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,080
Do you remember me?

186
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,110
How could I forget you?

187
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,110
You are the cause of all my misfortunes.

188
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,350
You're the one

189
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,080
who deserves to die.

190
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,080
It's complicated.

191
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,200
Chen Duo, you go.

192
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,230
We'll take care of this.

193
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,680
Chen Duo is gone.

194
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,320
Ms. Bao, let's go.

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,960
Don't worry, Meng.

196
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,920
We'll deal with Chen Duo.

197
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Judging from Meng's movements,

198
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,710
he's ordinary.

199
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,750
I should be able

200
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,560
to deal with him easily.

201
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,830
And I've never dealt

202
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,710
with anyone like Qiu.

203
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,080
It would be nice

204
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,560
if Dou found me some of this type of prey next time.

205
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,230
It's heavy.

206
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,560
What are you looking for?

207
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm your opponent.

208
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,440
It's object manipulation.

209
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,280
Man.

210
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,750
You have a good eye.

211
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,870
How many years have you been practicing?

212
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,990
More than 20 years.

213
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,800
More than 20 years?

214
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,750
You had a hard time dealing with my iron ball.

215
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
What a loser.

216
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,040
You have a magic weapon.

217
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,750
Without it,

218
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,080
you would've been kicked to death.

219
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,200
You couldn't even defend yourself against my kicking.

220
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,200
Tell me.

221
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,680
How many years have you been practicing?

222
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,320
I'm flattered.

223
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,280
I've been practicing for 20 days.

224
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,680
Do you have a problem with that?

225
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,630
Twenty days? Unbelievable.

226
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,280
I'll show you.

227
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,710
Don't say my weapon is lame.

228
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,870
Your gadgets and cleverness

229
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,280
are useless

230
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,590
in front of my magic weapon.

231
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,750
Qiu.

232
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,870
You're playful.

233
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,440
But if that hurts you,

234
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,920
that's not good.

235
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,800
Besides,

236
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,440
I think

237
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,630
they are asking for trouble.

238
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,400
Actually, I've already seen it.

239
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,040
Your protections

240
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
are for malicious attacks.

241
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,230
But I'll bear you no ill will.

242
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,160
I created

243
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,990
this fist technique.

244
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,400
Massage the acupuncture points

245
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,040
to make people's glands

246
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,280
secrete dopamine

247
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,560
until

248
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,280
they become what you are now.

249
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,110
Remember.

250
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,750
This trick

251
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,400
is called Massage of Love.

252
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,710
Chen Duo also has protection.

253
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,120
Why isn't it

254
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,440
working on Ms. Bao?

255
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,880
We're colleagues.

256
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,600
We shouldn't fight.

257
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,360
Be good.

258
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,360
Come back with us.

259
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,230
I won't hit you.

260
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,030
Are you also

261
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,160
from the company?

262
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,990
My name is Feng Baobao.

263
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,710
His name is Zhang Chulan.

264
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,360
We were ordered to bring you back to the company.

265
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
You were ordered?

266
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,750
Bring it on.

267
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,200
There is a limit to the protection of magic weapons.

268
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,310
Even if I could break through it,

269
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
I wouldn't have to.

270
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,680
The question is,

271
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,920
why does Chen Duo have protection?

272
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,270
What does she have to do

273
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,640
with that weapon Outsider?

274
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,840
Your qi is special.

275
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,920
Can you teach me?

276
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,070
You won't learn.

277
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,960
Why?

278
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,440
To learn this,

279
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
your body will rot little by little.

280
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,270
Do you still want to learn?

281
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,990
Protections

282
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,440
didn't work on her.

283
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,990
It's normal.

284
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,030
Your protections are automatic and lame.

285
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
[Qiu Rang, Armorer]

286
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,640
She's strong.

287
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,550
She's all right.

288
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,270
Are you all right, Ms. Bao?

289
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm all right.

290
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,400
Who are you?

291
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,030
You're in luck today.

292
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,440
Prepare to be amazed.

293
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,230
Not everyone

294
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,750
can see my gilded ruyi.

295
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,710
And my emerald ring

296
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,710
can resist all attacks.

297
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,640
Run.

298
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,510
That guy

299
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,710
broke his protection.

300
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,790
He's hiding deeper than we are.

301
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,840
Where is Chen Duo?

302
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,400
She escaped.

303
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,790
We were this close to catching her.

304
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,790
But a guy with magic weapons came out of nowhere

305
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,960
and rescued Chen Duo.

306
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,750
We found out

307
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,790
that Chen Duo also has protection,

308
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,440
just like the other Outsiders.

309
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,400
We need to think carefully.

310
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,640
You broke the rules, didn't you?

311
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,550
We have two people

312
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,840
from Lubei.

313
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,710
I'm not.

314
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,120
She's from Lubei.

315
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,840
You can call her Baobao.

316
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,790
It has always been the code name

317
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,600
of temporary workers in Lubei.

318
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm just an assistant.

319
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,120
Don't ask too much.

320
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,790
Which of you is in charge?

321
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,230
- He is. - She is.

322
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
The man from Luzhong

323
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,840
and the girl from Northeast are the only ones I haven't met.

324
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,270
It was my fault

325
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,270
that Chen Duo escaped.

326
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,400
I gave her time to react.

327
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,840
I missed the best chance to complete the task.

328
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,960
Meng.

329
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,070
You have dealt with Chen Duo.

330
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,440
Why did she say

331
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,680
you were the one who deserved to die?

332
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,990
There must be some misunderstanding here.

333
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,550
I didn't hurt Chen Duo.

334
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,200
We never spoke

335
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
after our first meeting.

336
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,510
Five years ago,

337
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,270
I took a task

338
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,230
to destroy an illegal organization called the Medicine Immortal Association.

339
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,640
Liao also participated

340
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,270
in that task.

341
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,600
It's said that the Medicine Immortal Association

342
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,990
is from a space we can't recognize.

343
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,120
Everything there is unconventional.

344
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,230
Qi operates in a way we don't understand.

345
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,360
It's a veritable forbidden place for Outsiders.

346
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
The Medicine Immortal Association

347
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,470
acts strangely.

348
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,960
They worship a strange kind of energy.

349
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,510
They take a poison of unknown origin

350
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,790
as their god.

351
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
And they think of it as a sacred relic

352
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
handed down from generation to generation.

353
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,960
The Medicine Immortal Association

354
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,470
brutally trains those who inherit poison arts.

355
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,880
They cut them off from the outside world

356
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,680
until they lose their sense

357
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,160
of being human.

358
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,510
In their world,

359
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,790
they only know poison arts.

360
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,230
The most outstanding one

361
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,400
is Chen Duo.

362
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,990
She was called

363
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,510
Saint Poison Girl.

364
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,940
[Saint Poison Girl]

365
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,070
The other members of the Immortal Medicine Association

366
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,600
deserve to die.

367
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,680
But Chen Duo is innocent.

368
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,920
She's a victim.

369
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,470
The Medicine Immortal Association made her into what she is now.

370
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,680
She didn't have a choice.

371
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,200
Girl.

372
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Don't be afraid.

373
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,030
Come with me.

374
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,710
Liao and I took her

375
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,400
from the Medicine Immortal Association.

376
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,470
At that time,

377
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,550
Liao was in charge of the Bunker.

378
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,230
The Bunker is a research facility for special Outsiders.

379
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,440
He took the lead

380
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,510
in getting Chen Duo to the Bunker

381
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,680
for treatment.

382
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,470
Let's go.

383
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,310
I whine

384
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
when dealing

385
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,960
with dangerous tasks.

386
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,680
When I met Chen Duo,

387
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,550
I couldn't say anything.

388
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,440
She was never trained

389
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
to be a human

390
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,960
after birth.

391
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,360
Then,

392
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,200
she spent many years in the Bunker.

393
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,990
It was Liao...

394
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,990
It was Liao who made her a temporary worker.

395
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,920
Although she could not live

396
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,200
like an ordinary girl,

397
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,920
she was at least like a human being.

398
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,680
I'll be blunt.

399
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,790
Cut the nonsense.

400
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
I'm not interested in your story.

401
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,030
I just want to finish this task as soon as possible.

402
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,400
An order from the headquarters.

403
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,480
[Headquarters]
If the poison on Chen Duo spreads,

404
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,940
it will cause great damage.

405
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,030
The situation is critical.

406
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,030
Catching Chen Duo is of great importance.

407
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,480
If you encounter strong resistance or are in danger of your life,

408
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,150
you can decide for yourself what to do.

409
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,400
Although this is an order from the headquarters,

410
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,070
I'd like to ask for a favor.

411
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,960
If Chen Duo doesn't want to come back to the company with us,

412
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,710
please don't hurt her first.

413
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,600
I want to persuade her.

414
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,510
After all, Chen Duo is not a bad person.

415
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,030
Qiu. Xiao.

416
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,400
You've seen it.

417
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,710
She didn't try to kill us.

418
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,310
I know I'm no match for you.

419
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,710
If you insist on going your own way,

420
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,840
I will...

421
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,410
[Northeast]
I support Meng.

422
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,410
There is room for maneuver.

423
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,210
We'll find a way to catch her alive.

424
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,040
[Luzhong]
Agree.

425
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,120
Chen Duo.

426
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,510
It doesn't matter.

427
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,960
Maybe something more interesting will emerge.

428
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,270
Qiu.

429
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,120
Her tricks are interesting.

430
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,470
Only by capturing her alive

431
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,990
can I know her origins.

432
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,750
I agree.

433
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,160
Let's catch her alive.

434
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,120
Lubei's people.

435
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,680
What do you say?

436
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,270
Since it's okay with you,

437
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,920
it's okay with us.

438
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,470
The matter is complicated.

439
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,470
We'll only be able to figure it out if we catch her alive.

440
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,270
I think the headquarters wants

441
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,270
to complete the task

442
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,600
and get some information.

443
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,600
Ms. Bao.

444
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,790
What do you think?

445
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,200
Agree.

446
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,310
Thank you.

447
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,160
Looks like all their attention

448
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,640
centers on Chen Duo.

449
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,680
But the biggest threat is the attitude of the headquarters

450
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,550
towards temporary workers.

451
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,270
Tell me what you're thinking.

452
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,680
I don't treat you like a stranger.

453
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,070
I told you.

454
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,510
I think

455
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,680
it's complicated.

456
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,600
But I don't know why.

457
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm just a worker.

458
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,710
As long as I can save Chen Duo,

459
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,990
I will do whatever the headquarters says.

460
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,360
I don't mind.

461
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,070
I just want to deal with a few fresh people.

462
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,510
I don't care

463
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,750
about anything else.

464
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,440
It seems

465
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,990
that they can perceive the attitude of the headquarters.

466
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,790
Meng. Xiao.

467
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,270
What do you mean?

468
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,990
What they mean is that

469
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,680
we're

470
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
being played.

471
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,960
What?

472
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,120
By whom?

473
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,440
The people above.

474
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,510
People above, come out.

475
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,990
I saw you.

476
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,030
Get down.

477
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm referring

478
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,640
to the company,

479
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,680
the board of directors.

480
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,070
On the face of it,

481
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,880
this joint operation is about catching Chen Duo.

482
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,600
But actually, it's about temporary workers.

483
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,550
This is called

484
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,310
achieving a goal by any means.

485
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,230
No wonder.

486
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,990
The attitude of the headquarters towards us

487
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,400
has always been subtle.

488
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,920
Although temporary workers are very useful,

489
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,920
the headquarters

490
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,510
can't direct us.

491
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,070
Plus, we're a hidden danger

492
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,120
to the headquarters.

493
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
The headquarters delegated the task to us.

494
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,790
As long as we can satisfy the headquarters,

495
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,960
you're good,

496
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm good,

497
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,070
and everyone is good.

498
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,120
What if the headquarters is not satisfied?

499
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,160
Then, all of us

500
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,270
will die a terrible death.

501
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,200
It's a pity.

502
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,270
But we all understand

503
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,510
that temporary workers are nice.

504
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,790
For example,

505
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,550
Bao.

506
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,160
To the headquarters,

507
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,270
she's more like a weapon

508
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,160
of the second generation

509
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,550
of the Xu family

510
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,070
than a special agent.

511
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,600
If that's the case,

512
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,920
I'm the same.

513
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,710
Guys.

514
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,160
What do you think about this?

515
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,360
I

516
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,790
don't mind.

517
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,150
I think it's a good thing.

518
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,240
I can follow people from higher levels.

519
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,190
In that case,

520
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,760
we can handle the task

521
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,190

be better?

to manage the temporary workers directly.

will be exposed.

Basically,

00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,630
we don't communicate with people

when we carry out our tasks.

If we need help,

that the headquarters will take

555
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,280
away Baobao's management rights.

Temporary workers

557
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,840
are not normal people.

just ask.

I'm satisfied with my supervisor.

They've already made their decision.

Their discussion was just a test of each other.

577
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,070

00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,510
To learn his kung fu,

698
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,550
I was very close to joining the Sinister Pleasure.

699
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,840
Well.

700
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,280
I should call him Master.

701
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,110
Qiu.

702
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,240
What sect are you from?

703
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,960
I don't

704
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,840
belong to any sect.

705
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,440
I'm sympathetic.

706
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,920
People are willing to teach me.

707
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,760
It's a magic weapon again.

708
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,990
Xia.

709
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,720
I'm not here to talk about the old days.

710
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,190
Where did that girl go?

711
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,070
I don't know.

712
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,110
Looks like we came here for nothing again.

713
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,240
What should we do with this man of the Sinister Pleasure?

714
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,990
I won't do anything to him.

715
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,320
After all, he taught me something.

716
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,110
Well.

717
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,470
If you want to deal with him,

718
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,800
I can't stop you.

719
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,360
Qiu.

720
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,800
What are you...?

721
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,920
Don't ask.

722
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,440
All I can tell you

723
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,720
is that I'm not with that girl.

724
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,320
I'm here to deal with her.

725
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,320
That's great.

726
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,150
Qiu.

727
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,590
All my life,

728
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,840
I have no official successors.

729
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,280
You're kind of my successor.

730
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,110
But you fooled me.

731
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,990
If you

732
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,670
have a conscience,

733
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
you should repay me.

734
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,470
Please.

735
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,880
Please get Jinfeng back.

736
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,030
Xia.

737
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,440
Get up.

738
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,240
If you kneel,

739
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,070
this will get serious.

740
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,150
I'm not good at dealing with serious things.

741
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,030
Xia.

742
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,110
What did that girl do

743
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,960
to you?

744
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,800
That girl

745
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,030
wanted to take Jinfeng away.

746
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,280
And she had helpers.

747
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,240
Their skills are average.

748
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
But they all wore

749
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,550
high-level magical weapons.

750
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,880
I have a clue.

751
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,360
They all seem

752
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,360
to come from a village

753
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,070
called Biyou Village.

754
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,920
[Lubei]
Erzhuang.

755
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,240
Let the headquarters look up information about Biyou Village.

756
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,360
I know

757
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,240
you'll discuss what to do with me.

758
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,840
If you can get Jinfeng back,

759
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,240
I'm at your disposal.

760
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,360
You're a bad man.

761
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,960
But you're not totally bad.

762
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,550
You're not my thing.

763
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,800
But killing you

764
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,800
doesn't break my principles.

765
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:20,190
Xiao.

766
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:20,990
That's a shame.

767
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,630
I'm not interested in him.

768
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:25,920
Qiu.

769
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,760
I'll leave him to you.

770
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,190
I want to help you.

771
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:32,800
But

772
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,510
saving people

773
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,920
is so boring.

774
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,470
I can only promise you

775
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:40,840
that I will try.

776
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,760
That's enough.

777
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,800
I'm too old for this.

778
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:53,880
Take it.

779
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,070
You learned my tricks.

780
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,400
But you're too playful.

781
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,800
How can you fight them?

782
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,800
This is your treasure.

783
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,240
What will you do

784
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,280
if you give it to me?

785
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,070
It's not

786
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,630
my only treasure.

787
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,470
I can't

788
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,590
take them all to the grave.

789
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,440
Take it.

790
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,840
Qiu.

791
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,470
Qiu.

792
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,550
You...

793
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,440
Don't overthink it.

794
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,920
I won't accept it for no reason.

795
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,800
When I get Mei Jinfeng back,

796
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,590
you will kowtow to me.

797
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,030
Thanks.

798
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,510
I have a successor.

799
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,280
I have a successor.

800
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,240
Here's what you want.

801
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,360
Thank you.

802
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,920
Welcome back to Biyou Village.

803
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,110
Chen Junyan.

804
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,190
Chen Junyan.

805
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,030
Are you waiting for me?

806
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,510
Chen Junyan.

807
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,360
I'm dirty.

808
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,320
I'm going to take a shower.

809
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,360
Be good.

810
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,760
Don't follow me.

811
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,320
Otherwise, you'll die.
