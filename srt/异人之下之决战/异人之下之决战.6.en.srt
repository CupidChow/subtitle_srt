00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,670
Then forget about the anesthetic!

174
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,670
Saving her is the priority!

175
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,030
Okay.

176
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,630
Is this even the organ of a human being?

177
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,360
Her entire body has been destroyed,

178
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,870
and she has become a Petri dish of poison.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,720
From a medical point of view, it's hard to explain

180
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,030
why she's still alive.

181
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,480
She's lucky,

182
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,440
but

183
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,870
she might die anytime.

184
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,910
Furthermore,

185
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,150
the recent findings at the research institute revealed

186
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,030
that the members of the Medicine Immortal Association

187
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,790
remained unharmed in those situations

188
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,870
because the runes in their cave

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,320
were written with a special pigment

190
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,510
containing a unique material.

191
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,120
The institute has now developed

192
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,030
a fabric that contains this material.

193
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,270
Be careful.

194
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,960
This is bad.

195
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,150
Go save him now!

196
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,200
Let's go. Hurry!

197
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,790

198
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,630
Liao,

199
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,270
quit messing around.

200
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,120
Liao!

201
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,750
You fell for it, didn't you?

202
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,200
Unbelievable.

203
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,440
She undoubtedly possesses cognitive awareness.

204
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,510
The operation of the poison technique

205
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,600
is highly complex.

206
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,600
The fact that she can endure such potent poison

207
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,720
with only her body demonstrates that,

208
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,320
in some ways,

209
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,750
her strength exceeds our imagination.

210
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,960
The Medicine Immortal Association

211
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,440
has constantly trained her,

212
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,600
aiming to suppress her responses to stimuli.

213
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,750
So, you're suggesting that with the right stimulus,

214
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,720
we might bring back her human side?

215
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,030
In theory, yes.

216
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,360
We were hoping this would lead us

217
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,550
to a way to cure her.

218
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,120
But we've tried

219
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,390
every possible stimulus,

220
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,910
and she hasn't responded.

221
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
At this point,

222
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,870
we have to consider long-term plans.

223
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,670
Mr. Liao,

224
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,510
wear this.

225
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,960
We've been monitoring

226
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,910
her physiological indicators and data,

227
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
and have set a baseline.

228
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,390
Any stimulus in her daily life

229
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,630
that causes the fluctuations

230
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,320
beyond this baseline

231

will show up on this terminal.

232
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,000
You know,

233
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,670
there are two simple ways

234
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,390
to treat your Body of Disruption.

235
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,910
Didn't you always say

236
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,670
you'd never fail?

237
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,240
Well, all it takes is one failure,

238
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,390
even if it's on purpose.

239
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,630
That alone would break the cycle.

240
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,550
That's out of the question.

241
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,030
I would never

242
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,670
make light of this matter.

[The Body of Disruption, one of the subjects monitored by the Bunker]

244
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,870
Then there's only one option left:

245
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,840
to completely give up

246

Unfortunately,

you haven't passed

250

our assessment even once,

can't let you go yet.

253
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,440
Quick, get away from her.

254
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,630
Don't let her affect you.

and you have a colon obstruction.

258
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Nonsense!

259
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,960
Are you messing with me again?

260
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,440
How is it that every time you're here,

261
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,390
it's either coughing up blood or chest pain,

262
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,240
but whenever I show up,

263
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,960
it's always something related to the lower part of my body?

264
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't buy it!

265

There's another assessment next month.

266

I'll come back then.

Is it a smartwatch?

Mind your own business.

270
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,240
I heard a new kid

Yeah.

When I was still a doctor,

What makes the Body of Disruption special

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,300
No.

346
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,670
I won't give it to you.

347
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,670
You are cheating.

348
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,140
You are the one who's cheating.

349
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,500
[44 bpm. 80 bpm one minute ago]

350
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,580
Just a moment ago,

351
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,820
she returned to normal.

352
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,030
Her heart rate stabilized,

353
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,670
[41 bpm. 77 bpm one minute ago]
but her brainwaves

354
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,860
seem to be becoming more active.

355
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,230
It looks like she's confused about something.

356
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,620
Sir,

357
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,230
I think the Poison Girl's world

358
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,060
consists of only two parts:

359
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,990
herself

360
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,540
and the other children who train alongside her.

361
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,380
Are you saying

362
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,340
that the Poison Girl sees Chen Junyan

363
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,230
as one of her own kind?

364
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,780
It's not entirely that.

365
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,820
The members of the Medicine Immortal Association are cruel.

366
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,060
When they were training Chen Duo,

367
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,990
they made her disregard

368
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,860
even basic physiological instincts.

369
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,340
But Chen Junyan's temperament,

370
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,380
mental state, actions,

371
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,100
and abundant vitality

372
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,270
are all new

373
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,470
and incomprehensible

374
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,670
to the Poison Girl.

375
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,100
To her,

376
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,140
he is a whole new third kind of existence.

377
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,470
So, I suspect

378
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,540
Chen Duo was confused

379
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,060
because Chen Junyan's defiance

380
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,670
of the rules didn't lead to the punishment

381
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,340
she would have expected.

382
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,100
That's interesting.

383
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:32,950
Sir,

384
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,910
if it's all right,

385
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,190
I have an idea.

386
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,030
Don't just sit there all the time.

387
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,470
I actually envy you

388
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,710
for being able to sit still.

389
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,860
Is it really fun to just sit and zone out?

390
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,270
The people here

391
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,430
have taught me how to meditate.

392
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,430
It's like this.

393
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,670
You really have no reaction.

394
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,340
[42 bpm. 41 bpm one minute ago]

395
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,300
Well,

396
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,430
I ended up here

397
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,140
for some reasons

398
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,910
I don't even fully understand myself.

399
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,230
When I first came,

400
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,910
I was so scared that I wet myself.

401
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,340
Then, I ran into the Big Monster

402
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,820
and ended up peeing myself again.

403
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,470
But over time,

404
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,470
I found that the people here

405
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,510
aren't too bad.

406
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,910
Being stuck here is annoying,

407
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,540
especially with that scar-faced guy around.

408
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,060
He bullies everyone,

409
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,860
but he can't do anything to kids,

410
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,270
so we get to bully him instead.

411
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,750
I don't know

412
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,990
why you're here

413
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:13,990
but

414
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:15,910
don't worry.

415
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,710
They'll handle

416
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,430
the rest.

417
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,510
This is a safe place.

418
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,510
Bring Chen Junyan out.

419
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,540
Got it.

420
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,270
Let's go.

421
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,980
[78 bpm. 80 bpm one minute ago]

422
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,430
It's slowing down again.

423
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,540
Shall we give

424
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,470
another stimulating approach a shot?

425
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,540
It might work.

426
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,670
No.

427
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,910
We've worked hard to get here,

428
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,140
and if we pick the wrong stimulus,

429
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,710
it'll cause her to regress.

430
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,860
Gather all her data,

431
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,380
I need to submit it to the board

432
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,710
for approval

433
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,230
of the next steps.

434
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,060
I really didn't expect the board

435
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,230
to approve your proposal.

436
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,380
It certainly wasn't easy.

437
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,580
There was a lot of debate,

438
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,750
but in the end,

439
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,190
they agreed with me.

440
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,620
Are we all set?

441
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,140
Don't worry.

442
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,100
All participants are of high caliber.

443
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,470
We've informed their families

444
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,540
about the associated risks

445
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,710
and necessary details.

446
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,300
Our top experts

447
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,270
are stationed around,

448
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,540
so everything's under control.

449
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,510
Monks should practice the restraint of anger.

450
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,540
Hit it.

451
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,140
Attention everyone.

452
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,060
If you detect

453
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,060
any possibility

454
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,430
of a deadly poison leak,

455
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,860
restrain the Poison Girl immediately

456
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,750
and stop all operations.

457
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,430
The priority

458
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,270
is ensuring

459
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,380
the participants' safety.

460
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,710
This will teach you a lesson.

461
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,380
You two seem perfect for each other.

462
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,910
You want a lesson too?

463
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,780
Miss,

464
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,100
are you also here to save someone?

465
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,340
What's your name?

466
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,140
Your hair is so beautiful.

467
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,780
It looks amazing.

468
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,470
Miss, you're so pretty.

469
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,510
This will serve you right.

470
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,910
You fool. How can you hit me for real?

471
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,820
Did you get hurt?

472
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,270
Get up now.

473
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,540
Are you okay?

474
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,100
Are they bullying you?

475
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,540
Swallowing saliva.

476
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,710
Directly into the dantian.

477
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,910
Are you okay?

478
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,750
Miss, are you all right?

479
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,470
Are you sick?

480
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,670
Miss, are you okay?

481
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,380
Miss, are you okay?

482
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,030
Is it serious?

483
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,340
Miss, are you okay?

484
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,140
Miss, are you okay?

485
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,950
Miss, are you okay?

486
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,580
Is it serious?

487
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,380
That will do.

488
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,340
- Let's go. - Let's go.

489
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,710
- Let's go. - Let's go.

490
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,580
What are you expecting?

491
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,860
The familiar abuse?

492
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,860
Compared to that kind of pain,

493
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,620
this inexplicable existence

494
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,430
has left you more at a loss, right?

495
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,300
Sorry,

496
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,750
I can't give you back the world

497
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,270
you were anticipating.

498
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,710
Even if you don't know

499
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,230
how to put it into words or explain it,

500
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,750
you can feel it deep down, can't you?

501
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,030
The one who's abnormal

502
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,230
is you.

503
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,340
It's been an hour.

504
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,710
Is everything all right?

505
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,910
The research institute has been studying

506
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,380
the poison in this girl.

507
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,750
There have been some findings,

508
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,990
but they're not ideal.

509
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,780
It's not so much a poison

510
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,860
but more like qi.

511
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,270
Qi is the source

512
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,430
of all life.

513
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,300
In the body of an outsider,

514
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,670
qi takes shape and has substance.

515
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,990
Qi transforms into form,

516
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,190
and from form, life emerges.

517
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,510
Life is just the aggregation of qi.

518
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,710
Everything is born from the laws of nature.

519
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,270
Yet this girl's qi

520
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,990
is formless,

521
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,780
as though it comes from nothingness

522
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,060
and returns to it.

523
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,270
Or perhaps

524
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,990
she's from another world,

525
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,340
where cause and effect don't exist.

526
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,950
Quit trying to sound smart.

527
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,230
Just speak in simple terms.

528
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,270
What I mean

529
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,270
is that it's a bad result.

530
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,710
As long as her organs are still functioning,

531
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,620
the poison

532
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,510
will keep producing itself.

533
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,750
Right now, it seems

534
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,820
almost impossible to cure her.

535
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,230
Face.

536
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,580
Face.

537
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:19,990
Face.

538
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,340
Face.

539
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,140
Face.

540
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,780
Yes.

541
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,750
Next.

542
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,100
Blue.

543
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,380
Blue.

544
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,300
Blue.

545
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,910
That's right.

546
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,620
Blue.

547
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,140
Come on.

548
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,030
Here we go.

549
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,620
How come you're not tired?

550
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,030
Dude,

551
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,540
you've got to win at least once.

552
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,620
Look at yourself.

553
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,230
You keep shouting until your voice cracks,

554
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,710
but you still can't beat her.

555
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,990
Don't talk as if it's a simple thing.

556
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,820
Her stamina is beyond human.

557
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,230
Even you're probably no match for her.

558
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,230
Good news.

559
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,750
You can go home now.

560
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,910
Go home?

561
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,620
Go for the rebound!

562
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,030
Why don't you brainwash me

563
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,100
and then send me back?

564
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,190
Just like in the TV shows,

565
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,990
organizations like yours

566
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,430
always erase the victim's memories

567
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,670
of being persecuted.

568
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,780
You must have a way of doing that, right?

569
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,190
We don't.

570
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,670
You brought me here,

571
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,340
and it's like entering a whole new world.

572
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,030
With all this talk of qi

573
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,270
and superpowers,

574
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,820
my whole worldview

575
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,710
has been upended.

576
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,060
And now, you want me

577
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,710
to go back to the normal world?

578
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,780
That's your problem.

579
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,710
That's right,

580
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,710
Poison Girl.

581
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,230
This is cheating.

582
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,300
What Poison Girl?

583
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,230
It's Chen Duo,

584
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,670
as in the flower "Duo."

585
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,710
I came up with the name.

586
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,620
She'll take my last name.

587
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,100
From now on, call her Chen Duo.

588
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,220
Got it?

589
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,540
My name is Chen Duo.

590
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,620
Right.

591
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:25,620
You're absolutely right.

592
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,870
It was my oversight.

593
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,310
But I'm the one who chooses names.

594
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,510
After all, I'm known as the god of names!

595
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,390
We can choose names like Li and Mi.

596
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,260
Sir,

597
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,220
calm down.

598
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,180
You!

599
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,950
Your face...

600
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,620
Amazing, right?

601
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,100
The antidote is working.

602
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,220
Time to go.

603
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,260
What are you looking at?

604
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,870
Where is the beautiful lady going?

605
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,260
She's about to leave.

606
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,180
I should have asked her earlier

607
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,950
how she ended up here.

608
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,100
Cut it out.

609
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,700
You just want her phone number.

610
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,660
True,

611
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,140
I was planning to ask her out.

612
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,580
Let's stop bickering.

613
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,580
I'll also be leaving in a couple of days.

614
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,140
Make sure to come visit me afterward.

615
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,310
Mr. Zhao,

616
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,220
can we not delay this a little longer?

617
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,470
We really can't delay this any longer, Liao.

618
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,030
Mr. Zhao,

619
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,390
with Chen Junyan being someone who can wield

620
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,030
Outsiders' technique without relying on the flow of qi,

621
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,700
do you understand

622
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,430
how precious a case he is to us?

623
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,950
Some people just have special skills.

624
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,470
If he doesn't have the qi flowing in him,

625
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,580
then Chen Junyan can't really

626
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,140
be considered an Outsider.

627
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,390
According to their explanation,

628
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,540
the anomalies in him

629
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,910
were caused

630
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,790
by a third type of contact.

631
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,660
You know?

632
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,350
This isn't even in our field of expertise.

633
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,140
If it weren't for Chen Junyan,

634
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,870
I wouldn't even believe

635
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,220
such a department exists.

636
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,740
Check out the text above.

637
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,660
[Profanity is strictly prohibited in the workplace.]

638
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,220
How come you're still swearing?

639
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,790
Before anything else,

640
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,060
copy the text above

641
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,700
a hundred times.

642
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,700
A hundred times?

643
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,180
Do it now.

644
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,910
Bye, Big Monster.

645
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,580
Chen Junyan,

646
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,470
will you be leaving as well?

647
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,430
Of course.

648
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,140
I can't stay here forever, can I?

649
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,180
Once I'm cured,

650
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,180
I'll leave too.

651
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,870
Are you unwell?

652
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,100
They all say I'm an alien,

653
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,060
not able to adapt to Earth's environment.

654
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,140
I guess everyone who stays here

655
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,700
is unwell in some way, right?

656
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,100
So,

657
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,790
what will you do when you go out?

658
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,260
Not sure,

659
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,990
I'll decide once I'm out.

660
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,580
Chen Junyan,

661
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,510
you're getting worse at this.

662
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,740
I've been beaten by you so many times,

663
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,030
I've gotten used to it.

664
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,870
I'll admit it,

665
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,430
you're a bit better than me.

666
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,310
Just a bit though.

667
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,310
Chen Duo,

668
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,870
if I leave,

669
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,430
will you miss me?

670
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,870
I don't know.

671
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,310
Are you leaving?

672
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,180
They're going to take me somewhere else.

673
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,470
They say I don't have qi,

674
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,620
so I'm not considered an Outsider.

675
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,430
They won't let me stay here anymore.

676
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,910
But no matter where I go,

677
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,580
we'll always be friends,

678
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,540
right?

679
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,220
Friends?

680
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,180
Rematch.

681
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,830
- Time to go, brat. - Chen Duo.

682
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,510
Chen Duo!

683
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,950
Mr. Liao,

684
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,700
can you get Chen Duo

685
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,350
a phone or something?

686
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,950
Look at you, acting so pathetic.

687
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,220
Unlike you, Chen Duo is calm.

688
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,740
We've already sorted everything out for you over there.

689
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,740
You're free now.

690
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,580

Mr. Liao,

701
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,030
can I go out now?

702
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,100
It's getting late.

703
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,310
You should get some rest.

704
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,310
Am I also someone

705
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,990
who doesn't belong here?

706
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,700
If she had caused

707
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,950
a serious incident, it would have been simpler.

708
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,100
She would just stay locked up.

709
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,100
But now, neither locking her up

710
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,390
nor freeing her seems right.

711
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,060
This is the first time I've encountered such a situation.

712
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,950
Also,

713
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,870
I'm concerned about her condition.

714
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,100
Her physiological indicators

715
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,620
are becoming more stable,

716
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,100
which makes me fear

717
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,470
she could regress.

718
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,350
Do everything you can to heal her body.

720

Also, find one of our top experts

721

to train her.

722

what are you up to?

724
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,180
Didn't you also undergo training before?

725
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,220
So train with her for a couple of days.

726
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,990

Don't worry,

730
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,100
I won't go all out.

731
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,430

732
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,700
to protect yourself

he had already held his breath.

741
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,540
