Okay, we're almost there.

of the Furnace?

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Pretty awesome.

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,910
So do you want to try

63
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,470
using this Furnace?

64
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,910

67
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,910
he is...

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
His name is Zhao Nian.

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,800
He used to be an office worker.

70
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,910
He practiced some Qimen Skills

71
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,280
he picked up from somewhere.

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,910
Then he's like this.

73
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,120

74
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520

You can say that.

76
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,430
But unfortunately,

77
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,310
he took the wrong path.

78

79
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,080

to wake him up

81
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,750

82
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,560
I didn't want to bother you.

83
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,910

Mr. Zhuge,

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,470
please!

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,910
Please!

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Save him or not.

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,080
It's up to you.

99
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,240
Okay.

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,400
I've been wanting to try the Furnace for a long time.

101
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,520
What should I do?

102
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,710
Qing, I knew

103
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,240
you would help them.

104
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,430
In fact, I've done a lot of efforts

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
with the Refining Furnace

106
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,080
before you came.

107
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,680
I tried to rebuild the human meridian vessel

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
in the Refining Furnace.

109
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,150
It's useless.

110
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,590
There's no problem

111
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,720
with the running of their meridian vessel.

112
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
They are just lost

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,600
in their own consciousness.

114
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,430
But let's take another perspective.

115
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,070
The phantasmagoria is built from the meridian vessel.

116
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,480
With the help of the Furnace,

117
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,600
you can integrate your meridian vessel

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
with Zhao Nian's,

119
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,510
so that...

120
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
We can share the phantasmagoria.

121
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,510
Right.

122
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,800
That’s why I need your help, Qing.

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,870
Interesting.

124
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,510
I know what to do.

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
Tell me how to operate it.

126
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,600
The Refining Furnace will get everything ready for you.

127
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,600
All you need to do

128
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,870
is bring Zhao Nian out.

129
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,000
Qing,

130
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,000
you will enter not only his phantasmagoria

131
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,160
but also your own.

132
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,040
I don't know what is going to happen.

133
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,630
The more you say it,

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
the more interested I am.

135
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,630
Bring it on.

136
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,190
Stop wasting time.

137
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,040
A fairyland.

138
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,390

139

But the visual effect is too...

140
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,750
There are so many people.

141
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,750
Which one is Zhao Nian?

142
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,310
What a grand welcome ceremony!

143
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,160
Surrender!

144
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,190
Surrender?

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,510
I won't.

146
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,680

147
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,070
dare to be the enemy of me, the Number One Saint of the Three Realms.

148
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,630
You take away my magic weapon.

149
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,870
I'm going to kill your whole family.

150

151
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,390

152

He even changed his surname!

167
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,510
Shut up!

168
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,000
My surname

169
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,630
has been here for thousands of years.

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,430
How can someone like you slander it?

171
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,950
Qing,

172
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,270
Why did you come out?

173
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
Mr. Zhuge,

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,630
how is my son?

175
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
I think

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,390
he is quite happy now.

177
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,310
We don't need to help him.

178
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,510
He's fine.

179
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,070
Stop kidding, Qing.

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
Even you can't do anything?

181
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,830
Mr. Zhuge,

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
just say a number

183
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,510
and I'll give the money to you.

184
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,920
That's not what I meant, Ms. Zhao.

185
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,390
How to say it?

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,190
It's not difficult

187
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,190
to take him back for his situation.

188
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,800
But he may go back again at any time

189
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,070
after he wakes up.

190
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,390
Chief Ma,

191
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,070
can you erase

192
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,360
part of his memory

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
when he wakes up?

194
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,820
I can't.

195
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,480
I was only asking.

196
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,600
Why are you so serious?

197
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,680
Never mind.

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,070
Let me try again.

199
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,270
I'll have to do it my way

200
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,870
if it doesn't work this time.

201
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,800
The phantasmagoria

202
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,040
is hidden in the weakest part of the deep consciousness.

203
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,430
He can be influenced greatly

204
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,240
by what I do.

205
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Zhao Nian may be shattered by this.

206
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,720
Is it okay, Ms. Zhao?

207
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
Please.

208
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,790
Then I'll try again.

209
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,840
It's you again

210
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,480
I just cut you into ashes.

211
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,360
Are you

212
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,360
from the immortal Eastern Ghost Tribe

213
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,960
in the legend?

214
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,000
Your highness,

215
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,270
I'm not some ghost.

216
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,480
I'm here because of your mom.

217
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,360
She asked me to take you home for dinner.

218
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,670
My mother?

219
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,030
Do you think I'm stupid?

220
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
My mother is trapped

221
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,200
in the Deceased Emperor Tower

222
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320
for protecting me,

223
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,790
the only blood of Taichu.

224
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,840
Tell me,

225
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,360
what are you here for?

226
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,550
I can't stand you anymore.

227
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,480
In short,

228
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
the happy life you are living

229
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,510
as an Immortal is fake.

230
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,000
In reality,

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you are just an ordinary office worker.

232
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
Interesting.

233
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm becoming interested

234
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,480
in your background.

235
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,790
Right.

236
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,600
I had some weird dreams before.

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,630
In my dreams,

238
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,750
I was ugly,

239
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,150
humble,

240
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,720
and weak.

241
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,910
In the dreams,

242
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,150
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

243
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,480
However,

244
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,000
everyone else wanted to hurt me.

245
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,030
Everyone else looked down on me.

246
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
You are wrong.

247
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,870
In fact, nobody looks down on you.

248
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,200
They don't look at you at all.

249
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Everyone is busy.

250
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,550
Why will they look at you?

251
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,550
Rubbish.

252
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,000
I forgot to tell you

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,240
I am a sorcerer.

254
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,120
The phantasmagoria

255
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,080
is my home court.

256
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,080
You took my hit without vomiting blood.

257
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,720
The level of your martial arts

258
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,550
is at least the Advanced Stage of Crazy.

259
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
You are an advanced stage! Your whole family is an advanced stage!

260
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,360
I didn't want to do this.

261
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,600
But the only way

262
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,320
to stop you from wallowing here

263
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,720
is to defeat you completely

264
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,910
in your deep consciousness.

265
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,790
Now

266
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,510
are you going back with me?

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,320
Defeat me

268
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,390
completely?

269
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,840
You know nothing.

270
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,390
Built with three thousand Great Taoists,

271
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,510
The second of the three world-destroying demon swords,

272
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,750
Sky Cutting Sword!

273
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,080
Chief Ma,

274
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
is everything okay?

275
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,720
How so?

276
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,910
It's the first time it reacts like this.

277
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,840
Is it Zhuge Qing's Ji

278
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,120
that causes components overloading which triggers the vibrations?

279
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,510
Cut the sky?

280
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,870
Why do you always want

281
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,510
to cut the sky?

282
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,840
The voice

283
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
isn't from that man.

284
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,790
Tell me,

285
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,360
did the sky provoke you?

286
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,030
Why do you want to cut it?

287
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,510
Who are you?

288
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,000
Me?

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,750
I'm you in the real world.

290
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,000
Now way.

291
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,910
You are a monster.

292
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,480
Monster!

293
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,390
I can destroy heaven and earth.

294
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,870
I can break the void.

295
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,150
Why can't you kill me?

296
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,080
It's simple.

297
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,790
Because everything you are experiencing now

298
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,550
is all an illusion.

299
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
And the dreams

300
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,840
you don't want to remember

301
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,720
are real.

302
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,550
Who do you think you are?

303
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,550
Why should you define what is real?

304
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,960
Do you think you are God?

305
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,030
To be right,

306
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,550
even God

307
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,240
has no right of defining reality.

308
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,840
And I

309
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,200
just defined

310
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,080
that this world is just an illusion.

311
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,960
Illusion?

312
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,600
The air,

313
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,440
earth

314
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,670
and the knife in my hand,

315
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,720
I am feeling them.

316
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,030
Why should you

317
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,270
define what they are?

318
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,030
Feeling?

319
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,000
If feelings can be taken for real,

320
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,870
there won't be so many people in the world

321
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,870
practicing hard.

322
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,440
Are you seeing it?

323
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,080
Feelings are unreliable.

324
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,790
If feelings mean the reality

325
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,150
then your reality

326
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,360
can be twisted by a few pills.

327
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,000
You said this world is unreal.

328
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,480
Is the world in the dreams you talked about

329
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,670
is real?

330
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
Yes.

331
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,510
Because it's more reasonable.

332
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,870
It's unreasonable to be able to defeat countless masters with one blow

333
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,390
You have no strength.

334
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,670
You are yelled by your boss and don't dare to look up. That's more reasonable.

335
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,550
So it's more real there.

336
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,150
Tao is reality.

337
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,870
Reason is reality.

338
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,720
Evidence of that world being real

339
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,440
is in your memory.

340
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,150
Everything in this world

341
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,440
originates from there.

342
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,030
I don’t want that kind of reality.

343
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,120
I don't care

344
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,960
about reality

345
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,600
or illusion

346
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
as long as I am powerful.

347
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,360
Powerful?

348
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,270
Do you mean

349
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,960
this?

350
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,120
Chief Ma,

351
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,390
what's happening?

352
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,750
No.

353
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,960
The components are not acting right.

354
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,150
Qing,

355
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
you need to hurry up.

356
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know

357
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,440
how much longer the Furnace will hold.

358
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,790
Look,

359
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,600
I shattered your world with one kick.

360
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,270
Is it powerful?

361
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,960
I don't think.

362
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,200
Because I don't see any reason

363
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,910
from the kick.

364
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,510
And you can't imagine the hardship I went through

365
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,750
when I was practicing?

366
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,910
Reason...

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,840
So many reasons...

368
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,480
You are so annoying.

369
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,840
So what if it's unreasonable

370
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,320
when I can experience

371
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,120
the pleasure of being powerful?

372
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,150
The thing is that powerful people are reasonable.

373
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
No matter boxing,

374
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,150
mathematics,

375
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,240
or physics,

376
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,510
the people

377
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
become powerful

378
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,670
on the way of exploring truth.

379
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,720
This is by no means an easy way.

380
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,630
Think about it if you don't believe me.

381
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,480
In the dreams you don’t want to mention,

382
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,120
aren't you

383
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,440
walking on that way too?

384
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,600
What else can you do?

385
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,510
Do it again!

386
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,600
Which one is more real?

387
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,480
Which one is more powerful?

388
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,030
The God who wants to cut the sky

389
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,550
or the nerd that studied all night?

390
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,350
Yunshang Nian

391
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,000
is much better than the trashy Zhao Nian, right?

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,790
Shut up!

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,550
Oh no.

394
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,350
I have to stop the Furnace first.

395
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,480
Mom!

396
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,720
My son!

397
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,400
Mom!

398
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,680
I'm a coward.

399
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,240
I'm useless.

400
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,510
So let’s talk about the most important thing

401
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,200
since you are awake completely.

402
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,070
Do you know

403
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,550
why you were trapped in that situation?

404
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
You rode with lax reins?

405
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,030
Do you know the concept of "monkey's heart, horse's will"?

406
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,270
This phrase is from a classic book in Han Dynasty.

407
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,310
Journey to the West also used this concept.

408
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,240
I don't have to explain

409
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,480
the meaning of it.

410
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,310
An ancient Practitioners once had an interpretation.

411
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,110
They compared the monkey

412
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,400
to Sun Wukong,

413
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,830
and the horse to the White Dragon Horse.

414
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,590
Follow the heart.

415
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,880
Defeat the evil.

416
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,510
The monkey's heart jumps around.

417
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,750
The horse runs everywhere.

418
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,830
If you can't keep your heart,

419
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,240
it's easy to lose yourself

420
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,880
and get into trouble.

421
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,350
This is the so-called "Ride with lax reins,

422
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,400
doomed to disaster."

423
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,720
This is how an ancient practitioner

424
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,000
understand Journey to the West.

425
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,830
Of course he could be wrong.

426
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,350
But one thing was right.

427
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,510
Even from a modern person's perspective,

428
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,830
we should stay true to our heart,

429
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,640
have a strong mind

430
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,550
and a strong body.

431
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,000
That's the real Practice.

432
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,030
You went crazy this time

433
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,110
because you were taken over

434
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,440
by your feelings.

435
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,240
I'll ask you another question.

436
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,440
What's the name of Sanzang's horse?

437
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,480
White Dragon Horse.

438
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,270
Another identity of the horse

439
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,270
is the Third Dragon Prince of the West Sea.

440
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,720
Here's a pretty simple riddle.

441
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,000
Interpret the Third Dragon Prince of the West Sea.

442
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,200
The West...

443
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,110
The West...

444
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
The Third Dragon Prince...

445
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,880
The third Qian of Yao...

446
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,070
Right.

447
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,030
That's the last thing I want to tell you.

448
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,440
I won't interfere you

449
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,880
no matter where you go or what you do.

450
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,640
But I hope you remember it.

451
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,830
I will.

452
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,790
I will remember it forever.

453
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,350
The third Qian:

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,680
A man should work hard during daytime.

455
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
Be vigilant even at night.

456
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,830
Then he's doing it right.

457
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:24,260
[The third Qian: A man should work hard during daytime. Be vigilant even at night. Then he's doing it right.]

458
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank Chief Ma.

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,830
He saved you.

460
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,880
Thank you.

461
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,070
Don't thank me.

462
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,480
The Refining Furnace and Mr. Zhuge saved you.

463
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
It's not easy to be an Outsider.

464
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,920
Go back.

465
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,680
Remember

466
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
Biyou Village will always welcome you.

467
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,590
Zhuge Qing.

468
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Zhuge Qing.

469
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,720
Who is that?

470
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,350
Qing?

471
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,510
He really entered my phantasmagoria.

472
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,750
But I didn't have any thoughts.

473
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,920
Wouldn't the phantasmagoria exist

474
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,720
if you don't think about it?

475
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,510
Who do you think you are?

476
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,590
The man you woke up

477
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,640
didn't hurt anyone.

478
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,400
He just wanted a place to be peaceful

479
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,750
where he can accept himself.

480
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,640
Why wouldn't you let him do it?

481
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,480
Meanwhile,

482
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,720
you keep talking about truth and reasons

483
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,680
but never

484
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
dare to admit what you want.

485
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,070
You don’t even dare to admit your own desires.

486
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,310
He hid in the phantasmagoria.

487
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,880
You are hiding in Biyou Village.

488
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,510
How are you smarter than him?

489
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,240
Shut up!

490
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,310
I just said the truth to you and you can't stand it.

491
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,640
Isn't it your own choice?

492
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,160
Do you really think that Ma Xianhong

493
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,480
called you here

494
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,350
just to save

495
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,160
an unimportant office worker.

496
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,350
You have already figured out

497
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,790
that Ma Xianhong was taking advantage of you.

498
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,440
But you still accepted it

499
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,000
because you wanted to see the Refining Furnace.

500
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,240
Do you know

501
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,680
what changes you will bring to the world?

502
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,000
Shut up!

503
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,510
You made a mistake

504
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,000
and it's irretrievable.

505
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Zhuge Qing,

506
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,110
you lost.

507
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,590
You lost completely.

508
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,400
I told you to shut up!

509
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,720
Qing?

510
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,720
Qing?

511
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,240
Qing?

512
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,480
What's wrong, Qing?

513
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,980
I'm fine.

514
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,270
Maybe a little tired.

515
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,830
Chief Ma,

516
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,640
the Furnace...

517
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,920
Good it is ruined.

518
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,160
As long as you don't care.

519
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,510
I'll go back then.

520
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,790
How could I not care?

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,550
Let's start

695
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,360
from the operation to exterminate Medicine Immortal Association

696
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,840
five years ago.

697
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,920
Are you okay?

698
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,190
The poison concentration here is too high.

699
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
The suit can't protect us

700
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,510
if we stay here any longer.

701
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,550
We need to get out of here immediately.

702
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,880
We won't find any more survivors.

703
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,070
Look around.

704
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,070
Even serpents and scorpions

705
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,360
can't survive in the environment

706
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,070
let alone people.

707
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,710
Send a request to the headquarter.

708
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,590
Let's get out of here.

709

Come here.

710

Take care of him.
