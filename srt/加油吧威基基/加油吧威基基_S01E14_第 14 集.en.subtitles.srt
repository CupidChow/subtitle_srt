1
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,671
It was you, wasn't it?

2
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,673
You did this, didn't you?

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,259
That's right.
I stopped it from being released.

4
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,220
Don't you know
the anchor has editorial rights?

5
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,597
What?

6
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,016
How can you call yourself a reporter?

7
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,350
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

8
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,728
Stop acting so innocent!

9
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,563
You...

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,565
You...

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,651
will end up hurt.

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,279
What? You bastard!

13
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,866
Cut!

14
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,452
Good! Let's move on to the next scene.

15
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,245
Are you all right?

16
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,290
-I don't know how to control myself yet.
-It's all right.

17
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,583
It happens.

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,376
Don't worry about it.

19
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,170
Thank you for understanding.

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,464
Joon-ki, you have a call.

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,133
It's been ringing nonstop for a while.
You should answer it.

22
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,635
Ah, thank you.

23
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,388
Hello? Yes, this is Lee Joon-ki speaking.

24
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,642
Excuse me?

25
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,980
Yes, yes. I understand.

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,444
What was that about?

27
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,447
Well... you see,

28
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,076
they want me to appear in a commercial.

29
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,453
And a coffee commercial, at that.

30
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,663
What?

31
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,290
A coffee commercial?
I haven't even done one yet.

32
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,209
Congrats, Joon-ki!

33
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,002
That's great.

34
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,213
Thank you.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,641
THE MORNING DEW OF COLOMBIA

36
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,185
Don't you know the anchor
has editorial rights?

37
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,103
What?

38
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,438
How can you call yourself a reporter?

39
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,732
-Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
-Stop acting all innocent!

40
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,528
You... You'll end up hurt.

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,071
You bastard!

42
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,489
Stop!

43
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,826
Wow! Look at that expression!

44
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,579
Aren't I oozing with charisma?

45
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,247
"You bastard!"

46
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,250
Wasn't it great? Amazing?

47
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,419
Okay, we got it.
Now can we watch something else?

48
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,962
I'm sick and tired of it.

49
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,255
Sick and tired?

50
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,885
You bastard!

51
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,555
If he's like this over a supporting role,

52
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,640
imagine the fuss he'll make
over a lead role.

53
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,602
What? You bitch!

54
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,106
By the way, why do they want you
in their commercial?

55
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,525
Don't only top stars
shoot coffee commercials?

56
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,694
-Are they set on going belly-up?
-Gosh.

57
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,655
What? You bastard!

58
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,867
That's enough.

59
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,119
I'll be getting to my meeting, then.

60
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,788
Hold on. Can I borrow your car today?

61
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,498
You mean my precious Rebecca?

62
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,875
Why? For what reason?

63
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,420
It's a hassle picking up clothes
without a car and taxis are expensive,

64
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,380
so I want to practice driving.

65
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,132
Is your car in good condition?

66
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,425
Of course!

67
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,885
My Rebecca is very reliable.

68
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,764
But don't open the right window.

69
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,765
Why?

70
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,230
Because that window has a sad story.

71
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,399
Take care of my Rebecca.

72
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,236
-Okay.
-It'd be better not using it.

73
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,487
Don't worry.

74
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,031
But isn't it expensive
getting a driving instructor?

75
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,284
It won't be a problem
because Doo-sik will take care of it.

76
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,410
What? Me?

77
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,995
When? Where? What? How? Why?

78
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,413
Just follow me, Director Bong.

79
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,791
Hold on. I don't even have socks on.

80
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,460
That's fine.
We'll just be in the car anyway.

81
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,128
-We'll be back.
-H-hey.

82
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,171
Doo-sik, be careful!

83
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,965
-Dong-goo...
-See you later!

84
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,882
-Be careful.
-Okay.

85
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,008
-Hey.
-Rebecca is rough.

86
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,095
I'll get going, then.

87
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,306
I'm heading out, too. Wait for me.

88
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,355
Didn't I tell you to keep
a five-meter distance from him?

89
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,899
Leave five minutes after Joon-ki.

90
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,192
What?

91
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,653
When are we going to stop doing this?

92
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,864
Well, that will be when I'm no longer
suspicious of you two.

93
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,703
-Jeez.
-Jeez?

94
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,580
Well, I'll get going now.

95
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,748
Okay. Go ahead.

96
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,007
Jeez. Queen of exploitation, you.

97
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,425
This is so annoying.

98
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,345
What? Do you have something else to do?

99
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,058
-No.
-That's what I thought.

100
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,354
But you do know how to drive, right?

101
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,815
Of course. I got my license
eight years ago.

102
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,234
Though I haven't driven once since.

103
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,528
What? Not once?

104
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,363
It's fine.

105
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,907
I'll get the hang of it soon.

106
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,076
Well, then, let's go.

107
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,121
So annoying.

108
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,209
Doo-sik, which one is the brake?
Is it the left pedal or the right pedal?

109
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,252
What?

110
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,671
You going to drive
without even knowing that?

111
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,883
It's just been a while, so I'm confused.

112
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,719
This doesn't feel right.

113
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,139
What is this?

114
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,353
What? Why won't this open?

115
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,064
That door only opens from outside.

116
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,566
Nothing in this car works.

117
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,650
Hold on.

118
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,029
What are you doing?

119
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,697
Seriously?

120
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,503
Director Bong, what are you doing?
Let's go.

121
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,254
All right. Just a second.

122
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,345
Well, here we go.

123
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,145
Jeez! What are you doing, you idiot?

124
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,855
What? Idiot? You wanna die?

125
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,315
I take it back.

126
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,691
Here we go now.

127
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,611
CAN'T TELL BRAKE FROM ACCELERATOR!
BEGINNER DRIVER, MURDERER-TO-BE!

128
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,368
Hey, hey. Slow down!

129
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,209
You bastard!

130
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,378
Ow!

131
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,255
Seo-jin, it's me!

132
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,840
Joon-ki?

133
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,259
What the heck? You scared me!

134
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,552
Are you okay?

135
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,263
Are you sure you're not being followed?

136
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,764
I'm talking about Dong-goo.

137
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,809
What are you talking about?
Dong-goo has other things to do.

138
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,644
Didn't you see the look in his eyes?

139
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,438
He looked like the Grim Reaper!

140
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,064
We have to be really careful.

141
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,190
My goodness.

142
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,693
Are we dating or shooting a spy movie?

143
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,945
There's nothing we can lose
from being careful.

144
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,698
So, should we go grab some coffee?

145
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,242
Didn't you say you had a meeting
with the ad agency?

146
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,870
But I have time for a cup of coffee
with my Bacca.

147
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,787
Don't worry.

148
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,375
I really hope you get
the commercial contract.

149
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,046
-Don't worry. It's nearly confirmed.
-Really?

150
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,592
Have you told your father?
He's probably very pleased.

151
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,136
Yeah, he said he was proud of me.

152
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,557
It was the first time in 31 years of life
that my father complimented me.

153
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,769
I'm so proud of you, my boyfriend!

154
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,114
Damn it! I lost her.

155
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,366
Has she caught on?

156
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,328
Kang Seo-jin. Lee Joon-ki.

157
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,997
Just wait until I catch you.

158
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,837
You both will be attending
your own funerals.

159
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
There aren't that many cars

160
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,724
or people on this road,
so it's perfect for practice.

161
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,559
But there isn't much to driving.

162
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,604
Oh, I forgot the most important thing.

163
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,025
Hey, are you nuts?

164
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,777
Why would you take your hands
off the wheel?

165
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,571
You got it. What's the problem?

166
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:56,285
Sunglasses are a necessity
for looking good while driving.

167
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,913
What are you talking about?
Hurry up and grab the wheel!

168
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,165
This isn't a self-driving car, you psycho.

169
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,376
-What?
-I take it back, so just grab the wheel.

170
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,878
Give me a second.
Let me take a look in the mirror.

171
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,172
I can't believe you.

172
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,174
Gosh...

173
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,763
What am I doing?

174
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,516
Is it funny?

175
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,566
Dong-goo, what are you doing?
Why are you scooping out the bread?

176
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,234
Oh, this?

177
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,070
I have to check if an air rifle
fits inside a loaf of bread.

178
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,739
An air rifle inside bread?

179
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,659
The main character is a spy

180
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,619
and keeps a rifle inside bread.

181
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,496
-Why?
-I'm not sure.

182
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,999
They said it was my idea,
but I have no recollection of it.

183
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,127
Anyway, they want me to fit a rifle
inside the bread.

184
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,628
I don't know what I'm doing.

185
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,173
-Are you heading out?
-Yeah, to the studio.

186
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,466
Again?

187
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,887
Don't you think you're going too often?
There's a lot to do around here.

188
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,015
I finished everything.

189
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,516
Oh, you did?

190
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,687
I took a look around yesterday
and there's a lot in need of repair.

191
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,188
Like what? Where?

192
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,025
Well... the dormitory room
on the second floor--

193
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,360
The loose doorknob?

194
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,946
I bought a new one and replaced it
this morning.

195
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,072
Really?

196
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,950
The single room on the second fl--

197
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,494
The light that flickers every 4.2 seconds?

198
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,957
I used a ladder to fix
all the short circuits yesterday.

199
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,001
Oh, right! The third floor...

200
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,420
The third stair that's a bit wobbly?

201
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,590
I bought a welding machine
and fixed it this morning.

202
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,800
You can go, then.

203
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,303
Okay. See you, Sol.

204
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,138
Please take care of Sol.

205
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,473
Bye.

206
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,891
Bye.

207
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,644
What was that?

208
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,105
Sol, your mom can even weld now.

209
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,649
She's like a professional.

210
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,236
She can't be spending so much time
with Song Hyun-joon.

211
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,030
Whatever.

212
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,909
Why are they putting
an air rifle in here?

213
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,869
What kind of movie is this?

214
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,455
Joon-ki, we're sorry.

215
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,416
The advertiser suddenly recommended
Kim Jae-hyun.

216
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,543
I'm sorry, Joon-ki.

217
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,588
I said I wouldn't do it,
but my agency pressured me.

218
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,008
No, it's fine.

219
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,012
Still, it makes me look like
I stole your contract.

220
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,097
This isn't right.

221
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,310
By the way, do you know
why they recommended me?

222
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:31,232
Well, your smile is most important
in this ad.

223
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,362
Some people weren't completely satisfied
with Joon-ki's smile.

224
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,863
So...

225
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,491
what kind of smile do they want?

226
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,453
A smile as fresh as morning dew.

227
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,500
"A smile as fresh as morning dew"?

228
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,168
Why don't we go eat first?

229
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,211
Sure.

230
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,134
-Jae-hyun!
-Are you okay?

231
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,303
I'm all right.

232
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,932
Wait. Why is he smiling all of a sudden?

233
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,600
You fell pretty hard.

234
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,272
It hurts a bit, but I'm...

235
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,274
okay.

236
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,445
Wait. He's smiling again.

237
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,989
Is he showing off his smile?

238
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,659
I feel...

239
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,453
a lot better now.

240
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,415
He is showing off his smile!

241
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,001
What if I lose my contract to him?

242
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,545
Shall we head out?

243
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,921
Sure.

244
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,092
I'm getting a call. Just a moment.

245
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,511
Hello?

246
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,848
What? Really?

247
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,267
How could...

248
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,977
Okay.

249
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,813
Is something wrong?

250
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,026
A friend of mine collapsed.
He's in surgery right now.

251
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,570
He's like a brother to me.

252
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,405
His name is Kang Dong-goo.

253
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,240
You must be worried.

254
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,117
It's okay.

255
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,286
I'm all right.

256
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,126
Yeah, I'm sure
everything will be all right.

257
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,420
-Stay strong.
-Thank you.

258
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,590
I should stay positive
in difficult situations like this.

259
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,509
I'm okay.

260
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,513
I see...

261
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,766
Then what should we eat for lunch?

262
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,397
Tofu with kimchi or a sandwich?

263
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,274
"Tofu with kimchi or a sandwich"?

264
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,109
-How about you, Joon-ki?
-I think...

265
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,281
tofu with kimchi or a sandwich
would be fine,

266
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,368
but sushi also sounds good.

267
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,995
Hey!

268
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,830
How long will you keep this up?

269
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,958
Why are you fixing your makeup
while driving?

270
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,045
Don't you see my skin tone
doesn't match my sunglasses?

271
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,089
Shut up and grab the wheel.

272
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,675
Okay, okay! Gosh!

273
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,260
You're so annoying.

274
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,304
Hey, slow down!

275
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,223
You're speeding. Brake!

276
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,895
-What is this?
-What?

277
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,231
This isn't the brake, is it?

278
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,482
-Let me see it.
-Okay.

279
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,568
-It's the brake!
-What?

280
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,945
The brake broke?

281
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,488
That's amazing!

282
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,282
It's not the time to be in awe.

283
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,701
Shit, this is crazy. What is this?

284
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,204
-How did the brakes...
-What do I do?

285
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,290
Doo-sik, what do we do now?

286
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,125
Take your foot off the accelerator.

287
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,878
-Then the car will slow down.
-Okay.

288
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,006
What's going on? It's not slowing down.

289
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,758
Doo-sik, what do I do?

290
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,553
Oh, my God,
we're going to get in an accident.

291
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,305
Hand brake!

292
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,683
What's going on?

293
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,935
What kind of car is this?

294
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,480
Doo-sik, what should I do?

295
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,318
We have no choice.
Let's report it. Let's call 911.

296
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,904
-Call 911.
-Where's my cell phone?

297
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,988
Where is it? Wait.

298
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,454
Damn it.

299
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,790
I left my phone on top of the car.

300
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,085
-Soo-ah, give me your phone.
-My phone...

301
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,048
Where's my cell phone?

302
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,472
Shit. I left mine at home.

303
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,223
Damn it!

304
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,226
We have no other choice.

305
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,396
What are you doing?

306
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,942
Joon-ki said not to open that window,
that it has a sad story.

307
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,694
Well, what else can I do?
My phone is up there.

308
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,907
Wait. Why won't this open?

309
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,035
Goodness. Joon-ki, that jerk.

310
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,704
This is a disaster.

311
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,296
I think I can reach it.

312
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,633
Hey, why are you raising the window?

313
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,550
I didn't!

314
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,845
Soo-ah, it hurts! Please lower it.

315
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,098
-Okay.
-My arm's going to get cut off.

316
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,557
-It's cold outside.
-Wait. What?

317
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,101
This doesn't work either.

318
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,979
How can there be a car like this?
Soo-ah. Ow!

319
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,648
What do I do?
It's a busy intersection.

320
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,899
A busy intersection?

321
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,570
Left! Turn left!
Turn into the construction site.

322
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,907
-Okay.
-H-hey... slow down.

323
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,117
Go in. Go straight ahead.

324
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,912
-How?
-Go to the side.

325
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,747
Why would you crash into that?

326
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,582
Doo-sik, what do I do now?

327
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,877
Keep turning.

328
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,587
Just keep spinning around.

329
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,964
What? Turn?

330
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,633
What else can we do?
We'll get in an accident if we go out.

331
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,094
Why did you suggest
practicing your driving?

332
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,304
Jeez, I had no idea this would happen.

333
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,390
ROOM D

334
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,231
Joon-ki, try this.

335
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,821
Oh, thank you.

336
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,407
It's nice to see you guys like this.

337
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,491
You must be close.

338
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,078
Of course. We're as close as brothers.

339
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,332
But, sir...

340
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,335
is the concept for the commercial
finalized?

341
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,503
Of course.

342
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,631
The most important thing
about this commercial

343
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,884
is your smile, as I mentioned before.

344
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,761
Next is your facial expression.

345
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,431
Your expressions need to be
as abundant as...

346
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,932
the colors of the rainbow.

347
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,437
Expressions as abundant

348
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,522
-as the colors of the rainbow?
-That's right.

349
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,524
-Let's eat up.
-Sure.

350
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,533
Oh, it's so sour!

351
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:57,826
So sour!

352
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,661
-Is the kimchi that sour?
-Yes.

353
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,583
-It's like chewing on a lemon.
-Lemon?

354
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,585
It's sour. I need some water.

355
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,299
Gosh, it's so cold.

356
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,968
There he goes again.

357
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,097
All right. If he wants to play
that game, game on.

358
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,850
The chili looks delicious.

359
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,400
I feel like my mouth is on fire.

360
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,985
So spicy!

361
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,362
I want dongchimi.

362
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,659
It's sweet and sour.

363
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,996
It's sweet but also sour.

364
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,706
It's so flavorful.

365
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,291
Sweet and sour!

366
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,092
When can we stop?

367
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,386
I don't know.

368
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,306
I guess we'll have to keep going
until the car runs out of gas.

369
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,435
How is there no one around?

370
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,357
Why do I feel so gassy?

371
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,901
Did I eat too much pizza?

372
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,696
I think I may fart. What do I do?

373
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,410
You startled me.

374
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,579
Why did you honk all of a sudden?

375
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,622
Huh? There was a cat.

376
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,791
A cat? I don't see a cat...

377
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,878
What's that smell?

378
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,462
Is there a sewer nearby?

379
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,592
Min Soo-ah.

380
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,971
You farted, didn't you?
That's why you honked the horn.

381
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,016
No, I didn't.
I honked because there was a cat.

382
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,269
Stop kidding.
It's not just about the sound.

383
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,146
What are you going to do about the smell?

384
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,190
Fine, I farted.

385
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,192
But your manners are crap.

386
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,569
If a lady farted,
you could just pretend to not notice.

387
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,321
Did you have to say something?

388
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,657
They say whoever denied it supplied it.

389
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,744
Forget it. That's why you've never
dated anyone.

390
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,456
What? That was a low blow.

391
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,082
Forget it. I'm not talking to you.

392
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,754
What the heck?

393
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,924
-Did you fart again?
-No, it was because of the cat.

394
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,550
Oh, it smells!

395
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,219
What did you eat?

396
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,512
-I said it was because of the cat!
-Oh, my gosh...

397
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,764
Stop farting!

398
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,058
I'm not honking because I farted.

399
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,643
But, sir...

400
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,731
is there anything else you're looking for
other than abundant expressions?

401
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,316
Anything else?

402
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,903
Your voice is important, too.

403
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,696
How shall I put it?

404
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,909
A sweet voice like instant coffee

405
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,786
melting in hot water.

406
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,538
Something like the voice
of Gong Yoo in Goblin

407
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,873
or Sung Si-kyung...

408
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,333
Gong Yoo or Sung Si-kyung?

409
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,213
You're out of soup, sir.

410
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,591
-Excuse me, ma'am?
-Yes?

411
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,550
Yes?

412
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,055
It was delicious and seasoned right.

413
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,225
Because the time we spent
with the soup was precious,

414
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,185
I would like to order
one more doenjang-jjigae.

415
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,020
-Pardon?
-Also...

416
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,565
the texture was good,

417
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,151
it was cooked just right,

418
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,029
and all the time we had with the rice
was so dear,

419
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,782
we'll order another bowl of rice.

420
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,245
Okay. Another doenjang-jjigae
and bowl of rice at table three!

421
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,208
I'm exhausted.

422
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,794
How long have we been driving?

423
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,839
Is it the pizza I had earlier?
I'm getting a stomachache.

424
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,008
I'm losing it.

425
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,135
Ah, my stomach.

426
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,470
My endless farting doesn't seem normal.

427
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,352
Isn't this too much?

428
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,937
What did I do?

429
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,439
It's because of the cat.

430
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,899
Quit it with the cat!

431
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,360
You're not the only one
with a stomachache. I have one, too.

432
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,904
If I relax just a bit,

433
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,490
I'll be on the verge of a disaster.

434
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,328
But I am holding myself together
because of basic decency.

435
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,331
Forget it. I'm not talking to you anymore.
Don't talk to me.

436
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,713
Why don't you just take a shit?
Just do it!

437
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,903
What do you keep staring at?
I can't concentrate.

438
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,905
You look so happy.

439
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,990
You look so happy when you're baking.

440
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,034
-Really?
-Yes.

441
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,121
Hyun-joon, was it your childhood dream
to become a pastry chef?

442
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,833
Yup! I always loved bread
ever since I was little.

443
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,253
I spent too much money on bread.

444
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,341
So I thought, maybe I should
just start baking it myself.

445
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,593
That's how I started.
And somehow I ended up here.

446
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,553
Stop joking.

447
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,473
What about you?

448
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,391
Was your dream being a pastry chef also?

449
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:18,271
No, I had another dream.
I've given up on that dream, though.

450
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,440
Really? What was it?

451
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,317
A rapper.

452
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,152
A rapper?

453
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,281
I thought my rap had an edge to it,

454
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,784
but apparently people don't get my swag.

455
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,120
Yoon-ah, a rapper...

456
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,287
I'm curious.

457
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,749
Really? Then would you like
to hear me rap?

458
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,501
I would be honored.

459
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,505
Then I'll try to freestyle about you.

460
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,972
A boy who liked bread

461
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,685
Hyun-joon loves bread
It tastes so good

462
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,021
Sausage roll, veggie roll

463
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,524
Red bean bun, cream puff!

464
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,692
Bang, bang!

465
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,818
Chew it well

466
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,997
What's taking them so long
to decide on a model?

467
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,875
I have no desire to be in a commercial.

468
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,543
They're wasting my time.

469
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,424
From the way I see it,
the director really seemed to like you.

470
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,760
Joon-ki, you better treat me out to a meal
if you get the job.

471
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,679
Sure.

472
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,310
FATHER

473
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,315
Yes, Father. What is it?

474
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,151
The commercial?

475
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,570
It hasn't been decided.

476
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,072
I'm waiting for the result.

477
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,783
There's no need to worry, Chairman Park.

478
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,536
We just decided on Jae-hyun.

479
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,538
Just a moment, Dad.

480
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,541
I assure you.

481
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,169
How could I possibly turn down
your favor?

482
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,422
I convinced the director to cast Jae-hyun,
so don't worry.

483
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,550
But don't forget about
the bag you promised.

484
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,054
I'll text you the exact name
of the model. Okay.

485
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,061
Yes, Dad.

486
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:25,023
I'm sorry, but would it okay
if I called you back later?

487
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,399
Yes.

488
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,076
My stomach is killing me.

489
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,036
I can barely breathe.

490
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,122
What if I end up shitting my pants
in front of Soo-ah?

491
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,124
I can't let that happen.

492
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,834
My stomach.

493
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,504
I think I've reached my limit.

494
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,423
Doo-sik's right here.
This is driving me crazy.

495
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,426
I have no other choice

496
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,095
but to jump out.

497
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,471
Doo-sik...

498
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,059
I'm sorry, but could you grab the wheel?

499
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,312
Huh? Okay.

500
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,778
Min Soo-ah, are you crazy?

501
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,906
Don't stop me. My stomach hurts so much,
I think I'm going to die.

502
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,534
So you're going to jump out?
You'll die if you jump out.

503
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,952
I don't care.

504
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,455
Whether I die from jumping or die
from shame from shitting in front of you,

505
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,249
either way, I'll end up dying.

506
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,042
It's better to die from jumping out.

507
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,086
What? Get ahold of yourself, Min Soo-ah!

508
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,548
Don't. Don't stop me!

509
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,144
It stopped...

510
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,396
right?

511
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,358
It stopped. We'll live.

512
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,445
-We survived, Soo-ah.
-Doo-sik!

513
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:58,992
Get off me!

514
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,494
-Tissue.
-What? Yes, tissue.

515
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,292
I found some!

516
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,251
I found some!

517
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,295
-Doo-sik, give me one sheet.
-Okay.

518
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,051
What? There's only one sheet?

519
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,600
Doo-sik...

520
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,730
No, I can't. I can't give this up.

521
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:33,234
This is... my last bastion
of my human rights.

522
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,403
Forgive me, Soo-ah.

523
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,364
I figured.

524
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,991
I wouldn't give it up either
if I were you.

525
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,202
I understand.

526
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,706
You don't need to feel guilty.

527
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,542
I'll figure something out.

528
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,172
I'll just find some waste paper somewhere.

529
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,174
Min Soo-ah!

530
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,976
-Doo-sik...
-Take it before I change my mind.

531
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,353
Hurry.

532
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,612
What are you going to do?

533
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,662
It's already too late for me.

534
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,165
So hurry and go.

535
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,458
And go as far as you can.

536
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,210
Far away.

537
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,514
Doo-sik, I'm sorry, but...

538
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,683
I have a favor to ask you.

539
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,813
Min Soo-ah...

540
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,025
I can't believe you.

541
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,238
How can you ask me to do such a thing?

542
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,408
How could you?

543
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,829
Doo-sik, now is the time!

544
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,135
Does Yoon-ah know what time it is?
Why isn't she home yet?

545
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:26,431
What is she doing
with that Song Hyun-joon character?

546
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,101
-Yoon-ah, you're--
-I'm back.

547
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,437
Dong-goo, how are you?

548
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,606
Not well.

549
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,319
Yoon-ah, why are you
coming home so late?

550
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,905
Do you know how behind we are
because you're late?

551
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,991
I'm sorry. I didn't realize the time.

552
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:49,204
Never mind. Go change
and clean up the kitchen.

553
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,288
Okay.

554
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,499
Hyun-joon, I'll see you in class.

555
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,418
Yoon-ah, here.

556
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,628
I almost forgot.

557
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,005
Thank you for the gift.

558
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,925
Don't mention it.
I got to hear your amazing rap.

559
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,968
I thought I'd give you
something in return.

560
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,721
Thank you. I'll make good use
of the mini oven.

561
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,806
See you in class?

562
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,982
-I'll get going, then.
-Hold on.

563
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,029
-Hyun-joon, we should talk.
-Sure. What would you like to talk about?

564
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,698
If Yoon-ah comes home late,

565
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,618
it greatly affects our business.

566
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,621
So going forward,
please have her come home early.

567
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,290
She's my employee.

568
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,042
You have no sense of ethics.

569
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,503
Are you that anxious?

570
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:40,964
What?

571
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,799
That's what it looks like to me.

572
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,260
I'm clearly at a disadvantage,

573
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,721
but seeing you this anxious
doesn't feel all that bad.

574
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,807
Rest up.

575
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,853
Wait a minute.
What do you mean by that?

576
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,105
Where are you going? We're not done.

577
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,358
What? Do I feel anxious?

578
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,195
Why would I be anxious?

579
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,364
I'm not anxious at all.

580
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,909
He's ridiculous.

581
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,667
Joon-ki, you're home.

582
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,378
What happened with the commercial?

583
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,591
I obviously

584
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,136
failed the audition, like always.

585
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,055
Why? You said it was almost finalized.

586
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,182
It just... turned out that way.

587
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,144
What do you mean? There must be a reason.

588
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,273
So, the thing is...

589
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,943
What? How could they do that?

590
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,445
Those jerks!

591
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,113
What can I do?

592
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,657
I have no connections nor money.
I just have to accept it.

593
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,784
Cheer up, Joon-ki.

594
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,953
I'm sure more opportunities
will come your way.

595
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,663
I'm fine.

596
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,166
I'm all right, but...

597
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,377
I'm worried my dad
will be disappointed.

598
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,005
He was so thrilled.

599
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,889
Have you been practicing driving
until now?

600
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,809
But why do you look like that?

601
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,853
Isn't that Soo-ah's dress?

602
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,396
Why are you wearing that?

603
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,399
Yeah. Doo-sik, where are you pants?

604
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,653
What happened?

605
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,404
Don't ask.

606
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,450
Don't ask us anything at all.

607
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,247
Soo-ah...

608
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,501
I'll wash this

609
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,878
and give it to you tomorrow.

610
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,216
No, it's fine. Keep it.

611
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,177
How could I possibly wear it?

612
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,096
You can have it.

613
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,059
I'm going to bed.

614
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:04,941
Joon-ki...

615
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,530
why don't we scrap Rebecca?

616
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,784
What are you saying?
Why would I scrap my Rebecca?

617
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,911
Don't ask me why.

618
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,330
Just do as I say.

619
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,291
It's for your sake.

620
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,256
Hey.

621
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,551
What are you talking about
dressed like a shaman?

622
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,474
Cheer up.

623
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,309
You'll get another contract.

624
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,228
That's right, Joon-ki.

625
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,939
Try some bread.

626
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,399
You haven't had breakfast.

627
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,736
No, I don't have an appetite.

628
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,491
Wait. Isn't that the commercial
you were going to shoot?

629
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,330
It is. Colombia Espresso.

630
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,291
-Right?
-I don't know.

631
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,168
I don't want to see it.

632
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,253
I'm going to go rest.

633
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,215
-Wait, what is that?
-It's morning in Colombia

634
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,093
and the coffee beans wake up
with a smile

635
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,596
as fresh as morning dew.

636
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,478
Emma roasts freshly-picked
coffee beans every morning.

637
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,899
It brings out flavors

638
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,026
as abundant as the
colors of the rainbow.

639
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,613
The coffee melts with a sound

640
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,824
as sweet as sunshine in spring.

641
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,329
Enjoy a relaxing cup of coffee
every morning.

642
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,790
Colombia Espresso.

643
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,334
What was that? It's so cheesy.

644
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,835
-What was that?
-Seriously.

645
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,879
I'm embarrassed just watching it.

646
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,839
It's a good thing
you didn't do the commercial.

647
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,424
What was that?

648
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,096
So he played dirty to shoot that?

649
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,598
Exactly. How humiliating.

650
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,267
Why? It's the most handsome
coffee bean I've ever seen.

651
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,977
He has a smile as fresh as morning dew,

652
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,938
and expressions
like the colors of the rainbow,

653
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,441
and a voice as soft
as morning sunshine.

654
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,860
Now you're smiling.

655
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,112
You happy?

656
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,824
My appetite is suddenly back.

657
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,368
So delicious!

658
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,912
It melts in your mouth.

659
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,498
My goodness.

660
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,876
Here. Eat up.

661
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,045
It's melting in my mouth.

662
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,238
Hey, what are you doing?

663
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,369
It's been 49 days since Olivia passed.

664
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,372
My poor Olivia.

665
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,500
I hope her suffering is over.

666
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,586
Hey, Dong-goo?

667
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,423
You know you're as crazy as I am?

668
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,343
How can you say that?
You're the one who killed her!

669
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,513
I'll buy you a better one
when I make money.

670
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,391
And when will that happen?
When?

671
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,769
I want to shoot movies
and don't even have a camera.

672
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,899
If I had even a cheap camera,
I'd be able to forget about Olivia.

673
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,318
It's not like
this is going to bring her back.

674
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,696
That's not why I'm doing this!

675
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,573
Joon-ki, I came up
with something amazing.

676
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,617
-It's incredible!
-Something amazing?

677
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,785
-What is it?
-Wanna see? Follow me!

678
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,454
-What is it?
-Shut up!

679
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,914
I'm holding a memorial service.

680
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,543
LEE JOON-KI

681
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,505
BONG DOO-SIK

682
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,030
Three point eight seconds!

683
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,282
Incredible. It's a new record!

684
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,745
Move. Let me try. It's my turn.

685
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,717
Here I go.

686
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,689
What are you doing?

687
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,862
Is it skeleton this time?

688
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,492
It's not exactly skeleton.
We call it "sheleleton."

689
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,327
-Doo-sik came up with--
-Be quiet!

690
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,496
Do you realize how childish this is?

691
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,040
-Do you know how old you are?
-Thirty-one.

692
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,667
You're not a child! What are you doing?

693
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,295
I'm sorry.

694
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,342
You didn't forget we're meeting
my friend today, did you?

695
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,470
-That's today?
-You forgot?

696
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,097
Go get ready!

697
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,224
Okay, I will.

698
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,693
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I THINK ABOUT IT

699
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,030
How is it?

700
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,825
I was here recently,
and the food was good.

701
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,827
It's so delicious.

702
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,580
-Thank you for bringing us.
-Don't mention it.

703
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:57,376
Seo-jin has been bragging so much
about her boyfriend.

704
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,754
But you're just as great as I had heard.

705
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,671
Thank you.

706
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,507
I get that a lot.

707
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,886
You're funny, too.

708
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,512
You're lucky.

709
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,181
Yeah...

710
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,976
Right. Ji-young's boyfriend here
is a potter.

711
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,561
A potter?

712
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,313
So you're an artist.

713
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,107
Please come by my studio sometime.

714
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,193
-I'll show you around.
-Sure.

715
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,986
That'd be great.

716
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,113
I heard you're an actor.

717
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,075
You're in Newsroom these days, right?

718
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,284
Yes.

719
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,287
What other shows have you been in?

720
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,374
Do you recognize this?

721
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,044
-Octopus ink...
-Octopus ink...

722
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,962
gun!

723
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,635
That's a children's show.

724
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,470
You were so funny in that one, too.

725
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,347
No, I wasn't.

726
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,266
I'm not that funny.
You got me wrong.

727
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,022
That's hilarious.

728
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,567
Would you like to see another one?

729
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,951
You're so funny!

730
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,872
Seo-jin! What's wrong?

731
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,166
Did I do something wrong?

732
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,835
You don't know?

733
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,628
What did I...

734
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,380
What's the matter with you?

735
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,007
Why are you acting like a fool
in front of my friend?

736
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,678
I was just trying to break the ice.

737
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,596
Why do you have to do that?

738
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,514
Are you a clown?

739
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,350
Why is everything a joke to you?

740
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,768
Can't you be more mature?

741
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,229
Sorry.

742
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,440
I'll be more careful from now on.

743
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,443
That's not enough.
Just stop it altogether.

744
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,446
Stop it altogether?

745
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,781
I'm not sure about that...

746
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,160
I'll only do it at home. How about that?

747
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,956
All right, all right. I'll stop.

748
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,001
I'll stop joking around. You happy now?

749
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,795
Are you being serious?

750
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:05,963
You promised.

751
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,966
Okay.

752
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,095
You're so cute.

753
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,107
It fits!

754
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,736
I can't believe it. It fits!

755
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,321
What is this?

756
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,281
Why are you guys coming in together?

757
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,784
We ran into each other out front.

758
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,286
Y-yeah.

759
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,498
-Really?
-Yeah!

760
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,875
Joon-ki!

761
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,878
What took you so long?
I've been waiting for you.

762
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,588
Let's play another round
of sheleleton.

763
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,423
Sheleleton?

764
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,217
Sounds like fun!

765
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,179
My throat hurts.

766
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,897
Doo-sik, I'm sorry, but...
I don't think I can play anymore.

767
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,191
What? Why?

768
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,070
Anyway, I'm not going to do things
like that anymore.

769
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,280
You can play by yourself.

770
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,160
Joon-ki! Joon-ki?

771
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,579
Why are you being like this?

772
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,830
What's wrong?

773
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,844
Yoon-ah, you're still here.

774
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,847
I just wanted to finish these.

775
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,308
I see. By the way,

776
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,978
I have something to give you.

777
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,854
Here.

778
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,024
What's this?

779
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,194
It's the revenue from your muffins.
It's not much, though.

780
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,322
What are you doing? Take it.

781
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,577
I'm not sure if I can take this.

782
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,037
You earned it.
Of course you can take it.

783
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,331
Go on.

784
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,375
My arm's going to fall off.

785
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,002
The envelop is falling.

786
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,756
Thank you.

787
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,675
Thank you so much.

788
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,853
Just one round?

789
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,277
I'm not going to.

790
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,195
Are you really going to be like this?

791
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,323
Why are you like this
all of a sudden?

792
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,284
I'm not going to play games
like this anymore.

793
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,830
You've changed!

794
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,594
-I'm home.
-Hi, Yoon-ah.

795
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,096
What is all this?

796
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,684
I got my first payment for my muffins,
so I bought a few things for you guys.

797
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,619
What do you think?
Do you like them?

798
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,914
Of course.

799
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,499
I want to wear this every day.

800
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,714
I've been wanting an elephant hat.

801
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:36,840
Thank you.

802
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,093
Yeah.

803
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,721
I was looking for a princess mirror
like this one.

804
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,931
How did you know?

805
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,600
I really like this, too.

806
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,352
But what is it?

807
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,938
What do I use it for? Blush?

808
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,149
It's a shaving brush
for applying shaving cream.

809
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,651
Shaving brush?

810
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,570
It's made from badger fur.

811
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,948
I heard it works really well.

812
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,409
Really?

813
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,662
I'm so excited thinking
about putting on shaving cream

814
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,038
with badger fur.

815
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,750
I knew you would like it.

816
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,628
Truthfully, I'm really good
at choosing gifts.

817
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,842
Is Dong-goo still in his room?

818
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,469
I bought him something, too.

819
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,474
What do you think?
Do you like it?

820
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,518
Huh?

821
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,439
Of course. I love chicks.

822
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,315
That's why I rarely eat chicken.

823
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,194
Of course. I knew you'd like it.

824
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,655
Dong-goo, are you free tomorrow?

825
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,657
Tomorrow? Why?

826
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:48,537
I have so much to thank you for,
so I wanted to treat you to a meal.

827
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,496
A meal?

828
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,250
You don't need to.

829
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,377
When and where
do you want to meet?

830
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,597
This is so embarrassing.

831
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,850
I look like an elementary school student.

832
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,938
But she gave it to me.
I couldn't not wear it.

833
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,444
-Dong-goo.
-Hey.

834
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,779
Sorry I'm a bit late.

835
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,284
You wore the shirt!

836
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,746
Yeah, I love it so much,
I had to wear it today.

837
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,165
What should we go eat?

838
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,249
Wait.

839
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,836
That's strange. Why isn't he here yet?

840
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,006
What? Someone else is coming?

841
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,008
Yoon-ah.

842
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,302
Hyun-joon.

843
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:56,939
Why are you...?

844
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,482
Why are you here?

845
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,235
I was on my way to meet Dong-goo

846
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,987
when Hyun-joon called
asking to have lunch.

847
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,032
So I thought it'd be great
for all of us to have lunch together.

848
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,868
-Sure.
-Well, sure.

849
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,787
Where did you get that shirt?

850
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,166
I liked it so much,
I gave it to him as a gift, too.

851
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,752
But I didn't know you would wear it
at the same time.

852
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,505
You both must really like it.

853
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,676
Of course.

854
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,929
You can't imagine
how much we like it.

855
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,265
Then should we go eat?

856
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,016
-Sure.
-Okay.

857
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,811
Why would you wear that out?

858
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,029
What are you doing?

859
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,782
We need to talk.

860
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,409
Let go of me.

861
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,040
Gosh, why are you holding on to me?
People are watching.

862
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:01,128
Why did you sit next to Yoon-ah?

863
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,754
I just sat down.

864
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,715
One of us has to sit there.

865
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,593
But why does it get to be you?

866
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,177
What do you want to do about it?

867
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,222
Hyun-joon, we may be enemies,

868
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,225
but let's play fair like men.

869
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,860
I'm buying today, so eat up.

870
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,944
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

871
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,785
I'm getting a call.
Excuse me. I'll take this outside.

872
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,078
-Huh?
-What?

873
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,041
This must look weird.

874
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,133
How humiliating.

875
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,929
Can you back off?

876
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,181
It's cramped here.

877
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,183
Do your best.

878
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,105
When I created this, I was inspired by...

879
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,317
-the famous potter, Peter Voulkos.
-Really?

880
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,862
I wanted to create a Korean version
of his abstract pottery.

881
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,280
I see.

882
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,825
-Would you like to see that one, too?
-Sure.

883
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,746
Seo-jin, doesn't this remind you
of Uhm Jung-hwa?

884
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,289
-Put them down.
-Yes, ma'am.

885
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,376
I told you to stop fooling around.

886
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,294
Sorry.

887
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,494
What are you doing?

888
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,331
Just...

889
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,334
it's not fun playing alone.

890
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,379
I want to play sheleleton.

891
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,757
Do you want me to play?

892
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,510
Really?

893
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,778
What do you think? I'm great, right?
Shall I do it again?

894
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:35,073
No, it's fine. That's enough.

895
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,200
It's no fun with you.

896
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,161
What? Why?

897
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,247
You don't possess that...

898
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,500
spirit Joon-ki has.

899
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,669
What? "Spirit"?

900
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,088
Why do you need "spirit"
playing this stupid game?

901
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,175
What? Stupid game?

902
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,760
Is that what you think?

903
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,596
W-what?

904
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,347
Forget it.

905
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,433
That's why you're impossible.

906
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,021
What? Seriously?

907
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:09,274
I did him a favor because he was bored.

908
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,782
How was the food?

909
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,992
It was delicious.

910
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,328
It would've been even better
without someone.

911
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,832
It was delicious.

912
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,834
I feel the same way.

913
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,131
A bike.

914
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,134
Looks fun.

915
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,261
Do you want to ride a bike?

916
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,014
Watching them makes me
want to ride one, too.

917
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,641
-Then--
-Let's go biking, then.

918
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,060
I'll rent them.

919
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,780
Here, Hyun-joon.

920
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,574
-Let's go.
-Okay.

921
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,374
Why am I riding a one-person bike?

922
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,919
That's all they had left.
What can I do?

923
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:14,714
So you're saying that you'll ride
the two-person bike with Yoon-ah?

924
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:18,385
-That's right.
-You said let's play fair like men.

925
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,679
What do you want to do, then?

926
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,894
Was this necessary?

927
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:33,733
You're the one who insisted we play fair.

928
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,901
Forget it.

929
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,319
Just step on the pedals.

930
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,826
This is so embarrassing.

931
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,415
What are you doing?

932
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,001
Why are you leaning your head
on my back?

933
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,004
-Let's just go.
-People will get the wrong idea.

934
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,589
You're a strange man.

935
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,008
-Jeez.
-Just go.

936
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,264
Thank you for inviting us today.

937
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,765
It was wonderful.

938
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,934
I'll invite you to the next exhibition,
so please come.

939
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,394
Of course.

940
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,854
Invite us, and we're there.

941
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,106
How is it working as a reporter?

942
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,066
It's crazy.

943
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,194
I had no idea that being a reporter
was so hard.

944
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,572
-Is it that hard?
-Yeah.

945
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,949
By the way, how long have you two dated?

946
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,380
Goodness.

947
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,885
-What's wrong?
-My tooth...

948
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,094
What's wrong with your tooth?

949
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,309
Did you tooth fall out?

950
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,648
It's not a tooth.

951
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,693
It's a pine nut.
A pine nut!

952
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,029
Oh, my gosh!

953
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,449
-You scared me.
-You're so funny.

954
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,576
It was funny, right?

955
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,328
It's not a tooth. It's a pine nut.

956
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,621
Isn't it funny?

957
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,165
Pine nut.

958
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,251
What's going on?

959
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,462
Why are you smiling?

960
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,468
Oh, it's nothing.

961
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,595
I feel loved.

962
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,264
I'm jealous, but I'm loved, too.

963
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,270
It's so refreshing.

964
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,817
Isn't it so nice to ride bikes
and have beer?

965
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,110
Right.

966
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,321
It would've been better without someone.

967
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,994
Let's ride bikes and have beer
together more often...

968
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,328
Okay.

969
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,331
...just the two of us.

970
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,793
Excuse me. I'm just going to go
to the restroom.

971
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,336
Sure.

972
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,555
Thank you all for coming out tonight.

973
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,932
Does everyone know

974
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,560
today is our store's
one-year anniversary?

975
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,811
Yes!

976
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,897
So, as promised,

977
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,608
we'll start our couples event

978
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,736
with amazing prizes!

979
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,322
Jeez. It's so loud.

980
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,742
What kind of event is this at a bar?

981
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,953
I know. I just wanted
to drink beer in peace.

982
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,205
The winner of today's

983
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,957
couples event

984
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,421
receives a new DSLR camera!

985
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,216
The prize... is a camera?

986
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,387
Those who would like to participate,
please come up.

987
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,682
I must participate.

988
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,518
Where's Yoon-ah?
Why isn't she back yet?

989
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,605
Why? Are you going to participate
with Yoon-ah as a couple?

990
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:02,901
Yes, I really need a camera.

991
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,194
But that's cheating.

992
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,404
How dare you participate
in a couples event with Yoon-ah?

993
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,782
But this doesn't mean anything.

994
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,450
It's for the camera!

995
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,035
Please understand this for once.

996
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:16,289
We'll wait 30 more seconds
for any more participants.

997
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,000
She's not back yet.
What do I do?

998
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:19,918
She won't come back.

999
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,049
Hold on.

1000
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,134
What?

1001
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,136
Why are you looking at me like that?

1002
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,598
Hyun-joon, will you participate
in the couples event with me?

1003
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,350
What?

1004
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,769
Are you insane? That's ridiculous.

1005
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,146
Are you going to be like this?

1006
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,484
I know we're enemies,
but you can still do this for me.

1007
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,947
But this makes no sense.

1008
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,907
I need that camera.

1009
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,535
I really need it.

1010
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,786
Okay, ten.

1011
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,705
Nine.

1012
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,376
-But this is...
-Eight!

1013
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,877
Fine.

1014
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,505
-Seven.
-Next time we ride bikes...

1015
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,590
-Six.
-I'll let you ride

1016
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,883
the two-person bike with Yoon-ah.

1017
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,053
-Really? Can I sit next to her, too?
-Five.

1018
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,179
-What?
-Four.

1019
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,431
-Aren't you being too greedy?
-Forget it, then.

1020
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,766
Three.

1021
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,769
Fine, but only if we win.

1022
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,854
-Two.
-I'm in.

1023
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,564
One.

1024
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:23,940
We're in!

1025
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,570
The couple that lasts the longest

1026
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,739
will win the new DSLR camera.

1027
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:32,824
Hold on.

1028
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,325
Hold on.

1029
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,829
-Are you okay, Hyun-joon?
-Yes.

1030
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,080
I'm okay.

1031
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,667
I'll hold on even if I die,
so stay strong, Dong-goo.

1032
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,377
Yes.

1033
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,005
I'll hold on even if my legs break.

1034
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,966
-Let's go!
-Let's do it!

1035
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,019
-Dong-goo, let me wipe your sweat.
-Thank you.

1036
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,190
-Let's win.
-Come on!

1037
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,400
-We can do it.
-We can do it.

1038
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,863
Where is everyone?

1039
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,699
I'm hungry.

1040
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,034
Do you want some ramyun?

1041
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,911
I have no appetite.

1042
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,747
I'm going to bed.

1043
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,291
Oh... okay...

1044
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,838
Joon-ki!

1045
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,093
Let's do it.

1046
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,135
BONG DOO-SIK

1047
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,054
Three point eight seconds!

1048
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,514
Incredible! It's a new record!

1049
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:21,641
Five secs.

1050
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,811
Five secs. Five secs!

1051
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,604
Do you want me to feed you?

1052
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,607
-Kiss me, Joon-ki.
-Oh, my God.

1053
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,532
-I'm so sorry.
-Excuse me.

1054
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,244
What are we doing?
How long do we have to do this?

1055
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,037
It's okay. Don't worry.

1056
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,040
Why are you crying?
Think positively.

1057
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,587
This is amazing!

1058
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,088
My goodness.

1059
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,205
What's wrong with him?

1060
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,459
Dong-goo is completely worn out.

1061
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,918
Worn out?

1062
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,253
From what?

1063
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,505
It just happened.

1064
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,217
Yoon-ah, I'm going to lay him down.

1065
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,887
Okay. I'll bring up some water.

1066
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,641
All right. Gosh.

1067
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,519
Why is he so heavy?

1068
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,984
Matilda.

1069
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,570
-Matilda.
-If you're Matilda, I'm Leon.

1070
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:02,116
What are you doing? Leave.

1071
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,953
You shouldn't be like this.

1072
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:10,249
I carried you up here
and helped you win a camera.

1073
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,920
The least you can do is thank me.

1074
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,881
Why should I thank you?

1075
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,801
It was my first date with Yoon-ah

1076
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,887
and you messed it all up.

1077
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,639
Ditto.

1078
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:28,351
You're unbelievable. Seriously.

1079
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,977
Tell me, Yoon-ah.

1080
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,979
Tell me.

1081
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,525
What's going on here?

1082
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,111
They're like newlyweds.

1083
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,154
When did they get so close?

1084
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,412
Gosh.

1085
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,457
Dong-goo's still sleeping?

1086
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,752
He and Hyun-joon
are still sleeping, cuddling.

1087
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,464
They may even become besties,

1088
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,008
even though that's impossible.

1089
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,760
Why not? What do you mean?

1090
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,263
Huh? It's nothing.

1091
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,892
Joon-ki, you should eat. Have a seat.

1092
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,102
Sure.

1093
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,274
Doo-sik--

1094
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,826
What's wrong with your face?
Are you sick?

1095
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,161
You don't look good.

1096
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,204
I agree. Is something wrong?

1097
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,499
No, I'm okay.

1098
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,258
Joon-ki! What's wrong?

1099
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,760
Wake up!

1100
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,557
We ran tests, and his liver somatic index
and blood pressure are high.

1101
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,350
All his test results are not good.

1102
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,936
But the strange thing is that
we can't find what caused this.

1103
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,773
What? What do you mean
you don't know what caused this?

1104
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,859
A person who was perfectly fine
yesterday can't get ill this fast.

1105
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,862
The only cause could be extreme stress.

1106
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:07,366
Has Mr. Lee experienced
tremendous shock recently?

1107
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,494
Well... I can think of one thing.

1108
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:10,661
What is it?

1109
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,832
He really likes to joke around,
but I told him not to.

1110
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:18,211
Now that I think about it,
that's when he became really quiet

1111
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,462
and lost energy.

1112
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,506
That must be the cause of his stress.

1113
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,715
Excuse me?

1114
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,302
How can someone get sick
from not being able to joke around?

1115
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:29,514
It's not common,
but it seems to be the only cause.

1116
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,141
Maybe to him, joking around

1117
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,227
is everything to him.

1118
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,145
Everything to him?

1119
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,855
Joking around?

1120
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,070
Hey, you're back.

1121
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:49,784
What did he say? Am I really sick?

1122
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,245
Yes, you might die.

1123
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,413
What?

1124
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,958
It's incurable?

1125
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,168
There's no hope even with surgery?

1126
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,213
No. You'll get better
if you joke around again.

1127
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,591
Huh? What are you talking about?

1128
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,344
You're sick because I told you
not to joke around.

1129
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:11,764
So you can joke around
as much as you want.

1130
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,725
Really? Can I?

1131
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,645
If not, you might die.
What else can I do?

1132
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,731
So do as you want!

1133
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,568
Thanks, Seo-jin. Thanks so much.

1134
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,779
But there's one thing

1135
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,824
I've been wanting to do. Can I?

1136
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,659
Sure! Go ahead.

1137
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:32,869
Yes!

1138
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,333
Seo-jin, look at this!
Don't I look like I'm flying?

1139
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,423
Try it on the other side.

1140
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,311
Have some.

1141
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,771
You haven't eaten anything all day.

1142
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,983
It's fine. I don't feel like eating.

1143
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,819
What's up with you lately?
Is something wrong?

1144
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,279
I don't know.

1145
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,491
I have no energy
and I don't feel like eating either.

1146
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:15,703
Doo-sik!

1147
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,251
Joon-ki!

1148
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,255
Doo-sik, I'm so sorry
for what I put you through.

1149
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,632
You must have been angry at me.

1150
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,636
What is this? Are you back now?

1151
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,721
-Are you back to the Joon-ki I know?
-Huh?

1152
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,351
Are you sure?

1153
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,144
Are you sure?

1154
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,938
Yes!

1155
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:45,316
Doo-sik, let's make up
for all the games we missed.

1156
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:46,776
Let's do this!

1157
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,446
Let's do it!

1158
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,198
By the way...

1159
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,617
I upgraded our sheleleton cart.

1160
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:56,744
You want to try it?

1161
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,081
Let's do this!

1162
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,791
Upgrade! Let's do it!

1163
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,794
-If it's with you...
-If it's with you...

1164
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,879
Oh, right. I forgot
I wanted to give you this--

1165
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,262
LEE JOON-KI

1166
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,765
BONG DOO-SIK

1167
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:23,562
Let's go.

1168
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:42,164
Did you see how they all fell down?
It's called "Cart Strike."

1169
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,166
You get the highest point with this.

1170
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,711
If you succeed twice,
it's a double strike.

1171
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,629
If you succeed three times, it's a turkey!

1172
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,965
It's so organized. It's amazing.

1173
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,383
-I want to try!
-Come here.

1174
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,555
Here. It's your turn.

1175
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:59,515
I'm going to set up the pins.

1176
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,808
Go get ready.

1177
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,059
Thanks!

1178
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:10,109
Soo-ah, why are guys like this?

1179
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,614
They don't understand
why we're so crazy about shopping.

1180
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,784
Just stop trying to understand.

1181
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,204
Let's see it.

1182
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,822
I said I would do it.
Why did you offer to help me shave?

1183
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,075
-I didn't do it on purpose!
-Are you finished?

1184
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,326
What?

1185
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,328
Let's just break up, then!

1186
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,163
Sure! Fine! Let's break up!

1187
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,083
-It was a joke!
-A joke?

1188
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,002
-Come on in.
-It's a nice and cute.

1189
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,754
What's that smell?

1190
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,214
Aren't those Philip's shoes?

1191
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:16,675
That rotten smell is from Philip's feet?

1192
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,428
-Do we really have to go with this guy?
-Two, three!

1193
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:23,682
Didn't I say that I don't want
to inconvenience you one bit?

1194
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,434
Yoon-ah, are you free this weekend?

1195
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,686
I have something to tell you.

1196
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,107
-What? Hyun-joon.
-Why are you here?

1197
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,275
-Could you lend me some money?
-What's wrong?

1198
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,860
Yoon-ah was in an accident.

1199
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,154
I'll get the money right away.
Follow me.
