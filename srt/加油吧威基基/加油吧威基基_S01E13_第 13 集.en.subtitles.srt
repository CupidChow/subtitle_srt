1
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,905
Doo-sik!

2
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,156
Sweep, Doo-sik!

3
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,199
Sweep!

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,076
Dong-goo! Go!

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,369
-Sweep!
-Go!

6
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,080
Sweep!

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,040
Go!

8
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:22,957
Go--

9
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,544
What are you doing?

10
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,755
It's curling this time?

11
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,175
I told you guys to clean.
What the hell are you guys doing?

12
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,510
We were cleaning.

13
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,386
Why not make it fun?

14
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,015
We didn't want to, but Joon-ki made us.

15
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,184
What? Joon-ki made you?

16
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,896
Even so, you shouldn't tattle on him.

17
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,689
You're so petty.

18
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,982
What? Petty?

19
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,235
Hey, Seo-jin.

20
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,694
Why are you taking Joon-ki's side?

21
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,656
When did I take his side?

22
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,657
Gosh.

23
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,700
What? Petty?

24
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,835
I have to go to a table read.

25
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,798
Go!

26
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
Hey, Doo-sik, aren't the two of them
acting suspicious?

27
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,386
What do you mean?

28
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,306
What, are you suggesting that Seo-jin
and Joon-ki are dating or something?

29
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,270
-That doesn't make any sense.
-You're right.

30
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,564
Joon-ki can do better.

31
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,649
Are you crazy? Do you want to die?

32
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,567
SECRETLY, GREATLY

33
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,696
I'm so sick of this.

34
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,865
I really need to work on my web fiction.

35
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,950
Doo-sik!

36
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,785
Why are you making a fuss?

37
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,663
I found something I can really be good at.

38
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,706
Take a look.

39
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,584
Soorgio Armhany?

40
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,751
A business plan?

41
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,879
I'm going to start
an online shopping mall.

42
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,755
Soorgio Armhany Mall.

43
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,424
In short, it's Soo-ah Mall.

44
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,718
I've given it some thought,

45
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,304
and I think have to work in fashion.

46
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,056
So you want to start a business?

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,974
Do you have funds?

48
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,393
I do. I got an investment from Soo-bong

49
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,394
since he'd just gotten paid.

50
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,814
Please don't. It's not easy
to run a business, you know.

51
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,900
And how will you do this alone?

52
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,152
I'm not doing it alone.
You're doing it with me.

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,194
What? Me?

54
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,654
When, where, why and how?

55
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,448
Do you want to work part-time
at a convenience store

56
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,199
or be director of a shopping site?

57
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,659
Director?

58
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,995
I'm the director?

59
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,455
How much will I get paid?

60
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,666
-Three...
-Thirty million won a year?

61
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,960
No, three thousand an hour.

62
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,006
Hey. Minimum wage is 7,530 won these days.

63
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,591
What? 3,000 an hour?

64
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,301
Okay, fine. I'll give in.

65
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,221
Then I'll pay you 3,500 won. Happy?

66
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,057
Director Bong, come with me.
We have tons to work on.

67
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,184
No, I don't want to. I won't do it!

68
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,977
-I won't, you queen of exploitation!
-Come!

69
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,895
Hey!

70
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,190
I just got done with work,
so I'll head to the studio.

71
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,818
Okay. See you later, Hyun-joon. Bye.

72
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,115
I'm interested in Yoon-ah.

73
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,742
I like her.

74
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,620
Are you going to the studio?

75
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,622
Yes, I have something to work on.

76
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,999
I see. Are you done cleaning?

77
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,835
I noticed the third floor is a bit messy.

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,047
The third floor? I vacuumed and mopped
the floors earlier.

79
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,800
Really? I noticed some water stains on
the top right corner above the bathtub

80
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,760
in the bathroom on the second floor.
Did you clean that?

81
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,887
I did. I wiped down from the top right

82
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,181
to the bottom left corners
with bleach earlier.

83
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,808
Did you now?

84
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,270
Okay, then how about the pool table?
In the four o'clock--

85
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,814
You mean the dust in the pockets
in the four o'clock position?

86
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,940
I cleaned it with a rag

87
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,567
and I even waxed the balls and cue sticks.

88
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,280
-Go then.
-I'll see you later.

89
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,666
She's become meticulous.
It's like she has a PhD in cleaning.

90
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,877
She can't keep spending time
with that asshole.

91
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,130
It's killing me.

92
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,885
I can't believe we're almost home already.

93
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,471
Why? Is my Bacca upset?

94
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,639
Bacca?

95
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,057
Your pet name.

96
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,769
You're my girlfriend now. It'd be wrong
to keep calling you Chewbacca.

97
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,815
So I was debating between Chew and Bacca

98
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,067
and decided that Bacca sounds cute.

99
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,112
How about "Ha-Hu"? Short for

100
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,030
Hairy from Huam-dong?

101
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,742
I don't like any of them,
but it's up to you

102
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,785
as long as it's not Ha-Hu.

103
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,454
Bacca it is!

104
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,955
But Joon-ki,

105
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,874
how long do we have to keep this a secret?

106
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,751
Can't we tell Dong-goo the truth?

107
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,795
What? You know he has a temper.

108
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,175
If he finds out, he'll beat me to death.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,429
So just for a while, okay?

110
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,430
Okay.

111
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,100
Are you just going to go in?

112
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,810
How else should we go in?

113
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,979
You want to do cartwheels?
Or crawl inside?

114
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,814
No, not that...

115
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,526
What...

116
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,529
-Oh, a kiss?
-Yes!

117
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,489
But...

118
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,241
-here?
-Yes!

119
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,827
What if someone sees us?

120
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,663
There's no one around. Who's going to see?

121
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,250
Okay, okay.

122
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,503
Naughty little Bacca, you.

123
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,962
Come here.

124
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,429
What the hell do they think they're doing?

125
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,518
Wait, I know that face.

126
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,646
Hey! Kang Seo-jin!

127
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,359
It's you, right?

128
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,361
What are you doing?

129
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,238
It's Dong-goo, isn't it?

130
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,906
What do we do?

131
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,826
Who the hell are you?
Stay right there, you punk.

132
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,536
Shit.

133
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,288
Look at you.
Where do you think you're going?

134
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,623
No, that's not it.

135
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,874
What's not it?

136
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,178
What the hell?

137
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,602
What a piece of work.

138
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,313
Wait.

139
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,985
I know I've seen that red coat before.

140
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,616
What? Don't tell me...

141
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,785
You!

142
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,954
-You're wrong.
-You!

143
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,961
Seo-jin, tell me the truth.

144
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,255
That guy in the park.
It was Joon-ki, right?

145
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,757
I told you it's not him.

146
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,842
Bullshit!

147
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,845
Joon-ki has the exact same coat!

148
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,431
I knew something was up

149
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,266
when you started shaving regularly.

150
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
It's really not him.

151
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,937
Then who is he? Who the hell is he?

152
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,355
Well...

153
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,691
I have a boyfriend.

154
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,401
What? Boyfriend?

155
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,487
Then why did he run away from me?

156
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,822
That's because...

157
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,241
You were yelling like a maniac!
You scared him off.

158
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,703
Nope. You're acting suspiciously.

159
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,623
Something smells very fishy here.

160
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,586
Yes, Director! Of course.

161
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,172
Yeah, I just got in.

162
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,550
Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

163
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,596
What is it?
Why are you looking at me like that?

164
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,764
Be honest with me.

165
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,684
You're the guy that was kissing
Seo-jin in the park, right?

166
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,936
What's this nonsense?

167
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,980
I was at rehearsal all day
and I only just got home.

168
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,942
Hold on. Seo-jin was kissing someone?

169
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,443
Who was it? Gross!

170
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,819
-Stop acting.
-What?

171
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,364
He was wearing the exact same red coat
as you!

172
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,410
What, so every person wearing a red coat
is going out with Seo-jin?

173
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,247
Besides, why would I ever
go out with a girl

174
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,958
who's got a temper like she does
and has more facial hair than me? Gross!

175
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,294
So this is how you'll play, huh? Fine.

176
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,672
Hey, bring him here.

177
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,633
Bring your boyfriend home.

178
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,678
-What?
-Why? You can't, right?

179
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,806
That's because your boyfriend is Joon-ki!
Am I wrong?

180
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,848
Goodness.

181
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,267
Seo-jin, bring him home!

182
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,935
-What?
-Bring him home

183
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,438
and prove to Dong-goo that
there's nothing going on between us!

184
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,566
Call him, okay?

185
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,944
Oh... Okay.

186
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,196
Fine, I'll bring him.

187
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,156
Will you, now?

188
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,618
Great. Let's wait and see what happens.

189
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,833
Joon-ki, are you here?

190
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,961
I'm here.

191
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,755
Are you all right?

192
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,510
Blood! You're bleeding!

193
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,813
No worries, man.

194
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,652
I think my organs were damaged

195
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,488
when I was hit by that car earlier.

196
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,700
At least Dong-goo didn't catch us.

197
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,910
Do you have to go this far?

198
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,120
Can't we just tell him?

199
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,332
Who knows? He may give us his blessing.

200
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,585
Hey. If I had a sister, I wouldn't let her
date a guy like me either.

201
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,129
You think he'll give us his blessing?

202
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,007
-Dream on.
-Jeez.

203
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,135
Why'd you tell me to bring my boyfriend?
How will I do that?

204
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,303
Don't worry.

205
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,181
I'll get one of my actor friends to do it.

206
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,350
It worked out.

207
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,102
We can take this opportunity to have him
meet your fake boyfriend,

208
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
so Dong-goo can relax
and we can date in peace.

209
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,980
Don't you think?

210
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,733
Well, I guess...

211
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,778
Don't worry.

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,114
Bacca can just trust me.

213
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,200
Okay?

214
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,827
What are you two doing?

215
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,876
You're so ugly! So very ugly!

216
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,796
How can you be so ugly?

217
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,049
Goodness, this face
with all your facial hair.

218
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,093
I wonder who you'll end up with.

219
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,307
Your ugly face just woke me right up.

220
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,480
Hold on.

221
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,943
What is it?

222
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,990
I'm saying this just in case.

223
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,994
If anything ever happens with my sister,

224
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:51,961
that's the day
you'll be attending your own funeral.

225
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,422
Understood?

226
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,554
Don't worry. That'll never happen.

227
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,438
Understood?

228
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,656
There's definitely something going on.

229
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,033
Especially that kiss between them.

230
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,245
I guess I'll find out today.

231
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:32,501
If Seo-jin's boyfriend ends up being
Joon-ki, then I'll...

232
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,758
Dong-goo, I'm off to the studio.

233
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,051
Again?

234
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,512
There's a lot to do here. Don't you think
you're going there too often?

235
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,055
It's all done.

236
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,725
There were piles of laundry in the
laundry room. Have they been washed?

237
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,977
They've been washed
and hung on the drying rack.

238
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,605
I saw a stain on the upper left corner
of a pillowcase in the guestroom upstairs.

239
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,899
I changed all the pillowcases
and washed them this morning

240
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,984
and I even sterilized them.

241
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,570
-The third floor. How about the--
-Curtain in the rec room?

242
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,238
I washed the curtains and hung them.

243
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,199
Oh, really?

244
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,577
On the rooftop,
next to the third railing--

245
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,495
The guesthouse flag?

246
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,748
I washed it, ironed it and hung it again.

247
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,418
-Go then.
-Thanks. See you later.

248
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,006
She's become meticulous.

249
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,799
She's too sharp.

250
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,426
When did she do all that?

251
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,887
This is really bothering me.

252
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,680
Song Hyun-joon, you bastard!

253
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,189
Look at you.

254
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,531
Director Bong!

255
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,035
Goodness. Why are you yelling?

256
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,248
Your boss hasn't slept a wink because she
was running around Dongdaemun all night.

257
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,457
And you're sleeping during work hours?

258
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,919
I haven't slept for a few days
because I was working on the website.

259
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,921
Forget it. Do we have any orders?

260
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,132
You and I are the only two people
who know this website exists.

261
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,718
So how will anyone place an order?

262
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,096
What do we do then?

263
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,098
How can we advertise?

264
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,226
Getting some air-time is the best form
of marketing,

265
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,644
but it's no easy task.

266
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,896
Air-time?

267
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,482
Air-time, you say.

268
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,654
We now begin part two of
See You at Noon with Seo Yoo-ri.

269
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,656
During part two,
we have the segment you all love,

270
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,533
the singing contest for our listeners.

271
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,828
We're on live with the first contestant.

272
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,162
Hello?

273
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,289
We got it!

274
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,667
-Yes, hello!
-Nice to have you on the line.

275
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,085
Could you please introduce yourself?

276
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:43,507
Yes, I'm Bong Doo-sik,
a director at Soorgio Armanhy,

277
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,758
an online shopping mall.

278
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,635
Ah, I see. Director Bong,

279
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,389
you're not supposed to say
the name of your business on the air.

280
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,349
Oh, really? Sorry!

281
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,644
Okay, we'll let it go
since it was a mistake.

282
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,981
Which song will you sing for us today?

283
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,109
I will sing Yim Jae-beom's "Confession."

284
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,820
"Confession"? That's a difficult song.

285
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,822
Let's begin right away.

286
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,997
What shall I do?

287
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,086
What should I do?

288
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,382
I dared

289
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,720
I dared

290
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:35,309
To love her

291
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,314
I should have just let Soo-ah

292
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,528
Even I don't know Soo-ah
Soo-ah... Soo-ah...

293
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,492
Soorgio Armhany

294
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,079
Shopping Mall

295
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,997
Soo-ah--

296
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,167
Goodness, we got disconnected suddenly.

297
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,085
Shit.

298
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:13,973
It's good.

299
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,059
-Really?
-Yes, it's really good.

300
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,395
I'm so glad.

301
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,982
To be honest, I'm most confident
about making muffins.

302
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,817
I even named it after Sol

303
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,694
so I can sell it when I open a bakery.

304
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,196
Really? What's it called?

305
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,701
Sol, Sol, My Green Sol's Muffin.

306
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,663
I see. That's quite unique.

307
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,211
-Is this the recipe?
-Yes, I developed it myself.

308
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,387
So this guy is your boyfriend?

309
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,180
-That's what I'm saying.
-Stay out of this.

310
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,225
Are you really Seo-jin's boyfriend?

311
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,105
Check, check.

312
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,899
That's right. I enjoy wearing red coats

313
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,778
and we were kissing in the park yesterday
until you...

314
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,781
came screaming at us.

315
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,827
I got shocked and ran away.

316
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,413
I'm Seo-jin's boyfriend, Kang Hong-seok.

317
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,753
Hong-seok is a musical actor, so he
tends to exaggerate his movements.

318
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,714
He's very expressive, you see.

319
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,340
He really is.

320
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,384
How did you two meet?

321
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,805
Do it.

322
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,563
What happened to the lights?

323
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,568
We first met before a show.

324
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,489
Seo-jin opened the doors to the venue

325
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,283
and went click-clack,

326
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,286
click-clack,

327
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,790
and all of a sudden
my heart went thump, thump.

328
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,709
It started beating fast.

329
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,464
I heard the song which described our fate
in my ears.

330
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,723
Excuse me, where is the toilet?

331
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,976
Sorry? The toilet?

332
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,311
It's that way.

333
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,482
That way.

334
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,109
Please excuse me.

335
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,028
Plod, plod, plod.

336
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,781
Plod, plod...

337
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,324
What did I tell you?

338
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,700
There's nothing going on between us.

339
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,663
It's a bit strange,

340
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,917
but he's a hundred times better
than you, Joon-ki.

341
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,752
What did you say?

342
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,504
What's wrong with me?

343
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,506
Just be grateful it's not you.

344
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,552
If you were Seo-jin's boyfriend,
that's the day...

345
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,849
you'll attend your own funeral.

346
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,059
I got it.

347
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,602
Stop saying that, you freak!

348
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,896
You sound like the Grim Reaper. Stop.

349
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,360
You want me to do this?

350
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,778
Do you have to go this far?

351
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,656
Then what do we do? We have to advertise.

352
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,117
What is it?

353
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,703
Why is it so loud?

354
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,829
Dong-goo...

355
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,289
What's wrong with you two?

356
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,331
What are you doing?

357
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,792
We're going to do an online show.

358
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,127
To advertise our shopping site.

359
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,171
I see.

360
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,798
-What's that on your face?
-Huh?

361
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,009
Oh, this?

362
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,887
Remember how much attention Seo-jin got
when she shaved online?

363
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,889
So we're going to do a shaving show.

364
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,473
This is just makeup.

365
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,685
I see.

366
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,230
What's with the bones?
Are they dinosaur bones?

367
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,024
I can't believe

368
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,359
she wants me to do a mukbang
with bones. Like Joon-ki did!

369
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,738
With none other
than these sturdy cow leg bones.

370
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,741
Joon-ki did it with pigs' feet bones,

371
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,202
so you have to have a bigger impact
for people to watch.

372
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,495
Seriously.

373
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,456
Someone's online.

374
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,624
Ahem.

375
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,626
Let's begin, Doo-sik.

376
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,379
Hello, Gangnam Parvenu!

377
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,925
Bursting onto the shaving show scene,
I am pretty girl,

378
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,844
BJ Soorgio!

379
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,890
Hello, I'm the pretty boy
of the bone mukbang scene,

380
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,433
Armhany!

381
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,144
Then we'll begin

382
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,106
with a bone mukbang and shaving show!

383
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,318
First, I'll put on some shaving cream.

384
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,532
What are you doing? Start eating already!

385
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,079
Oh, Doo-sik...

386
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,875
How's rehearsal going?
You start shooting soon.

387
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,045
I don't know. I'm doing my best

388
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,507
but I'm worried and anxious.

389
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,968
Cheer up. I know you can do well.

390
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,262
I knew it. My Bacca is the only one

391
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,846
who cares about me.

392
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,640
Aren't you grateful?

393
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,100
Then shouldn't I get a prize?

394
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,352
Prize? What prize?

395
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,229
Do you have to ask?

396
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,107
What?

397
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,985
-Again?
-Yes!

398
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,987
What if Dong-goo catches us again?

399
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,196
There's no way.

400
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,365
We should still be careful.

401
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,242
Didn't you hear what he said yesterday?

402
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,955
"You'll attend your own funeral."

403
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,834
I get goosebumps

404
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,460
just thinking about it.

405
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,754
Still. Please?

406
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,218
Darn it!

407
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,971
You naughty, naughty Bacca, you.

408
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,223
Pucker up. Pucker up those lips of yours.

409
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,184
Get ready, here I come.

410
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,769
I'll show you how a pro does it.

411
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,734
What the hell is that?

412
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,362
Hey! Seo-jin!

413
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,449
It's Dong-goo, isn't it?

414
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,034
Yeah, what do we do?

415
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,202
Hey, Seo-jin. Who is it?

416
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,871
-Who the hell is it?
-Damn it.

417
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,831
What? What the hell?

418
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,208
What was that?

419
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,044
Anyway--

420
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,589
Kang Seo-jin. You're at this again?

421
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,049
No, that's not it.

422
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,592
What's not it?

423
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,595
-Ow!
-Come with me.

424
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,848
Kang Seo-jin.

425
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,310
Hong-seok has a show tonight,
so who the hell were you with?

426
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,937
Wait.

427
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,858
He looked a lot like Joon-ki from behind.

428
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,028
What are you saying? It's not Joon-ki.

429
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,488
Then who is it?

430
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,699
Why the hell was he kissing you?

431
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,742
Well...

432
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,038
-He's my boyfriend.
-What? Boyfriend?

433
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,372
What about Hong-seok?

434
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,292
Don't tell me you're two-timing them.

435
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,210
What?

436
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,587
Yes, I am.

437
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,964
I met him during an interview today

438
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,508
and he's totally my type.

439
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,760
You were kissing some jerk you met today?

440
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,804
I've been unable
to control my urges lately.

441
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm sexually frustrated, you see.

442
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,058
You expect me to believe that?

443
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,561
Yes, Director! Of course.

444
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,313
Thanks for giving me a ride home.

445
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,565
Drive safe. Bye.

446
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,485
See?

447
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,529
He's got the same head as that jerk
from earlier.

448
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,947
What are you talking about?

449
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,032
Don't play dumb.

450
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,327
You're the guy who was kissing Seo-jin
in the park, right?

451
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,578
What's this nonsense?

452
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,248
I was rehearsing with my director all day
and I only just got home.

453
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,377
Hold on. Seo-jin kissed someone again?

454
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,589
You're totally crazy about kissing,
aren't you?

455
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,342
So you're saying it wasn't you?

456
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,177
Fine.

457
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,138
Bring your boyfriend home.

458
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,556
-Bring him.
-Right now!

459
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,600
What? Right now?

460
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,061
Why are you surprised? Why?

461
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,187
I'm not surprised.

462
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,523
Hey, Seo-jin. Bring him home!

463
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,358
-What?
-Bring him home.

464
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,110
You can do it.

465
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,736
Just trust me and bring him home.

466
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,156
And prove to him that we are nothing more

467
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,032
than friends.

468
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,660
Yeah, do it. Prove it!

469
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:17,539
Why the hell aren't you calling him?!
I have to meet him tonight!

470
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,124
-Bring him!
-Right now!

471
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,585
Okay, fine.

472
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,925
Why are you wearing that?

473
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,512
I was in the middle of shooting
a period piece

474
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,514
and received an urgent casting call.

475
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,766
A casting call?

476
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,894
What I mean is...

477
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,396
I received an urgent call

478
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,356
from my girlfriend, Bang Seo-jin.

479
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,566
Did you say Bang Seo-jin?

480
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,695
Am I wrong?

481
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,697
-Excuse me?
-Actually,

482
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,867
we were in such a rush to date,

483
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,203
that I don't even know her name...

484
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,288
Sure, that can happen.

485
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,957
Once, it took me three months.

486
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,792
-Is that so?
-Anyway,

487
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,670
I am Seo-jin's boyfriend for sure.

488
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,465
I'm sorry, may I leave

489
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,966
if you're done checking?

490
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,594
I'm scheduled to die in 30 minutes.

491
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,680
Oh, really? Okay, you should go then.

492
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,806
Bye then.

493
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,189
See, you punk? I told you it wasn't me.

494
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:29,110
Is that so? He's a bit strange,

495
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,614
but he's better than you, Joon-ki.

496
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,658
It's not enough to be two-timing,

497
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,660
you had to go kiss him on the first day?

498
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,037
Aren't you too loose?

499
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,622
Sorry.

500
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,251
I didn't know how loose I was either.

501
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,588
-I'm so sorry.
-Goodness.

502
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,261
We still have zero hits.

503
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,720
VISITORS: 0

504
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,515
We already bought a bunch of clothes.
We're in trouble.

505
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,226
Damn, my molar.

506
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,103
Min Soo-ah, you pain in the ass.

507
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,524
Director Bong, follow me.

508
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,817
Follow you where?

509
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,236
We can't just sit around
waiting for orders.

510
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,571
We should hit the ground running.
Let's go.

511
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,408
-Where are we going?
-I said come.

512
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,994
What are you going to do now?

513
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,704
Hello, this is Soorgio Armhany.

514
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,082
Hello. We're an online shopping mall,
Soorgio Armhany.

515
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,543
Hello. We're an online shopping mall,
Soorgio Armhany.

516
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,669
Please look us up.

517
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,962
Please look us up.

518
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,846
Let's stop, Soo-ah.

519
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,265
This isn't going to work.

520
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,642
Who advertises their website with fliers?

521
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,728
Then what should we do?
There's no other way.

522
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,979
We have to do something, don't we?

523
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,357
You can go if you want.
I'm going to hand all of these out today.

524
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,984
Hey.

525
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,444
Hello. We're an online shopping mall,
Soorgio Armhany.

526
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,737
Please visit.

527
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,254
GRAND OPENING EVENT

528
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,052
That's why I told you to stop.

529
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,387
Let's go. Okay?

530
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,807
Hey, Soo-ah.

531
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,267
Are you crying?

532
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,810
Doo-sik.

533
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,313
What the hell is wrong with me?

534
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,901
Why can't I do anything properly?

535
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,530
I really worked hard this time.

536
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,118
I really wanted to do well.

537
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,210
-Get up.
-I'm fine.

538
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,420
I'm going to stay, so you should go.

539
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,839
I said get up. I'm hungry.

540
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,885
How can you say you're hungry
in this situation?

541
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,221
We have to eat something if we're going
to continue passing out fliers.

542
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,641
-What?
-And how can the director leave

543
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,601
when the boss is being like this?

544
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,395
So get up already.

545
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,454
Come on, drink.

546
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,248
I don't feel like it.

547
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,042
Just have a bit, okay?

548
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,763
Freeze!

549
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,891
Get on the ground.

550
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,852
Get on the ground
if you don't want to die!

551
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,855
-Is that a gun?
-Huh?

552
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,566
It's a gun!

553
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,192
What's happening?

554
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,610
Hey, over there.

555
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,529
Get down on the ground. Now!

556
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,947
Yes, sir!

557
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,202
-Hi, Hyun-joon.
-Hi.

558
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,621
Why did you call me over?

559
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,708
Oh, I have something to show you.

560
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,503
NEW PRODUCT
SOL, SOL, MY GREEN SOL'S MUFFIN

561
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,172
What is this?

562
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,340
I'm a businessman after all.

563
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,343
Your muffins seemed marketable.

564
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,304
So I made it into a product.
Do you like it?

565
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,055
Are you serious?

566
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,515
I followed your recipe to the T.

567
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,769
My bakery will take care of the
production, sales and management.

568
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,271
In return, we'll split the proceeds 50-50.

569
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,230
Any objections?

570
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,733
No, not at all.

571
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,027
Thank you.

572
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,904
I'm really grateful, Hyun-joon.

573
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,448
I look forward to working together,
Patissier Han Yoon-ah.

574
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,708
Park Doo-chul! It's not too late!

575
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,960
Drop your weapon and surrender!

576
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,921
Cut the crap!

577
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,340
Get lost if you want the hostages to live!

578
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,967
How long do we have to stay here?

579
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,387
What?

580
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,515
The TV stations must be here to cover it.

581
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,766
You're right.

582
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,726
There are so many cameras.

583
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,313
Wait a sec. Doo-sik,

584
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,024
aren't situations like this
broadcast live?

585
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,193
Yeah. Why do you ask?

586
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,070
It's an opportunity to advertise!

587
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,572
It's being broadcast live nationwide!

588
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,699
So you want to promote the website?
In this situation?

589
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,617
You're nuts.

590
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,370
Stay here, okay?

591
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,789
-I'll take care of everything.
-Don't. Please.

592
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,667
You'll get shot. Don't do it.

593
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,126
Don't!

594
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,879
I said don't! Stop it.

595
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,466
What's going on? What is she doing?

596
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,892
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

597
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,311
The thing is... sir,

598
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,564
is it okay if I just stand here?

599
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,649
I'm a hostage all the same

600
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,860
whether I'm standing up or lying down.

601
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,111
-That nutjob.
-What?

602
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,988
Are you crazy?

603
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,364
Get down.

604
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,282
Get down now!

605
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,659
I have my reasons.

606
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,494
I want to die as it is.

607
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,746
Do you want to die as well?

608
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,006
We all have tough lives.

609
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,132
What?

610
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,510
I don't know what you're going through,

611
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,554
but my life is pretty bad as well.

612
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,181
I lost my entire fortune

613
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,766
because I was conned by a guy,

614
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,685
and to make matters worse,

615
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,938
I'm leeching off of my ex-boyfriend
who I dumped for being hopeless.

616
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,356
Really?

617
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:44,861
On top of that, my ex is now in love
with someone else!

618
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,989
He even asks me for dating advice.

619
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,867
It's mortifying every time it happens.

620
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,285
He's a son of a bitch, isn't he?

621
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,915
And my online shopping site,
which was my last ray of hope,

622
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,124
is about to go under.

623
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:03,004
Please let me just stand here.

624
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,882
Sir... please?

625
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,553
Why would you cry?

626
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,182
Everyone's staring. Stop.

627
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,934
What are they doing?

628
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:16,851
Shit.

629
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,787
Good thing I learned a thing or two
from Soo-bong.

630
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,332
What's wrong?

631
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,876
-Bacca, please.
-Do you have to ask?

632
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,461
I became some loose woman
because of you!

633
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,130
We had no choice because of Dong-goo.

634
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,548
How long will you keep this up for?

635
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,718
-Will you live like this forever?
-Don't you know your brother?

636
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,346
He'll really beat me to death
if he finds out.

637
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,306
Why are you such a coward?

638
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,350
-Are you that scared of Dong-goo?
-Yes, I am.

639
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,309
I'm so scared of him.

640
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,270
I don't want to die.

641
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,981
Forget it.

642
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,983
Let's just break up.

643
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,777
Break up? What do you mean?

644
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,404
Bacca, why are you doing this?

645
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,865
Seo-jin, please.

646
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,367
Forget it. Let go of me.

647
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,619
-No, I don't want to. I won't!
-Let go!

648
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,122
Hey, Seo-jin!

649
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,001
It's Dong-goo, isn't it?

650
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,253
Why is he here again?

651
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,796
Let's just tell him the truth.

652
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,214
We can't. I'll die!

653
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,382
You're going to continue being this way?

654
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,760
Stay right there, you punk.

655
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,470
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

656
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,014
Come here.

657
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,939
What the hell? Is he a freaking cheetah?

658
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,693
Hey, Seo-jin. Who was that guy?

659
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,610
I don't know either!

660
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,321
-Seriously.
-Goodness.

661
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,198
What the hell is she mad about?

662
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,284
Hey! Kang Seo-jin!

663
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,704
We'll interview the brave citizen
who apprehended the gunman

664
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,248
with her bare hands.

665
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,167
Hello.

666
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:05,960
Hello,

667
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,963
my name is Min Soo-ah,
the CEO of online shopping mall

668
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,175
Soorgio Armhany Mall,
also known as Soo-ah Mall.

669
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,928
It couldn't have been easy
to apprehend the gunman.

670
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,138
Of course not.

671
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,725
But the founding principle behind
Soorgio Armhany

672
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,560
is the realization of a just society.

673
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,644
What?

674
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,940
The best quality at reasonable prices
with speedy delivery.

675
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,694
Soorgio Armhany will always
be beside those of you

676
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,737
who dream of a just society.

677
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,114
W-W-W dot...

678
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,325
Seo-jin, tell me the truth.

679
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,327
Who's that guy you were hugging?

680
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,703
I said I don't know.

681
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,831
How can you hug someone you don't know?

682
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,666
I just found him on the street
and hugged him! So what?

683
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,876
Don't you know I'm loose?

684
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,421
Why are you getting mad?

685
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,925
I'm just worried you might be dating
Joon-ki.

686
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,552
Why do you hate him that much?

687
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,930
What? Hey.

688
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,890
Why would I hate Joon-ki?

689
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,101
I love him.

690
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,771
He may be a bit immature,
but he's got a good heart.

691
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:07,980
He's thoughtful too.

692
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,649
But!

693
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,194
I can't accept him as my brother-in-law
is what I'm saying.

694
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:14,946
Is that so?

695
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:19,659
Then... I'm asking this just in case.

696
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,245
What will you do if I go out with him?

697
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,579
Are you going to beat him?

698
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,748
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

699
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,960
But if that does happen,

700
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,255
I won't leave you alone.

701
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,259
Me? What are you going to do?

702
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,470
There's this tiny temple I know of

703
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,098
deep in the mountains of Gangwon Province.

704
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,016
It's got great views, fresh water

705
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,269
with no one around,
not even an ant in sight.

706
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,187
What about it?

707
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,357
Rather than seeing you go out with him,

708
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:56,279
I'll shave off every strand of hair
on your head and turn you into

709
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,114
a Buddhist nun.

710
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,116
A Buddhist nun?

711
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:05,496
I am one with the world

712
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,166
I won't even let you have a shaver.

713
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,597
You know I don't kid around
about shit like this, right?

714
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,101
Yes, of course.
I know very well.

715
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,857
Hey, Kang Dong-goo!

716
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,526
What the hell? Why did he drink so much?

717
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,447
Hey, you!

718
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,074
I have something to confess to you today.

719
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,785
Confess? What is it?

720
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,418
What the hell?

721
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,589
I'll lay it all out like a man.

722
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,425
Actually,

723
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,179
Seo-jin...

724
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,524
Hey, Seo-jin! What are you doing?

725
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,944
He... He was so loud!

726
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,113
He should just go and sleep.
What's with the drunken frenzy?

727
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,115
There's really nothing I like
about this guy.

728
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,665
She doesn't have to despise him that much.

729
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,124
Gosh.

730
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,752
I suspected them for nothing.

731
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,756
Joon-ki, are you all right?

732
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,219
Hey, Bacca,
did something happen last night?

733
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,139
I remember getting home,

734
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,891
but then I blacked out.

735
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,061
Well...

736
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,604
You fell because you were drunk.

737
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,481
Really?

738
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,026
Anyway, I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

739
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,487
I'll tell Dong-goo about us today

740
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,532
-even if it means he'll beat me to death.
-What?

741
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,909
No, it's okay. Don't do it.

742
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,037
-Why?
-I thought about it

743
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,415
and I think it'd be better
to keep it a secret.

744
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:17,628
So, Joon-ki,
let's keep it a secret forever.

745
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,922
Oh. Okay, then.

746
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,550
I have to go to work.

747
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,760
Already? I thought the shoot
was in the afternoon.

748
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,804
-Why are you leaving so early?
-I have to go prepare.

749
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,849
I'm working with Min Gi-young today.

750
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,310
Really? You must be so nervous!

751
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,812
My heart's about to burst.

752
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:39,317
Then do you want me to recharge
your batteries? So you can stay strong?

753
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,819
Recharge me? How?

754
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,826
So? Did that work?

755
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,998
Yes. I have so much energy
that I can't control it. What do I do?

756
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,463
What are you doing?

757
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,630
What if Dong-goo sees us?

758
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,591
Who cares?

759
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,018
We got another order.

760
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,938
You're getting quite a few now.

761
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,441
Yes, thanks to good marketing.

762
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,070
You know this is all thanks to me,
right, Director Bong?

763
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,447
Hey, I don't see Yoon-ah.

764
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,282
Yeah, she left earlier
to go to the bakery.

765
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,201
What? So early?

766
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,745
Hyun-joon set up a corner for her
so she could sell her muffins

767
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,038
at the bakery.

768
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,832
I think he's sharing the profits too.

769
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,043
Oh, really?

770
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,254
Hey, Director Bong, what are you reading?

771
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,548
-Is it good?
-Yeah, it's really good.

772
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,716
What's it about?

773
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,802
There's this guy

774
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,471
who pretends to be terminal
to get the woman he loves.

775
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,473
He's so desperately in love.

776
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,476
What? He pretends to be terminal

777
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,353
to be with the woman he loves?

778
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,438
He's lying.

779
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,441
He's not desperate. He's cheap.

780
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,069
-What do you mean?
-He's being cheap!

781
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,739
Like someone who's holding onto another
by letting her sell muffins at his bakery!

782
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,700
How can a man do that? That's cheap.

783
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,994
Don't you think so? Huh?

784
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,205
What a bastard.

785
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,416
CODENAME DUBAI

786
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,044
REAL MEN

787
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,884
Hello.

788
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,969
Hello.

789
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,095
Hi.

790
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,513
You're here.

791
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,349
Joon-ki, you know Mr. Min Gi-young, right?
Say hello.

792
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,851
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Min.

793
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,145
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

794
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,731
I'm actor Lee Joon-ki playing the role
of Song Joon-Seok.

795
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,694
Oh, you're the guy who's playing
Song Joon-seok.

796
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,572
-Excuse me?
-So you're playing Song Joon-seok.

797
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,576
Yes, I am.

798
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,036
You make a good impression.

799
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,746
Let's do our best today.

800
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,503
Joon-ki, why are you laughing?

801
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,007
His pronunciation is a little...

802
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,968
Oh, that. He recently got surgery
on his tongue.

803
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,262
That's why he has difficulty
with S and J sounds.

804
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,139
He'll get better soon, so don't worry.

805
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,974
That's why.

806
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,518
Okay... Cue!

807
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,355
Chief, I can't follow your orders.

808
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,650
I will report this story.

809
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:27,985
What did you say?

810
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,488
Even if I have to step down
from my position as anchor,

811
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:35,367
no even if I die...
I will report this story.

812
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,368
Do you understand?

813
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,205
Will you really be like this?
Song Joon-seok!

814
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,459
Have you forgotten what I've done for you?
Song Joon-seok!

815
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,338
Cut!

816
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,673
Joon-ki, why are you curling your lips?

817
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,261
I'm... sorry.

818
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,055
My lips keep drying up.

819
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,973
Sorry, sir.

820
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,059
No worries.
That can happen when you're nervous.

821
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,394
Let's continue.

822
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,938
We'll start with your line, Mr. Min.

823
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,481
Yes, sir!

824
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,567
Okay... Cue!

825
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,819
Have you forgotten what I've done for you?
Song Joon-seok!

826
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,785
-Why do you keep laughing?
-Sorry?

827
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,578
I asked why you keep laughing.

828
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,663
Is my acting a joke?

829
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,624
No, sir. That's not it.

830
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,918
Forget it. Director Kim,

831
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,253
let's take a break.

832
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,715
Sorry, sir.

833
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,509
I'm sorry, sir.

834
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,302
Why do you keep laughing, Joon-ki?

835
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:39,056
I apologize. I can't help it
because of Mr. Min's pronunciation.

836
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,267
Still, how can you laugh at him
when he's acting?

837
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,935
Be careful, all right?

838
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,520
I'm sorry.

839
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,981
Mr. Min...

840
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,484
Damn it.

841
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,403
But...

842
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,863
Why do I keep cracking up?

843
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,283
Seriously, my gosh.

844
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,868
I must be nuts.

845
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,329
Okay, so that's what we'll do.

846
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,873
-So how'd it go yesterday?
-We're looking into it.

847
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,459
He gave her a corner to sell muffins?

848
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,297
What a cheap trick. He's using
the bakery to hold on to Yoon-ah!

849
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,008
That piece of shit.

850
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,678
When Shin Hyun-joon sneaks into the party
at the hotel in Dubai,

851
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,264
where should he hide his weapon?

852
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,558
-I gave this some thought.
-Yeah?

853
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,518
There's a band playing
at the party, right?

854
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,563
So what about inside an instrument case?

855
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,566
Hey, punk, that was already done
in Mission Impossible.

856
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,485
Don't you have any fresh ideas?

857
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,488
Look, he's at it again.

858
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,034
He must be brewing something up.

859
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,578
Hey, Dong-goo. Do you have anything?

860
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:44,955
Bread!

861
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,207
Bread? What about it?

862
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,125
Excuse me?

863
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,502
The bread for the guests? So...

864
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,963
You're saying we should hide the air rifle
in bread.

865
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,342
-That's new.
-No way.

866
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,469
How can you hide an air rifle in bread?

867
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,888
The bread has to be long.

868
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,057
There will be food at the party.

869
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,684
It's a very natural flow of events,
don't you think?

870
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,561
Hey, Dong-goo, you did it again.

871
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,440
I think you're ready to become a director!

872
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,276
-I love it! It's brilliant!
-Thank you.

873
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,780
You beat me again.

874
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,948
I was thinking about bread, too.

875
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,368
-Go easy on me, won't you?
-Pardon?

876
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,912
Sorry.

877
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,719
Dong-goo, what brings you here?

878
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,055
You must be here to see Yoon-ah.

879
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,349
No, I'm out researching props

880
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,850
for the movie.

881
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,811
Is Yoon-ah around?

882
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,064
She's in the studio.
Do you want me to get her?

883
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,357
No, it's fine.

884
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:58,112
So I hear
that you're selling Yoon-ah's muffins.

885
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,488
Yes, right here.

886
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,574
I see.

887
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,867
So this is it.

888
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,788
I didn't think of you like that
but you're quite cheap.

889
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,415
What do you mean, cheap?

890
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,375
You want to buy her affection

891
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,710
by allowing her to sell her muffins here.

892
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,546
What a cheap trick.

893
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,256
How can a man hold bread hostage?

894
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,216
-Excuse me?
-Enough.

895
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,678
Do you have bread that's big enough
to hold an air rifle, by any chance?

896
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,304
Why would you put an air rifle in bread?

897
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,974
Because that's what's needed
for the movie.

898
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,851
You wouldn't understand.

899
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,979
Then can you custom-make bread

900
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,856
that's big enough for an air rifle?

901
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:34,815
Like a loaf of bread.

902
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,692
Yes, I guess we can make something.

903
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,153
Then can you make about 20 of them?

904
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,197
Big enough to hold an air rifle, okay?

905
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,115
Sure.

906
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,410
Dong-goo, what brings you here?

907
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,747
I came to research props for the movie.

908
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,000
-I'll be off now.
-Bye.

909
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,751
Oh, Hyun-joon,

910
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,505
let's live like a man. A real man.

911
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,350
What a cheap trick.

912
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,311
I could never be like that.

913
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,062
He's so shameless.

914
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,735
My leg!

915
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,489
Dong-goo!

916
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,824
-Are you okay?
-Hold on.

917
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,409
Just hold on a bit, okay?

918
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,536
Don't touch me!

919
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,913
Just hold on.

920
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,414
Are you okay?

921
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,209
Call 911. Ambulance!

922
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,259
-Are you home, Joon-ki?
-Yeah.

923
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,262
Why the long face?

924
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,305
Did something happen?

925
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,849
I almost got fired today.

926
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,018
What? Why?

927
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,854
Mr. Min hurt his tongue,

928
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,815
so he can't pronounce S and J sounds.

929
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,733
Uh-huh.

930
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:03,320
But my character's name happens to be
Song Joon-seok.

931
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,863
So?

932
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,823
Whenever he says my name,

933
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,702
he goes "Thong Thoon-Theok,
Thong Thoon-Theok".

934
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,580
I got in trouble because
I couldn't stop cracking up.

935
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,250
What? "Thong Thoon-Theok"?

936
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,960
Yeah.

937
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,629
On top of that, he has such
a serious expression

938
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,215
when he goes "Thong Thoon-theok"

939
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,551
and I just couldn't hold it in.

940
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,595
I'm the same way.
I can't stop laughing once I start.

941
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,848
We're reshooting the scene tomorrow.

942
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,810
What am I going to do?

943
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,900
Dong-goo!

944
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,320
What happened?
Why are you in a wheelchair?

945
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,490
He was injured.

946
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,117
How?

947
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,452
Don't make a fuss. It's nothing.

948
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,872
Yoon-ah, please take me to my room.

949
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,124
Okay.

950
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,922
What are we going to do?

951
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,924
He hurt both of his legs.

952
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,175
He can't even move.

953
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,427
I know.

954
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,429
Today shouldn't be an issue,

955
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,556
but we've all got to work tomorrow.

956
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,309
Don't worry. I'll stay beside Dong-goo.

957
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,102
How about baking school? And the bakery?

958
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,771
I can just miss a few days of class

959
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,024
and I'll ask Hyun-joon
to help with the muffins.

960
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,278
Dong-goo, tell me if there's anything
you need.

961
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,614
-Okay?
-Okay.

962
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:32,200
I want to rest for now, Yoon-ah.

963
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,580
Let's go.

964
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,214
So she won't go to that jerk, right?

965
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,799
Good thing I got hurt.

966
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,302
This is perfect!

967
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,684
Gosh, I slept well.

968
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,482
Shall I go use the toilet?

969
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:12,949
Huh? It doesn't hurt.

970
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,286
I'm fine.

971
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,914
That's such a relief.

972
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,751
You're up.

973
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,672
Are your legs all right?

974
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,216
They're all better
after a good night's sleep.

975
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,093
I'm so glad.

976
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,347
Then I'm going to go to the bakery
for a bit.

977
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,683
I'm worried about the muffins.

978
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,602
What? So she's going to his bakery again?

979
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,771
Shit... That can't happen!

980
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:47,901
My legs!

981
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,779
Dong-goo!

982
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,948
Dong-goo, what's wrong?

983
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,909
I thought I was all better,
but I guess I was wrong.

984
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,704
Ow! My legs! The pain!

985
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,123
It hurts more than yesterday.
What am I going to do?

986
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,668
I can't do... anything by myself...

987
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,169
Really?

988
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,381
-What's happening all of a sudden?
-I'm so sorry, Yoon-ah.

989
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,425
You have to go to the bakery...

990
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,219
No, don't worry about it.

991
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,763
-I'll help you get into bed.
-Okay.

992
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,453
Hello, Mr. Min.

993
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,668
I apologize for my actions yesterday.

994
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,670
Please forgive me.

995
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,298
Never mind.

996
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,177
Make sure it doesn't happen again. Got it?

997
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,179
Yes, sir.

998
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,100
-Have you eaten?
-No, not yet.

999
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,228
Would you like some sandwiches?

1000
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,399
Yes, thank you.

1001
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,945
Take this apple juice as well.

1002
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,993
-What's the matter?
-Sorry?

1003
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:22,788
It's nothing, sir.

1004
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,457
Thank you.

1005
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,211
Goodness.

1006
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,428
"Sandwiches. Apple juice." Hilarious!

1007
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,264
He's killing me.

1008
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,142
All he has to do is open his mouth
and it's funny.

1009
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,524
What if I start cracking up again?

1010
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,277
It's only a few times.

1011
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,739
I'll hold it in no matter what it takes.

1012
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,326
What a waste I dropped these "sandwiches."

1013
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,286
Hey, Joon-ki,

1014
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,163
the writer made some changes
to the script.

1015
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,873
There aren't that many changes,
so work on those lines.

1016
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,124
Okay, I will.

1017
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,793
Where's Mr. Min?

1018
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,004
What?

1019
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,173
Thong Thoon-theok...

1020
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,473
Let's get rolling.

1021
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,976
Okay... Cue!

1022
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,813
Chief, I cannot follow your orders.

1023
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,276
-I will report this story.
-What did you say?

1024
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,820
Even if I have to step down
from my anchor position,

1025
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,906
no even if I die...
I will report this story.

1026
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,241
Do you understand?

1027
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,536
Song Joon-seok!

1028
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,497
Will you really be this way?
Song Joon-seok!

1029
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,962
Have you forgotten all I've done for you?
Song Joon-seok!

1030
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,839
Song Joon-seok!

1031
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,762
-That was hil--
-Again?

1032
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,139
What's wrong with you?

1033
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,435
I'm so sorry, sir.

1034
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,687
-Is my acting a joke?
-No, sir.

1035
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,272
How dare you laugh when your senior
is acting!

1036
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,775
Director Kim, I'm done for the day.

1037
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,572
-Mr. Min...
-Mr. Min!

1038
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,908
Are you crazy?

1039
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,159
Why do you keep cracking up?

1040
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,745
-Sorry, sir.
-I don't want to hear it!

1041
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,789
If he quits like this,
you're also finished.

1042
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,124
Understood?

1043
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,628
Mr. Min...

1044
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,545
Mr. Min!

1045
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,423
This is killing me.

1046
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,885
Why do I keep cracking up?

1047
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,603
Pretending to be in pain isn't easy.

1048
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,230
I'm so sore.

1049
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:59,027
At least Yoon-ah isn't with Hyun-joon,
that bastard.

1050
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,864
Oh, my legs.

1051
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,907
Time to take your medication.

1052
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,325
Thanks.

1053
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,869
-Does it still hurt a lot?
-Yeah.

1054
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,288
It's getting worse by the minute.

1055
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,876
What if I'm never able to walk again?

1056
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,336
Oh, no.

1057
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,880
-First, let's take your meds.
-Okay.

1058
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,382
Can you get up?

1059
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,092
I'll try my best.

1060
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:28,974
Thanks.

1061
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,105
Don't you need to wash up?

1062
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,065
I want to, but...

1063
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:38,858
Don't worry about it.

1064
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,736
You should still wash up.

1065
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,488
Let's go. I'll help you.

1066
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,159
You really don't have to.

1067
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,160
Slowly.

1068
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:52,455
I don't know if I can... Gosh.

1069
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,669
Goodness.

1070
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,840
-Thanks, Yoon-ah.
-It's no problem.

1071
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,050
How will we wash your hair?

1072
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,220
It's okay. I'll wash it when I get better.

1073
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,305
You should still wash your hair.

1074
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,308
I'll wash it for you.

1075
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,269
Really? You will?

1076
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,897
You really don't have to.

1077
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,859
Shall I lean back? How should we do it?

1078
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,993
Jeez, all because of my legs.

1079
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,287
I feel so bad.

1080
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:33,872
It's all right.

1081
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,708
Yeah, right there. Gosh.

1082
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,293
Are you home, Yoon-ah?

1083
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,379
Huh? That sounds like Hyun-joon.

1084
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,218
Hyun-joon, what are you doing here?

1085
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,720
I was worried about Dong-goo.

1086
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:52,682
Why the hell did he come here?
Things were going great.

1087
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,559
Dong-goo, how are your legs?

1088
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,270
Well, you know. So-so.

1089
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,813
They're worse than yesterday.

1090
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,356
He can't do a thing by himself.

1091
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,524
Is that so?

1092
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,777
That's a problem.

1093
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,864
-What the hell?
-Hello? Hi, Seo-jin.

1094
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,200
What? Really?

1095
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,745
Okay, then. Bye.

1096
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,872
What's the matter?

1097
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,542
Seo-jin left some important paperwork
at home and asked me to bring it to her.

1098
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,213
I can't leave you by yourself.
What do I do?

1099
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,172
That brat.

1100
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,423
You should go. I'll stay.

1101
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,176
Could you do that?

1102
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,553
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

1103
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,807
Yoon-ah!

1104
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,266
You can't leave me like this.

1105
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,684
I'll rinse it out for you.

1106
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,853
What? Are you crazy?

1107
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,021
Why would you rinse out my hair?

1108
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,191
You can't stay like this.

1109
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,818
I'm fine.

1110
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,737
Stay still. I'll rinse it out for you.

1111
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,489
I said I'm fine! Don't touch my hair!

1112
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,200
-Just stay still.
-Hey!

1113
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,118
Goodness.

1114
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,872
Looks like we'll have to rinse it again.

1115
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,833
I said I'm fine. It's all good.

1116
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,085
There's still so much foam.
I'll get more water.

1117
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,546
I told you it's okay. I'm fine!

1118
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,881
You still have foam in your hair.

1119
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,008
No! I said it's fine! It's all done!

1120
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,262
-You still have foam.
-It's okay!

1121
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,140
I said I'm fine!

1122
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,268
Damn it.

1123
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,937
I told you I'm fine!

1124
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,147
What the hell is this?

1125
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,982
I'm really sorry.

1126
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,109
You're all wet.

1127
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,610
You need to get changed.

1128
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,487
Where's your room? Let me help you change.

1129
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,157
What did you say? Help me change?

1130
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,325
You're out of your mind!

1131
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,579
-You want to come down?
-Yes!

1132
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,080
-Okay.
-What do you think you're doing?

1133
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,334
Let's get you changed now.

1134
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,671
I said I'm fine. Stop it now.

1135
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,340
Just stay still, will you?

1136
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,343
Where shall we begin? Your pants!

1137
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,221
What's wrong with you?

1138
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,682
Come on. I feel bad, that's why.

1139
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,851
I'll do it myself.

1140
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,436
I will change my clothes.

1141
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,271
How will you do that?

1142
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,356
You said you can't move a muscle
because of your legs.

1143
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,984
Were you faking it?

1144
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,654
What do you mean, faking it?

1145
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,990
What kind of person do you take me for?

1146
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,408
That's why you should stay still.

1147
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,785
Excuse me!

1148
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,623
Your underwear's all wet too.

1149
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,458
You'll need to change your underwear
as well.

1150
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,710
Is there nothing you won't do?

1151
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,962
I told you to stay still!

1152
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,552
There we go.

1153
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,305
Where do you keep your underwear?

1154
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,183
Hey, you!

1155
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,102
You can't leave me here like this!

1156
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,033
Hey, Bacca.

1157
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,702
Joon-ki, how's the shoot going?

1158
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,745
It's not good.

1159
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:04,290
I got yelled at again because I couldn't
stop laughing when Mr. Min was acting.

1160
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,669
One more strike and I'll be fired.
What do I do?

1161
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,295
Oh, no.

1162
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,465
Why don't you try thinking
about something else?

1163
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,758
Like something sad.

1164
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,593
I've tried everything.

1165
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,012
I pinched my thighs and bit on my tongue,

1166
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,806
but "Thong Thoon-theok"!

1167
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,975
It gets me every time.

1168
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,351
Nothing works.

1169
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,062
Really? Then what are you going to do?

1170
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,774
Oh, Joon-ki. How about this?

1171
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,568
What?

1172
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,196
Mr. Min.

1173
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,782
I'm really sorry about earlier.

1174
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,035
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

1175
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,287
Never mind.

1176
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,999
If it happens one more time,

1177
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,042
I won't let it go. Got it?

1178
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,753
Yes. I got it, sir.

1179
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,548
Let's get started.

1180
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,718
Okay... Cue!

1181
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,388
Chief, I can't follow your orders.

1182
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,725
I will report this story.

1183
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:04,976
What did you say?

1184
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,228
Even if I lose my position as anchor,

1185
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:11,482
no even if I die...
I will report this story.

1186
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,859
Do you understand?

1187
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,321
Song Joon-seok!

1188
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,989
Will you really be this way?
Song Joon-seok!

1189
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,625
This is killing me.

1190
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,794
If I crack up this time, I'm finished.

1191
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,212
What do I do?

1192
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,925
Wait. Shall I really do what Seo-jin
suggested?

1193
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,511
When you feel like
you're about to crack up,

1194
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,847
think of the thing that scares you
the most.

1195
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,517
Something that gives you chills all over.

1196
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:49,729
Why not? I've got nothing to lose.

1197
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,648
Let's give it a shot.

1198
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,026
Have you forgotten all I've done for you?
Song Joon-seok!

1199
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:04,327
You'll be attending your own funeral.

1200
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,079
Song Joon-seok!

1201
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:14,128
You'll be attending your own funeral.

1202
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,213
Song Joon-seok!

1203
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:20,093
You'll be attending your own funeral.

1204
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,261
-You'll be...
-Your own funeral.

1205
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,013
Song Joon-seok!

1206
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:29,060
You'll be attending your own funeral.

1207
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,442
You're finished in this industry!

1208
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,778
Do you understand, Song Joon-seok?

1209
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,072
Do as you wish.

1210
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,157
But Chief,

1211
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,159
does the media exist to cover things up?

1212
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,496
Is it the press's role to distort
the truth and instigate the people?

1213
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,417
The press must not distort
nor discriminate the truth!

1214
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,337
That is the responsibility and duty
of a journalist.

1215
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:57,839
Do you understand?

1216
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,966
Cut! Okay!

1217
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,136
That was great, Joon-ki!

1218
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,429
Thank you, sir.

1219
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,390
-Thank you, Mr. Min.
-Well done.

1220
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,976
Why did you hold back?
You were great!

1221
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,687
Your acting was great!

1222
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,692
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

1223
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:22,196
Thanks, Dong-goo! It's all thanks to you!

1224
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,869
This is so embarrassing.

1225
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,247
Why did he have to see it?

1226
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,416
Why do things like this

1227
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:37,044
keep happening with that bastard?

1228
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,301
Sorry, I took too long.

1229
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,635
I got on the wrong bus.

1230
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,179
It's okay.

1231
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,390
What's the matter with Dong-goo?

1232
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,683
Did something happen?

1233
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:51,768
Well...

1234
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,774
No, nothing happened.

1235
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,734
I'm glad to hear that.

1236
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,194
Thank you so much, Hyun-joon.

1237
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,237
It was nothing.

1238
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:04,155
I'll get going now.

1239
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,782
I'll walk you out.

1240
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,450
Wait.

1241
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,536
I'll see him out. You should stay.

1242
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,249
I should see him out to say thanks
for nursing me today.

1243
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,092
Don't.

1244
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,267
Hold up.

1245
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,102
Why don't we talk?

1246
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,689
Let's pretend today never happened.

1247
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:42,610
You know I saw yours the other day, right?

1248
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,862
We could both get hurt.

1249
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,158
Sure, it never happened.

1250
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,076
Are you happy now?

1251
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,662
Well, okay, then.

1252
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,123
But did you really come here
out of concern for me?

1253
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,124
Yes.

1254
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,585
I wanted to you get better quickly.

1255
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,838
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

1256
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,173
Since then I'll be able to see Yoon-ah.

1257
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,718
So you came because of her, not me!

1258
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,929
You call yourself a man?

1259
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,307
Faking an injury isn't manly either,
is it?

1260
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,142
What did you just say?

1261
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,396
Faking an injury?
What do you mean?

1262
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,898
Are you suggesting I'm faking it
right now?

1263
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,108
Never mind then.

1264
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,529
I hope you get better soon. Bye now.

1265
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:28,865
That...

1266
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,702
I'm not going to get better.
Why would I get better?

1267
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:35,788
That bastard won't even listen
to what I'm saying.

1268
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,085
Seems the bastard caught on.

1269
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,797
What? Then he... On purpose?

1270
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,592
What the hell? Damn it.

1271
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,343
Shit!

1272
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,683
Yoon-ah!

1273
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,978
Yoon-ah, let me take a look.
Are you all right?

1274
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,273
-I'm fine.
-Gosh, this is all his fault.

1275
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,233
-Dong-goo, your legs.
-Huh?

1276
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,576
Oh, my legs.

1277
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,120
Oh, my God.

1278
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,664
You run very well for someone
who can't move a muscle.

1279
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,541
I thought Usain Bolt showed up.

1280
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,752
Were you faking it?

1281
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,296
I wasn't faking it.

1282
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,298
I, uh...

1283
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:30,426
I had superhuman strength for a second.

1284
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,802
Enough.

1285
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,512
Stop it and get up already.

1286
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,640
I told you I wasn't faking it.

1287
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,935
I'm Kang Dong-goo. The real man.

1288
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,897
Is that so?
Then use your superhuman strength

1289
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,565
to come inside, okay?

1290
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,901
Yoon-ah.

1291
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,904
Wait for me, Yoon-ah.

1292
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,573
I'm still hurting. I really am.

1293
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,952
Yoon-ah, you could at least get me
my wheelchair...

1294
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,578
Yoon-ah?

1295
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,997
I'm really in pain.

1296
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,042
The ground is cold.

1297
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,073
Dong-goo, do you have time tomorrow?

1298
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,366
Where and when do you want to meet?

1299
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,993
You're wearing the shirt.

1300
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,160
Yoon-ah.

1301
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,037
Why are you here?

1302
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,373
Why are you sitting next to Yoon-ah?

1303
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:43,874
The prize is a camera?

1304
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,044
Can you participate in
a couples' event with me?

1305
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,337
I'm off to work on the commercial.

1306
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,632
The most important thing for this ad
is the smile.

1307
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,884
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1308
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,720
-What the hell?
-I'm fine.

1309
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,138
Next is your expression.

1310
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:58,180
This looks amazing.

1311
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,098
Oh, so sour!

1312
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,474
Game on.

1313
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,184
-Let me borrow your car.
-Do you know how to drive?

1314
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,894
Of course.

1315
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,563
-Doo-sik, which one is the brake?
-What?

1316
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,648
Slow down. You're going too fast.

1317
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,607
Brake!

1318
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,651
-Hey, what's this?
-Is that the brake?

1319
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,987
The hand brake!

1320
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,906
Oh, no, Doo-sik!
