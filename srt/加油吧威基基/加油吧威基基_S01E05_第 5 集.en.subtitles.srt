1
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,131
Seo-jin, wake up.

2
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,717
You haven't eaten in days.

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,634
She's right.

4
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,013
This isn't even the first time.
When will you snap out of it?

5
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,639
Just leave me alone.

6
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,141
You brat.

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,351
Who told you to slap the interviewer
with a piece of meat?

8
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,520
He sexually harassed her.

9
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,149
Still, how can you think of hitting him?
With meat, at that?

10
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,276
You and that temper of yours.

11
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,569
Stop it!

12
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,863
Jeez, why are you yelling?

13
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,033
And please, Seo-jin, shave.

14
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,410
The guests will freak out if they see--

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,039
Are you crying?

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,377
Do you know how badly I wanted to work
at that newspaper?

17
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,924
It's all I wanted ever since
I made up my mind to be a reporter.

18
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,718
The least you could do is comfort me,
but you're scolding me instead.

19
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,429
What I meant to say is that...

20
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,059
Stop crying. You'll get in next time.

22
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:41,976
Forget it.

23
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,312
Who would hire someone like me
with a terrible temper

24
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,023
who can't make heads or tails of anything?

25
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,152
I'm going to give up
on becoming a reporter and getting a job.

26
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,987
You'll give up?

27
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,906
Seo-jin!

28
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,283
You're giving up on your dream
over something like this?

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,495
How foolish.
You know, no one in our fam--

30
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,496
I know I'm foolish!

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,914
That's why I'm giving up!

32
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,839
I said one thing.

33
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,965
You jerk.

34
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,175
Now is not the time.

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,885
-Can't you tell what's going on?
-Seriously!

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,970
What's wrong with you?

37
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,388
Seo-jin.

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,181
You can go back to sleep after you eat.

39
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,059
-I don't want to!
-Seo-jin, come on.

40
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,477
JOURNALISM EXAM PREP

41
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,437
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU!

42
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,109
How's Seo-jin doing?
Did she eat?

43
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,404
No. She won't even leave her room.
All she does is cry.

44
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,406
That's a bummer.

45
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,408
How can we cheer her up?

46
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,329
She loves chicken feet.
Let's have chicken feet for dinner!

47
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,748
You think that'll cheer her up?

48
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,378
What Seo-jin needs right now is comfort,
not chicken feet.

49
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,588
Comfort, huh?

50
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,798
Like telling her it's growing pains
or something?

51
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,051
I can't. It's too cheesy.

52
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,053
Don't you agree?

53
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,231
How much would it cost to open a shop
like this one?

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,941
A lot, probably.

55
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,484
You want to open a bakery?

56
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,321
You're really going to become a pastry
chef? You sure dream big, don't you?

57
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,822
Did I say something?

58
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,450
I was just talking to myself.
Is there a law against that?

59
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,620
You should really learn
to read between the lines.

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,704
What did I do?

61
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,080
I just said one thing.

62
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,959
-Why are you so irritated with me?
-What are you talking about?

63
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,920
I've never, ever been irritated
in my life.

64
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,796
You are right now.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,298
When? What are you talking about?

66
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,300
This. Right now.

67
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,385
Don't you know what it means?

68
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,931
Dong-goo, what are you doing here?

69
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,641
Is this a lovers' quarrel?

70
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,017
Cut the crap.

71
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,227
What's with the car?

72
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,771
I start shooting for the drama soon,

73
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,105
so I got myself a ride.

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,192
Jeez, it's not even a big role.

75
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,819
Shush! It's cold outside. Get in.
I'll take you home.

76
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,529
Jeez.

77
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,619
Welcome aboard.

78
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,038
How old is this thing?
Does it move all right?

79
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,456
Of course.

80
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,458
Rebecca is smoother than she looks.

81
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,753
Get ready for takeoff.

82
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,592
Gosh, Rebecca.

83
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,387
What happened? Did she die on us?

84
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,514
No worries, man.

85
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,225
I'll just start the engine again.

86
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,191
-What is this?
-No worries, it's okay.

87
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,318
I'll just sew the seat belt back on.

88
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,611
What...?

89
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,783
No worries, man.

90
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,785
No worries, my ass!
I'm getting out.

91
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,371
Huh? The door won't open!

92
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,790
You're right.
It only opens from the outside.

93
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,166
What?

94
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,168
No worries, man.

95
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,629
I can open it for you from outside.

96
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,547
It's not okay.

97
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,215
Hey, you can't do that to Rebecca!

98
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,843
This is a complete mess.
Why did this break off?

99
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,886
Leave Rebecca alone.

100
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,138
I can see her insides!

101
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,265
Rebecca's a transparent woman.

102
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,100
-Hold on.
-Is this a DIY car?

103
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,351
There we go.

104
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,687
Let's go.

105
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,788
-What's the matter with Dong-goo?
-I almost died.

106
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,624
I'm never riding in Rebecca again.

107
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,460
You're such a scaredy-cat.

108
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,712
No worries, man.

109
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,629
Stop it. Don't.

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,007
Doo-sik, let me take Sol.
Thank you.

111
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,344
-Let's go to Mommy.
-Hi, Sol. I missed you so much!

112
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,971
I missed you, too.

113
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,556
What are you up to?

114
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,600
PRESIDENT IS BRUCE LEE

115
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,477
You're manipulating
the number of views again!

116
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,811
Everyone does it.

117
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,981
What's with the numbers lately?
It's driving me insane.

118
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,399
Maybe because it sucks.

119
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,985
Why does it suck?

120
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,071
Doo-sik's a great writer.

121
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,407
A great writer? Have you seen
what he's been working on online?

122
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,159
Listen up.

123
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,495
The president is abducted by aliens.

124
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,288
Suddenly, he attacks them
with a palm blast,

125
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,873
and the aliens are all eliminated.

126
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,999
Do you know who that president is?

127
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,543
POTUS.

128
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,090
There's a foreshadowing that Bruce Lee
was reincarnated as POTUS, okay?

129
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,216
Look at that.

130
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,301
Does it make sense that Bruce Lee
shoots palm blasts?

131
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,886
Fine, ridicule me all you want.

132
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,431
Don't forget, I will never cast you
in my movie if I make it big, okay?

133
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,599
Great! Thanks!

134
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,517
Hey!

135
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,311
-Doo-sik.
-Look at him go.

136
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,814
-He's gonna go sulk again.
-Stop it.

137
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,650
What's this?

138
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,319
Project Cheer Up, Youth.

139
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,823
Failure Isn't Falling,
But Not Getting Back Up.

140
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,535
Sounds nice.

141
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,702
It's so cheesy.

142
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,579
What a cheesy title for a book.

143
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,207
Do they think those words
can provide comfort?

144
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,417
Exactly.

145
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,837
I'm hungry. I'm going to eat ramyun.

146
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,214
-Make one for me, too.
-Two ramyuns coming up.

147
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,632
Oh, my God!

148
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,265
Hey, Seo-jin. Seo-jin!

149
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,769
-Seo-jin.
-Kang Seo-jin!

150
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,690
How long is she going to be like that?

151
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,734
I don't know.
I'm worried something may happen.

152
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,240
Yoon-ah, can you take Seo-jin out

153
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,784
for some fresh air
and try cheering her up?

154
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,619
Me?

155
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,956
You said so yourself
that what she needs right now

156
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,500
is for us to comfort her.

157
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,960
Please.

158
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,589
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

159
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,673
Thanks.

160
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,258
Just wait and see.

161
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,970
I'm going to make it big
and take revenge on you, Lee Joon-ki!

162
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,682
Hey, punk. I told you not to do
anything else during your shift!

163
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,184
Sorry, sir.

164
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,771
Go put this in my washing machine
if you have time to goof around.

165
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,317
The passcode is #-8-9-1-4-#. Got it?

166
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,569
Okay, I will. Let go!

167
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,031
When are you going to hire another person?

168
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,993
I just hired someone,
so stop complaining, okay?

169
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,497
Here she comes.

170
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:28,049
Say hello. She starts today
and her name is Kim Sun-woo.

171
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,593
-She's my daughter.
-What?

172
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,094
Why are you so surprised?

173
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,513
Hello.

174
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,682
So, don't be too hard on her

175
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,601
and teach her well, okay?

176
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,019
Yes, Father.

177
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,021
-Excuse me?
-Huh?

178
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,191
-What? I didn't say anything.
-That's odd.

179
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,150
Dad, please.

180
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,195
Leave so we can work. Go!

181
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,741
It must be tough to work with my dad.

182
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,535
He can be pretty difficult.

183
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,827
Not at all, miss.

184
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,121
Please speak casually.
I'm much younger.

185
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,249
Shall I, then?

186
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,543
By the way, what do you do?

187
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,964
I'm a writer. Wanna-be writer, I guess.

188
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,008
That's so cool!
What are you working on?

189
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,593
Movie scripts.

190
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:19,183
It's my dream to write a love story
like Iwai Shunji's Love Letter.

191
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,018
I love that movie.

192
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,896
Make sure you show me first
when you complete your script.

193
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,273
Okay.

194
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,274
Promise.

195
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,029
Sure, honey.

196
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,698
-Sorry?
-Huh?

197
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,325
It's nothing. I didn't say anything.

198
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,250
How many times have we seen this now?

199
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,504
The UFC match is on right now.

200
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:49,839
Want to watch?

201
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,132
Shall we?

202
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,771
Okay, fine. Just watch.
Let's watch this forever.

203
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,773
Jeez.

204
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,775
What's that sound?

205
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,570
What is that?

206
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,447
Where's it coming from?

207
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,712
Don't tell me.
Is this the sound of your heart beating?

208
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,882
Joon-ki, I'm afraid...

209
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,383
I'm in love.

210
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,469
Oh, goodness.

211
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,846
There he goes again.

212
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,432
Who is it this time?

213
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,768
She's my boss's daughter,

214
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,603
and she's so cute and adorable--

215
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,979
We don't care.

216
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,106
Don't forget what I said.

217
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,192
The cuter and prettier a girl is,

218
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,611
the probability that it'll work out
with you nears zero.

219
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,446
Snap out of it.

220
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,656
It's different this time.

221
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,532
She's really into me.

222
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,579
Hello? Yes.

223
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,539
A production company?

224
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,213
Here.

225
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,758
I am Tak Myung-hwan,
CEO and director

226
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,176
of Artist Top Film.

227
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,469
Thanks.

228
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,264
I was very impressed
with your web fiction.

229
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,058
I see.

230
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,560
Did you enjoy it that much?

231
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,313
No, it's a piece of trash.

232
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,858
-Then why did you--
-But...

233
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,986
on the fourth page of Episode 7
of President is Bruce Lee,

234
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,698
there's a bed scene involving
the male and female leads.

235
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,952
Dare I say, you, Mr. Bong,
are a genius of erotica.

236
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,412
You are erotica incarnate.

237
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,123
I'll cut to the chase.

238
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,291
I'd like to commission you for a script.

239
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,669
Pardon? A script?

240
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,213
-What kind of...
-Have you

241
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,632
heard of the Goodbye, SIL series?

242
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,051
I've never heard of it before.
What's it about?

243
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,888
It's an adult film about
a star-crossed brother and sister-in-law.

244
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,890
I'd like you to write the script
for Goodbye, SIL 5.

245
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,059
What do you take me for?

246
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,561
I don't write that kind of stuff!

247
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,356
Paul Verhoeven,
Ang Lee and Stanley Kubrick.

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,067
-Do you know these world-renowned masters?
-Of course.

249
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,903
Then how about their masterpieces,
Basic Instinct,

250
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,698
Lust, Caution and Eyes Wide Shut?

251
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,577
I don't plan on making
a run-of-the-mill adult film.

252
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:30,291
Mr. Bong, won't you join me
in creating a masterpiece?

253
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,919
And let's... go to Cannes together.

254
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,045
What do you say?

255
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,859
Seo-jin, isn't it so nice to be outside?

256
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,361
It's so refreshing.

257
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,864
Nice, my ass.

258
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,783
I'm about to freeze to death.

259
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,453
It's cold. Let's go home.

260
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,165
Hold on. We came out today
because I have something to say.

261
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,666
What is it?

262
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,627
Tell me already. I'm freezing.

263
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,421
Seo-jin...

264
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,133
failure is not falling down,

265
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,760
but not getting back up.

266
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,053
What?

267
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:27,890
Do you see that kid?

268
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,143
He's fallen countless times

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,562
trying to fly that kite.

270
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,482
But he didn't get discouraged
and got back up again.

271
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,943
Look, he succeeded.

272
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,737
-So what?
-So you can do the same.

273
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,907
If you get up after falling once,
even twice,

274
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,994
then you, too, will be able to fly high
like that kite one day.

275
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,042
Gosh, look at that kite flying high
in the sky!

276
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,378
Why would I do that? I'm freezing.

277
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,630
Will you just listen to me?

278
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,341
Fine, I'll look.

279
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,385
Why are you telling me to look at a kite?

280
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,762
Oh, my God! Seo-jin!

281
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,265
-Oh, no!
-Gosh.

282
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,891
Are you all right?

283
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,768
-Blood! There's blood!
-What? You're bleeding?

284
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,895
-Damn it.
-What'll we do?

285
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,608
Seo-jin, I'm sorry.

286
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,360
Please open the door.

287
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,820
Seo-jin, please.

288
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,281
Just go and leave me the hell alone!

289
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,367
I said to comfort her.

290
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,953
Why'd you make her watch
the kid with a kite?

291
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,997
I didn't know this would happen.

292
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,790
I'll talk to her again.

293
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,251
Forget it. Step aside.
I'll take care of it.

294
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,837
Is it that hard to cheer her up?

295
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,089
You're so frustrating.

296
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,561
What is it?

297
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,022
What?

298
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,235
Dong-goo?

299
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,529
Why did you wake me up?

300
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,364
I want to take you somewhere.

301
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,658
Where? At this hour?

302
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,911
You'll find out when we get there. Get up.

303
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,954
I'm so sleepy.

304
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,081
Where are you taking me?

305
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,673
What are we doing here?

306
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,384
You see, Seo-jin,

307
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,887
there's something I want to say to you.

308
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,180
Something to say?

309
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,806
What is it?

310
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,769
Seo-jin, failure isn't falling down,

311
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,520
it's not getting back up.

312
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,649
Seo-jin...

313
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,821
the sun always rises from the east
and sets in the west,

314
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,866
but it doesn't stop there,
but moves halfway around Earth

315
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,493
and rises again.

316
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,410
So what?

317
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,916
So if you don't stop here
and keep on moving,

318
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,753
one day you will shine like the sun.

319
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,797
Do you understand?

320
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,261
Hey, kiddo, shall we go back down?

321
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,973
Do you want to race to see who's faster?

322
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,392
Come on.

323
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,939
Dong-goo! Are you okay?

324
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,483
I can't get up!

325
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,110
I fell...

326
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,153
I fell on a rock. Ow.

327
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,531
So, why'd you bring me here?
Goodness.

328
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,491
Can you stand up?

329
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,078
No, I can't. I can't get up.

330
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,788
That damn rock!

331
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,292
It hurts!

332
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,007
You said to get back up after falling.

333
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,924
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,927
You shouldn't forget what I said earlier.

335
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,095
Failure isn't--

336
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,180
-Shut up!
-Okay.

337
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,348
Seriously.

338
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,399
I'm sorry, Seo-jin. Don't be mad.

339
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,984
My bad.

340
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,404
Look at you, after ridiculing me
like that.

341
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,698
It really hurt.

342
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,408
The rock

343
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,909
cut right into my cartilage.

344
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,244
Be quiet!

345
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,206
You good-for-nothing fools.

346
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,461
I'll take care of Seo-jin,
so you two can stay out of it.

347
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,671
You really don't know what she needs?

348
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,257
What's so hard about cheering her up?

349
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,261
You're such amateurs.

350
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,316
What is it now?

351
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,527
What!

352
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,239
Get up. I want to take you someplace.

353
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,825
Where now?

354
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,827
Why are you doing this to me?

355
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,830
You'll see, so get up.

356
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,708
You're driving me crazy.

357
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,293
I won't go.

358
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,712
Now.

359
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,672
I said, no!

360
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,342
No, I don't want to go!

361
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,719
No!

362
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,646
Oh, my goodness.

363
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,023
Shit, who is it?

364
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,194
It's Sun-woo.

365
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,656
Did you have lunch, Doo-sik?

366
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,075
Of course I did. I had...

367
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,789
That sounds so good.

368
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,791
I love spaghetti.

369
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:51,547
Then let's go eat spaghetti together.

370
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,466
Really? I'd love to!

371
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,761
Such a cutie.

372
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,600
Huh? It's Director Tak.

373
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,188
Mr. Bong, I read your script.

374
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,024
The bed scene needs to be spiced up a bit.

375
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,442
Really?

376
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,697
I've saved a few

377
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,532
decent bed scenes,

378
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,201
so please take a look

379
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,539
and let me know which way
you'd like to go.

380
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,835
Wait, where did I save those again?

381
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,631
Here they are.

382
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,552
-This one, and...
-Doo-sik,

383
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,470
can you recommend a few movies?

384
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,472
Ones you like to watch.

385
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,391
Send. Okay.

386
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,146
Something like this?

387
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,693
So, that's done.

388
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,237
Why isn't Sun-woo replying?

389
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,044
No way. No...

390
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,587
Why did this get sent to Sun-woo?

391
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,380
Shit!

392
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,676
She hasn't checked it yet.

393
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,179
Please don't... don't open it!

394
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,096
Doo-sik!

395
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,141
Hi, Sun-woo.

396
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,851
Hello, sir.

397
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,729
Why are you running like a madman?

398
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,647
Is something wrong?

399
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,690
Nothing at all. I was just out for a jog.

400
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,317
It's a great day.

401
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,071
Sun-woo, did you happen to see my text?

402
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,823
Did you send me something?
No, not yet.

403
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,576
Dad wanted to eat out suddenly,

404
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,579
so I ended up leaving my phone at home.

405
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,580
I see.

406
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,916
Why are you sending my daughter texts?

407
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,584
Dad, I...

408
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,544
I asked him to recommend good movies.

409
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,881
Let's go eat.

410
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,383
Bye, Doo-sik.

411
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,843
Okay. Goodbye.

412
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,390
What a relief.

413
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,977
She hasn't seen it yet.

414
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,561
Wait a sec.

415
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,480
If they're going out to eat now,

416
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,483
that means no one's home.

417
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,488
Here we are.

418
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,954
You woke me up to go for a drive?

419
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,999
It's nice.

420
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,543
There's also something
I want to say to you.

421
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:35,877
You, too?

422
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,922
Why does everyone want to give me
a piece of their minds?

423
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,090
What is it?

424
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,261
You see, Seo-jin...

425
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,514
failure isn't falling down--

426
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,057
It's not getting back up again?

427
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,018
How do you know that?

428
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,811
Are you all in on this?

429
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,604
What's up with you three?

430
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,067
Don't you get it?

431
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,113
Look at the reeds in the field.

432
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,159
Come on, look.

433
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,495
They shake when the wind blows,

434
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,997
but they never fall down.

435
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,999
-So what?
-So...

436
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,376
if you can overcome this harsh wind,

437
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,045
you can get back up again like the reeds

438
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,298
and bloom into a beautiful flower.

439
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,841
Do you get what I'm saying?

440
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,552
I do. I get it, so let's go home.

441
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,013
Look at you.

442
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,848
Do you feel better after listening to me?

443
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,685
Yes, I do. I feel better,
so let's please go home.

444
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,853
Goodness.

445
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,731
You're such a cutie. Okay, let's go.

446
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,818
Let's go home now.

447
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,862
Go!

448
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,242
-What's going on?
-No worries, man.

449
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,620
It keeps stalling.

450
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,206
She's warming up. It's all right.

451
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,046
You did good, Joon-ki.

452
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,759
What the hell?

453
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,762
Oh, no.

454
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,055
What the hell?

455
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,932
Seo-jin, wake up!

456
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,227
Get this off! It's blocking my view.

457
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,562
I've seen it all, really.

458
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,107
What's wrong with this?

459
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,149
It's broken.

460
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,693
Get this off. We'll get into an accident!

461
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,112
This is crazy.

462
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,905
This car is messed up just like you!

463
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,037
Thanks.

464
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,208
-Oh, my God! What's wrong with this?
-Why?

465
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,210
Do something about this!

466
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,503
Hold on.

467
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,673
No! It's going up!

468
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,133
This won't do.

469
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,759
Then stop the car or something!

470
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,387
How can I stop the car here?
There's a truck right behind me!

471
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,555
You want me to stay like this?

472
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,890
Wait, I'll try to stop
at the intersection.

473
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,308
It hurts.

474
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,395
How can you do this to me?

475
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,272
That's the kind of guy I am.

476
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,692
I cheated on you. So what?

477
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,235
Why are you overreacting?

478
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,319
Are you serious?

479
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,738
You scumbag.

480
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,532
Okay, hit me.

481
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,326
Throw me a big punch
and let's part ways right here.

482
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,328
Go ahead. I'm ready.
Bring it on.

483
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,663
Stop crying and do it.

484
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,790
Let this be a beautiful goodbye. Go!

485
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,329
Damn it.

486
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,000
Why does she live on such a high floor?

487
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,669
The sixth floor. Which way do I go?

488
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,171
Where's unit 605?

489
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,465
605, where are you?

490
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,258
605!

491
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,890
Where's Sun-woo's room?

492
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,101
Bathroom!

493
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,146
What's this smell?

494
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,942
This is it!

495
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,490
There it is!

496
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,207
What the hell? Damn it!

497
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,174
How could you leave your wallet at home?

498
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,425
I know.

499
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,136
I'm sorry, really.

500
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,930
Sun-woo.

501
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,975
Doo-sik said he sent a text.

502
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,978
-What is this?
-What?

503
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,814
What is this? Why, that son of a bitch!

504
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,108
Crazy bastard!

505
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,609
I'll kill him!

506
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,570
No, Dad. He's not that kind of guy.

507
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,698
He's really innocent.

508
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,950
Why do you keep taking his side?

509
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,160
Do you like him?

510
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,497
I don't know if I like him... yet.

511
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,291
I'm right!

512
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,252
There are so many fish in the sea.
Why are you interested in a fool like him?

513
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,837
Never mind. Why do you care?

514
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,339
-Give me my phone.
-What do you think you're doing?

515
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,551
I'm checking to see if it was a mistake.

516
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,110
Sir...

517
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,446
it's a misunderstanding.

518
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,699
Sun-woo, you're mistaken.

519
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,993
What happened is...

520
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,457
Why is this here?

521
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,417
You pervert!

522
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,335
No...

523
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,962
Ms. Kang...

524
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,923
why did you slap a stranger?

525
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,427
She didn't slap him, per se.

526
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,263
Her arm was stuck in the window,
so she accidentally--

527
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,681
You think that makes sense?

528
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,975
Do you know how badly injured he is?

529
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,935
I'm telling the truth.

530
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,604
This is insane.

531
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,440
Why would you suddenly slap someone?

532
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,150
-You made him faint!
-Seo-jin!

533
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,276
Are you all right?

534
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,778
What happened?

535
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,113
Why are you at a police station?

536
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,282
What did you do to her?

537
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,077
Well, I was driving and...

538
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,162
-a newspaper covered the windshield--
-What?

539
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,207
She got her arm stuck in the window and--

540
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,751
I'm not a pervert.
It's a misunderstanding.

541
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,169
Doo-sik.

542
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,422
-What are you doing here?
-Dong-goo!

543
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,132
Let go!

544
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,301
Dong-goo!

545
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,761
Dong-goo.

546
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,304
What's wrong?

547
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,848
Tell them I'm not a pervert.

548
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,433
Of course you're not!

549
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,395
-Says who?
-This is unbelievable. Gosh.

550
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,442
Why were you in their apartment?

551
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,777
I don't know.

552
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,987
Don't ask me a thing.

553
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,117
Be thankful all you got
is a restraining order!

554
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,744
You could've ended up
with an ankle monitor!

555
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,917
Seo-jin, I'm sorry.

556
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,460
I didn't do it on purpose.

557
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,588
-I just wanted to cheer you up.
-Who asked you to cheer me up?

558
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,216
You should've just left me alone.

559
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,177
I'm upset enough as it is.
What's wrong with you guys?

560
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,262
Leave me out of it.

561
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,724
Seo-jin, please.

562
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,934
I'm sorry.

563
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,644
How can I get you to forgive me?

564
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,397
I'll do anything you want.

565
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,107
If you tell me to drop dead, I will.

566
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,151
You want me to strip?

567
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,987
I'll do it right here. Just say the word.

568
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,364
-You guys are in, right?
-I'm in!

569
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,949
Okay!

570
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,743
-Then go ahead.
-What do you want? What shall I do?

571
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,745
-Strip down.
-Huh?

572
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,664
Right now?

573
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,208
Here? In this cold?

574
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,085
You can't do it?

575
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,506
Then don't ever think
of talking to me again, understood?

576
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,009
Seo-jin, wait.

577
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,177
Hey, Seo-jin!

578
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,219
Seo-jin!

579
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,019
A strip show?

580
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,942
Kang Seo-jin!

581
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,404
What?

582
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,037
-Hey...
-Dong-goo.

583
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,666
What do you think you're doing?

584
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,044
You told me to strip down.

585
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,089
What are you guys doing?

586
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,051
Come on! Let's do it!

587
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,677
They just released me.

588
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,138
Do it!

589
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,976
Gosh, it's cold.

590
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,394
This is what you wanted, right?

591
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,939
You didn't do anything wrong.

592
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,026
What's wrong with slapping a guy
who sexually harassed you?

593
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,319
Don't you think?

594
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,072
Yeah, he had it coming.

595
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,075
Don't give up on your dream
because of an asshole like him!

596
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,620
You'll get an awesome job soon.

597
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,330
-Don't worry!
-He's right.

598
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,667
So cheer up, kid!

599
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,876
Cheer up!

600
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,922
You can do it!

601
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,137
You can do it!

602
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,815
Enough, guys.

603
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,733
People are staring.

604
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,861
-You laughed.
-It worked!

605
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,404
-She laughed.
-We did it!

606
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,738
She's laughing.

607
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,741
Okay, okay.
So put your clothes back on.

608
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,369
-Our clothes!
-Of course!

609
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,913
-I'm freezing.
-Hey, you guys!

610
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,331
Run!

611
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,292
-Get out of here!
-I'm not a pervert!

612
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,101
What's wrong with him?

613
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,561
Perv.

614
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,606
Sun-woo!

615
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,150
I'm sorry!

616
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:48,072
I can't get within 100m of you.

617
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,533
I can't come close.

618
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,118
What is he saying?

619
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,038
Sun-woo!

620
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,749
I'm sorry!

621
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,919
I guess I'm a guy after all.

622
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:06,257
Actually, I'm... writing a script
for an adult film.

623
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,053
I'm really sorry.

624
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,518
Get moving.

625
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,063
The group reservation is coming in soon.

626
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,481
Okay.

627
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,360
I get that it's a big group,
but did you need to give them our rooms?

628
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,569
Where will we sleep?

629
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,613
We can slum it in the living room.

630
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,823
We haven't had a group in so long.

631
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,993
Yeah, we're behind on rent.
Let's just deal with it.

632
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,620
The landlady called earlier.

633
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,663
Really?

634
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,791
-She wants us to move out, huh?
-Yeah.

635
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,709
Damn it. What will we do?

636
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,964
What the hell is he doing
when we're working our asses off?

637
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,632
Can't you see?

638
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,635
I'm taking care of myself. Mind control.

639
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,928
Mind control, my ass.

640
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,264
Let him be.
It's his first day on the new job.

641
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,601
He thinks he's a celebrity now,
doesn't he?

642
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,894
Right, Yoon-ah?

643
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,146
Yoon-ah?

644
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,731
Huh? What?

645
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,608
What's the matter? Are you sick?

646
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,904
I don't feel well.

647
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,030
Really?

648
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,492
You're sweating buckets.

649
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,162
You're really hot.

650
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,335
She has swine flu.

651
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,171
-Pardon? Swine flu?
-Swine flu...

652
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,048
No need to worry too much.

653
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,801
She just needs to take meds
and rest for a few days.

654
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,930
She'll need to be quarantined, though.
It's highly contagious.

655
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,932
It's highly contagious? How contagious?

656
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,726
Extremely.

657
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,645
You can pass it on with a cough
or through other bodily fluids.

658
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,733
THE PERFECT EDUCATION

659
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,361
I'm sorry.

660
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,405
You're so busy with all the guests.

661
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,323
It's fine.

662
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,868
I'm glad you'll get better
with meds and rest.

663
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,953
What will we do?

664
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,706
It'll be bad if any of the guests
get sick.

665
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,124
I know.

666
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,667
We have to quarantine her,

667
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,878
but we even gave up our rooms.

668
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,254
There's no space.

669
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,799
Shall we get her a room at a nearby motel?

670
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,176
What?

671
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,678
We can't send her to a motel alone.

672
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,430
You're so cold-hearted.

673
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:21,350
If you're so worried,
take off that damn mask!

674
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,561
It's my first day today.

675
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,773
-You understand, don't you?
-Of course.

676
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,940
You're such an angel.

677
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,609
She can't go to a motel.

678
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,070
What if their guests get sick?

679
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,364
I guess. Then what do we do?

680
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,748
Are you sure about this?

681
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,793
-How can we make a sick person sleep here?
-Do you have a better idea?

682
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,461
Shall we cancel the group reservation?

683
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,630
This is a bit...

684
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,174
No, it's all right.

685
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,427
Guests aside,
I'm worried I'll pass it on to Sol.

686
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,931
There's an electric blanket inside
and a space heater as well.

687
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,057
It should be okay.

688
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,602
Honestly, you're to blame
for not taking better care of yourself,

689
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,062
so just bear it, okay?

690
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,815
You punk! How can you talk like that?

691
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,900
Cold-hearted fool, you.

692
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,568
Close the door!

693
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,698
Wait, what about the toilet?

694
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,203
I didn't think about that. The toilet...

695
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,840
You've got to be kidding me.

696
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,550
Yeah, you jerk.

697
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,010
This is a violation of human rights!

698
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,096
How can you tell a grown woman
to do her business here?

699
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,764
You think I have a choice?

700
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,725
Where'd you even get this?

701
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,270
I borrowed it from the snack joint
down the street.

702
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,483
It used to be her daughter's
and it plays music if you push the button.

703
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,027
-That might make it less embarrassing.
-Less embarrassing, my ass!

704
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,239
You're the cruelest of them all,
you jerk!

705
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,657
That's enough.

706
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,577
I'm really okay, so please take good care
of Sol for me.

707
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,120
Don't worry about Sol, Yoon-ah.

708
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,583
Our guests should be arriving any minute.
Let's go.

709
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,515
Why aren't they here yet?

710
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,184
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

711
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,019
Will Yoon-ah be okay on the roof?

712
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,812
I'm worried it'll be too cold.

713
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,105
I know.

714
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,732
What did you say?

715
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,860
She should bear it because it's her fault
for not taking care of herself?

716
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,570
Am I wrong?

717
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,572
It's true she didn't take care of herself.

718
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,489
You ass.

719
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,782
They're coming.

720
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,201
They're here!

721
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,746
-Hello!
-Seo-jin, go and show them to their rooms.

722
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,747
-Go, go!
-Okay.

723
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,417
Aloha!

724
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,422
Welcome.

725
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,506
Good afternoon.

726
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,217
Come on inside.

727
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,473
We haven't had a group in so long!

728
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,933
I know.

729
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,268
Hey, Dong-goo, about what you said just--

730
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,479
-Hey.
-What?

731
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,813
You have a runny nose.

732
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,482
A runny nose?

733
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,693
Why is my nose runny?

734
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,820
Hold still.

735
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,364
What the hell?

736
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,616
You have a fever.

737
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,825
Don't tell me.

738
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,163
No way. Goodness, no.

739
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,250
I just told you no.

740
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,460
Germs!

741
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,755
Goodness gracious.

742
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,801
Dong-goo.

743
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,970
What's with the sleeping bag?

744
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,181
He was just diagnosed with swine flu.

745
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,812
Go inside. Run along now.

746
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,356
I'm going, I'm going. Stop poking me.

747
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,528
Are you going to take all day?

748
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,371
Did you get it from me?

749
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,456
Who else would it be?

750
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,168
I had an event booked for tomorrow, too.

751
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:19,922
Goodness.

752
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,350
Turning left.

753
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,810
Turning right.

754
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,687
Right.

755
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,688
Right.

756
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,609
Why is my throat closing up?

757
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,986
Wait.

758
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,196
I can't be sick, can I?

759
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,075
I have to do well for the first shoot.

760
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,079
What the hell was that?

761
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,749
Ow, my neck, my eye.

762
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,961
Damn it.

763
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,630
Why won't the door open?

764
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,257
Shit...

765
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,344
My eye, my neck.

766
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,055
My Rebecca!

767
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,474
Rebecca!

768
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,516
Oh, my God!

769
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,518
Pay attention to the road!
What were you thinking?

770
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,854
I'm sorry. I just started driving.

771
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,106
If you don't know how to drive, don't!

772
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,775
What the hell is this?

773
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm in a rush,
so just give me your number.

774
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,820
Yes, sure.

775
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,072
Now!

776
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,783
-You must have a card or something.
-I'm so sorry.

777
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,409
You're an outlaw on the road,

778
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,619
a murderer in the making.

779
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,663
What the hell were you thinking?

780
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,165
Ow, my eye.

781
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,418
Don't cry, Rebecca. Rebecca.

782
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,922
That damn outlaw.

783
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,221
Hello, Director.

784
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,348
Hey.

785
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,850
Your eye-- What's up with your neck?

786
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,853
I got into a fender bender on the way in.

787
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,147
It won't affect the shoot at all.

788
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,982
-I'm okay.
-That's good to hear.

789
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,609
Did you practice your lines?

790
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,027
Of course, sir.

791
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,530
No need to worry, sir.

792
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,116
This is why I like you so much!

793
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,618
Director, the writer is here.

794
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,994
She's here?

795
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,498
Hey, Joon-ki,

796
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,708
-have you met Hye-jin?
-Not yet.

797
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,585
Come. Let me introduce you.

798
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,962
-You will?
-Sure.

799
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:23,963
Okay.

800
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,631
I'll cherish it.

801
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,178
Hye-jin!

802
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,847
You scared me.

803
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,890
You must be so busy.
Why'd you come all the way here?

804
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,272
Where did he go?

805
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:42,982
Who?

806
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,942
Never mind. Let's go.

807
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,319
Let's take ten!

808
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,660
The outlaw.

809
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,466
I'm sorry, Dong-goo. It's all my fault.

810
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,385
It's okay.

811
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,473
Yoon-ah,

812
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,851
can I give you a word of advice?

813
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,479
What is it?

814
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,524
You know you're a bit troublesome, right?

815
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,652
While you may not be doing it on purpose,

816
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,448
you keep causing trouble
and discomfort to others.

817
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,992
That's not good.

818
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,827
It'll become a habit.

819
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:43,083
I'm telling you this because I care,
so don't take it personally.

820
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,086
Okay. I'll be careful from now on.

821
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,466
I'd rather die than be a nuisance
to others.

822
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:55,221
I just don't understand. Goodness...

823
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,223
How does she live like that?

824
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,944
Over here.

825
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,445
-Hello.
-Hi.

826
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,404
You must be cold.

827
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,823
Please.

828
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,910
-I'll push the chair in now.
-Thank you.

829
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,666
How do you feel?

830
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,627
I'm perfectly fine.

831
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,172
In fact, I feel healthier now
than before the accident.

832
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,007
My appetite is back.

833
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,301
That's a relief.

834
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,555
Why did you want to see me?

835
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,973
Oh, that.

836
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,851
I was worried I may have been
out of line.

837
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,605
I was worried

838
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,526
that I may have hurt your feelings.

839
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,610
Not at all.

840
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,404
Actually...

841
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,864
I wasn't in my right mind this morning.

842
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,827
I don't know if I should tell you this.

843
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,162
My childhood best friend

844
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,915
passed away this morning.

845
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,420
His name is Dong-goo.

846
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,840
He was like a brother to me.

847
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,341
Oh, my.

848
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,679
Come to think of it,
this is one of his favorite spots.

849
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,266
Dong-goo...

850
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,441
Please, have this one.

851
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,901
You don't have to do this.

852
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,905
No, please. Enjoy.
I feel bad. Don't worry about it.

853
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,409
Hold on. It's a bit chilly, isn't it?

854
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,453
Excuse me.

855
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,581
Could you bring us a blanket, please?

856
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,999
-Yes, sir.
-Thanks.

857
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,001
Please eat.

858
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,386
I hope the food was to your liking.

859
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,638
It was delicious.

860
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,264
That's great.

861
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,393
So you'll completely forget
about my mistake

862
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,312
from this morning, right?

863
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,605
Of course.

864
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,152
Please get home safely. Good night.

865
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:16,987
Excuse me.

866
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,197
Yes?

867
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,450
Do you have a girlfriend?

868
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,827
Pardon? A girlfriend?

869
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,955
No, I don't. Why do you ask?

870
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,668
What? So you're dating the writer?

871
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,295
What choice do I have?

872
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,674
If I said no, it would've been worse
than how I acted this morning.

873
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:40,427
I'll just date her
while I'm shooting the drama.

874
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,181
What a way to live, Joon-ki.

875
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,100
Damn it.

876
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,895
Wait, what time is it?

877
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,319
Dinner's here!

878
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,322
Hey!

879
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,865
I'm off now!

880
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,203
What are we, livestock?

881
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,705
Is it chow time? Are we prisoners?

882
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,459
I'll go get it.

883
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,045
That's okay. I'll go.

884
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,005
Jeez.

885
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,927
Goodness.

886
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,471
Those punks.

887
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:31,562
Dong-goo!

888
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,980
-My back.
-Are you okay?

889
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,106
My back!

890
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,109
-Oh, no, Dong-goo!
-My back!

891
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,235
Are you all right?

892
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,363
I'm okay. I'm...

893
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:48,162
Damn, that hurts. What the hell is this?

894
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,587
You're not eating?

895
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,213
I will.

896
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,756
Gosh.

897
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,928
My back is killing me.

898
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,390
Yoon-ah, can you help me up?

899
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,517
Why?

900
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,854
I thought you didn't like
asking for favors.

901
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,315
You said it was a nuisance.
It'll become a habit, no?

902
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,568
Fine, forget it.

903
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,069
I just asked, okay?

904
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,697
I can eat lying down.

905
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,824
Look at you, with your eyes wide open.

906
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,994
Why won't this work?

907
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:31,914
Want me to feed you?

908
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,791
-Don't bother.
-Fine.

909
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,513
I guess I'll let you
if you really want to feed me.

910
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,486
Like I told you earlier,

911
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,822
I'm not the type to go around
causing trouble.

912
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,908
So don't take this the wrong way--

913
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,119
I need water.

914
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,913
Here.

915
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,044
Gosh, that was close.

916
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,300
I'm not usually like this, you know.

917
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,428
I get it, so just eat.

918
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,306
Yoon-ah!

919
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,601
I'd like a piece of ham

920
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,769
wrapped in laver.

921
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,605
You just gave me rice.

922
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,536
Shit, I need to pee.

923
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,746
I must've drank too much water.

924
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,457
I'm going nuts, here.

925
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,814
Oh, gosh.

926
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,026
-Are you okay, Dong-goo?
-Yes.

927
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,861
Where are you going?

928
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,614
I want to get some air.

929
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,450
Air? You're not well.

930
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,576
Just lie back down.

931
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,666
I need to go.

932
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:40,751
Excuse me?

933
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,630
I need to go badly.

934
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,216
-Pardon?
-I need to pee!

935
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,095
We're almost there. We'll stop now.

936
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,683
Now go down.

937
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,022
There you go.

938
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,568
Can you open your zipper?

939
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,321
Of course. I can do that myself.

940
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,114
What do you take me for?

941
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,326
I told you I'm not the type
to cause trouble.

942
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,455
You can go now.

943
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,968
She'll hear everything. Damn it.

944
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,845
Seriously.

945
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,870
Yes.

946
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,957
Yes, Hye-jin.

947
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,211
I'll see you in the evening, then.

948
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,631
Okay, bye.

949
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,008
Damn it, that's hot.

950
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,344
You're not a couple of teenagers in love.

951
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,846
How can you talk all night long?

952
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,890
She just wouldn't hang up.

953
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,102
Do you know what she said
as she hung up?

954
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,313
She wants to talk details when we meet.

955
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,566
Doesn't she have a script to write?

956
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,235
You have to meet her again? Tonight?

957
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,528
Yeah.

958
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,322
Why is my life so difficult?

959
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,866
You know, I--

960
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,535
It's Director Choi.

961
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,371
Hello, Director. Joon-ki speaking.

962
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,707
Yes.

963
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,168
Right now?

964
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,009
It's too early to be drinking so much.

965
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,510
What's the matter?

966
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,346
I got into a fight
with my girlfriend recently.

967
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,265
She said

968
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,102
she wanted some time to think,

969
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,313
but I think she's seeing someone.

970
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,314
Really?

971
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,525
Wow, she's ridiculous.

972
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,403
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

973
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,739
It's a secret,

974
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,783
so keep it to yourself.

975
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,825
Sure thing.

976
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:19,951
It's Hye-jin.

977
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,584
By Hye-jin, you mean...

978
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,212
the one who's writing our drama?

979
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,547
Yeah, her. Just wait and see.

980
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,508
Whoever the hell he is,

981
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,510
I won't leave him alone.

982
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,261
What will you do?

983
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,474
I'll find him by whatever means necessary

984
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,436
and break him to pieces!

985
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,440
What?

986
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,610
Your director and writer
were in a relationship?

987
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,487
Yeah.

988
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,532
What do I do now?

989
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,202
How can things get this bad?

990
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,454
I don't know why you live that way.

991
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,665
Jeez, man.

992
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,916
KWON HYE-JIN

993
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,459
That's why I told you--

994
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,884
Hello, Hye-jin.

995
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,095
Of course.

996
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:24,099
I'm on my way. See you.

997
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,688
Excuse me. I need to go on a date.

998
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,651
How's he going to get out of this?

999
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,653
I don't know.

1000
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,282
By the way, I wonder how Dong-goo
and Yoon-ah are doing.

1001
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,576
He's probably giving her an earful.

1002
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,286
You're right.

1003
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:46,872
Blow.

1004
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,791
Harder. Come on.

1005
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,959
Blow!

1006
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,046
Look how nasty.

1007
00:52:55,797 --> 00:53:00,302
Yoon-ah, let me tell you one more time
that I'm not the type to--

1008
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,970
-Shut it!
-Okay.

1009
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,605
Why is your face so filthy?

1010
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,108
I got myself a big baby
now that Sol isn't here.

1011
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,286
We're here.

1012
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,079
This is where I live.

1013
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,748
I see.

1014
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,375
It's late. You should go on in.

1015
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,837
I don't want to say goodbye.

1016
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,965
Would you like to come in
for a cup of tea?

1017
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,508
Tea?

1018
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:44,179
No, that's quite all right. No, thanks.

1019
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,097
You must be tired. Go up and rest.

1020
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,349
I'm fine.

1021
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:48,934
Let's go inside.

1022
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:49,851
-Where?
-Come on.

1023
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,853
Hye-jin...

1024
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,282
Pardon me.

1025
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,117
Welcome to my place.

1026
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,331
Jeez.

1027
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,546
I'll stay for just one cup of tea, then.

1028
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,674
Okay.

1029
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,218
Wait here. I'll go make coffee.

1030
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,135
Okay.

1031
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,821
-Oh, no!
-Who is it?

1032
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,573
What the hell is that jerk doing here?

1033
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,492
Hye-jin, open the door.

1034
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,495
-Hye-jin, it's me.
-Shit.

1035
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,039
-Let's talk.
-There's something I haven't told you.

1036
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,625
There's this guy I was seeing.

1037
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,087
I'll make it clear and end it right now,
so don't take it the wrong way, okay?

1038
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,339
No, don't. Please.

1039
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,383
Don't do anything!

1040
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,885
Hye-jin, are you really doing this to me?

1041
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,220
I know...

1042
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,639
you're inside, damn it!

1043
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,267
I saw you

1044
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,768
going in there with that jerk!

1045
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,729
Don't worry.
I'll make sure this doesn't affect you.

1046
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,105
But it will.

1047
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,482
Please don't do a thing. I beg of you!

1048
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:23,695
I have no choice
but to unlock the door myself.

1049
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,322
Don't open it. No! Don't do it!

1050
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,000
What do you think you're doing?

1051
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,419
You reek of alcohol!

1052
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,046
Did you drink again?

1053
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,881
Yeah, I did. So what?

1054
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,175
Anyway, where's the guy?

1055
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,135
Where is he?

1056
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,553
What's wrong with you?

1057
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,473
Who are you to concern yourself
with whom I date?

1058
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,266
Where did you hide him?

1059
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,769
Let's see that smartass face of his.

1060
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,272
So this is where he is.

1061
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,648
Damn it!

1062
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,317
Open up, you bastard!

1063
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,821
I'll break the door in if you don't!

1064
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,409
Where is he?

1065
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,454
Come out here. Come out, you shit.

1066
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,084
Where are you going? Stop right there!

1067
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,001
Shit, man!

1068
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:24,798
Gosh!

1069
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,678
Got you! Finally.

1070
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,806
You dare steal my woman?

1071
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,766
Let me take a look at you.

1072
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,768
Take this off.

1073
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,813
Get rid of it now!

1074
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,314
Damn it!

1075
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:43,233
What the...

1076
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,944
Let me see--

1077
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,990
Huh?

1078
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,326
You...

1079
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,247
Hello, Director.

1080
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,207
It's Lee Joon-ki.

1081
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,211
So, you're Hye-jin's new boyfriend?

1082
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,337
It's a misunderstanding.

1083
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,756
There was that fender bender with Hye-jin,

1084
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,342
and she suddenly asked me out,
which is why I was forced to say yes and--

1085
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,010
So you said yes!

1086
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,471
I don't like her.

1087
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,515
She's not my type.

1088
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,683
Joon-ki!

1089
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,478
Hye-jin.

1090
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,689
That's not what I meant. I, uh...

1091
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:26,985
Director, you have me all wrong.
What happened is that the director...

1092
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,987
No, I mean, the writer. Wait.

1093
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,449
I'm the director, you assface!

1094
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,033
And I'm Lee Joon-ki.

1095
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,786
Come here, you!

1096
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,375
Why do you live like that?

1097
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,463
It's not like I knew this would happen.

1098
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,717
They won't fire me, will they?

1099
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,885
I doubt that.

1100
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:55,430
The writer's a professional. She won't be
petty and take revenge on you.

1101
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,850
So, I'll be okay, right?

1102
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,226
You'll be fine.

1103
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,565
I'll be fine.

1104
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,945
Dong-goo, are you all right?

1105
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,075
Your fever's getting worse.

1106
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,119
I'm fine.

1107
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,330
I'll be better once I get some sleep.

1108
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,766
Why aren't you sleeping?

1109
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,310
I want to read.

1110
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,443
Do you still want to be a pastry chef?

1111
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,947
Yes, it's my dream.

1112
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,076
I won't ever give up, for Sol's sake.

1113
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,703
You really are stubborn.

1114
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,666
Sorry, can you pass me my phone?

1115
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,629
Hello?

1116
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,090
Excuse me?

1117
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,426
No, I'm not interested!
I have enough loans as it is!

1118
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,053
Hang up for me, Yoon-ah.

1119
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,888
Don't these people sleep?

1120
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,473
Jeez.

1121
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,353
Who is this, Dong-goo?

1122
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,356
My mom.

1123
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,191
She's beautiful.

1124
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,445
I've never heard you talk about your mom.

1125
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,241
She passed away.

1126
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,954
Oh, I see.

1127
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,336
What kind of person was she?

1128
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,046
My mom?

1129
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:57,594
Well... she was stubborn, picky,
and was always nagging me.

1130
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:01,055
Just like you, when she made up her mind
about something,

1131
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,474
she never gave up.

1132
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,769
Gosh, I remember getting beatings
as a kid.

1133
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,064
She must've been very tough.

1134
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,317
She was a softie, though,

1135
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:17,196
and would stay up all night
to take care of my wounds.

1136
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:21,826
Don't you miss her?

1137
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,538
Of course I do.

1138
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,249
I miss her so much,

1139
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,293
but I can't see her.

1140
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,550
You sound worse than before.

1141
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,594
Sleep.

1142
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,471
Yeah, I better.

1143
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,163
What is this?

1144
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,710
Why is this...

1145
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,217
Was it Yoon-ah?

1146
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,722
Goodness.

1147
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,442
I fell asleep.

1148
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,490
I wonder if his fever broke.

1149
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,496
That's much better.

1150
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,998
I'm so glad.

1151
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,425
Dong-goo, are you sleeping?

1152
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,391
Hey, Dong-goo.

1153
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,277
That's better.

1154
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,696
I nearly died.

1155
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,201
Oh, no.

1156
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,541
The smell...

1157
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,796
Didn't you miss me, Sol?

1158
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,883
Mommy missed you so much!

1159
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,426
I really missed you!

1160
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,554
Thank you for taking care of Sol.
I'm sorry.

1161
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,140
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

1162
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,394
Joon-ki's drama is on.

1163
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,271
Don't watch it.

1164
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,148
I said don't, please.

1165
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,400
It's your drama debut. We have to watch.

1166
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,778
-Where's the remote?
-There he is.

1167
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,280
We've arrived, sir.

1168
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,198
He's on.

1169
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,074
I won't leave them alone.

1170
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,368
How dare they covet my position?

1171
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,996
I'll show them who's boss
at today's board meeting.

1172
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,207
-Hey, Kim.
-Yes, sir.

1173
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,667
-Would you like a piece of candy?
-Out of nowhere?

1174
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,462
-Thank you, sir.
-Don't watch.

1175
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,557
What's wrong?

1176
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,353
Hey! Kim!

1177
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,397
Who knew we'd lose you like that?
I'm sorry, Kim.

1178
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,151
We must go on, so let's forget him

1179
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,237
-and get me a new driver.
-Yes, sir.

1180
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,738
-What the hell?
-Yes, sir.

1181
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,824
That's it? You eat a piece of candy
and then you die?

1182
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:48,950
We won't see you anymore?

1183
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,326
No.

1184
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,162
Wow, she really holds a grudge,
doesn't she?

1185
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,747
How can she kill you off like that?

1186
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,129
Where've you been?
Joon-ki's drama just aired.

1187
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,341
I watched it on my phone.
He ate a candy and died.

1188
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,303
Joon-ki,
what kind of candy was it? Mint?

1189
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,015
How is that important right now?

1190
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,269
Yeah, it was mint. Happy?

1191
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,186
Really?

1192
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:22,066
It's the mint candy's fault.
Why take it out on me?

1193
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,239
Yoon-ah, take this.

1194
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,407
What is it?

1195
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,284
You said you want to become a pastry chef.

1196
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:36,330
You can't become one by just studying
and baking at home.

1197
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,165
You need to get yourself licensed.

1198
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,167
I don't have money for that.

1199
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,711
You don't have to pay.

1200
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,463
Apparently there's government-funded aid
for single moms.

1201
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,757
-Really?
-Yes.

1202
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,636
I looked around and there's a decent
baking school nearby.

1203
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,931
Come with me tomorrow to apply for the aid
and take a look around the school.

1204
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,184
Thank you, Dong-goo.

1205
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,395
There you go again.

1206
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,564
Stop it with the waterworks!

1207
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,735
Thank you, Dong-goo.

1208
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:11,073
What? Why are you blushing?

1209
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,871
I'm not.

1210
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,372
She was suffocating me, that's why.

1211
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,210
Why would you hug me like that?
What a strange woman.

1212
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:27,006
Huh? He's stuttering.
What's up?

1213
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,718
Have you developed feelings for Yoon-ah
after cohabitating on the roof?

1214
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,012
What are you talking about?
You're wrong!

1215
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,518
Goodness.

1216
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,978
Something's up.

1217
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,065
Let's watch something else.
He's already dead.

1218
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,946
What the hell? Feelings?

1219
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,782
Why did you blush, you moron!

1220
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,201
No way.

1221
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,746
That can't be.

1222
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,207
There's no way.

1223
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,731
I met him in class,

1224
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,817
and he dropped me off on his way home.

1225
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,068
He's great.

1226
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,737
He's good-looking, sensitive.
You should date him, Yoon-ah.

1227
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,489
How can you say he's great?
You barely met him.

1228
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,950
He seems a bit off.
Yoon-ah, watch out for him.

1229
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,744
-Dong-goo, do you like Yoon-ah?
-Do you want to be in our movie?

1230
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,080
Shin Soo-jung,
the icon of innocent and sexy?

1231
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,331
I'll do the bed scene!

1232
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,251
You have to lose 10kg in one week?
Ask Seo-jin to help you.

1233
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:46,836
Let's go again!

1234
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,170
Bed scene!

1235
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,296
We do not walk!

1236
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,508
Shin Soo-jung! Bed scene!

1237
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,468
You'll end up dead, Joon-ki.

1238
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,679
Hi, I came to collect rent.

1239
01:06:56,762 --> 01:07:00,349
The past due rent and interest will be
collected by auctioning off said items.

1240
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,059
Do you want to close shop
or get married?

1241
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,310
A wedding?

1242
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,272
Did you say Wheesung?
He'll sing at the wedding?

1243
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,692
-Kiss the bride!
-Kiss the bride!

1244
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,652
Kiss the bride!

1245
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:15,322
Dong-goo, what am I going to do?
