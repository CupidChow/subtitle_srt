Look at them.

00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,211
Not a hint of discomfort
despite all this activity.

15
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,754
Still don't believe me?

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,215
One, two, three!

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,468
Oh my God!

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,555
-Goodness.
-Damn it!

CHEER UP

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,281
Dear God, Buddha, please.
Let me at least get in somewhere.

24
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,742
I promise I'll go to church and to temple.

25
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,412
Namo Amitabha Buddha. Amen.

26
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,708
-Seo-jin, what are you doing?
-Praying.

27
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,294
I just submitted my job applications.
Twenty-five, to be exact.

28
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,089
I hope it works out.

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,510
Oh, it's that guy.
He's a really good actor.

30
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,720
What was his name again?
Lee... Lee something.

31
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,264
Who, Uncle Deok-hwa?

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,933
What do you mean, Uncle Deok-hwa?
Do you know him?

33
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,309
He's Joon-ki's dad.

34
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,770
What? He's Joon-ki's dad?

35
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,939
How fascinating.

36
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,692
I'm going to ask Joon-ki
for his dad's autograph.

37
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:34,154
No, you can't.
He doesn't like to talk about his dad.

38
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,698
-Why?
-Well, the thing is,

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,950
-Uncle Deok-hwa--
-Okay, thank you.

40
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,204
What is it? What's going on?

41
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,790
Is it just me?

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,668
You wench.
You talking shit about me?

43
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,170
What did you say, you hairy wench?

44
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,255
You've got it all wrong.

45
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,173
Come clean if you don't want an earful.

46
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,301
OMG. OMG!

47
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,886
What's all the fuss about?

48
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,180
You've become a hot star, Joon-ki!
Look at this.

49
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,640
What is it?

50
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,225
"Who is the man
from the home shopping program"?

51
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,560
Who are you?

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,061
What the hell?

53
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,397
What is this?

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,899
-Amazing.
-This is amazing.

55
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,066
What the hell?

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,067
No!

57
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,236
Your face is all over the Internet
right now.

58
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,488
They even gave you a nickname.
Guess what it is?

59
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,867
What "Boy"?

60
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,994
-Aren't these memes just awesome?
-Don't laugh, you brats!

61
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,581
Masters of Photoshop, all of them.
Seriously.

62
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,500
-Hello?
-Take a closer look.

63
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,421
Yes, yes. I said don't!

64
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,797
Yes, speaking.

65
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,216
Excuse me?

66
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,511
Yes, thank you. Bye.

67
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,889
What is it? Who called?

68
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,057
That was a movie agency.

69
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,269
They want to cast me in a role.
They were impressed with my performance.

70
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,897
What did they see you in?

71
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,318
You mean they saw Pink Boy?

72
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,196
-No way.
-Stop it with the "Boy" nonsense.

73
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,158
This is the script and filming schedule.

74
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,245
Are you serious? I don't need to audition?
I got the part?

75
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,331
You think I'm pulling your leg?

76
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,000
No, that's not what I meant.

77
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,462
Can you tell me about the role?

78
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,798
Our movie is about a mom
who takes revenge

79
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,008
on those who abducted her daughter.

80
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,427
You're one of the accomplices
who abducted the girl.

81
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,137
Will I have any lines?

82
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,847
Not a lot, but sure.

83
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,599
There's a scene
where you're up against the lead.

84
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,810
Then can you tell me who the lead
is played by?

85
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,019
The star?

86
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,605
Kim Hee-ja.

87
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,731
Kim Hee-ja?

88
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,692
Kim Hee-ja from Desert?

89
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,403
The greatest actress in Korea,
that Kim Hee-ja?

90
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,696
That's what I'm telling you.

91
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,616
So prepare thoroughly for your role, okay?

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,827
Yes, sir. I'll do my best!

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,744
Thank you!

94
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,960
So? Does it taste good?

95
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,505
Yes. It's delicious.

96
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,842
When can we have some rice?

97
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,012
We've only eaten bread for days,
so I'm kind of getting sick--

98
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:05,805
Just eat.

99
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,599
What if she suddenly decides
to rap again?

100
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,059
Fine, I'll eat.

101
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,229
Take your time. I made plenty.

102
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,733
Guys!

103
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,359
The most amazing thing happened.

104
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,446
I was cast in a movie today!

105
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,072
Know who I'm working with?

106
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,241
The best actress in Korea...

107
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,577
Kim Hee-ja!

108
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,162
-Kim Hee-ja?
-Kim Hee-ja, really?

109
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,622
-So what's your role?
-I get murdered by her.

110
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,875
No wonder. You're an extra again.

111
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,418
But I have lines this time.

112
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,170
Anyway, that's great.

113
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,796
Shouldn't we throw him a party
to celebrate?

114
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,673
We can have
some spicy stew with rice and--

115
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,634
Sorry, but I have to go over the script.
Don't have time for that.

116
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,552
Let's celebrate next time!

117
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,222
-Kim Hee-ja!
-Joon-ki, I... I just want some rice.

118
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,557
He's ecstatic.

119
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,894
Doo-sik, take a new one
since you dropped yours.

120
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,729
Thanks.

121
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,947
Hello, sir!

122
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,366
Goodness. I died because of you!

123
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,744
Sorry, sir.

124
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,872
-So, did you practice your lines?
-Day and night for a week, sir.

125
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,667
I don't see Ms. Kim anywhere.

126
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,127
She'll be here soon.

127
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,754
There she is.

128
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,554
It's Ms. Kim.

129
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,015
Ms. Kim, it's nice to meet you.

130
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,272
What's wrong with her?

131
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,441
She's in character.

132
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,361
Her daughter was abducted, you see.

133
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,613
That's why she won't eat, sleep or go home

134
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,241
while we're shooting the movie.

135
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,201
She'll lose hold of her emotions,
she says.

136
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,328
She's really something.

137
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,539
Beat him! And choke.

138
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,253
She's the best actress in Korea
for a reason.

139
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,758
The scene we'll shoot now is when the mom
comes to see the accomplice.

140
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,970
She finally meets the culprit
and is enraged.

141
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,180
And the accomplice is trembling with fear.

142
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,933
The enraged mom comes to blows
with the accomplice

143
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,602
and she gets so worked up
that she ends up killing him.

144
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
Got it?

145
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,481
-Let's rehearse it first.
-Yes, Director!

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,954
Who is it?

147
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,665
Who is it?

148
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,791
Who is it that you'd--

149
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,294
How'd you get here?

150
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,304
Where's my daughter?
Where is Soo-jin?

151
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,847
Tell me, you son of a bitch!

152
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,142
-This is only a rehearsal!
-What? Rehearsal?

153
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,023
Tell me where Soo-jin is!

154
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,900
Tell me!

155
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,901
I can't...

156
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,195
My daughter!

157
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,032
Hee-ja, enough!

158
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,284
Joon-ki, wake up!

159
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,577
Wake up!

160
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,457
Are you okay?

161
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,922
I saw the light.

162
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,090
God, this could've been bad.

163
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,093
Sorry, Director. I was so engrossed
in the scene that I...

164
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,597
Are you all right, Joon-ki?

165
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,935
Yes, I'm fine.

166
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,104
Director, I'll go calm down a bit.

167
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,026
This movie will be the death of me.

168
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,111
I told her enough is enough. Sheesh.

169
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,155
What if someone gets hospitalized again?

170
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,159
-Hospitalized?
-The guy who had this role before you

171
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,495
ended up in the hospital
after being beaten by Hee-ja.

172
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,580
-Four weeks until he fully recovers.
-What?

173
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,292
So be smart about how you're hit.
Got it?

174
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,421
Yes, sir...

175
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,345
Are you ready, Joon-ki?

176
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,806
Yes. Yes, I am.

177
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,980
How'd you... get... here?

178
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,820
Where is my daughter?

179
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,282
Tell me, you son of a bitch!

180
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,326
Blood!

181
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,829
No... please, ma'am!

182
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,040
-Ouch!
-Where is she?

183
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,921
Stop. Hee-ja, enough!

184
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,633
No, no...!

185
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,969
-Please, no!
-Don't, Hee-ja!

186
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,061
-You shot this birthday video?
-Yes.

187
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,067
Wow, it's so pretty.

188
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,652
Look how adorable the baby is.

189
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,237
So cute.

190
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,447
Cute, my ass.

191
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,075
After this, I became a firm believer
that human nature is fundamentally evil.

192
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,910
Humans are born evil. I know it.

193
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,455
Really? That's how you talk about a baby?

194
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,999
You haven't seen them cry
and throw fits.

195
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,294
When a baby cries, the mom calls me over
to make him laugh.

196
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,590
Does she think I'm a comedian?
How am I supposed to make him laugh?

197
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,301
-What's so difficult about that?
-You think it's easy?

198
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,844
It is. Watch.

199
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,929
Sol.

200
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,182
A-buru buru buru-buru buru-- hung?

201
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,227
A-buru buru buru-buru buru-- hung?

202
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,982
What? She laughed right away.

203
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,110
What did you just say to her?

204
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,780
-"Ah-bu" what?
-A-buru buru-- huh?

205
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,449
A-buru bu... pung?

206
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,911
-Hung.
-Not pung, hung.

207
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,204
-Fung?
-No.

208
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,542
Stay on that note and go "hung."

209
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,461
Oh, I see. Hung.

210
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,421
Do you... do you have anything else?

211
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,798
Something else?

212
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,467
Take Sol for a sec.

213
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,011
-Come here, Sol.
-How about...

214
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,555
Oh no, where's Mommy?

215
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,516
Where did she go?

216
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,143
Here she is!

217
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,814
Unbelievable. That's amazing!

218
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,482
Awesome.

219
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,403
"Where's Mommy? Here she is."

220
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,571
You have to go a little higher
with this one.

221
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,240
-Ti...
-Ti...

222
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,075
-Here she is!
-Here she is!

223
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,034
That's it.

224
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,162
"Here she is!" on a "ti" note.

225
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,707
-I'm home,
-Hey, Joon-ki--

226
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,708
What the hell happened?

227
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,293
I was slightly injured--

228
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,296
during the shoot.

229
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,715
How'd you get hurt so badly?

230
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,634
Hee-ja was totally

231
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,845
immersed in her role.

232
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,848
Regardless of that,
how can she beat someone up like this?

233
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,434
Next time she may actually kill you.

234
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,019
I'm fine.
It's all in the name of acting, after all.

235
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,230
It's all right. I'm fi--

236
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,445
Joon-ki.

237
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,448
Did he just fall asleep?

238
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,908
-Is he breathing?
-Goodness, gracious.

239
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,579
What a tumultuous life, man. Seriously.

240
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,460
I saw the light...!

241
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,506
Is he talking in his sleep now?

242
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,009
-What's wrong with him?
-Are you really okay?

243
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,512
I can't do this. No! Please stop!

244
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,270
Today's scene is a continuation
from yesterday.

245
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,481
After the mom kills the accomplice,

246
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,108
she wails like a crazy person.
Absolutely loses it.

247
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,694
You're dead, Joon-ki.
Don't move a muscle.

248
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,446
-Got it?
-Yes, Director.

249
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,906
Let's do this.

250
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,431
Where is my daughter?

251
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,392
Where is Soo-jin?

252
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,896
Tell me where Soo-jin is!

253
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,813
Tell me!

254
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,608
-Tell me!
-Please... save... me...

255
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,194
I asked, where is she?

256
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,371
Where is she?

257
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,623
You scumbag.

258
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,918
Where is she... Tell me!

259
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,755
Where is she?

260
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:14,979
That was great!

261
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,065
Gosh.

262
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,276
Hee-ja, you're acting was spot-on.

263
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,363
I got goosebumps just watching you!

264
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,073
Well done, Joon-ki.

265
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,827
I was worried we'd have to redo the scene,
but you got through it.

266
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,537
Thank you, sir.

267
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,665
Sorry, but I need to use the restroom.

268
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,794
What do you think of him? Not bad, eh?

269
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,421
I guess.

270
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,798
He's pretty good at acting,
but above all

271
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,925
I like his attitude.

272
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,095
Where'd you find a guy like him?

273
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,097
Oh, him?

274
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,266
Well...

275
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,533
I almost died.
Why'd that have to fall into my mouth?

276
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,373
Joon-ki, you did good!

277
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,586
The world is finally starting
to take notice of my acting.

278
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,547
-Hello.
-Hi.

279
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,008
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

280
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,097
What's up with him today?

281
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,766
He's been like this since morning.

282
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,102
Ma'am, I'll take a few shots of Jang-goon
before we begin.

283
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,773
Jang-goon isn't feeling great right now.
What should we do?

284
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,232
So I was thinking...

285
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,110
-You want me to make him laugh?
-How did you know?

286
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,488
Par for the course
after the look you gave me.

287
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,405
I'll give it a try.

288
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,160
Here we go.

289
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,791
Ah buru-buru hung! Hung!

290
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,294
Ah buru-buru hung?

291
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,463
Ah buru-buru hung?

292
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,132
What are you doing?
You're making it worse!

293
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,550
No worries. I have another trick.

294
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,010
Jang-goon.

295
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,764
Uncle Dong-goo is missing.
Where did he go?

296
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,183
Here he is!

297
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,020
What do you think you're doing?
You're about to give me a stroke.

298
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,939
It's okay, Jang-goon.

299
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,483
That's odd. It worked when Yoon-ah did it.

300
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,610
What'll I do?

301
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,862
A-buru buru buru-buru buru-- hung!

302
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,574
A-buru buru buru-buru buru-- hung!

303
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,494
Where did Auntie go?

304
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,412
Here she is!

305
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,665
-How sweet are you!
-Jeez.

306
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,792
What the heck?
He's such a happy baby!

307
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,169
Is this why you called me so urgently?

308
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,381
It's odd. He threw a fit when I did it.

309
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,134
You're very good with babies.

310
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,218
I feel better now.

311
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,971
Ow.

312
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:54,972
Is the pain back?

313
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,016
You have to go see a doctor.

314
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,517
What about Jang-goon?

315
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,477
Your mother's almost here.

316
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,439
You should go.
I can look after the baby.

317
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,606
Will you?

318
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,818
Sorry for the trouble, but could you
change him into this as well?

319
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,112
Sure. Don't worry.

320
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,780
I'll take good care of him.

321
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,323
Please. Thank you.

322
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,908
See you.

323
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,164
He's an odd one, I tell you.
I did it just like you did.

324
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,625
Babies can instinctively tell
good people from evil ones.

325
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,045
So are you saying I'm evil?

326
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,838
-That's not exactly--
-Shut it!

327
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,548
I'm going to the restroom.
Keep your eyes on him.

328
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,347
How pretty.

329
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,350
I wonder how much all this costs.

330
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,854
Oh, that's right.
He has to change into this.

331
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,898
Let's see.

332
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,319
It's so cute!

333
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,654
Sol would look adorable in this.

334
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,406
Right, Sol? Look at this.

335
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,121
Good work. Thank you.

336
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,916
You always praise me.
What can I say?

337
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,751
Thank you, Director.

338
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,795
Good job, Joon-ki.

339
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,756
Everyone worked so hard today.

340
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,716
Let's all go out
for some pork belly with soju.

341
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,093
Yeah!

342
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,095
You should come.

343
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,597
You're coming too, right, Hee-ja?

344
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,642
What did you just call me?

345
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,021
Director, I'm going to turn in early.
I'm a bit tired.

346
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,232
Hey.

347
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,359
Goodbye, Ms. Kim.

348
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,653
Why-- is it something I did?

349
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,779
No, it's nothing.

350
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,366
Hee-ja! Wait up!

351
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,080
Hee-ja. You can't leave like this.

352
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,332
I'm not in the mood to go out.

353
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,708
Is it because of what I said?

354
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,379
I despise kids like him who act up
because someone has their back.

355
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,381
You know darn well

356
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,258
how much Deok-hwa helped me out
when I was down and out.

357
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,594
How can I say no when he asked me
to cast his son?

358
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,805
What are you talking about?

359
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,519
Joon-ki, it's not what you think.

360
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,521
What did you just say?

361
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,819
Hi pretty girl, look over here.

362
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,155
Look how pretty you are.

363
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,323
Over here. Good girl.

364
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,408
Look over here.

365
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,201
-What are you doing, Yoon-ah?
-Gosh, you scared me.

366
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,744
Why are you so startled?

367
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,496
Why are you taking pictures
of someone else's kid?

368
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,040
I thought it was Sol from a distance.

369
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,878
It is Sol.

370
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,630
What's going on here?

371
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,965
-The thing is--
-I mean,

372
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,842
the guests will see!
What are you thinking?

373
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,135
I'm so sorry. Actually--

374
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,137
Forget it. Just change their clothes.
Hurry.

375
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,389
-Seriously.
-Jang-goon!

376
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,186
Oh, my goodness.

377
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,523
Look at my precious Jang-goon.

378
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,318
It's been so long.

379
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,362
Grandma's been in the States,
so I haven't seen you

380
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,990
since you were a newborn.

381
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,992
What a handsome boy.

382
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,827
-Right?
-He's so well-behaved.

383
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,205
Why has he lost so much weight?

384
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,082
His cheeks were about to burst
in all the photos.

385
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,126
He's lost weight.

386
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,794
That's probably not true...

387
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,423
By the way, who are you?

388
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:20,385
Photographers for the party.

389
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,887
Grandma, you must be tired.

390
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,180
Let us take him.

391
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,473
No, I'm fine.

392
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,810
Do you know how long it's been
since I held him?

393
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,064
Jang-goon right here is the only son

394
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,608
for the eighth generation
of our family clan.

395
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,402
Do you know his parents went through
hell and high water,

396
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:42,366
with IVF and whatnot,
just so they could have a son? Goodness.

397
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,742
I have to interview you.

398
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,245
A few words for your grandson?

399
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,248
-We'll take Jang-goon.
-You can film me while I hold him.

400
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,499
I can just hold him.

401
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,459
Wouldn't it look better that way?

402
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,755
You can't... really...!
This is driving me insane.

403
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,011
Did you do a poo-poo,
my little Jang-goon?

404
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,471
Wait one second.

405
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,682
Grandma will change your diaper,
Jang-goon.

406
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,268
No! You can't!
We'll do it.

407
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,311
You know kids these days,
quite the stinkers.

408
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,731
-I'll do it, Grandma.
-No, it's fine. I'll do it.

409
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:19,236
Can Grandma see your little wee-wee?

410
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,738
You want to see his wee-wee?

411
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,075
-Really?
-Here you go, Jang-goon.

412
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,952
Let's see your wee-wee now.

413
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,745
Let's have a look-see.

414
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,877
What are you doing?

415
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,214
He's just a baby,
but he still needs his privacy.

416
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,924
Privacy, my foot!

417
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,430
What's the matter with you?

418
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,934
Grandma. He may be young
but you have to respect his rights.

419
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,394
This is a violation of his rights.

420
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,397
Violation of his rights! What nonsense.

421
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,110
What's wrong with you?

422
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,030
Are you messing with me?

423
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,865
I was traumatized as a child

424
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,118
whenever my grandma
would talk about my wee-wee.

425
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,537
It hurts me to this day.

426
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,790
What a load of bull!

427
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,377
-You can't do this, ma'am.
-Look at you.

428
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,504
Take your hands off. Now.

429
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,174
Take your hands off of him!

430
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,426
-Take them off now!
-You really can't do this!

431
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,677
You fool.

432
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,347
-Dong-goo!
-What a stubborn ass!

433
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,183
You can't, Grandma!

434
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,519
You should've listened to me. Jeez.

435
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,855
-Grandma, you can't!
-Let's take a look now.

436
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,482
Jang-goon's wee-wee...

437
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,624
What...!

438
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,668
What is this?

439
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,712
Where...

440
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,382
Where is Jang-goon's... wee-wee?

441
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,969
-Grandma!
-Oh, no! Grandma!

442
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,097
Sorry, Sol.

443
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,778
What brings you here?

444
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,071
Why did you do it?

445
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,615
Why'd you do it again?

446
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,617
What the hell are you talking about?

447
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,410
I heard everything from Director Kim.

448
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,665
I asked you to please stop.

449
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,126
I'm busting my chops to make it
on my own.

450
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,627
Why do you keep doing this?

451
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,755
Then do well on your own.

452
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:48,552
I watched you
on that home shopping program.

453
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,181
Goodness, what a disgrace.

454
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,642
Yeah, I asked him.

455
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,563
I felt bad having to see my only child
go through all that.

456
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,398
Is that so wrong?

457
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,733
I want to have a clear conscience.

458
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,570
-What's wrong with that?
-Because I'm your son.

459
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,239
Because I am the son
of actor Lee Deok-hwa,

460
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,782
the man I admire most in this world.

461
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,995
That's why I want to make it

462
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,247
on my own, without your help.

463
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:22,669
That way, I'll be able
to hold my head high in front of you.

464
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:28,258
So please... can you just trust me?

465
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,845
That's all I want from you.

466
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,638
I get what you mean, but--

467
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,684
Fine, punk.
Go on home shopping programs

468
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,604
or spend your life as an extra
for all I care.

469
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,898
What a brat.

470
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:48,069
Hey, by the way.
What's up with the pink underwear?

471
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,987
You're a man!

472
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,948
-It's sexy.
-Jeez.

473
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,952
Okay, let's go inside.

474
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,954
Have dinner at home.

475
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:02,042
That's okay. I have to be somewhere.

476
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,504
Hey, Joon-ki!

477
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,970
I guess I didn't do such a bad job
raising that one.

478
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,313
I'm sorry about everything.

479
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,315
You didn't know.

480
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,360
It's still my fault.

481
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,861
I apologize.

482
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,200
Thanks for dinner. Good night, sir.

483
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,411
Joon-ki!

484
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,289
Gosh, that kid.

485
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,336
Hey. How's the grandma?

486
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,798
Really? That's a relief.

487
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,802
I'm sorry about today.
I'll take full responsibility.

488
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,428
Sorry.

489
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,013
Bye.

490
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,850
What happened? Everything all right?

491
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,894
Yeah, I guess.

492
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,146
What were you thinking?

493
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,899
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

494
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,818
How can you do that
at someone else's celebration?

495
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,615
I felt bad, that's why.
I felt bad for Sol.

496
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:24,416
Poor Sol got me for a mom, and...

497
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,337
she was never once congratulated
on being born,

498
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:35,051
and never got any pretty clothes,
or even a toy.

499
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,807
So I wanted a proper
100th-day photo, that's all.

500
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,102
I'm so sorry.

501
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:58,783
Today we bring you
the Automatic Bright Smile Corrector.

502
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:03,330
In just three minutes a day,
we guarantee a natural smile.

503
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,582
How does it feel?

504
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,627
It's much easier to smile.

505
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,421
I see. It's easier to smile.

506
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:15,175
Can you tell us specifically
how it has helped you to smile?

507
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,179
-Specifically?
-Specifically.

508
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,221
A detailed account.

509
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,309
Well...

510
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,480
my lips tend to make an upside-down
U-shape

511
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,940
but now my lips curl upwards.

512
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,904
My smile has become much more natural.

513
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,576
What the hell is this?

514
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,996
I can't believe she made me talk
through that.

515
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,916
Ow, my chin hurts.

516
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,587
There's no way this can go viral, can it?

517
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,839
Damn it!

518
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,095
Who's calling now?

519
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,597
Hello?

520
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,558
Yes, speaking.

521
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,397
Pardon?
You want to meet with me?

522
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,703
-Excuse me.
-Leave it there.

523
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,955
Okay.

524
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,000
Wait, no. You called me earlier?
I'm Lee Joon-ki.

525
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,880
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

526
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,173
Hello.

527
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,843
Why did you want to see me?

528
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:44,305
I'm starting work on a new morning drama.
You were recommended for a role.

529
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,974
Recommended?

530
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,104
By whom? Who recommended me?

531
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,857
-I did.
-She's here.

532
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,527
Ms. Kim, how are you?

533
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,653
-Good to see you.
-Hello.

534
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,822
Hello.

535
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,449
Why did you...?

536
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,244
Director Choi was looking for a new face
who's a talented actor.

537
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,329
You don't have the looks,
but you are talented.

538
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,331
That's why I recommended you.

539
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,792
-Don't you want to do it?
-Of course I do.

540
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,627
Thank you!

541
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,880
It's up to you now to get cast, all right?

542
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,591
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

543
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,802
Hee-ja, take this script.
It's for the drama--

544
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,429
-Thanks again!
-I'll call you!

545
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,859
Yoon-ah. Come out for a sec.

546
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,361
Why?

547
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,946
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

548
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,239
Surprise.

549
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,328
SOL'S 100TH DAY

550
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,916
CONGRATULATIONS SOL!
FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS

551
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,753
100TH DAY
GROW UP TO BE HEALTHY AND WISE

552
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,463
What is all this?

553
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,425
What do you think? Come here.

554
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,261
Ta-da. It's for Sol's 100th day.

555
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,266
It's not much,
but we put it together ourselves,

556
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,060
so we ask for your understanding.

557
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,564
Not at all. It's beautiful.

558
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,233
Thank you so much.

559
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,861
Don't mention it.
Actually, you should thank Dong-goo.

560
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,155
It was his idea.

561
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,451
-You don't have to tell her that.
-Really? Thank you, Dong-goo.

562
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,412
I was just afraid
you'd do something stupid again.

563
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,500
Stop it with the waterworks!

564
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,711
Crying's become a total habit for you.

565
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,547
Sorry.

566
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,715
It's really beautiful.

567
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,011
Huh? There's no cake.

568
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,473
It would've been even more perfect
with a cake.

569
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,230
The cake has arrived!

570
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,816
Of course we prepared a cake.

571
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,234
What would it be without one?

572
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,822
-Thank you.
-There you go again.

573
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,616
Seo-jin, light the candles before
this place becomes flooded with tears.

574
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,868
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

575
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,995
You got champagne as well?

576
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,913
Good call, Joon-ki!

577
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,498
This is for me.

578
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,418
-For what?
-I, uh...

579
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,753
I was cast in a morning drama.

580
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,423
I'm a regular!

581
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,174
Wow.

582
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,551
A regular? Really?

583
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,011
I am the lead character's

584
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,637
chauffeur.

585
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,765
-No wonder.
-So you're really an extra.

586
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,602
Hey, now. We can talk later.

587
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,312
Photos first.

588
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,147
-Okay.
-Photo time.

589
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,523
This way, Yoon-ah.

590
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,358
Turn it to the right.

591
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,902
Let's take pictures.

592
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,154
Places, everyone.

593
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,531
Get in there, Dong-goo.

594
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,158
-Smile.
-Okay.

595
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,911
I set the timer for ten seconds.
Smile, okay?

596
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,621
Make sure the candles are lit.

597
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,789
-Kimchi!
-Here we go.

598
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,292
-Kimchi!
-Kimchi!

599
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,209
Hold on.

600
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,796
We're missing a gold ring.

601
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,382
That would've made it really perfect.

602
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,092
-The ring...
-Yoon-ah.

603
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,011
Seo-jin, just go buy a ring.

604
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,679
Why the hell did we prepare this?

605
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,932
Right? Clear the table!

606
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,600
-Clear it!
-No, no.

607
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,560
-You want us to buy a ring?
-No, it's okay.

608
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,777
I'll start now.

609
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,574
Turning left.

610
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,410
Right turn coming up.

611
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,411
Yes, sir.

612
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,580
Reverse.

613
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,291
This? Or...

614
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,588
Turning left.

615
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,799
Right turn coming up.

616
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,135
Yes, sir. Reverse.

617
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,347
Which is better?

618
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,848
Be honest.

619
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,104
How are they different?
They seem identical.

620
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,522
What?

621
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,526
You punk. The first one was

622
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,027
a driver who works earnestly

623
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,612
no matter how small the task

624
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,239
to make it on his own.

625
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,116
The second driver was agitated and annoyed

626
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,242
and was barely working

627
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,995
just kissing the boss's ass!

628
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,248
Is that so?

629
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,207
You want to be a director

630
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,001
yet you can't see the subtle differences
in one's character?

631
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,293
Sorry.

632
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,798
It's my first-ever recurring role
in a drama. I'm in deep shit.

633
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:29,882
I know.

634
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,011
You think I should interview
some real-life chauffeurs?

635
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,305
There's no need for that.
You only have three lines.

636
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,932
You're a piece of work, Joon-ki.

637
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,851
Let him do what he wants.

638
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,185
What do you know about acting?

639
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,063
What's that, Yoon-ah?

640
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,066
Someone threw out a perfectly fine oven

641
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,984
so I brought it.

642
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,986
An oven? What for?

643
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,280
You said I should sell my muffins.

644
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,699
So I'm going to go into business.

645
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,034
Into business?

646
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,785
Then how will you work here?

647
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,787
I'll work on my business
in my spare time.

648
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,290
That's up to you.

649
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,332
But...

650
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,460
it can't interfere
with your work here, okay?

651
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,878
Don't worry.

652
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,421
Goodness.

653
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,590
Oh my God!

654
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,010
Sorry...

655
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:23,478
HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES

656
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,026
NEW MESSAGE FROM DAEYOUNG DAILY

657
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,361
-It's here.
-Check it.

658
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,533
-Joon-ki.
-Yeah?

659
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,161
My heart's about to burst.
Can you check it for me?

660
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,246
Jeez. Okay.

661
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,418
What does it say?

662
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,257
What are you going to do?

663
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,926
Seo-jin...

664
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,304
They...

665
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,724
want you to come interview.

666
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,768
You passed the first round!

667
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,020
Are you serious? Really?

668
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,522
See for yourself!

669
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,441
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
1ST ROUND - INTERVIEW DETAILS

670
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,736
I passed!

671
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,321
You still have to interview.

672
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,405
No time for tears.

673
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,657
I don't care.

674
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,992
I really want to work here.

675
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,119
Congratulations!

676
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,203
You can get in!

677
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,665
Enough. You should look at your face.

678
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,543
Do you smell something burning?

679
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,879
It's coming from the kitchen.
What is it?

680
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,048
What is that? Why is there smoke?

681
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,341
What's with the smoke?

682
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,135
-Gosh!
-There's so much smoke!

683
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,178
Oh my God!
I think the bread is burning!

684
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,472
-Then turn it off!
-Huh?

685
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,600
What's wrong with this?
I can't turn it off!

686
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,018
Seriously?

687
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,687
Just unplug it!

688
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,648
This could've been disastrous.

689
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,484
-I'm sorry. The timer must be faulty.
-Seriously.

690
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,611
Why'd they throw out a faulty oven?

691
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,283
Maybe because it's faulty.

692
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,160
-I see.
-"I see"?

693
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,953
You almost set the place on fire!

694
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,997
Why did you bring this home?

695
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,416
Let's go celebrate Seo-jin
getting through the first round.

696
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,333
You can stop now.

697
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,418
Gosh!

698
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,460
Enough, already.

699
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,087
-If it wasn't for Seo-jin's good news...
-Got it.

700
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,005
Seriously...

701
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,385
Yoon-ah, let's go join them.

702
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,721
No, I want to clean this mess up.

703
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,640
Okay. Come upstairs when you're done.

704
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,075
Okay, here I go!

705
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,577
Spin it!

706
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,995
-Spin it already!
-Go!

707
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,999
-Okay, Joon-ki!
-Joon-ki, you're up!

708
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,751
I guess it's my turn. Go.

709
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,044
Ask me anything you want.

710
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,629
I'll answer everything.

711
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,671
Who's first?

712
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,049
-I'll--
-Me! I want to go.

713
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,759
-Me, me, me.
-Fine.

714
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,763
Your first kiss. Who, when, where?

715
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,016
I must've been in the third grade.

716
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,977
Second grade, actually.

717
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,898
It was with the older girl next door
at the school playground.

718
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,568
We came down on the elephant slide

719
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,779
and shared a hot...

720
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,242
-Man, were Si-won's lips hot.
-Okay, stop.

721
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,410
-Man!
-I don't want to hear anymore.

722
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,954
So then what happened?

723
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,997
You're the one who asked. Be quiet!

724
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,582
-Si-won was...
-She hurt my feelings.

725
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,709
I brought some fruit.

726
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,044
Did you clean up the kitchen?

727
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,380
Yes, I did.

728
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,881
Did you ventilate? And the smell?

729
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,675
Stop being so hard on her.

730
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,094
-Sit down, Yoon-ah.
-No, it's okay.

731
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,221
Please sit. We're playing Truth or Dare.

732
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,514
Join us.

733
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,308
-Sit down.
-You're always rejecting us.

734
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,894
-I guess I'll join you then.
-Great.

735
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,396
Here we go again.

736
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,107
-Okay. Go!
-Ta-da!

737
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,692
Okay!

738
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,402
Yoon-ah, your turn.

739
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,488
What could we possibly ask Yoon-ah?

740
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,115
-Can you--
-Me! I want to go.

741
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,616
Me, me, me.

742
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,118
Are you an automatic question-asker?

743
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,744
I'm really curious about something.

744
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,788
What is it?

745
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,500
I want to know...

746
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,795
what happened with Sol's dad.

747
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,886
Why would you ask that?
It's a tough question to answer.

748
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,888
We're all curious, aren't we?

749
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,308
You're all just too afraid to ask.
Am I wrong?

750
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,268
It's all right.

751
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,520
There's nothing to hide.

752
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,814
Where do I begin?

753
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,238
What happened is...

754
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,995
That's what happened.

755
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,831
So...

756
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,834
you were left to live
with relatives because

757
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,128
your parents died in a fire
when you were two,

758
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,839
but your relatives took
the insurance settlement

759
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,007
and sent you to an orphanage?

760
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,136
And after that, you were abused
by the orphanage director and you ran away

761
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,097
and started working at a convenience store
when you met him?

762
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,142
You split up with him
because his parents didn't approve

763
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,019
and to make matters worse,
you found out you were pregnant

764
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,187
only after you broke up with him?

765
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,192
Wait.

766
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,903
Are you saying
Sol's dad knew about the pregnancy

767
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,279
but did nothing?

768
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,158
No, he doesn't know I had her.

769
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,618
Why not?

770
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,163
-Huh?
-The thing is...

771
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,043
Sol must be awake. Excuse me.

772
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,799
She's been through so much.

773
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,926
It must've been really tough.

774
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,553
Hey Dong-goo.
Be nice to Yoon-ah.

775
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,638
All you do is berate her!

776
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,307
When did I berate her?

777
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,602
You were so harsh with her earlier
for almost setting the place on fire.

778
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,563
I... I was just telling her to be careful.
That's all.

779
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,482
-You be careful!
-You're out.

780
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,526
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

781
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,203
Guys! Ta-da!

782
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,663
How do I look?

783
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,290
Gosh, you look incredible!

784
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,001
Incredibly awkward!

785
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,920
That usually looks good on anyone.

786
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,965
I'm the fool for asking you losers.

787
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,383
We're just kidding.

788
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,968
What's with the suit?

789
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,345
I have my interview today.

790
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,223
I have a bad feeling about this.

791
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,434
Don't you worry about me.

792
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,812
Let me go put my face on.

793
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,729
Oh my God!

794
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,151
Damn it! What am I going to do?

795
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,447
It's almost time. I'm screwed.

796
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,450
-Don't be such a drama queen.
-Just change into something else.

797
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,536
I can't. This blouse goes with this suit.

798
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,246
None of my other blouses match.

799
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,665
Then go wash it. You still have time.

800
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,916
I should.

801
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,007
What are you up to?

802
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,551
You start selling your muffins today,
right?

803
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,719
Yes.

804
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,720
Can we help?

805
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,722
No, I'm almost done.

806
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:17,933
All finished.

807
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,228
Sol must be awake.

808
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,736
She has to look after the baby,
the household, and sell muffins...

809
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,946
Must be tough for her.

810
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,740
I know.

811
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,243
Can you think of a way to help her?

812
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,746
I want to help,
but there's nothing we can do for her.

813
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,040
It's not like we can
find a husband for her.

814
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,170
That's a great idea.
Shall we try looking for Sol's dad?

815
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,005
How would we know who it is?

816
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,467
You're right.
How would we go about finding him?

817
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,306
Isn't this Yoon-ah's phone?

818
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,766
I think it is.

819
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,309
We can search for his number.

820
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,687
-How would we know which number is his?
-Let's take a look.

821
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,691
-Huh?
-Why?

822
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,361
Other than us,
there are only two numbers--

823
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,987
"Great Wall of China" and Kim Joon-seong.

824
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,448
Kim Joon-seong. This must be him.

825
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,034
-Does that make sense?
-Would it be Great Wall of China?

826
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,912
That's not what I'm saying.
How do you know that's Sol's dad?

827
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,996
I guess.

828
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,707
We can try calling him, you jerk.

829
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,377
-Are you crazy? You must be insane.
-Let go.

830
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,546
-We can just try.
-You'll only make trouble.

831
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,382
Jeez.

832
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:39,848
-Hello?
-Is this Kim Joon-seong's phone?

833
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,392
-Yes, that's right.
-Don't.

834
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,061
Do you know someone named Han Yoon-ah?

835
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,231
We dated briefly. Who is this?

836
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,693
They dated. It's him!

837
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,904
I'm a courier.

838
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,157
I have a package for you from Han Yoon-ah.

839
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,368
Can you give me your home address, please?

840
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,704
The rain washed away what's written here.

841
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,247
It's sunny outside, silly.

842
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,916
Yes, okay. Hold on.

843
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,919
"Dongsan-ro 35-gil"...

844
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,463
All right, it's on the way. Thanks.

845
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,966
It's him! It's Sol's dad!

846
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,759
We have his address. Shall we go?

847
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,219
Joon-ki, this doesn't feel right.

848
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,471
Stay out of it, then. I'll go alone.

849
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,764
You have no loyalty.

850
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,018
-Fine! I'll go. Happy?
-Where are you two going?

851
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,603
-You don't need to know!
-What?

852
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,104
-Loyalty!
-What's with them?

853
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,064
They're up to no good.

854
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,235
-Are you going somewhere?
-To sell my muffins.

855
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,820
Were you serious?

856
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,697
Not everyone's cut out for sales,
you know.

857
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,198
I'll give it a shot.

858
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,660
Hold up. Can I carry that for you?

859
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,829
It's okay. I can manage. See you.

860
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,789
It'll be tough on your own.

861
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,628
You want to go out there
with a baby in your arms?

862
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,505
Not my problem. Forget about it.

863
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,972
Buy some muffins!
I made them myself.

864
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:02,931
Muffins for sale!

865
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:06,935
Buy some muffins!
I made them myself.

866
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,313
Hello. Homemade muffins for sale.

867
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,397
Please try one.

868
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,988
It's cold.

869
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,159
Welcome.

870
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:23,952
Dong-goo?

871
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,287
What are you doing here?

872
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,081
I was just passing by.

873
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,416
How's business?

874
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,128
Your face tells me it's not going so well.

875
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,800
I told you.
It's tough for both you and your baby.

876
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,468
Not everyone's cut out for sales,
you know.

877
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,471
And every bakery carries these muffins.

878
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,849
Who would buy them off the street?

879
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,768
You don't have an edge.

880
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,937
Look at these haphazard,
handwritten signs.

881
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,648
What's with the names?

882
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,317
You think these will sell?

883
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,985
That's why I...

884
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,284
Are you crying?

885
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,996
I'm upset enough as it is

886
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,457
and you keep going on and on.

887
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,334
I'm so sad.

888
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,296
There's no need for you to cry.

889
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,090
You're an adult.

890
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,551
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

891
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,519
People are staring. Stop crying.

892
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,022
Come on.

893
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,484
I'll sell these for you, okay?

894
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,112
I'll help you, all right?

895
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,573
-You'll help me?
-Yes, so stop crying.

896
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,241
Okay? Stop.

897
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,952
Okay.

898
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,289
"Dongsan-ro"...

899
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,875
I think this is it.

900
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,336
Joon-ki. This isn't right.

901
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,754
We can still turn back.

902
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,381
Go ahead!

903
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,884
You really have no loyalty.

904
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,178
First...

905
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,345
Careful over there.

906
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,599
-He's the boss.
-Jeez, no.

907
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,645
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

908
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,231
Does this house belong to Kim Joon-seong?

909
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,691
Yeah, why?

910
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,944
We have something to say to him.

911
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,404
What a bother.

912
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,781
-Boss.
-Yeah?

913
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,949
There are people here to see you.

914
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,493
-Me?
-Yes.

915
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,036
Who are you?

916
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,871
-You're Kim Joon-seong?
-Yes.

917
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,165
Nice to meet you, I'm Lee Joon-ki.

918
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,668
We have something to say to you.

919
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,962
Really? What do you--

920
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,965
-Is there any chance that you--
-Honey!

921
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,468
When will they be done with construction?

922
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,553
We're running out of time.

923
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,431
They'll finish before our wedding
so don't worry, okay?

924
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,892
Who are these people?

925
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,312
They have something to say to me.

926
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,772
What's this about?

927
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,316
Well... it's, um...

928
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,486
We came to work.

929
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,447
-You want to work?
-Work?

930
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,492
We're not looking for workers.

931
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,577
Mr. Choi sent you, right?

932
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,580
I gave him an earful
that we're short-handed.

933
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,707
He must've sent them.

934
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:19,169
Yes, you're right... Mr. Choi...

935
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,797
Then you should've come to see me.

936
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,175
What business do you have
with the boss? Follow me.

937
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:26,927
Yes, sir.

938
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,722
What are you talking about? Work?

939
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,933
How can I bring up Yoon-ah
in front of his girlfriend?

940
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,393
That's why we shouldn't have come.

941
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,770
-Let's go.
-That's a great idea.

942
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,276
Where do you think you're going?

943
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,654
Sir.

944
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,949
Actually...

945
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,659
There's a lot to do today.

946
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,869
I see, but...

947
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,997
The thing is--

948
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,291
We--

949
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,292
Excuse me.

950
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,711
Look at this punk.

951
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,630
-Come with me.
-Doo-sik.

952
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,007
-Joon-ki.
-You've got it all wrong.

953
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,014
-Sorry.
-Sorry, it's my first day.

954
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,100
What the hell are we doing here?
When are we leaving?

955
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,352
What can we do?
He won't even listen to me!

956
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:19,896
Wanna see?

957
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,066
-Just work, damn it.
-Okay, okay!

958
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:23,984
Go.

959
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,361
Hurry.

960
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,572
Follow me.

961
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,702
Why is it taking so long to dry?

962
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,287
I'm going to be late for my interview.

963
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,125
What now? Is there anyone out there?

964
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,044
I'm going nuts here.

965
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,803
I don't have time for this.

966
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,640
Where is everyone?

967
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,518
Damn it, I'm late.

968
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,000
Buy some muffins. They're good.

969
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,670
What are you doing? Louder.

970
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,130
I'm trying.

971
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,340
Muffins for sale.

972
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,927
They're-- they're good.

973
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,887
Homemade muffins.

974
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,432
Why don't we call it a day and go home?
No one's interested.

975
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,686
They'll go to waste
if I don't sell them today.

976
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,146
You really are stubborn.

977
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:47,901
Can I ask why you live
such a tough life?

978
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,611
What do you mean?

979
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,862
About Sol.

980
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,741
Have you thought about telling her dad?

981
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,619
No. Not once.

982
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,746
Isn't it tough raising her alone?

983
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,749
Of course it is.

984
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,836
But I don't want to use her as an excuse
to hold him back.

985
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:11,508
She's my daughter, regardless.

986
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,887
I'm going to do my best to raise her
on my own.

987
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,473
That's why I'm selling the muffins.

988
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,603
You can go if it's too tiring.

989
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,815
-I'm going to stay a bit longer. Go ahead.
-No, it's fine.

990
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:30,986
We've already been here all day.
Why would I leave now?

991
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,283
Muffins for sale. They're good!

992
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,201
Muffins for sale! They're tasty!

993
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,454
Muffins for sale.

994
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,289
Muffins for sale.

995
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,124
Muffins for sale. I tried them

996
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,917
and they're really good.
Why won't you buy any?

997
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,044
They're tasty. Muffins for sale--

998
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,838
What are you doing here?

999
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,632
Excuse me? We're selling muffins.

1000
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,259
Did you get permission?

1001
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,762
Yes, of course.
Dong-goo gave me permission.

1002
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,682
I gave her permission.
What's the matter?

1003
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,017
DAEYOUNG DAILY EMPLOYMENT
INTERVIEWS

1004
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,810
Our company's interview process
is unique, isn't it?

1005
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,270
Relax.

1006
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,939
and let's eat together, have a drink,

1007
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,192
-and talk comfortably.
-Yes, sir.

1008
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,694
You can take off your jackets and relax.

1009
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,237
Thank you.

1010
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,745
What happened to my blouse?

1011
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,039
Where's my blouse?

1012
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,046
This is insane! What'll I do?

1013
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,839
Is something wrong, Ms. Kang?

1014
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,299
I said you should take off your jacket
and relax.

1015
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,052
That's all right, sir.
It's chilly in here.

1016
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,970
Really?

1017
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,597
As you wish.

1018
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,518
Here's your order.

1019
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,316
Oh my God.

1020
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,235
I'm so sorry.

1021
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,904
Give me your jacket.
I'll clean it off for you.

1022
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,073
That's okay. I'll do it myself.

1023
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,699
No, allow me.

1024
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,452
You can't. I'll do it myself.

1025
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,833
I'm fine, so please just go.

1026
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,209
Good job, everyone.

1027
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,460
Good job.

1028
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,337
Hey, over there!

1029
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,297
Come here.

1030
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,799
Well done today.

1031
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,843
Get home safely
and I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

1032
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,970
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

1033
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,977
Dude, look at this.

1034
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,856
He's a lot more generous than he looks.

1035
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,440
Happy, are you?

1036
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,317
You must be so pleased
to have made so much money.

1037
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,570
Let's go. I'm exhausted.

1038
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,155
-Don't do that.
-Okay.

1039
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,908
By the way, I think his girlfriend
went home.

1040
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,785
Should we talk to him about Yoon-ah?

1041
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,203
Are you nuts?

1042
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,247
He's getting married soon.

1043
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,667
What will happen when he finds out
Yoon-ah had his baby?

1044
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,253
-The wedding will be called off!
-You're right.

1045
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,213
-What do you mean?
-Huh?

1046
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,468
Yoon-ah had my baby?

1047
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,553
Is that true?

1048
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,353
Do you have a boyfriend?

1049
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,357
Pardon? No, I don't.

1050
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,026
I don't either.

1051
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,235
Really?

1052
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:22,032
That's unexpected.
I thought you'd be very popular, Ms. Yoon.

1053
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:25,911
Guys love voluptuous women like you.

1054
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,370
Excuse me?

1055
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,956
Why are you glaring at me?

1056
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,417
Is this sexual harassment?

1057
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,920
My bad, I was just joking.

1058
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,339
Women today are so frightening

1059
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,049
you really must watch what you say.
Goodness.

1060
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:45,096
Please excuse me.
I need to go to the ladies' room.

1061
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,684
I can't believe that ass.

1062
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,852
I'd like to just--

1063
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,523
I can't.

1064
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,525
Let it go, Seo-jin.

1065
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:01,029
You have to get yourself a job.

1066
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:18,296
Ms. Yoon, would you like to join me
for a drink after the interview?

1067
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,925
-I have a prior commitment.
-What kind of commitment?

1068
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,177
Is it more important than getting a job?

1069
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,430
I guess you don't mind getting dropped.

1070
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,225
-No, it's just...
-One drink.

1071
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,560
It won't mean a thing.
You're like a little sister to me.

1072
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,356
Don't you want a job, Ms. Yoon?

1073
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,987
She said no.

1074
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,655
What did you say, Ms. Kang?

1075
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,408
She's like "a little sister," huh?

1076
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,201
If you want to drink that much,

1077
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,996
then go drink with your little sister!

1078
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,040
What did you say? Hey.

1079
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,459
-Are you crazy?
-Take your hands off me

1080
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,253
-or I'll make you regret it.
-What?

1081
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,296
How will you make me regret it?

1082
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,132
Are you going to hit me?

1083
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,634
Go ahead.

1084
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,262
Take a shot. Come on.

1085
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,180
Can't do it, can you?

1086
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,017
Know where you are
before making empty threats.

1087
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,728
Who do you think you are,
you little--

1088
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,822
What do you think you're doing?

1089
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,743
Report me if you want.
I'll countersue for sexual harassment.

1090
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,247
Get up. This interview isn't worth it.

1091
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,331
Let go.

1092
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,542
-Excuse me?
-What's wrong with you?

1093
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,046
Will you take responsibility
if I don't make it?

1094
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,716
Who are you to affect my chances?

1095
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:50,013
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

1096
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,850
I'm so sorry.

1097
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,103
Please, let me. Oh, no.

1098
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:08,073
Joon-ki, should we have done
what we did?

1099
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:14,621
What do you mean, "we"?
You're the one who said it.

1100
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,040
What?

1101
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,918
You dirty prick.
You're putting it all on me?

1102
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,087
What did I do?

1103
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,005
You're the one who said it to him.

1104
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,840
You, with your own mouth. You.

1105
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,675
You must be insane.

1106
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,385
You're garbage.

1107
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,262
Garbage? Did you call me garbage?

1108
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,347
I call it as I see it.

1109
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,432
-Garbage!
-You're fighting again?

1110
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,101
All you do is fight.

1111
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,393
What's going on?

1112
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,271
Wash your faces. You're filthy.

1113
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,357
Hi. How come you're together?

1114
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,484
We, uh... met out front.

1115
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,653
Did you sell a lot, Yoon-ah?

1116
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,658
-Well...
-They came and confiscated everything.

1117
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,577
Selling without a permit and violating
food safety and hygiene guidelines.

1118
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,787
She was even fined.

1119
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,498
-Really?
-It's all my fault.

1120
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,333
I should've looked into it thoroughly.

1121
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,210
-You must be hungry.
-I am.

1122
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,462
Sol's asleep.
Let me put her down on the bed.

1123
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,547
I'll prepare dinner.

1124
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,382
Okay.

1125
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,760
How dare you call me garbage?

1126
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,595
-You have no manners or respect.
-How can you do that to me?

1127
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,264
You're the one who suggested we go.

1128
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,223
Now you're blaming me?

1129
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,141
Is anybody there?

1130
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,517
Hello. Welcome.

1131
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:18,810
That voice.

1132
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,821
I came to see Han Yoon-ah.

1133
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,826
Yoon-ah? Who are you?

1134
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,620
Joon-seong?

1135
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,205
Yoon-ah.

1136
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,003
-What are you doing here?
-We need to talk.

1137
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:48,131
-Oh, no.
-What the hell is going on?

1138
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,425
-Who is that?
-He's, um...

1139
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,218
Sol's dad.

1140
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:57,223
What? Sol's dad? How did he find us?

1141
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,393
Actually, we went to see him

1142
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,604
-to tell him about Sol.
-What?

1143
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,522
Why would you do that?
Are you crazy?

1144
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,900
I didn't say a word. It was all him.

1145
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,486
He must be crazy. When will he grow up?

1146
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,279
Really, Joon-ki?
You're a traitor, you garbage.

1147
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,823
-Garbage?
-I told you not to do that.

1148
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,408
That's not what's important here.

1149
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,952
Come on, let's follow them. Hurry.

1150
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,080
Why follow them?
Why would you get involved?

1151
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:21,998
Pipe down.

1152
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,172
What on earth is going on?
Why are you here?

1153
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,592
Yoon-ah. Are you out to ruin my life?

1154
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,470
-Excuse me? What do you mean?
-Listen carefully.

1155
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,223
I'm getting married soon

1156
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,683
so take this.

1157
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,853
Take this and never contact me again.
Got it?

1158
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,313
What's going on?

1159
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,941
-What is this?
-Why, isn't it enough?

1160
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,110
You wanted to use the baby to hit it big.
I guess you want more.

1161
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,446
You should be grateful for this much.

1162
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,157
Honestly, how do I know she's mine?

1163
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,118
What is that jerk saying?

1164
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,538
-That bastard.
-Hey, Dong-goo.

1165
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,332
You might be messing with me
to get money. Am I wrong?

1166
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,335
I don't know why you're doing this
out of the blue, but Joon-seong--

1167
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:13,341
You piece of shit.
Is that all you have to say to her?

1168
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,885
Do you even know how she's been living?

1169
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,387
He's got issues.

1170
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,097
"Hit it big"? Is that what you said?

1171
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,057
-Dong-goo, stop.
-Let go of me.

1172
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,309
A scumbag like this
doesn't have the right to be Sol's dad.

1173
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,562
-This asshole should just--
-Wait!

1174
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,814
Sol's dad?

1175
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,691
What are you talking about?

1176
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,277
He's not Sol's dad.

1177
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,949
Excuse me? He's not Sol's dad?

1178
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,117
Then who is he?

1179
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,620
I went on a blind date with him.

1180
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,665
Why is his number saved in your phone?

1181
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,125
To block his calls.

1182
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,669
He's a nuisance who drunk dials me
and pesters me all the time.

1183
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,838
Then why did you come here?

1184
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,008
I blacked out on the night
of the blind date

1185
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,469
so I thought something could've happened.

1186
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,638
This is so embarrassing.

1187
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:05,101
I can't believe I took their word for it.
I'm the nutjob.

1188
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,644
Unbelievable.

1189
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,895
Hey.

1190
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,565
Where do you think you're going?
You hit a man.

1191
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,108
Pardon?

1192
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:19,115
You know what?
I had an interview today.

1193
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,327
I don't think I'll get the job.

1194
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,412
I...

1195
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:29,375
slapped the interviewer in the face

1196
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,628
with a slab of pork.

1197
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:37,508
He was a piece of shit.

1198
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,303
But...

1199
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,765
they say I was in the wrong.

1200
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:49,687
They say I made a mistake.

1201
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,566
I thought...

1202
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,695
I did what was right.

1203
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,283
I don't know anymore.

1204
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,036
I don't know.

1205
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,873
I don't know a thing.

1206
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,008
Here I am talking about my problems.

1207
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,678
You look worried, too.

1208
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,973
Go on. Tell me. I'll listen.

1209
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,691
Mister...

1210
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,403
are you not wearing any pants?

1211
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:42,907
Hey, mister, don't forget to wear pants
for an interview.

1212
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,992
You'll be in trouble otherwise.

1213
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,663
Don't look ahead. Look at me.

1214
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,998
I'm not wearing a blouse.

1215
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,876
My blouse...

1216
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,513
Ow, my eye.

1217
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,683
It really stings.

1218
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,937
I'm so embarrassed.
I must've gone insane.

1219
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,773
Those two will only ever hurt me in life.

1220
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,191
Jeez.

1221
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,613
Here.

1222
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,294
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Yes.

1223
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,588
Why'd you hit him?

1224
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,133
He was being such a prick.

1225
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,303
Oh, my. Were you concerned about me?

1226
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,849
No, it's nothing like that.

1227
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,350
Never mind, then.

1228
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,313
Thanks, anyway.

1229
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,524
-For what?
-For letting me stay here.

1230
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,447
I was really lonely before coming here.

1231
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,160
I don't feel lonely anymore.

1232
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,371
I have people looking out for me now.

1233
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:17,710
I've never had a family, so I'm not sure,

1234
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:22,507
but I think this is what having
a family would feel like.

1235
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,301
Then do your job properly.

1236
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,762
There you go, berating me again.

1237
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,059
That won't do.

1238
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,686
-Give it to me. Let me help you.
-Don't bother.

1239
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,396
Come on. I'll do it for you.

1240
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,564
It's okay.

1241
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,942
-Just trust me, Dong-goo.
-It's not necessary.

1242
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,530
Oh, my God!

1243
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,242
I told you not to bother!

1244
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,160
Is there anything you can do properly?

1245
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:54,622
I, uh... did I do it on purpose?

1246
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,082
What?

1247
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,209
You're talking back now?

1248
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:01,921
I should stop being nice to you, woman!

1249
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,842
You're partly to blame as well.
Why are you so hard on me?

1250
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,593
Don't you think I have a temper?

1251
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,137
How scary. What did I ever do to you?

1252
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:15,017
Let's see that temper of yours.
What will you do? Let's see.

1253
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,186
-I'll really get mad.
-Go ahead.

1254
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,771
You don't know I've been holding it in,
huh?

1255
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,066
Fine. Don't hold it in.
You know how I get when I'm angry, right?

1256
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,818
You'll be shocked.

1257
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,237
You'll be even more shocked.

1258
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,531
Wow, you're so strong.

1259
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,616
See? Why is your head a rock?

1260
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,618
Whether it's a rock or not--

1261
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,970
You startled me.

1262
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,722
I'm giving up on becoming a reporter.

1263
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:56,434
Seo-jin needs you to comfort her
right now.

1264
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,060
If you can overcome this hardship,

1265
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,813
you too, can become a flower.

1266
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,732
Why are you at a police station?

1267
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,234
Kang Seo-jin! You did nothing wrong.

1268
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,278
So cheer up, girl!

1269
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:10,072
Joon-ki, I think I'm in love.

1270
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,241
She seems to be really into me.

1271
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,826
Doo-sik, what are you doing?

1272
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,119
I was watching a movie.

1273
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,746
-Let's watch together.
-No!

1274
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:17,872
Why did this get sent to Sun-woo?

1275
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,498
Shit!

1276
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,000
You crazy bastard!

1277
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,169
Do you have a girlfriend?
How about me?

1278
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,087
She's fallen for some other dude.

1279
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,341
I'll use whatever means necessary
to find him and kill him.

1280
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,800
The flu?

1281
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,427
This is all for your mom's sake.

1282
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,970
I'm worried about her.

1283
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,181
Yoon-ah, do you know
you're a bit of a pain?

1284
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,099
I'd like to ask you out, Yoon-ah.

1285
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,726
-Isn't that Yoon-ah?
-Who was that?

1286
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,770
Do you want to close up shop?
Or get married?

1287
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,688
What? A wedding?
