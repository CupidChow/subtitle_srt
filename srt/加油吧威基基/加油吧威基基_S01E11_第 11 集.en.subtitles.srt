1
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,132
Hi, Dong-goo.

2
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,179
Yoon-ah, I have something to say.

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,764
What is it?

4
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,225
I like you.

5
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,479
I really like you, Yoon-ah.

6
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,573
What's this, all of a sudden?

7
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,116
I like you, Yoon-ah.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,412
So can we... start seeing each other?

9
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,586
I don't want to.

10
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,714
Sorry? Why not?

11
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,968
Is it because of your situation?

12
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,138
Don't worry.
I'm ready to take responsibility

13
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,349
for your situation and Sol.

14
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,186
Who asked you
to take responsibility of Sol and me?

15
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,897
That's not what I mean.

16
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,651
Then does a single mom like me
have to say yes

17
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,987
to a guy like you?
Is that what you think?

18
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,033
-Yoon-ah. That's not what I meant.
-Forget it.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,701
I'll pretend this never happened.

20
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,455
Hey, Yoon-ah.

21
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,337
You left your phone in my car.

22
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,465
Thank you. Bye.

23
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,342
Okay. Bye.

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,318
-Are you okay?
-Soo-ah.

25
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,195
I was just rejected, right?

26
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,698
Yeah. It only took five seconds.

27
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,907
Five seconds?

28
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,742
Why?

29
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,578
Why did she...?

30
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,165
Hey, Chewbacca,
what are you doing this weekend?

31
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,833
I don't have a weekend.

32
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,751
I have to watch a bunch of TV shows
and critique them.

33
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,879
This is all I get to do.

34
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,130
My goodness.

35
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,758
You were dying to become a reporter.
Now that you are one, you're complaining?

36
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,970
What's with my ear?

37
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,973
Chewbacca.

38
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,100
To commemorate becoming a reporter,
can you clean my ears?

39
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,687
I'm afraid there's a lump of earwax
in there somewhere.

40
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,063
Clean it out for me.

41
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,815
What are you waiting for?

42
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,279
What the hell are you doing?

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,657
Just say you don't want to do it.
Why push me?

44
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,326
When did I...

45
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,536
Goodness.

46
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,207
Yoon-ah, let's talk.

47
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,669
Why won't you go out with me?
I want to know why I'm being rejected.

48
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,338
What?

49
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,174
What did you say?
Who rejected whom?

50
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,800
Stay out of it!

51
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,053
Tell me. What's the reason?

52
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,222
I don't want to go out with you.

53
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,975
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Can I go?

54
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,479
What is she talking about?

55
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,689
Are you saying you like Yoon-ah?

56
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,443
Dong-goo likes Yoon-ah.
But she turned him down in five seconds.

57
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,402
What?

58
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,655
Five seconds?

59
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,078
Dong-goo! Where are you going?

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,377
Yoon-ah, I have something to say.

61
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,670
I like you.

62
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,630
I really like you, Yoon-ah.

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268
I don't want to.

64
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,231
Who asked you to take responsibility
of Sol and me?

65
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,615
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,372
Damn it.

67
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,753
What are you doing here?

68
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,383
Soo-ah, am I that unattractive?

69
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,385
I'm not that bad, am I?

70
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,430
I've got a decent face and I'm tall.

71
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm tall and...

72
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,729
I'm tall. I guess that's it.

73
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,190
I'm better than most, aren't I?

74
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:20,445
Do you want to hear the truth
or a blatant lie just to feel better?

75
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,030
Forget it.

76
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,073
Never mind.

77
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,325
I need to go to the toilet.

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,209
SOO-BONG

79
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,588
Shit, he thinks I'm in the States.

80
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,805
Hello, Soo-bong. Hi!

81
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,515
What's up?

82
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,851
What do you mean, what's up?
It's your brother calling.

83
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,062
I couldn't even see you off.

84
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,022
I wanted to hear your voice.

85
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,066
I just got back from training.

86
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,943
That's right. You have a match coming up.

87
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,653
I leave for Hong Kong in two days.

88
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,489
So how is living in the States?

89
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,407
It's great. I love it.

90
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,950
So good. Very good.

91
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,410
Glad to hear that.

92
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,040
Hey, Soo-bong. Something came up
so it's actually a bad time to talk.

93
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,792
This is an international call,

94
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,669
but I can hear your voice
like it's right next to me.

95
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,880
You know technology these days.

96
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,382
I'll call you later.

97
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,884
Okay, talk soon.

98
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,220
-Take care.
-Okay, bye.

99
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,847
-Hey, Soo-ah.
-Soo-bong.

100
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,390
What are you doing here?

101
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,059
You said you were in the States!

102
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,020
Well... the thing is-- I'll explain, okay?

103
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,065
Let's go home and sleep, Soo-ah.
I'm tired.

104
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,108
Hey, Dong-goo!

105
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,318
Soo-bong!

106
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,529
What do you mean,
"Let's go home and sleep"?

107
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,364
Do you guys live together?

108
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,825
-I thought you broke up!
-Well... We--

109
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,910
I broke up with Yoon-seok.
Dong-goo and I reunited.

110
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,456
I pretended to be in the States because
I knew you'd worry if you found out.

111
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,584
Really? Then why are you living
at Dong-goo's?

112
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,086
What about your place?

113
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,171
Pardon? Oh, that...

114
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,799
Dong-goo said I should move in
to save on rent

115
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,759
since we'll get married anyways.

116
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,763
Married? You're getting married?

117
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,475
For real? We shouldn't talk
like this in the cold.

118
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,310
Let's catch up at your guesthouse.
Come on!

119
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,813
-We'll be right there.
-Sure thing!

120
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,440
What the hell was that?

121
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,608
I'm so sorry.
You know what my brother's like.

122
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,610
Help me out just this once.

123
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,780
I'll be done for if he finds out
I was conned!

124
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,948
Okay, fine.

125
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,118
Wait, isn't Joon-ki at home?

126
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,037
I can't believe Dong-goo likes Yoon-ah.

127
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,581
That's amazing.

128
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,916
Even more amazing
is he was turned down in five seconds.

129
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,129
From now on, his nickname will be
"Five Seconds.

130
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,047
We can call him "Five Secs."

131
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,592
Five Secs.

132
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,887
Five Secs, Five Secs, hey!

133
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,263
Five Secs.

134
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,432
Who's calling me?

135
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,101
-It's Dong-goo.
-"Five Secs"?

136
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,520
Hello, "Five Secs."

137
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,523
What do you mean?
It's your nickname, Five Secs.

138
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,902
What?

139
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,778
Soo-bong?

140
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,448
Soo-bong's coming?

141
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,575
Here?

142
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,035
Fuck!

143
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,455
-What do you mean, Soo-bong is coming?
-I don't know. I'm going to hide.

144
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,248
Let me know when he leaves.

145
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,250
If he catches me, he'll kill me for sure!

146
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,087
It's been a while.

147
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,215
I'm here! I came with Soo-bong!

148
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,925
He's come here after all this time!

149
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,429
How long has it been?

150
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,975
Wow, Doo-sik and Seo-jin!
It's been too long!

151
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,602
Gosh, you guys!

152
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,063
-I missed you cuties!
-Did Joon-ki leave?

153
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,357
-I missed you!
-He's hiding.

154
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,983
You're still really strong, Soo-bong.

155
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,694
You cuties, I really missed you!

156
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,697
It's nice to see you again.

157
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,908
You know, I'm a bit sad.

158
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,244
If Dong-goo and Soo-ah are back together,

159
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,330
then you guys should've let me know!

160
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,375
What do you mean, they're back together?

161
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,292
I told him...

162
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,253
that we decided to get back together.

163
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,590
Oh, that's right!
Soo-ah asked us to keep it a secret.

164
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,803
You punks. You sure are loyal, huh?

165
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,347
A man should be loyal.

166
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,808
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

167
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,976
Loyalty!

168
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,854
This place hasn't changed.

169
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,071
What's this?

170
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,739
It's a picture of Joon-ki.

171
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,327
Why is this still here?

172
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,165
Why do you have a picture
of a dead person?

173
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,588
Oh, Joon-ki...

174
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,010
I still can't believe that he's gone.

175
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,512
Joon-ki...

176
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,726
Joon-ki...

177
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,271
Who could've known
he'd leave us like that?

178
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,648
How could he get struck by lightning?

179
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,858
I know...

180
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,527
He got what he had coming, that's what.

181
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,279
How dare he steal his friend's girl?

182
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,780
My girl?

183
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,617
I know I shouldn't speak ill of the dead,

184
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,452
but it's probably better for him
that he died that way.

185
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,539
Had I caught him...

186
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,376
he would've spent the rest of his life
in a hospital,

187
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,670
in a body that is neither alive nor dead.

188
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,635
Joon-ki, you've got mail.

189
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,596
Where is he?

190
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,555
No!

191
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,725
Why is she asking for Joon-ki?

192
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,102
Yoon-ah, you're doing it again.

193
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,230
-Joon-ki's dead!
-What?

194
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,149
What do you mean, he's dead?

195
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,276
-I saw him just now.
-Yoon-ah!

196
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,820
Did you forget your meds?
You should always take them on time!

197
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,072
Come with me right now!

198
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,740
-This is garbage!
-Why are you...?

199
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,825
-Joon-ki was just here!
-Come to your senses.

200
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,452
Move it, woman!

201
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,082
What was that? And who is she?

202
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,751
She works here

203
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,379
but she hasn't been able to recover
from the shock

204
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,464
and still believes Joon-ki is alive.

205
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,799
Really?

206
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,051
What a pity. She's so young.

207
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,970
Jeez.

208
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,598
Will she get better with medication?

209
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,520
Excuse me? Joon-ki stole
Soo-ah's brother's girlfriend?

210
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,731
Yeah. When that happened

211
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,983
Soo-bong went crazy
saying that he'd kill Joon-ki.

212
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,945
That's why you lied and said he died?

213
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,781
We tried to stop him,
but that's what Joon-ki wanted.

214
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,575
Soo-bong is actually a UFC fighter.

215
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,285
He's a human weapon.

216
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,496
His record is 19 and 0. 19 KOs.

217
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,081
But still, how could you...?

218
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,126
Where's Joon-ki right now?

219
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,931
Why the hell did he suddenly show up?

220
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,267
Gosh, I'm so uncomfortable.

221
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,644
He's got to leave at some point.

222
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,565
What was that sound?

223
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,442
It came from over there.

224
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,907
Sorry, I caught a cold.

225
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,618
Really?

226
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,704
Hey, Seo-jin,

227
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,248
-you still have facial hair?
-What?

228
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,169
I've had it all my life.

229
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,421
Gosh, I'm tired.

230
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,466
Soo-bong, it's getting late.
You should go.

231
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,469
Yeah, I guess I should get going.

232
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,140
Yes, Coach.

233
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,392
Are you serious?

234
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,768
Okay. Thanks.

235
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,771
-What am I going to do?
-What's wrong?

236
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,398
The furnace in my dorm is broken.

237
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,358
Jeez. What'll I do?

238
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,154
I can just stay here.

239
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,492
Dong-goo. I fly out in two days.

240
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,410
Can I stay here until then?

241
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,163
Pardon?

242
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,916
Two days?

243
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,459
Say no.

244
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,338
Soo-bong. You have a fight in a few days.
You should take better care of yourself.

245
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,298
You'll be uncomfortable here
with so many people.

246
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,799
No worries, man.

247
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,093
I'm used to bunking with others.

248
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,806
Oh, that's right.
We have no vacancies at the moment.

249
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,183
I sleep well on the couch.

250
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,393
Then I'll take the couch.
You should sleep in my room.

251
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,354
I don't want to be a nuisance.

252
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,482
Soo-bong,
how about a beer for loyalty's sake?

253
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,527
I need to keep my weight under control
because of the fight.

254
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,488
I want to catch up on TV shows
I missed during training.

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,366
So don't worry about me and go sleep.

256
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,951
But still...

257
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,579
Sure. Please get some rest.

258
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,540
That's really frightening.

259
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,625
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

260
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,794
-Enjoy, Soo-bong.
-All right.

261
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,054
This is so good. Really good.

262
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:13,435
Kim Nam-joo and Ji Jin-hee...
They're amazing.

263
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,979
What do I watch now?

264
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,190
That's right. Wife's Desire.

265
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,776
I heard there was a huge twist.

266
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,988
Why isn't he sleeping? It's so late.

267
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:28,242
I need to pee and my legs are numb.
This is ridiculous.

268
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,413
I really need to go. What can I do?

269
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,173
Who asked you to take responsibility
for Sol and me?

270
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,467
I'll pretend this never happened.

271
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,387
I don't want to go out with you.

272
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,439
Dong-goo, I need to pee. Help.

273
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,486
Doo-sik, I need to pee. Save me.

274
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,744
THE POPULARITY OF FEMALE DIRECTORS

275
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,664
I'm so sick of this. It's never-ending.

276
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,542
I wonder if Joon-ki is all right.

277
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,838
Hold on. Why do I keep worrying about
that jerk?

278
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,883
I'm seriously losing it.

279
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,843
Wake up!

280
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,720
What's this?

281
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,558
I might pee in my pants.
Help me, Chewbacca.

282
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,685
Why do I keep thinking about
a loser like him?

283
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,523
I can start with Episode 8.

284
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,111
I'm so excited!

285
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,743
-Why aren't you sleeping, Seo-jin?
-Huh?

286
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,329
I need to find something.

287
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,290
-I see.
-Where did I put it?

288
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,417
Why are you holding a bottle?

289
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,711
Excuse me?

290
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,798
My hand feels empty.

291
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,675
Gosh.

292
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,471
Thanks, Seo-jin.

293
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,773
What's that sound?

294
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,693
Is there a leak?

295
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,362
What sound?

296
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,406
I don't hear anything.

297
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,450
-I'm sure I heard something.
-I should watch some TV.

298
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,744
Why is the volume so low?

299
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,746
That's too loud!

300
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,376
You see, I'm a bit hard of hearing.

301
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,718
Seo-jin, it's overflowing!

302
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,303
My piss is overflowing!

303
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,169
Gosh, I have a headache.

304
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,754
What are you doing up?

305
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,797
What are you writing?

306
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,760
What is it?

307
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,636
WHY, YOON-AH?

308
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,221
I DON'T WANT TO.

309
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,264
What is it?

310
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,477
Did you do this all night?

311
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,063
I just don't understand.

312
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
Doo-sik, am I that big a loser?

313
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,068
No, you're pretty great.
You're the coolest friend I have.

314
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,362
Really?
Then why won't Yoon-ah go out with me?

315
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,157
Shouldn't she at least give it
some thought?

316
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,036
That's true.
What did you say to her?

317
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,247
I held her by the arms
in front of the guesthouse

318
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,834
and said I like her and we should go out.
I confessed my feelings like a man!

319
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,419
Wait.

320
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,840
You just confessed to her on the street?
You didn't even get flowers?

321
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,509
Yeah, so what?

322
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,427
That's not right.

323
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,055
I would've said no, too,
if that happened to me.

324
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,767
Is that so? Is that why?

325
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,103
-Yeah.
-Now I get it.

326
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,354
Hey, Doo-sik!

327
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,523
How can you make such a silly mistake?

328
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,150
I thought it was manly but I was wrong.

329
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,237
By the way,
is Joon-ki still in the closet?

330
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,539
I must've fallen asleep.

331
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,165
What the hell?

332
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,378
Is it morning?

333
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,423
I can't even tell if it's day or night.

334
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,137
My legs...

335
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,598
Is Soo-bong

336
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,934
still out there?

337
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,107
Oh, my God. What's happening?
Unbelievable!

338
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:15,070
He's an athlete.
Why is he so crazy about dramas?

339
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,116
Do you mean to tell me...
that you're my father's daughter?

340
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,536
The daughter-in-law is his real daughter?

341
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,954
Unbelievable.

342
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,584
-This is insane!
-How could this happen?

343
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,378
-Did you sleep well, Soo-bong?
-That's nonsense!

344
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,590
Huh? Yeah, yeah.

345
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
-It's time for breakfast.
-I'm fine.

346
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,261
I need to watch this, so be quiet.

347
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,596
Jeez.

348
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,473
Thirty years ago

349
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,684
you abandoned a woman
named Yoo Geum-ran.

350
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,270
How do you know her?

351
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,898
I'm... her daughter.

352
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,567
What did you say?

353
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,653
-Oh, my God! This is crazy!
-You're my daughter as well?

354
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,030
His wife is also his daughter?

355
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,950
This is the best.
It's absolutely the best!

356
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,621
That's insane!

357
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,420
Is he an athlete

358
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,714
or someone who watches dramas
for a living?

359
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,257
He's completely hooked.

360
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,093
He's crazy about dramas.

361
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,805
He spends half his winnings
on pay-per-view for dramas.

362
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,642
Goodness. What do we do about Joon-ki?

363
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,436
By the way, where's Yoon-ah?

364
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,314
She prepared breakfast and went to class.
Apparently she has something to do.

365
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,816
Since when have you had feelings for her?

366
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,571
For a while. I've given it a lot
of thought so don't give me any crap.

367
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,198
I won't.

368
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,201
I'm running late. I'll eat at the store.

369
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,410
Wait.

370
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,122
I'm coming with you.

371
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,332
Where are you going?

372
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,833
What about Soo-bong?

373
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,212
I need to catch Yoon-seok
before Soo-bong finds out.

374
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,047
He'll kill me if he finds out.

375
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,007
Dong-goo, you take care of him, okay?

376
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,092
Let's go.

377
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,510
Oh, goodness.

378
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,762
I can't do it alone.

379
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,306
I need to get ready for work.
Look after Sol, okay?

380
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,101
Play with Dong-goo, Sol.

381
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,769
Fine. Go get ready.

382
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,317
Hey, Sol.

383
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,820
What does your mom like?

384
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,072
How should I confess?

385
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,242
What did you say?

386
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,077
You just said something!

387
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,246
Say something, please.

388
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,375
Not baby talk, real talk.

389
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,877
Please say something.

390
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,300
Why isn't this jerk showing up?

391
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,968
I need to get him before he catches on.

392
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,721
How should they fight it out?

393
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,141
Are you still writing that?
Is there any money in this?

394
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,101
-No.
-Then why would you do it?

395
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,687
Just because it's something I enjoy.

396
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,566
Goodness. You're too much.

397
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,943
Gosh, what do I do?

398
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,738
Should he throw a finger jab?

399
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,032
-What's a finger jab?
-A finger jab?

400
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,951
It's a Jeet Kune Do technique

401
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,329
that was developed by Bruce Lee.

402
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,539
It's a terrifying technique--
you jab someone in the eyes,

403
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,082
causing loss of sight.

404
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,793
You jab them in the eyes?
That's a cheap trick.

405
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,088
The goal in JKD is to end the fight
in the shortest time.

406
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,299
What fool would stand there
and get his eyes jabbed?

407
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,344
Look at you. You're really clueless.
Finger jabs are really fast.

408
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,679
-Want to see?
-Sure.

409
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,072
See? It's really fast.

410
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,074
You can't even see it
so how will you avoid it?

411
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,116
Why the hell not?

412
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,701
Try it on me.

413
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,536
Wow, you're really reckless.

414
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,122
Don't regret it, okay?

415
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,875
Then... here I go.

416
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,758
Ow, that hurts. My finger hurts!

417
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,009
Shut it.

418
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,928
This doesn't make sense.

419
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,429
Neither my wife nor daughter-in-law

420
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,681
were my biological daughters?

421
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,016
Is this where

422
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,644
-I face betrayal?
-No way.

423
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,854
I have to leave this place.

424
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,357
Thunder!

425
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:34,371
I must now return to my star.

426
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,957
Goodbye, Earth.

427
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,625
Goodbye...

428
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,632
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
WIFE'S DESIRE

429
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,261
Bravo. Incredible!

430
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,805
The dad was an alien.

431
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,724
The title is Wife's Desire,
but it ended with an alien father.

432
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,809
What a twist.

433
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,813
This is truly the best drama ever!
I need to get a copy of it.

434
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,108
How do they come up with this?

435
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,362
I need to do a better job
of confessing this time.

436
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,116
-How do I do it with Soo-bong here?
-Wow.

437
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,909
I need to watch that again.

438
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,162
He's driving me insane.

439
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,458
Yoon-ah, you're early.

440
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,043
Oh, hi.

441
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,129
I wanted to come in early.

442
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,466
Who...

443
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,719
was that guy yesterday?

444
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,472
He's my boss.

445
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,641
Oh, I see.

446
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,145
-Why did you--?
-Hyun-joon.

447
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,398
I'd rather not talk about it.

448
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,109
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

449
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,871
I'm going to the toilet.
Watch the counter for me.

450
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,247
-Okay.

451
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,000
Jeez, this is boring.

452
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,502
How long do I have to do this?

453
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,298
Excuse me.

454
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,008
Do you have that ramyun today?

455
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,260
Sorry? Which ramyun?

456
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,013
Pa-pa en ta-po tom yum moo-thai ramyun.

457
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,474
Wait a sec.

458
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,893
I know this voice.

459
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,777
Where is it?

460
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,826
You jerk. Hey!

461
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,744
Sorry?

462
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,289
Stop right there!

463
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,290
You're dead!

464
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,088
-Hold on, Soo-ah.
-Where do you think you're going?

465
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,381
Give me back my money!

466
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,633
Pa-pa en... the Thai guy!

467
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,051
Get out of my way!

468
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,513
Doo-sik, get him!

469
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,889
-It's the con artist!
-Move.

470
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,516
-No, no.
-Get out of my way!

471
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,352
What are you doing?

472
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,396
Put it down. Someone will get hurt!

473
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,690
So get out of my way if you don't want
to get hurt, you bastard!

474
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,192
-Don't. Stop!
-I said, move!

475
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,404
Shit, what do I do now?

476
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,497
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

477
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,082
You'll really get hurt!

478
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,840
You bastard!

479
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,345
Ow, my finger! It hurts!

480
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,932
-Ouch!
-You shifty son of a bitch!

481
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,434
Doo-sik, call the police!

482
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,977
How dare you jab me in the eye?

483
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,859
I will now return to my star.

484
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,862
-Goodbye, Earth.
-Unbelievable.

485
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,864
This is mind-blowingly awesome.

486
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,450
The writer's a genius. Wow.

487
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,541
I'm so sore from watching TV
all day long.

488
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,169
I should go for a jog.

489
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,594
Oh, my eyes.

490
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,101
My eyes are killing me.

491
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,770
My legs fell asleep.

492
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,151
It's cold. I'm freezing.

493
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,410
You asshole!

494
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,621
You-- you're dead.

495
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,122
What are you doing here?

496
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,501
What, you lied to me?

497
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,960
Do you know my brother?

498
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,545
What's this bullshit? What brother?

499
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,548
I guess you mistook me for Joon-ki.

500
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,386
I'm Joon-ki's twin brother,

501
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,804
Lee Joon-ku.

502
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,141
-What? Twin brother?
-That's right.

503
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,060
Joon-ki had a twin brother?

504
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,522
What with all the noise?

505
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,363
-Hey Dong-goo.
-Yes?

506
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,573
-Was Joon-ki a twin?
-Pardon?

507
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,370
Nice to see you again, Dong-goo.
It's Joon-ku. Lee Joon-ku.

508
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,621
Sorry?

509
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:31,126
Oh, right. Joon-ku. How have you been?

510
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,462
Joon-ki really had a twin brother?

511
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,923
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

512
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,427
I knew it.

513
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,803
He did it again.

514
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,555
He was always like that.

515
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,432
He never acknowledged my existence!

516
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,435
We were born from the same womb
at the same time,

517
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,562
yet he treated me as if I didn't exist.

518
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,149
Hey, Joon-ki. Cut the crap.

519
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,525
You're terrible.

520
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,447
Who am I? Do I really not exist?

521
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,950
I lived alone my entire life because
my parents only ever loved Joon-ki.

522
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,953
I lived my life hating him!

523
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,080
I, Lee Joon-ku,

524
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,542
am alive!

525
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,468
So you're really Joon-ki's brother?

526
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,094
Yes, I am.

527
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,971
Joon-ku, cheer up.

528
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,890
I didn't know.

529
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,017
I really didn't know.

530
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,729
It's okay. I'm used to it.

531
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,065
-You should sit down.
-That's okay.

532
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,569
I'm so heartbroken.
I don't think I can stay.

533
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,114
Please excuse me.

534
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,407
Hold on.

535
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,702
What's the matter?

536
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,250
-Where is Joon-ki?
-What are you talking about? He died.

537
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,668
Where is his grave?

538
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,339
-He was cremated.
-Which charnel house is he at?

539
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:04,302
We were going to take him to one,
but we scattered his ashes instead.

540
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,764
Where did you scatter his ashes?
Where's the location?

541
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,976
Never mind. Please take me there.

542
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,853
I'm a bit tied up today. Bye then.

543
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,230
-Joon-ku!
-Yes?

544
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,816
I leave the country tomorrow for a fight.

545
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,693
I'd like to pay my respects before I go.

546
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,196
-Can you do that for me?
-Yes!

547
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,911
Have a safe trip.

548
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,343
Hey, Joon-ku.

549
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,929
How far is it from here?

550
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,014
Huh?

551
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,184
We're almost there.

552
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,728
It's right here.

553
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,940
Here? Right here?

554
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,650
Yeah, this is it.

555
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,405
So this is where Joon-ki is?

556
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,621
Joon-ki...

557
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,296
I'm here, you punk.

558
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,674
Joon-ki!

559
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,012
Joon-ki!

560
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,225
You punk.

561
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,520
Joon-ki...

562
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,939
Joon-ki!

563
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,567
You punk...

564
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,696
Wait, are you crying?

565
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,825
We used to be the best of friends.

566
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,660
He was like a brother to me.

567
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,416
When he stole my girlfriend,
I was upset at first

568
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,043
but I forgave him right away.

569
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,504
Who knew he'd leave us so soon?

570
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:10,053
I would give him a big hug
if he were alive.

571
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,764
It pains me that I can't.

572
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,893
Joon-ki!

573
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,686
I'm sorry.

574
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,898
I'm so sorry, Joon-ki!

575
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,860
Please find peace where you are.

576
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,197
When I die, please...

577
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,241
please be my friend again.

578
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:37,288
Joon-ki!

579
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,208
Soo-bong!

580
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,596
Excuse me?

581
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,598
It's me,

582
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,976
your friend, Joon-ki!

583
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,852
What are you saying?

584
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,938
You said you're his twin.

585
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,232
You know I don't have a twin.

586
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,069
I'm an only child.
Fourth-generation only son.

587
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,865
I lied because I thought
you would beat me to death.

588
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,327
It's me, Joon-ki.

589
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,996
Lee Joon-ki!

590
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,461
Come on. Come get it.

591
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,134
What are you waiting for?

592
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,679
You said you wanted to hug me!

593
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,692
Actually I'm Joon-ku...

594
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,235
You jerk!

595
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,195
I'm Lee Joon-ki's--

596
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,115
You son of a bitch!

597
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,787
Soo-bong, please! I'm Joon-ku...

598
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,583
It's difficult to recoup your money
in cases like these.

599
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,543
It's pretty much impossible.

600
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,256
INFORMATION DEPARTMENT

601
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:16,345
Doo-sik, what'll I do?
Where do I go from here?

602
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,931
I don't have a single penny

603
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,808
and I'm a total has-been as a model.

604
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,643
You can start over.

605
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,397
Start what over?

606
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,524
There's nothing I'm good at.
I don't even have a college degree!

607
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:34,280
Forget it. You wouldn't understand.
All you do is write stupid stories.

608
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,034
-What's wrong with that?
-Are you proud?

609
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,494
Aren't you embarrassed?

610
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,996
Why should I worry
about what others think?

611
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,416
What I do may seem pathetic to others,

612
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,710
but I'm happy doing what I love.

613
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,381
Everyone has their own measure
of happiness, Soo-ah.

614
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:57,762
So it's not too late to find something
to do that will make you happy.

615
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:02,100
I'm too old to start over.
I'm 29 years old.

616
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,019
Twenty-nine is still young, you fool.

617
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,731
Do you know what the average
lifespan is nowadays? It's 80.

618
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,151
In baseball terms, you're only
at the bottom of the third inning.

619
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,488
Will you give up at the bottom
of the third just because you're losing?

620
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,615
Who knows if you'll hit a double,
a triple,

621
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:21,119
or even a walk-off home run?
You'll never know until you try.

622
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,036
Don't you agree?

623
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,165
-Doo-sik...
-What?

624
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,501
How many innings are there
in a baseball game?

625
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,559
Why is it so quiet? Where is everyone?

626
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,355
DONG-GOO

627
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,401
-Hello?
-Hi, Yoon-ah. Where are you right now?

628
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:57,572
-I just got back after class.
-Oh, really?

629
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,075
I'm cleaning the third floor.
Can you come help?

630
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,786
Sure, I'll be right there.

631
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,440
Dong-goo...

632
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,404
Yoon-ah,

633
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,324
I made a mistake yesterday.

634
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,284
I'd like to officially confess
my feelings.

635
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,831
I like you, Yoon-ah.
I really like you a lot.

636
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,626
-Can we--
-Why are you doing this?

637
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,461
I'm sure I said no yesterday.

638
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:54,837
Excuse me?

639
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,675
Is something the matter?

640
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,845
It took hours to do this by myself.

641
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,680
I'm going downstairs.

642
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,725
Yoon-ah.

643
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,310
Yoon-ah!

644
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,774
Yoon-ah. Wait, Yoon-ah!

645
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,817
What's wrong?

646
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,613
Isn't this enough? Oh, a ring!

647
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,865
I'll get you a pretty one
when I make money--

648
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,493
My answer won't change
no matter what you do.

649
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,788
I have no intention of going out with you.

650
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,752
Why? Do you hate me that much?

651
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,924
We can start dating and you can reject me
if you still don't like me.

652
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,301
Dating is a luxury for me.

653
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,179
It's overwhelming
just trying to live my life.

654
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,807
So please don't do this.

655
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,811
Then I'll wait.
I'll wait until you can date me.

656
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,104
Don't.

657
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,441
I said I'll wait. I want to wait!

658
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,360
Won't you even let me do that?

659
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:04,573
Am I not even worth considering?
Is that it?

660
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,582
Fine.

661
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,627
I understand how you feel.

662
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,462
I'll stop.

663
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:26,095
I'll stop liking you from now on.

664
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,555
What are you talking about?

665
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,184
You like her?

666
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,229
Why would you like this woman?

667
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,732
What the hell are you talking about?

668
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,534
Soo-bong, why are you out here?

669
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,542
-Come with me.
-Why are you doing this?

670
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,668
I heard everything.

671
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,338
You were conned
and that's why you're living here?

672
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:05,801
-Soo-bong, I can explain.
-Shut up and go back home.

673
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,636
Stay there and don't do a thing
till you're married.

674
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,014
-Come.
-I don't want to. I won't go!

675
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,516
Are you gonna leech
off of Dong-goo forever?

676
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,480
Soo-bong, I want to start over.

677
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,939
Start what over?

678
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,817
You got all cocky about being a model
and did nothing but slack off.

679
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,944
How will you start over?

680
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,655
Do you know how old you are?

681
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,992
What's wrong with how old I am?
I'm only 29.

682
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,036
-What?
-Soo-bong.

683
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,498
Do you know what the average lifespan is
nowadays? It's 80.

684
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,334
In baseball terms-- never mind.

685
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:42,588
In UFC main event terms,
I'm only in the second round out of five.

686
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,008
Would you throw in the towel
just because you're losing in round two?

687
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,553
Who knows if you'll win from an armbar
or a rear naked choke,

688
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,430
or a high-kick KO
in the remaining three rounds?

689
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,015
How will you know without trying?

690
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,725
Don't you agree?

691
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,646
I still have three rounds to go.

692
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,400
I have plenty of time left.

693
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,152
So I'll start over.

694
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,406
Believe in me just once.

695
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,616
Are you serious?

696
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,830
You'll get hit with a high kick from me

697
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,833
if you throw in the towel this time.

698
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:23,337
-Understood?
-Understood. Thanks, Soo-bong.

699
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,132
Come here. Don't cry.

700
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,940
Hi, Yoon-ah. You're still here.

701
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,234
I wanted to practice a bit more.

702
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,112
Is something wrong? Why the long face?

703
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,824
Is it because of that guy from before?

704
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,957
I know you don't want to talk about it,
but it's bothering me.

705
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,668
He seems like a good guy.

706
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,378
Why did you turn him down?

707
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,591
I know he's a good guy.

708
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,845
I know better than anyone

709
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,222
that he's a really great guy.

710
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,392
But Hyun-joon,

711
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,938
I don't want to put my trust
in another person again.

712
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,150
I...

713
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,195
don't want to get hurt again.

714
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,629
My answer won't change
no matter what you do.

715
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,798
I have no intention of going out with you.

716
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,425
Don't wait for me.

717
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,368
Are you okay?
You got beat up pretty bad.

718
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,871
I'm okay.
I should be grateful I didn't die.

719
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,207
So what? Are you friends again?

720
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,875
Of course, man.

721
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,711
We decided to remain friends
even after we die.

722
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,548
Breakfast is served.

723
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,259
Kimchi stew! It looks delicious!

724
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,510
Thank you!

725
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,683
Dong-goo, sit down and eat.

726
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,226
I'm fine. I don't feel like eating.

727
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,063
Doo-sik, can you look after Sol today?

728
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,440
I need to go practice
at Hyun-joon's studio.

729
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,359
Sure, no problem. Don't worry.

730
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,735
See you later, then.

731
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,869
By the way, hasn't Yoon-ah been going
to Hyun-joon's studio an awful lot?

732
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,414
You think maybe she's interested in him?

733
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,374
No way.

734
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,167
Don't let it bother you, Dong-goo.

735
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,877
It doesn't bother me.

736
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,298
I've decided not to bother
about Yoon-ah anymore. That's that.

737
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,049
-Good to hear.
-See you later.

738
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,050
Where are you going?

739
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,596
I told you I'm joining Director Kim's
production staff today.

740
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,015
-You did? When?
-I told you!

741
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,018
How many times have I told you?
Listen when I talk, jerk!

742
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,020
Listen, you bastards!

743
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,983
Why does he always
take his shit out on me?

744
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,485
There is no reason to be sad.

745
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,821
-Please eat.
-What?

746
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,698
Eat up, you fool.

747
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,616
CRAZY FOR YOU

748
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,744
-I'm so sleepy.
-Where'd you go this morning?

749
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,996
I didn't go anywhere.
I'm just getting home.

750
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,708
All day, I went to premieres, interviews,
wrote previews and ran errands.

751
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,003
I was on my feet all night. I'm exhausted.

752
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,345
Is that to commemorate getting beat up?

753
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,891
"A cup of coffee
after practicing my lines.

754
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,978
Caffeine helps me go on."

755
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,647
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

756
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,106
I opened a social media account.

757
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,443
Want to see?
I'll grant you the honors.

758
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,028
What is it?

759
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,073
You're so cheesy.

760
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,741
Social media? Why?

761
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:24,244
A celebrity needs to communicate
with his fans through social media.

762
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,663
Celebrity, my ass.

763
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,665
You don't even have followers.
Who are you chatting with?

764
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,957
He's communicating with himself.

765
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,334
I've only just started, that's why.

766
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,087
The number of followers
will increase astronomically.

767
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,004
Oh, goodness.

768
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,675
Hey, Chewbacca. Take a picture with me
as a fan of mine.

769
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,385
Forget it.

770
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,221
Come on. Come over here.

771
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,014
Here we go.

772
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,019
Hey, smile. Come on, smile.

773
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,562
One, two, three!

774
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,815
I said no! You're such a bother.

775
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:53,982
Hey, Chewbacca.

776
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,403
Why is she so mean to me these days?

777
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,737
She's never liked you.

778
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,031
Right. She never has.

779
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,325
Off to work.

780
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,953
-Are you going to shoot that kids' drama?
-Yeah.

781
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,288
I'm fighting Super Aquaman today.

782
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,209
How can I look awesome
shooting that black-ink squid gun?

783
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,545
Like this?

784
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,629
-My goodness.
-Hey.

785
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,299
See you.

786
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,052
-You're nasty.
-He's crazy.

787
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,971
Enjoy yourself.

788
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,602
Why did I start blushing then?

789
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,897
I'm losing it! I must be crazy!

790
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,070
Be still, my heart.

791
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:51,123
You all right?
Super Aquaman beat you up pretty badly.

792
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,708
I'm fine.

793
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,005
I don't know how much longer
I can put up with this.

794
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,801
Are you okay?

795
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,016
At least we're better off than he is.

796
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,226
Thank God we don't have to be
Hairtail Man.

797
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,728
I almost forgot.

798
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,314
-Did you audition?
-Audition for what?

799
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,734
For Director Kim Jin-ho's new drama.

800
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,489
By Kim Jin-ho do you mean
the director who got 40-percent viewership

801
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,116
with his drama Son's Revenge?

802
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,369
-The director with the Midas Touch?
-Yeah.

803
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,705
I auditioned for it yesterday.

804
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,707
-Really?
-Yes.

805
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,627
Darn it, I can't believe I missed it!

806
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,171
Do you know if there's a way
I can still audition?

807
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,688
Hey, Jae-woo!

808
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,774
Jae-woo!

809
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,944
Why does it have to be so loud?

810
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,779
Jae-woo!

811
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,281
Jae-woo!

812
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,533
Hi, Joon-ki!

813
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:08,992
It's been a while!

814
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,577
What brings you here?

815
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:15,290
I heard you're working on Director Kim's
new drama.

816
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,334
Can you get me an audition?

817
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,752
-What did you say?
-Goodness.

818
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,338
-Why are you yelling?
-What?

819
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,758
I can't hear you! Speak louder!

820
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,052
Why are you yelling at me?

821
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:32,266
Sorry about that! I hurt my ears
while shooting a scene

822
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,434
with an explosion!

823
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,811
Really?

824
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,188
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine!

825
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,358
It'll get better with treatment!

826
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,153
I almost forgot!
What did you say earlier?

827
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:50,784
Get me an audition
for Director Kim's drama!

828
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,078
Auditions are over!

829
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:58,208
That's why I'm asking you

830
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,502
to speak to Director Kim for me!

831
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,838
It'll be difficult because he's busy!

832
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,214
He's yelling louder.

833
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:06,758
Hey, Seo-jin.

834
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,595
Joon-ki!

835
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,472
-Are you here for an interview?
-You know how it is.

836
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,685
You look like a real reporter now.

837
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,818
What's wrong with you?

838
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,531
What's wrong with her?

839
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,951
Does she hate me that much?

840
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:39,041
Jae-woo! Help me get an audition!

841
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,544
-Okay! I'll talk to him!
-Really?

842
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,506
-But! I have a favor to ask!
-What is it?

843
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,050
Anything!

844
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,973
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I feel gross.

845
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,601
-Hyun-joon...
-So, have you looked into who'll play...

846
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,187
the Saudi informant cooperating
with our government?

847
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,022
It's not easy finding an Arab actor

848
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,899
who can act well and speak Korean.

849
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,860
That's a problem. It's an important role.

850
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,570
What the hell is he doing?

851
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,364
Hey, Dong-goo, got any ideas?

852
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,240
Hyun-joon!

853
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:13,784
Goodness.

854
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,203
Hyun-joon? Who's that?

855
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,412
Sorry?

856
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,623
You mean Shin Hyun-joon?

857
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,958
You want to put some makeup
on Shin Hyun-joon

858
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,418
and cast him as the Saudi informant?

859
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,589
It's a stretch to cast him
in an Arab role.

860
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,799
It's hilarious.

861
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,968
He's thinking outside the box.

862
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,388
-Get in touch with him.
-Yes, sir.

863
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,431
-Hey, Dong-goo.
-Yes?

864
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,518
That's a brilliant idea. You've definitely
got what it takes. Well done.

865
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,727
Thank you, sir!

866
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,605
Good for you.
I thought of Shin Hyun-joon as well.

867
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,691
-Excuse me?
-You beat me to it.

868
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,651
Sorry.

869
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,779
Jeez.

870
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,788
I wanted to treat you to something nice.
Why did you want to eat tteokbokki?

871
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:03,709
Why? It's good. It tastes even better
because you're buying.

872
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,462
Still, I wanted to treat you
to something nice

873
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,174
since you let me use your studio
and taught me baking techniques.

874
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,136
Tteokbokki is plenty nice.

875
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,892
-Are you sure this is enough?
-It was delicious, really.

876
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,694
-Ow, my back!
-Oh my God!

877
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,112
Are you all right, Hyun-joon?

878
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,906
-Try getting up.
-I'm sorry.

879
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,742
What are you sorry for?
Where are you going?

880
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,201
-Get up.
-Okay.

881
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,121
Ow!

882
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,540
I'm so exhausted.

883
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,210
I'm dying from running around all day.

884
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,423
I have to sleep.

885
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,259
Sleep.

886
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,558
JOON-KI

887
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,853
-What do you want?
-Hey, Seo-jin.

888
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,937
Do you have time right now?

889
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,898
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

890
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,109
I want to take you out.
So can you come?

891
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,905
Where are you? All right.

892
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,827
Why is he ordering me around like this?

893
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,044
He's such a bother.

894
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,672
Fine, I'll do him a favor.

895
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,883
My goodness.

896
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,073
-I'm here.
-Hey.

897
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,868
Why'd you call me out, all of a sudden?

898
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,829
I'm exhausted from working all night.

899
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:08,124
The thing is... I have a favor to ask.

900
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,626
A favor? What is it?

901
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,545
Well...

902
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:12,796
Over here!

903
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,804
Who's he?

904
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,473
He's a producer at the station.

905
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,476
Say hello.

906
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,771
This is my friend's sister, Kang Seo-jin.

907
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:33,942
And this is Kim Jae-woo,
a producer at JBC.

908
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,986
I see. Nice to meet you.

909
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,321
Hello!

910
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,865
I'm Kim Jae-woo!

911
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,199
Nice to meet you!

912
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,577
Gosh.

913
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,620
Why is he yelling?

914
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,540
He hurt his ears during a shoot.

915
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,876
He'll get better soon. Don't worry.

916
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,503
Jae-woo!

917
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,714
You're too loud right now!

918
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,592
Dial it down a little!

919
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,261
My bad. I'm sorry about that.

920
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,932
Why is he here?

921
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,894
He said he was interested in you

922
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:12,022
and asked me to set you up.

923
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,773
You're setting us up?

924
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,819
Joon-ki, can I have a word with you?

925
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:24,492
What the hell is this?
Why would you do this without telling me?

926
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,994
-I'm going.
-Seo-jin.

927
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,496
You can't just leave.

928
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:33,460
Actually, there's this audition
I really want to get.

929
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,962
He's assistant director for that project.

930
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,756
He said he'd let me audition

931
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,717
if I set him up with you
so I had no choice.

932
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:45,263
Don't you feel bad for me
for all the shit I have to put up with?

933
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,060
Seo-jin, please do me this favor.

934
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,896
Just once.

935
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,359
Fine, but I'm...

936
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,818
only staying for dinner.

937
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,363
Thank you. Thank you so much!

938
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,491
I'm going to go, so be good, okay?

939
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,700
Good luck!

940
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,749
That jerk.

941
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,253
Seo-jin! What would you like to eat?

942
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,757
I just...

943
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,843
How about a gorgonzola pizza
and a spaghetti alla carbonara?

944
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,011
Excuse me?

945
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,889
I can't hear you! Please speak

946
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,350
a little bit louder! Please!

947
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,814
A gorgonzola pizza!
And a spaghetti alla carbonara!

948
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,776
A gorgonzola pizza
and a spaghetti alla carbonara?

949
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,361
What would you like to drink?

950
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,821
Grapefruit ade!

951
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,614
Grapefruit ade?

952
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,825
Excuse me! Take our order please!

953
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,118
We heard everything!

954
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:51,454
The chef is already preparing your order!

955
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,455
Thank you!

956
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,999
This is so embarrassing.

957
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,418
Let me use the ladies' room.

958
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,337
-Sorry?
-I'm going to use the ladies' room!

959
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,922
Please, go ahead!

960
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,048
Go relieve yourself!

961
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,220
I'm home.

962
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,347
Hey.

963
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,975
How was it?
Happy to be working on a movie again?

964
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,270
It was really hectic.

965
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,354
What's this?

966
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,356
Ugh! What's that smell?

967
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,903
They're socks.

968
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,241
The director told me to wash them
because he doesn't have any time.

969
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,451
Seriously.

970
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,454
Why are you looking after Sol?
Where's Yoon-ah?

971
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,457
She left this morning
and hasn't come home yet.

972
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,875
She's still not back?

973
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,334
But it's late!

974
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,379
Why, are you worried about her?

975
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:45,050
-I thought you didn't care anymore.
-I'm not worried.

976
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,261
It's because I'm hungry. I'm starving.

977
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,013
It's Yoon-ah.

978
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,849
Hi, Yoon-ah.

979
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,102
Really? Okay.

980
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,937
All right, bye.

981
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,983
Was that Yoon-ah? What did she say?

982
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,443
She said she'll be late.

983
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,071
She's at that chef
Song Hyun-joon's house.

984
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,781
He's injured and his kid is sick

985
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,491
so she has to look after them.

986
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,909
So the two of them

987
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,453
are alone in his house?

988
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,080
At this hour?

989
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,249
You know, they might actually
become a thing.

990
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,169
-You must be concerned, Dong-goo.
-Don't.

991
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,756
Nonsense. Why would I be concerned?

992
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,842
I'm off to bed.

993
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,849
Yes? Hello, Director.

994
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,643
Your socks?

995
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,896
I'll be right there.

996
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,690
For goodness' sake.

997
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,317
Why? What is it?

998
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,529
My director is going to scout a location

999
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,198
and he has special socks
for location scouting.

1000
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,075
He wants me to bring them.

1001
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,244
Darn, it's so late.

1002
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,662
I'll get going, then.

1003
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,666
Socks for location scouting?

1004
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,210
-Do such things exist?
-I don't know.

1005
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,212
Maybe it's for good luck.

1006
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,631
Why won't they answer?

1007
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,259
Why isn't the baking school taking calls?

1008
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,802
Damn it.

1009
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,055
What? Why are the lights off?

1010
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,807
Why is nobody here?

1011
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,851
What the hell is going on?

1012
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,562
Song Hyun-joon, you son of a bitch!

1013
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,106
-Yoon-ah? Where are you?
-Hey!

1014
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,110
Class is over. What are you doing here?

1015
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:31,030
Could I get Mr. Song Hyun-joon's
home address?

1016
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,991
-Why?
-Sorry?

1017
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,785
The thing is...

1018
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,246
I have a parcel for him.

1019
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,373
It's for Mr. Song.

1020
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,167
-Let me see.
-Okay.

1021
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,628
There was a name here somewhere.

1022
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,047
Just a sec. I know I saw his name.

1023
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,217
The sender's name is right here.

1024
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:52,969
Oh, it's right here.

1025
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,888
Here it is.

1026
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,848
Name. Song Hyun-joon.

1027
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,516
I see that it's a parcel,

1028
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,518
but why is there no address?

1029
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:04,272
There are people who write just names
with no address these days.

1030
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,941
So please give me his address.

1031
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,235
I can't. That's private.

1032
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,945
You can just leave it with me.

1033
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,281
-I'll pass it on to him tomorrow.
-You see...

1034
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,911
It's express delivery.
I need to get it to him right away.

1035
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,455
It must be perishable food items.

1036
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,832
I think it's already going bad.

1037
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,544
Smell it. It smells foul.

1038
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,795
This seems pretty expensive.

1039
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,090
Fine!
You do whatever you want with it.

1040
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,635
I don't know anymore.
Whatever happens to this,

1041
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,637
it's your responsibility now.

1042
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,265
Wait.

1043
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,520
Yes?

1044
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,730
Who is it?

1045
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:53,321
-Yoon-ah?
-Dong-goo.

1046
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,448
What are you doing at my director's place?

1047
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,326
Your director? This is Hyun-joon's place.

1048
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,954
That can't be.

1049
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,082
My director asked me
to bring him something

1050
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,750
so I'm here on an errand.

1051
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,794
He must've given me the wrong address.

1052
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,671
I wonder what happened.

1053
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,089
Who is it?

1054
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,008
-Well...
-My gosh!

1055
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:14,926
Hello.

1056
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,179
I think we passed each other by last time.

1057
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,515
Why, yes. Hello.

1058
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,016
Do you live here?

1059
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,728
It would be disrespectful of me
to come all this way and just leave.

1060
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,940
You'll probably feel better if I came
inside for a cup of tea. Am I right?

1061
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,734
But Dong-goo.
Don't you have to go run your errand?

1062
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,779
You're right.

1063
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,033
Yes, hello, Director.

1064
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,952
Excuse me?

1065
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,663
You don't need the location scouting
socks after all?

1066
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,666
I see. Okay.

1067
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,544
Man, this guy. He's so fickle.

1068
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,547
I came all the way here
and now he doesn't need them anymore.

1069
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,758
Seeing as how this happened,
I should stay for that tea.

1070
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,261
Um, yes. Of course.

1071
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,848
Hello, Doo-sik. Pardon?

1072
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,601
Okay. I'll be right there.

1073
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,019
Bye.

1074
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:11,065
Dong-goo. Sol won't stop crying.
I have to go now.

1075
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,526
Can you stay here for a bit?

1076
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,652
What?

1077
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,154
Me?

1078
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:19,449
Hoon is sick
and Hyun-joon is injured, as you can see.

1079
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,491
Please.

1080
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:24,621
Hey, Yoon-ah... Yoon-ah?

1081
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,362
What are you talking about?

1082
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,530
Why is Dong-goo at his place?

1083
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,033
Apparently the director lives
in Hyun-joon's building.

1084
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,743
We met coincidentally

1085
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,829
when Dong-goo rang the bell to Hyun-joon's
thinking it was the director's place.

1086
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:07,747
Are you serious?

1087
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,918
That sort of coincidence happens
maybe once every thousand years.

1088
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,380
It must be really awkward
to stay with someone he barely knows.

1089
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,799
Let him be.

1090
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,342
What could possibly happen?

1091
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:23,930
Why do you keep staring at that
when you don't even get a single comment?

1092
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,307
I do too, get comments!

1093
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,725
My fans comment on it!

1094
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,479
Fine, I'll let you see.

1095
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,107
Goodness.

1096
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,820
"Cheer up, Joon-ki.
Your acting is the best."

1097
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,947
You weren't kidding.

1098
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,492
Their handle is "junki_love_"?

1099
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,536
For goodness' sake.

1100
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,788
They say the world is wide

1101
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,748
and it's overflowing with crazies--

1102
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,417
What? Are you jealous, punk?

1103
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,670
I don't even want to talk
with someone who doesn't have any fans.

1104
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,382
You have arrived at your destination.

1105
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,175
Oh, my God. What the hell?

1106
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,844
What jerk has his navigation on so loud?

1107
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,931
Seo-jin! I had such a great time today!
Good night!

1108
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,559
-Thank you for driving me home!
-What the hell?

1109
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:12,353
-Have a good night, Jae-woo!
-Isn't that Seo-jin?

1110
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,397
-Thank you!
-Why is she yelling so loudly?

1111
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,358
It's-- never mind.

1112
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,319
Hey, Seo-jin.

1113
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,617
Seo-jin... Hey! Seo-jin!

1114
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,624
Seo-jin, what's wrong?

1115
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,959
Something happen?

1116
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,462
Can't you see? I thought my eardrums
were going to pop because of him!

1117
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,048
Just bear with it.
He's undergoing treatment right now.

1118
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,135
-He said that it'll get better soon.
-Shut it.

1119
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,137
I went on that date,
so it's all good, right?

1120
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,930
Actually, Seo-jin...

1121
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,101
I have a few days left until my audition
so can you just help me out until then?

1122
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,352
No way!

1123
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,605
Okay.

1124
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,107
There's nothing I can do.

1125
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,235
The audition's gone down the drain then.

1126
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,154
Guess I'll cry tears of blood,
filled with regret

1127
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,323
if that drama becomes a hit.

1128
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:13,080
I must be fated to wear
that octopus mask for life.

1129
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,208
Fine.

1130
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,878
It's only until your audition, okay?

1131
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,883
Thanks, Seo-jin. Thank you so much!

1132
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,135
Let go.

1133
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,347
Go ahead and rest. Good night!

1134
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,480
Bastard.

1135
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,368
It's so damn awkward.

1136
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,871
Do I have to stay with him all night?

1137
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,042
No worries.

1138
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,837
I have you guys.

1139
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,464
Excuse me, Dong-goo.

1140
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,382
Dong-goo?

1141
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,760
What does he want? Why is he calling me?

1142
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,356
-What is it?
-I'm sorry...

1143
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,608
but can you come inside to help me?

1144
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:27,989
What is it?

1145
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,450
What are you doing?

1146
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,910
Why are your pants pulled down?

1147
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:36,038
I barely sat down on the toilet

1148
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,083
to do my business

1149
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,127
but I can't stand up by myself.

1150
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,130
So what?

1151
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,798
Why did you call me over?

1152
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,801
Please...

1153
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,554
help me up.

1154
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,974
What? You want me to help you up?

1155
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,018
You want me to help you
in your current state?

1156
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,854
I can't stand up by myself, that's why.

1157
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,190
Okay.

1158
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,070
Stick out your hand. Just your hand.

1159
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,989
-I did.
-Slowly.

1160
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,742
-Okay, stop. Other side.
-All right.

1161
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,535
Don't bump into me.

1162
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,537
-Don't... no!
-Okay.

1163
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:19,665
-Let go!
-Okay.

1164
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,375
Seriously.

1165
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,586
-Thank you.
-Forget it.

1166
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,630
Wait, Dong-goo.

1167
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,673
What do you want now?

1168
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,467
I'm sorry

1169
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:35,514
but can you pull up my pants
and underwear for me?

1170
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,808
I can't bend over.

1171
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,479
All right.

1172
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,525
I can't believe what you're asking. Jeez.

1173
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,778
-Gosh, just stay still.
-Sorry.

1174
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:49,779
I'm so sorry.

1175
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,739
I am really, very sorry.

1176
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,243
Oh, my God! I saw it!

1177
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,246
Cover it up with a towel or something!

1178
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,749
You really have no manners. Gosh.

1179
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,503
What happened? Shit! I saw it again!

1180
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,216
Why did you fall? I just helped you up!
Why are you doing this to me?

1181
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,975
I wonder if Dong-goo is doing all right.

1182
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,851
I should call him.

1183
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,855
I'm home.

1184
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,610
Hi, Dong-goo.

1185
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,446
-How's Hoon doing? Is he better?
-Yes.

1186
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,948
I'm glad.

1187
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,159
It must've been uncomfortable for you,
staying with Hyun-joon.

1188
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,079
Did something happen?

1189
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:42,790
Excuse me?

1190
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,960
No. Nothing happened.

1191
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:52,216
I'm mentally drained right now.
I'm going to bed.

1192
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,060
What's the matter with him?
Did they fight?

1193
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:08,065
No. This can't be happening!
This isn't right!

1194
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,900
Huh?

1195
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,164
It's too salty!

1196
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,499
How can you still not know
how to make ramyun properly?

1197
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,501
-Don't eat it!
-It's delicious!

1198
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,545
-Thank you.
-Then shut up and eat.

1199
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,631
-You have arrived at your destination.
-Again?

1200
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,508
Seo-jin must be home.

1201
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:38,012
You might really go deaf
spending time with him.

1202
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,350
Hey, Chewbacca, what's with the flowers?

1203
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:47,938
Hey. Hey, Chewbacca!

1204
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,107
-Go ask her.
-Okay.

1205
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,485
Hey, Chewbacca!

1206
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:58,240
What are the flowers for?
Are they from Jae-woo?

1207
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,451
It must be going well with him.

1208
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,328
He asked me to be his girlfriend.

1209
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,789
-Really?
-What should I do?

1210
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,875
Should I date him?

1211
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,169
You can if you want. You don't have to.

1212
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:14,006
-Joon-ki. Can I ask you something?
-What is it?

1213
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,509
Do you...

1214
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,095
not see me as a woman?

1215
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,847
What are you saying?

1216
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:26,685
To me, you're a man. What shall I do?

1217
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,397
Of course I'm a man.
I'm not a woman, silly.

1218
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,565
That's not what I mean.

1219
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,567
I...

1220
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,279
think I like you.

1221
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,243
What?

1222
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:44,036
I like you, Joon-ki.

1223
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,106
Why should I be upset?

1224
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,024
Something's up with Seo-jin.

1225
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,609
She doesn't look well.

1226
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,153
-It won't last.
-What is this?

1227
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,946
Seo-jin, what is this?

1228
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,073
-Why did you do it?
-Why do you think?

1229
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,700
I'm going on a date with Seo-jin today!

1230
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:25,035
What?
I don't think you can meet her today!

1231
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,079
Seo-jin, let's talk.

1232
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,623
-I've always wanted to study fashion.
-I'll help you.

1233
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,542
What is the name of the prince
who died tragically?

1234
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,793
Yoo Ah-in!

1235
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,837
Shall we start with English?

1236
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,010
It's been a while, that's why.
Don't worry too much.

1237
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,970
Why are you so conscientious of Hyun-joon?

1238
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,514
Because he's always around Yoon-ah.
It bothers me.

1239
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,143
Wow, you're really good at gonggi.

1240
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,770
Hello. Please teach me how to play gonggi.

1241
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,022
I need to learn gonggi.

1242
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:55,274
I really want to be good at it. Please.

1243
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:59,153
Mr. Song Hyun-joon.
How about a game of gonggi?
