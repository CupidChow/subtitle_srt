1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,338
Good job today, guys.
See you tomorrow.

2
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,007
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,392
-Please look over here!
-Sung-bin!

4
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,189
Excuse me...

5
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,732
Yes?

6
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,733
Could you...

7
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,488
-Yes?
-take a picture of me with Sung-bin?

8
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,241
Oh, okay.

9
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,038
Okay.

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,751
One, two, three!

11
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,213
Thank you.

12
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,851
Joon-ki, let's go see a movie
this weekend.

13
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,103
There's this movie I want to see.

14
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,606
It's been so long since we went on a date.

15
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,857
Okay.

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,069
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

17
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,446
Well...

18
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,157
I thought once the drama aired

19
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,993
there would be people who recognize me
and that I would gain some fans,

20
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,371
but nothing's changed.

21
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,998
You'll get fans soon.

22
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,126
Will that day actually come?

23
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,087
We're home!

24
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,381
-Did you go grocery shopping?
-Yeah.

25
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,676
You two look like newlyweds.

26
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,304
Newlyweds? Stop it.

27
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,974
Seriously, that's too much.

28
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,852
You love it.

29
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,105
Wait, does that mean Dong-goo
is Sol's dad now?

30
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,233
Sol's father. You're Sol-fa!

31
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,737
Gosh, I'm not Sol's dad.

32
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,282
-You took it too far, Joon-ki.
-Totally.

33
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,742
That's too much, Joon-ki.

34
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,661
I can't look at you guys.

35
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,706
-By the way, what's that, Yoon-ah?
-Oh, that's right.

36
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,126
This came for Joon-ki in the mail,
but there's no return address.

37
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,460
Really?

38
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,045
Who sent it?

39
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,179
What is this?

40
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,056
I LOVE YOU JOON-KI FOREVER

41
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,893
-What is this?
-Oh my God!

42
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,811
Is that blood?

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,271
I LOVE YOU JOON-KI

44
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,773
Yeah. I think it is.

45
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,070
-Hello?
-Joon-ki...

46
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,782
Did you receive the present I sent you?

47
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,160
Present?

48
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,706
Do you mean...

49
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,709
Who are you?

50
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,878
It's me, Jin-joo.

51
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,631
Don't you know me, Joon-ki?

52
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:35,924
Jin-joo?

53
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,927
I've never heard that name before.

54
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,303
What?

55
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,766
How... how can you not know who I am?

56
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,145
All I do is think about you
and look at you...

57
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,105
How can you do this to me!

58
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,530
-What the hell?
-Why? Who is it?

59
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,574
I think it's the person who sent this.

60
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,117
-What?
-What?

61
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,661
She even knows your number?

62
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,830
-Is she a stalker?
-Stalker?

63
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,541
You know, those fans
who become crazy obsessive.

64
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,711
-Does that mean I have a fan?
-That's not something to be happy about!

65
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,507
Joon-ki. Let's report her
before something happens.

66
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,884
Over something like this? Don't.

67
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,052
Just a sec.

68
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,388
She's just a fan. It's no big deal.
She says she loves me.

69
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,182
-It's okay.
-Hello? Is this the police?

70
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,558
STALKER

71
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,312
Look at how good my driving is.

72
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,940
-You suck at this!
-Geez.

73
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,650
Hey, you're not being fair.

74
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,944
How can you throw a banana peel
at a beginner?

75
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,821
Sorry.

76
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,992
I won!

77
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,327
You can't overtake me like that.
You tricked me.

78
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,538
"The loser doesn't speak."
Don't you know that saying?

79
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,748
Anyway, you lost. Go make that ramyun.

80
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,126
You're so cheap with your dirty tricks.

81
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,961
-Do you want to die?
-Eggs or no eggs in the ramyun?

82
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,296
Never mind, I'll take care of it.

83
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,716
-Seo-jin, let me know if you want some.
-Okay.

84
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,509
Make it good.

85
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,970
Why are you always teasing him?

86
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,098
I don't know, but there's nothing
I enjoy more in the entire world.

87
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,602
Hello?

88
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,314
Yes, I see. Thank you.

89
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,523
Who's that?

90
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,067
They caught Joon-ki's stalker.

91
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,781
We traced the number to a nearby
internet cafe.

92
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,410
I'm sorry, Joon-ki.

93
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,914
I did it because I love you so much.

94
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,876
Because you're so awesome...

95
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,672
I didn't mean any harm.

96
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,759
I'm serious.

97
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,845
What shall we do?
Do you want to press charges?

98
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,684
Darn it.

99
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,445
I'm letting it go because you promised

100
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,031
that you will never do it again, okay?

101
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,948
Okay.

102
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,659
Do you... like me that much?

103
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,705
Yes. I really like you.

104
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,541
I became a fan the first time I saw you.

105
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,211
You were in Cold-Blooded
as the gangster minion,

106
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,797
as the radioactive mutant
in Superhuman City,

107
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,423
the abductor in My Mom,

108
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,717
the chauffeur in Gayageum in My Heart,

109
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,178
and Octopus Man in Super Aquaman.

110
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,555
I watched them all.

111
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,891
Are you serious? You watched all those?

112
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,810
Of course!

113
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,312
I even own a copy of all the programs

114
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,855
you appeared in on DVD.

115
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,483
Even I don't have those.

116
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,652
You're amazing!

117
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,320
You said your name is Jin-joo, right?

118
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,698
Jin-joo. From now on, if you want
to see me, call me and come visit me

119
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,242
at home.

120
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,201
My address is--

121
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,371
Seoul, Yongsan-gu Huam-ro 31-gil,

122
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,248
Waikiki Guesthouse.

123
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,625
The room next to the bathroom
on the first floor.

124
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,544
How did you know that?

125
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,087
That's...

126
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,422
not the issue here.

127
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,007
Huh?

128
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,676
Okay...

129
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,637
You must be hungry.
Shall I buy you tteokbokki?

130
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,764
Yes, Joon-ki!

131
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,141
Let's go.

132
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,643
I'm so happy right now.

133
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,194
All right. Well done, Ah-young.

134
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,073
I know you're busy with work.
Thanks for making the time to help out.

135
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,034
Don't mention it.
I get to make money, too.

136
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,327
I need to use the bathroom.

137
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,537
Sure, give me those.

138
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,205
-Thank you.
-Sure.

139
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,752
Huh? What's that sound?

140
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,383
Don't tell me. Is that the sound
of your heart beating, Doo-sik?

141
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,468
What?

142
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,304
No, it's not.

143
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,599
Bullshit. Did you fall for Ah-young?

144
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,601
You should ask her out.

145
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,728
No, that's not it.

146
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,104
Goodness.

147
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,151
Ah-young. Doo-sik wants
to watch a movie with you.

148
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,360
Hey, Soo-ah. What are you doing?

149
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,738
With you?

150
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,698
I'd love to. Which movie?

151
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,366
Well...

152
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,619
Anything you want.

153
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,871
When do you want to go?

154
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,803
Mom... Hi, Mommy.

155
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,349
Oh my God! What?

156
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,351
Jin-joo.

157
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,520
What are you doing here?

158
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,314
You said I could come over anytime.

159
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,484
You looked so adorable
while you were sleeping

160
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,194
that I watched you.

161
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,196
Since when?

162
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,822
Around midnight last night?

163
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,282
Midnight?

164
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,494
I see...

165
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,497
I didn't know.

166
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:02,833
What is this?

167
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,794
What is all this?

168
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,505
I don't like to see other people

169
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,632
next to you in your photos,

170
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,051
so I switched them out to my face.

171
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,100
Why?

172
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,102
You don't like it?

173
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,022
No, not at all. I love it.

174
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,692
I really do.

175
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,277
That's a relief.

176
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,405
Why is it so loud?

177
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,031
Gosh! Who are you?

178
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,866
Why the hell do you want to know?

179
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,743
Can't you see we're talking here?

180
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,995
Sorry?

181
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,970
Joon-ki! Let's go out
and have breakfast together.

182
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,681
I prepared breakfast just for you.

183
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,683
Just for me?

184
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,519
Okay, sure... I'll be right out.

185
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,730
Hurry, okay?

186
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,481
Okay.

187
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,903
What the hell?

188
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,488
-Who is that freak?
-Goodness.

189
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,532
Seriously, I was so scared

190
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,744
that I pretended to sleep.
Who the hell is she?

191
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,329
She's a fan of mine.

192
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,249
You know, the one who sent me
those photos yesterday. It's her.

193
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,460
You're telling me it's that stalker?

194
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,379
No, silly! She's not a stalker.
She's a fan.

195
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,132
She just likes me too much, that's why.

196
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,552
I'm going to go have breakfast
with my fan, okay?

197
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,598
-That's what you call a stalk--
-She's a fan!

198
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,099
Don't eat anything!

199
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,894
He's going to get himself
into trouble yet again.

200
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,112
-Doo-sik.
-Hi.

201
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,867
You look very pretty today, Ah-young.

202
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,202
You think so?

203
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,829
I tried to look nice for our date.
Do you like it?

204
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,791
Yes, you're pretty. Very pretty.

205
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,125
Thank you.

206
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,627
You look good, too.

207
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,588
You must really love tracksuits.

208
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,174
I wear them often because they're comfy.

209
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,759
I see.

210
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,470
You even got us popcorn and soda.

211
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,888
That's very thoughtful of you.

212
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,766
You think so? Shall we go inside?

213
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,229
That movie was awesome, right?

214
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,980
Do you want to go grab something to eat?

215
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,149
Forget it, I just want to go home.

216
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,776
Huh? Why?

217
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,820
Do you have to ask?

218
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,030
You're unbelievable.

219
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,700
What? What did I do?

220
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,037
Why is she suddenly so upset?
Ah-young!

221
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,332
Sol, shall we start learning Hangul?

222
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,127
The first word you should learn

223
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,629
is "daddy."

224
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,464
Okay?

225
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,676
"Daddy." Say "daddy."

226
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,972
Sol, you have to focus.

227
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,350
Let's try again. "Daddy."

228
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,936
"Daddy."

229
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,855
Say "daddy" just once. Please?

230
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,155
What's wrong with you?

231
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,198
You were so excited about your date.
Why the long face?

232
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,742
Well...

233
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,037
What?

234
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,498
She got upset and left
as soon as the movie ended?

235
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,958
That's what I'm telling you.

236
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,794
Think about it carefully.
You must've done something wrong.

237
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,629
But I didn't!

238
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,133
I arrived 30 minutes early to wait for her
and I got tickets to the movie she wanted.

239
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,136
I had popcorn and soda ready
and we enjoyed the movie.

240
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,512
But suddenly she got upset and left.

241
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,055
What could it be?

242
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,308
Did the popcorn taste bad?

243
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,477
Nope, she ate every last kernel.

244
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,770
Really? Then what could it be?

245
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,399
Is it because you got regular soda
instead of diet?

246
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,985
It can't be.
She finished my drink as well.

247
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,195
Really?

248
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,282
-Maybe she just didn't like your face!
-What?

249
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,035
The more I look at it,

250
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,620
the more pissed off I get.

251
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,914
-That doesn't make any sense!
-But it does!

252
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,917
What on earth did I do wrong?

253
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,669
Doo-sik, let's play a game to see
who has to make ramyun.

254
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,797
What's with your face?
Did something happen?

255
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,467
Well...

256
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:27,056
Geez. I can totally see why Ah-young
would be upset.

257
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,641
Why?

258
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,934
What did I do?

259
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,977
Do you have to ask?

260
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,688
You may not be in a relationship,

261
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,358
but it's still a first date.
I can't believe you wore a tracksuit.

262
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,611
Tracksuit? What's wrong with that?

263
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,530
Hey. I'm sure Ah-young

264
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,323
got all dolled up for your date.

265
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,617
But you didn't make any effort.

266
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,993
Wouldn't you be mad?

267
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,372
But I chose the nicest tracksuit I have.

268
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,915
Look.

269
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,959
-It's a frog.
-Gosh.

270
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,671
-Is this something to be that upset over?
-Exactly. It looks good.

271
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,089
-It's the cutest.
-Right?

272
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,842
Goodness, you guys really have no idea
what women want.

273
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,806
Anyway, Ah-young is the sensitive type,
so make it up to her, okay?

274
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,517
Okay, I will.

275
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,648
-I love you!
-Sung-bin!

276
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,359
-Take a picture with me!
-Sung-bin!

277
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,444
-You're the best!
-I love you!

278
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,990
-Please look over here!
-You're awesome!

279
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,659
Joon-ki!

280
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,829
MY HANDSOME LEE JOON-KI

281
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,916
My handsome Lee Joon-ki!

282
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,378
I love you, Lee Joon-ki!

283
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,092
You did great today, Joon-ki.

284
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,428
Have a beverage.

285
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,264
And this is a vitamin.

286
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,557
And here is

287
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,059
a lollipop for when
you're low on blood sugar.

288
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,687
Here you go.

289
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,273
This is all for me?

290
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,942
You didn't have to.

291
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,153
Thank you.

292
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,780
Director, she's a fan of mine.

293
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,574
You're a star now, aren't you?

294
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,535
Sung-bin!

295
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,078
She's my fan!

296
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,123
She's my fan.

297
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,421
Why'd you ask to see me again?

298
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,214
Ah-young...

299
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,468
-I'm sorry about yesterday.
-What are you sorry for?

300
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,680
I was inconsiderate
and wore a tracksuit on our date...

301
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,599
Sorry.

302
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,272
So you know, huh?

303
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,317
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.

304
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,611
Let me make it up to you. Let's go eat.

305
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,197
There's a good cake shop nearby.
Do you want to go?

306
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,741
This cake is really delicious.

307
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,786
I had a craving for something sweet
because I was so stressed out.

308
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,496
Why? Did something happen?

309
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,499
There was this incident at work.

310
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,668
My colleague kept giving me her work

311
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,252
while she was slacking off.

312
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,921
Really?

313
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,341
I was really annoyed today, too,
because of a customer.

314
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,010
She wanted to return something
that she ripped by mistake.

315
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,638
-I was speechless.
-I can't believe people like them.

316
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,350
-You must've had a tough day.
-That's okay. It happens all the time.

317
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,395
You finished your coffee.
Let me get you a refill.

318
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,188
Forget it, I'm leaving.

319
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,649
What?

320
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,694
Why, all of a sudden?
Did I do something wrong again?

321
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,987
Do you have to ask?

322
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,073
-You're unbelievable.
-What?

323
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,535
What did I do? Ah-young!

324
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,745
What is it this time?

325
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,915
Geez. She had every right to be upset.

326
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,041
You think so?

327
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,793
What did I do wrong?

328
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,796
She complained to you about something
that happened at work.

329
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,506
Why would you tell her about your day?

330
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,009
What's wrong with that?
Is that something to get mad about?

331
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:50,926
Why?

332
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,888
She wanted you to listen to her
and take her side.

333
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,432
She wanted you to empathize.

334
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,101
Then you should've taken her side
or comforted her.

335
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,020
Or just listen to her.

336
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,648
But instead, you made it about you.
Wouldn't you be upset?

337
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,651
Oh... is that so?

338
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,404
That's what it was.

339
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,782
-Good job today.
-Thank you, sir.

340
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,869
Thank you. Good night.

341
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,417
They're going to be here today!

342
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,419
It's Jin-joo.

343
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,130
Gosh, she came to see me again.

344
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,133
Am I that lovable?

345
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,553
BE MINE, ASTAR

346
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,388
-Jin-joo!
-Hi, Joon-ki.

347
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,557
You didn't have to come again.

348
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,018
Let's go. I'll buy you a warm cup of--

349
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,063
What's all this?

350
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,731
Oh, this?

351
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,025
This is the ASTAR fan club T-shirt.

352
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,360
And this is an ABONG, ASTAR's light stick.

353
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,863
I'm a big fan of ASTAR.

354
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,865
ASTAR?

355
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,660
I thought I was the only celebrity
you liked.

356
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,497
Of the actors, it's you.
And among the singers,

357
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,207
it's ASTAR!

358
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,085
I see.

359
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,421
Weren't we going to watch my drama
together today?

360
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,634
I know. I'll be right over as soon as
ASTAR is done performing.

361
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,551
It's ASTAR!

362
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,404
There we go. All done.

363
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,448
This should be enough, right?

364
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,744
It's almost time. Where is Jin-joo?

365
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,455
What's all this? It looks delicious!

366
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,790
-Hey.
-Ouch!

367
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,916
How dare you touch this?

368
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,585
This is for Jin-joo and me to eat
while we watch my drama.

369
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,131
You're telling me you prepared snacks
for that stalker of yours?

370
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,301
Who are you calling stalker?
She's a fan!

371
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,971
Goodness, why isn't she here yet?

372
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,015
Oh Joon-ki...

374

SPONSORED BY DOUGH MIN HO PIZZA

375
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,610
What happened to her?

376
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,863
The drama's over.
Why is she still not here?

377
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,906
She won't even answer her phone.

378
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,450
Did something happen to her?

379
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,375
What the hell?

380
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,588
It was ringing just now.
Why is her phone turned off?

381
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,715
Is she...

382
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,384
avoiding my calls?

383
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,096
No way. No, that can't be.

384
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,640
I'm sure that's not it.

385
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,559
It can't be...

386
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,949
Joon-ki... What are you doing here?

387
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,578
We were supposed to meet up last night.

388
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,247
But you never showed up
and I couldn't get in touch with you.

389
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,249
I came because I was worried.

390
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,420
But how do you know where I live?

391
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,588
Huh?

392
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,010
That's not the issue right now.

393
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,720
Why didn't you come yesterday?

394
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,557
ASTAR's performance went on
longer than expected.

395
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,059
I see.

396
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,396
Then did you watch last night's episode?

397
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,815
No, I was too tired

398
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,359
and I just went to bed.

399
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,152
I see.

400
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,904
That can happen.

401
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,408
I downloaded it.
Do you want to watch it together?

402
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,786
Okay, sure.

403
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,038
I'll come over to your place later.

404
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,750
Will you? Okay. I'll be waiting for you.

405
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,085
Okay.

406
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,760
Ah-young. I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

407
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,928
What are you sorry for?

408
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,890
When you told me about
what happened at work,

409
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,434
I didn't listen and made it
about me instead.

410
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,689
At least you know.
Do you have any idea how upset I was?

411
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,525
Sorry. I just didn't know any better.

412
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,901
I'll be careful from now on.

413
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,152
Okay.

414
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,530
You're not mad anymore, right?

415
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,824
What shall we do?
What do you want to do?

416
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,950
Forget it, I'm leaving.

417
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,035
You're really unbelievable.

418
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,662
What is it? Why?

419
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,372
Did I do something wrong?

420
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,873
Do you have to ask?

421
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,459
How can you come meet me
without thinking about what to do?

422
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,838
Shouldn't you have thought about it
and made plans before coming here?

423
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,009
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.

424
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,805
The weather is so nice.
Shall we go to the park for a stroll?

425
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,349
-The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
-Forget it, I'm leaving.

426
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,435
You're really unbelievable.

427
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,895
Why? What is it?

428
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,772
Why am I so unbelievable?

429
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,817
Can't you see I'm wearing high heels?

430
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,527
But you want to go to the park?

431
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,279
Do you want to see me in pain?

432
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,490
You're right. I'm sorry.

433
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,742
I wasn't thinking straight.

434
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,120
Then shall we go for a cup of coffee?

435
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,788
If you want.

436
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,541
Okay, let's do that.

437
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,255
SHINE, ASTAR
BE MINE, ASTAR

438
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,134
Jin-joo, where are you?

439
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,385
Why aren't you coming?

440
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,512
You said we'd watch
my drama together.

441
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,931
Geez. It's him again.

442
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,433
What's wrong with him?

443
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,853
Where are you?
Are you on your way?

444
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,481
Jin-joo, why won't you answer me?

445
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,816
Why are you ignoring me?

446
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,736
Damn, he's persistent.

447
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,362
INCOMING CALL FROM JOON-KI

448
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,281
Forget it.

449
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,161
Why didn't you answer?

450
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,247
Joon-ki... What are you doing here?

451
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,666
That's not the issue at hand.

452
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,002
What are you doing here?

453
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,421
Are you here to see ASTAR again?

454
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,217
Did you stand me up because of ASTAR?

455
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,302
Sorry? Uh... No.

456
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,847
I just forgot is all.

457
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,766
I was just about to leave.

458
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,851
Is that so?

459
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,354
That's what happened, right?

460
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,939
Then, shall we?

461
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,363
I prepared a present for you.

462
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,242
-Ta-da!
-What is it?

463
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,787
This...

464
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,039
is a Jooni T-shirt.

465
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,754
And this is my light stick, Joonibong.

466
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,097
Why, don't you like it?

467
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,852
Not at all. I love it!

468
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,437
Wow. Wow.

469
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,066
Thank you.

470
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,693
It's a Joonibong...

471
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,946
Wow.

472
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,659
-You call yourself a reporter?
-Look!

473
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,453
It's me. I'm on!

474
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,457
Hey, Jin-joo.

475
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,293
What are you doing?

476
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,753
Excuse me? Why?

477
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,506
Why won't you wave your Joonibong?

478
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,426
You went all out for ASTAR.

479
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,387
I was just about to.

480
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,021
What? You're yawning?

481
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,940
Sleepy already?

482
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,777
You had no problems
staying up all night for ASTAR.

483
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,323
I wasn't yawning,

484
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,743
I was surprised by your acting is all.

485
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,704
-That's what happened, right?
-Yes.

486
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,458
Look! It's me again!

487
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,385
Come on. What are you doing over there?

488
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,888
-Doo-sik!
-Go easy on me, Doo-sik.

489
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,848
I can't do that. It's a game.

490
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,644
Okay, here I go!

491
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,898
Yay! First place. I came in first!
Did you see?

492
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,566
I'm first place!

493
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:28,985
I'm leaving.

494
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,445
You're unbelievable.

495
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,780
Okay...

496
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,406
I'm sorry.

497
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,867
I made another mistake.

498
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:36,952
I'm sorry.

499
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,871
Let me cook you ramyun to make up for it.

500
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,789
Come on.

501
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,168
-Okay, fine.
-Come on.

502
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,215
Hey Soo-ah. When did you get here?

503
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,925
Huh? Just now.

504
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,928
-What's that?
-This?

505
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,222
It's a video game.

506
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,557
I picked it up to play with you.

507
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,895
Let's play later.
I'm about to have ramyun with Ah-young.

508
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,230
Okay, sure.

509
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,606
Enjoy.

510
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,237
I guess I can play alone.

511
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,873
It's more fun with two.

512
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,668
Soo-ah. Hey, Soo-ah.

513
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,585
Yes?

514
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,838
Doo-sik, do you want to play with me?

515
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,339
Hold on.

516
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,757
We can play it later.

517
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,467
I have something to ask you.

518
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,678
Me? What is it?

519
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,513
Well...

520
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,433
I want to ask Ah-young
to be my girlfriend.

521
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,476
How should I do it?

522
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,187
What? Girlfriend?

523
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,565
I don't want to make another mistake.

524
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,066
So...

525
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,609
can you tell me what women like?

526
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,946
-How would I know?
-Don't be like that.

527
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,240
Help me, please?

528
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,450
I don't know!

529
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,708
There's this thing girls are crazy about.

530
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,002
What should we have for lunch?

531
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,588
Spaghetti or Chinese food?

532
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,881
Ah-young.

533
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,093
Doo-sik. What are you doing here?

534
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,137
What's with your outfit?

535
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,938
I have something to say to you.

536
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,607
What is it?

537
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,091
What do you think you're doing?

538
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,086
Ah-young...

539
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,880
will you be my girlfriend?

540
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,097
Doo-sik, what are you doing right now?

541
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,098
What's wrong?

542
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,393
Are you touched? Is that it?

543
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,312
Then shall we start--

544
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,196
Ah-young, what's wrong?

545
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,323
Did I do something wrong again?

546
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,130
Where are you?
Why can't I get in touch with you?

547
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,507
You went to see ASTAR again. Am I right?

548
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,635
What the hell is wrong with him?

549
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,221
He's a complete stalker, all right.

550
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,482
Joon-ki.

551
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,276
Are you just getting home, dear Jin-joo?

552
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,281
-How did you get inside?
-What?

553
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,243
That's not the issue right now.

554
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,039
You're right.

555
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,250
You haven't been answering
my calls lately.

556
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,586
I came because I was worried.

557
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,879
But it seems

558
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,423
you're fine.

559
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,927
I've been busy lately...

560
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,430
Is that so? Then you probably missed
watching my drama.

561
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,348
Shall we...

562
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,975
watch it together on VOD?

563
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,812
-Right now?
-Why?

564
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,857
ONLY LOOK AT ME

565
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,567
You don't want to?

566
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,528
Excuse me?

567
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,655
Who are you calling a stalker?

568
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,698
I wasn't stalking her!

569
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,534
Jin-joo is my first fan,

570
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,202
so I was happy about it, that's why.

571
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,080
I didn't mean any harm. Really.

572
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,374
Jin-joo.

573
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,917
You know how I feel, right?

574
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,836
So...

575
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,420
-will you press charges?
-Yes.

576
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,797
Yes, she'll-- What?

577
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,508
Jin-joo!

578
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,637
Goodness. You have nothing better to do

579
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,056
than to stalk a stalker and end up
with a restraining order?

580
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,558
I didn't stalk her.

581
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,892
It was out of love for my fan.

582
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,477
Goodness.

583
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,480
You really outdid yourself.

584
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,316
The only fan you had is now gone.

585
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,155
-Damn it.
-Oh my goodness.

586
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,950
He's upset.

587
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,160
That temper of his.

588
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,335
Where did you go looking like that?

589
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,378
Min Soo-ah!

590
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,965
What the hell happened? Tell me!

591
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,093
What is it? What's going on?

592
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,271
Excuse me? You publicly confessed to her
while tap dancing?

593
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,482
In front of her colleagues?

594
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:42,942
Are you crazy?

595
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,862
Don't you know that women despise
public confessions?

596
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,656
Are you serious?

597
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,575
Min Soo-ah!

598
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,118
You said that would do the trick!

599
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,245
You said that's what women love!

600
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,082
That's strange.

601
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,918
I'm all about public confessions.

602
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,837
I guess other women don't like it.

603
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,881
I had no idea. Sorry.

604
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,883
Sorry doesn't cut it.

605
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,551
What will you do now?

606
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,553
Take care of this!

607
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,847
I said I'm sorry.

608
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,309
I'm a bit tired. Good night.

609
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,355
Where are you going? Hey!

610
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,650
Come back here!

611
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,574
-Yoon-ah!
-Oh my God!

612
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,909
Go away! Don't!

613
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,202
Dong-goo, are you okay?

614
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,829
I'm sorry. I was so startled.

615
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,998
It's fine. I'm the one to blame
for startling you.

616
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,876
Sorry I'm late.

617
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,419
My meeting ran long.

618
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,090
It's okay. I just got here after class.

619
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,007
Shall we go?

620
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:52,553
It's still chilly out.

621
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,930
Aren't your hands cold?

622
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,848
Pardon? I'm okay.

623
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,310
No, I don't think you are.
You look like you're freezing.

624
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,979
Want me to warm them up for you?

625
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,314
My hands are warm, you know.

626
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,402
It's not because I want to hold your hand.
You know that, right?

627
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,154
Okay then.

628
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,750
Ah-young, listen to me. Please.

629
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,669
The reason I tap danced is-- Ah-young!

630
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:25,920
Damn it.

631
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,964
Hey, Min Soo-ah!

632
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,466
This is all your fault. Do you know that?

633
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,427
I said I'm sorry.

634
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,056
I wonder why Ah-young's not a fan
of tap dancing. I love it.

635
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,891
Is that all you have to say?

636
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,936
Hey, Soo-ah! Come here!

637
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,772
Hi.

638
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,192
You're home.

639
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,069
It's so hard to see you these days.

640
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,446
Sorry.

641
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,656
It's because I'm busy with the drama.

642
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,744
I know. I know, but do you know
when our last date was?

643
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,370
Sorry about that.

644
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,832
Do you want to go out for a movie
right now?

645
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,710
Forget it. You'll pass out.

646
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,669
Let's go next time.

647
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,297
I'm really sorry.

648
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,426
I get done early tomorrow.
Want to go watch a movie?

649
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,887
I'll make time no matter what.

650
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,766
Really? You promised, okay?

651
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,392
-Promise.
-Promise.

652
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,613
I'm exhausted.

653
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,657
One all-nighter after another.
This is crazy.

654
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,160
I'm dying.

655
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,661
It must be tough.

656
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,166
But I'm grateful I have a chance to act.

657
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,878
I'm physically drained,
but extremely happy.

658
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,550
Hi, losers.

659
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,968
What the hell?

660
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,929
Are you manic today?

661
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,846
Where've you been?

662
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,141
I went on a date with Yoon-ah.
A romantic date.

663
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,437
You're grinning from ear to ear.
Are you that happy?

664
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,482
I wonder how far Dong-goo has gotten.

665
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,401
He's probably kissed her, right?

666
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,947
What? Kiss?

667
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,784
We did that already. At the wedding.

668
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,286
That was a peck. It doesn't count.

669
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,996
Don't you know the difference?

670
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,875
Look at him.
He hasn't even kissed her yet.

671
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,503
-Have you held hands?
-Of course!

672
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,214
We hold hands every day!
We interlock fingers and everything!

673
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,924
Good for you!

674
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,009
You must be so happy
to interlock fingers with her.

675
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,970
Keep it up forever, okay?

676
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,681
Hey, now. You should rid your dirty mind
of the notion

677
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,183
that physical intimacy
is the measure of the degree of love.

678
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,144
Yes, good sir. I'll do that.

679
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,604
Live a life filled with happiness
with your interlocked fingers!

680
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,522
Wait.

681
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,442
Are you saying that you've kissed Seo-jin?

682
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,116
What are you, a shrimp!
Get up, you bastard!

683
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,535
I'm asking if you did that to my sister!

684
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,661
Get up!

685
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,954
DANCING WITH ELIZABETH

686
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,085
Good morning.

687
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,461
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

688
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,546
What are you doing?

689
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,591
I'm making some side dishes
with spring greens.

690
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,218
That sounds good.

691
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,097
Yoon-ah, you have something on your lip.

692
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,392
It must've happened when
I was tasting the food.

693
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,519
Over here. Let me get it for you.

694
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,357
They're soft.

695
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,318
So soft.

696
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,945
If they're this soft to the touch,

697
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,364
how much softer will they feel to my lips?

698
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,158
What's the matter, Dong-goo?

699
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,618
I want to kiss her.

700
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,704
I want to kiss her!

701
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,624
Dong-goo, are you okay?

702
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,210
Sorry? Yeah... I'm fine.

703
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,296
I was just thinking about something.

704
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,591
I have to head to work.

705
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,884
Okay.

706
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,513
Now that we've cast Shin Hyun-joon

707
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,558
and hidden the air rifle in bread...

708
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,728
Next, our protagonist Kang Chul

709
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,606
has to meet up with the Arab informant
played by Shin Hyun-joon.

710
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,109
Do you any refreshing ideas
for how they'll identify each other?

711
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,446
How about they touch their glasses
to send a signal?

712
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,241
That's been overdone.

713
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,326
Any novel ideas?

714
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,871
There he goes again.

715
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,957
He's brewing something up.
What is it this time?

716
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,919
-Kiss!
-Kiss?

717
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,673
You're saying that should be the signal.

718
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,259
That's novel indeed.

719
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,176
Director!

720
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,263
This is too much.

721
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,389
What is?

722
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,641
It's novel and sexy. It's great.

723
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,686
Director, I can't work on this movie
anymore.

724
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,481
-What's the matter with you?
-I quit.

725
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,028
But... What...

726
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,697
Sir!

727
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,866
It must be tough these days
with all the all-nighters.

728
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,201
It's all right.

729
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,955
I'm grateful I can act.

730
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,332
By the way, do you have an agency?

731
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
-No, not yet.
-Really?

732
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,170
Then you manage your schedule
and wardrobe yourself?

733
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,171
Yes.

734
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,799
You should be taken care
of in a more systematic manner

735
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,467
so you can focus on acting.

736
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,389
That's right. Do you want me to talk
to my CEO for you?

737
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,642
Pardon? Your agency...

738
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
is YS, right?

739
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,482
YS is huge. There's no way I can...

740
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,235
I'll set up a meeting.

741
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,737
Talk to the CEO, okay?

742
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,113
Are you serious?

743
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,241
Thank you. Thank you!

744
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,579
-I have to get going.
-Thank you.

745
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,706
Thank you!

746
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,501
YS? Wow!

747
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,962
Gosh. This is where you were.

748
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,797
The writer sent a revised script.

749
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,550
-A revised script?
-Yeah. A really important scene

750
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,386
-has been added. Take a look at Scene 38.
-Thirty-eight?

751
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,350
Joon-seok realizes that his situation

752
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,936
is very much like that of Elizabeth
who is in a window display,

753
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,606
that he starts crying
as he looks at Elizabeth.

754
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,316
Elizabeth?

755
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,234
Who's Elizabeth?

756
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,323
What's the turtle for?

757
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,283
This is Elizabeth.

758
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,079
Sorry? This turtle is Elizabeth?

759
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,539
Yes. This is your pet starting
from this episode.

760
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,501
What? Out of nowhere?

761
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,461
The writer wants to use
the turtle's hard shell

762
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,671
as a metaphor

763
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,675
for the hard walls of workplace politics
that Joon-seok is up against.

764
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,553
He gets healed
while looking after the turtle

765
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,347
and you commune with her.

766
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,015
Commune with her?

767
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,726
So I commune with Elizabeth--
I commune with a turtle?

768
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,604
We don't have much time,
so let's go shoot.

769
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,028
Eliza-- A turtle--

770
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,116
Song Joon-seok has enemies all around.

771
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,202
On his way home he sees Elizabeth,

772
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,037
who is trapped in a tank

773
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,082
and he starts wailing
without realizing it.

774
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,750
You get it, right?

775
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,505
Yes. I'll give it a go.

776
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,757
Okay. We'll start shooting right away.

777
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,968
Ready, everyone!

778
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,100
Okay... Action!

779
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,622
Cut! What are you doing, Joon-ki?

780
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,666
You need to shed tears.

781
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,626
Well... It's...

782
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:07,214
It's hard to get in character
while looking at a turtle.

783
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,051
Then what can we do?
This is a very important scene.

784
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,096
Gaze into Elizabeth's eyes

785
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,806
and commune with her.

786
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,562
The turtle's eyes are too tiny...

787
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,649
Still, just try to uh...
Look at them, okay?

788
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,860
-Let's go again.
-Yes, sir.

789
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,987
Okay... Action!

790
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,458
Cut! Again!

791
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,003
Cut.

792
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,548
Cut! Darn it.

793
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,176
Commune!

794
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,637
Yes, sir! Commune!

795
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,432
Cut! Cut.

796
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,725
Cut!

797
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,353
-Joon-ki, what's wrong with you today?
-Sorry, sir.

798
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,492
Is Shin Hyun-joon really going to be
in your movie as an Arab person?

799
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,410
I want to kiss her.

800
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,246
I want to kiss her!

801
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,830
I want to kiss her.

802
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,333
Dong-goo.

803
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,127
Can you not hear me, Dong-goo?

804
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,754
Sorry?

805
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,715
No, I can hear you fine.

806
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,635
That's right, Yoon-ah.

807
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,888
Actually there's something
I need to talk to you about.

808
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,598
Really? What is it?

809
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:44,061
Well... it's an important matter,
so I can't say it here.

810
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,940
Why don't we talk over there?

811
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,817
Okay.

812
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,485
Let's go.

813
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,863
What is it you want to say?

814
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,702
Well... the thing is,
it's been tough lately

815
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,746
working on the movie and not having guests
at the guesthouse.

816
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,457
So I need something

817
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,459
that will energize me.

818
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,671
I see.

819
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,257
Cheer up, Dong-goo.

820
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,844
Well...

821
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,180
Simply hearing words to cheer me up

822
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,890
won't really energize me.

823
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,977
Really? Then what do you need?

824
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,733
-Can you uh ki... me?
-Pardon?

825
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,486
-I'm asking if you can ki... me.
-Excuse me?

826
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,322
Can you kiss me?

827
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,490
Sorry? Kiss you?

828
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,910
So all this was about kissing?

829
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,079
No...

830
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,457
It's not because I want to kiss you,

831
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,336
but I need to be energized. Really.

832
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,177
Fine.

833
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,221
Really?

834
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,641
Yes.

835
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,207
Oh my God!

836
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,627
What's wrong?

837
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,713
Sorry... It's just...

838
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,882
I'm really ticklish.

839
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,260
You're sensitive in your neck area.

840
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,679
Let's try this again.

841
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,987
You're ticklish there, too?

842
00:44:59,071 --> 00:44:59,905
Okay.

843
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,490
Again.

844
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,000
That really tickles!

845
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,545
What am I going to do! That tickles!

846
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,804
Ah-young won't take my calls
or check my messages anymore.

847
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,721
What do I do?

848
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,391
Just give up already.

849
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,726
No! I won't give up.

850
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,520
It's fate. I know it.

851
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,149
What sort of fate changes all the time?
Goodness.

852
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,236
Ah-young...

853
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,737
I'm home.

854
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,118
You really came early.
Shall we go to the movies, then?

855
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,079
I got dolled up for our date.
What do you think?

856
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,792
Bacca, I'm sorry,

857
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,296
but I don't think I can go
to the movies today.

858
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,048
What? Why can't you go?

859
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,469
Well...

860
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,932
So

861
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,019
you need to commune with this turtle?

862
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,437
Yeah.

863
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,690
How are you supposed to do that?

864
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,609
I don't know.

865
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,736
Anyway, the director said

866
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,779
to eat and sleep with her.

867
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,781
And to stay with her 24/7.

868
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,866
What?

869
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:30,037
Seo-jin, let's go watch a movie
next time, okay?

870
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,372
It's always next time with you.

871
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,790
This is too much.

872
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,667
I'm sorry.

873
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,378
But we'll definitely go tomorrow, okay?

874
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,755
I'll treat you to something delicious.

875
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,841
Let's go to that restaurant
you mentioned before.

876
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,218
Promise?

877
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,303
You have to keep your promise tomorrow.

878
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,388
I will.

879
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:53,477
How the hell am I supposed to
commune with her?

880
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,194
Elizabeth.

881
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,071
Can you look at me, please?

882
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,865
Let's open our hearts and try to connect.

883
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,285
Will you keep being this way?

884
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,956
Elizabeth... Where are you from?

885
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,208
Do you have any friends?
Brothers or sisters?

886
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,710
What is your life's motto? Favorite book?

887
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,714
Damn it, there's no way you'd understand.

888
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,091
What do you expect, Joon-ki?

889
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,343
This is killing me.

890
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:29,846
Hey.

891
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,600
Why the long face?

892
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,893
It's nothing.

893
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,645
What's with the turtle?

894
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,230
This? It's...

895
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,190
Never mind.

896
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,110
That's right. Joon-ki.

897
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,196
I have something to ask you.

898
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,241
The protagonist of the movie
I'm working on has a girlfriend.

899
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:54,454
-And?
-And he needs to kiss his girlfriend,

900
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,207
but she's extremely ticklish.

901
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,084
It's just not possible to kiss her.

902
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,837
-So?
-How can I get the protagonist

903
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,297
to kiss his girlfriend?

904
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,048
So you're saying

905
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,843
that you're unable to kiss Yoon-ah
because she's ticklish?

906
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,011
No, no.

907
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,304
She won't even let me touch her--

908
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,471
No!

909
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,724
In the movie, silly!

910
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,934
Don't try to fool me.

911
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,812
Joon-ki, what should I do?

912
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:19,813
Do you have any ideas?

913
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,107
That's easy.

914
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,150
If she's ticklish,

915
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,277
don't use your hands.

916
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,280
Kiss her without using my hands? How?

917
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,907
With your hands behind your back.

918
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,326
Hands behind my back?

919
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,087
That's a weird position, though.

920
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,172
You think?

921
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,050
Then you can hold her hair.
Hair isn't ticklish.

922
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,801
Hold her hair?

923
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,345
That's even worse.

924
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,972
It's not romantic at all.

925
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,308
-You can still kiss her, though.
-Forget it!

926
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,225
I'd rather not do it!

927
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,478
It's not like I've lost my mind over
kissing her!

928
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,021
Goodness, man.

929
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,732
How's this? Not ticklish, right?

930
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,734
So you're suggesting

931
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,819
that we kiss like this?

932
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,154
We have no choice.

933
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,281
You're too ticklish.

934
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,033
And like I told you earlier,

935
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,702
it's not because I want to kiss.

936
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,870
I just need to be energized.

937
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,956
Goodness. Okay, okay.

938
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,266
What's wrong? I didn't touch you.

939
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,268
It's just--

940
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,563
the breath from your nose is tickling me.

941
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,065
Even my breath is ticklish?

942
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,442
Aren't you being too sensitive?

943
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,363
Sorry. I tried to hold it in,

944
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,823
but it was too ticklish.

945
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,409
Fine. Then I'll hold my breath.

946
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,160
Again.

947
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,799
I can't!

948
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,592
Oh my goodness, that really tickles.

949
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,594
Sorry, Dong-goo.

950
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,013
But that really tickles.

951
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,860
Elizabeth, is it tasty?

952
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:35,115
Answer me if it is.

953
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,659
Seriously?

954
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,662
I played with you, bathed you,
napped with you and fed you!

955
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,914
Isn't it time you started listening to me?

956
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:43,999
-Joon-ki.
-Yeah?

957
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,125
Enough.

958
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,835
You look like a crazy person.

959
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,628
-What?
-You know he's crazy.

960
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,088
Let him be.

961
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,340
You punks.

962
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,342
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

963
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,511
Do you know what scene I have
to shoot with her today?

964
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,804
What is it?

965
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,891
You know Days of Being Wild, right?

966
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,643
There's a scene where Leslie Cheung
does the mambo.

967
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,605
I have to do that dance with her.
I have to look at her, too.

968
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,775
You have to do the mambo with a turtle,
while looking at her?

969
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,109
That's what I'm saying!

970
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,780
The writer gave it ten stars,
saying it's an important scene!

971
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,573
Tough life.

972
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,909
What a tumultuous life you lead.

973
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:21,995
-Hey Joon-ki.
-Yeah?

974
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:25,582
You didn't forget about our date, right?
You have to keep your promise today, okay?

975
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,042
Don't worry.

976
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,835
I even made a reservation for dinner.

977
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,253
Really?

978
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,964
I can't wait. It's been too long.

979
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,800
Goodness. Not at the table.

980
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,929
ARTS AND CULTURE

981
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,727
I have butterflies thinking
about this date.

982
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,981
Should I have worn something else?

983
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,655
Let's finish up and go.

984
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,199
Seo-jin.

985
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,409
Look through these files
and summarize them

986
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,744
by the end of the day.

987
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,996
Pardon? All of this?

988
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,164
That's right.

989
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,457
Why? You don't want to do it?

990
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,960
No, it's not that...

991
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,046
It's urgent, so do whatever it takes
to get it done today. Got it?

992
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,593
Damn it.

993
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,595
How will I get this done?

994
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,681
I'm supposed to go on that date
with Joon-ki.

995
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,224
This is crazy.

996
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,768
Damn it.

997
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,648
Damn it.

998
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,070
Did you work on your scene with Elizabeth?

999
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:37,988
Sorry?

1000
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,949
I tried my best.

1001
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,909
Good.

1002
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,954
This scene is about Song Joon-seok

1003
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,914
dealing with the agony
of losing his position as anchor

1004
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,417
as he dances the mambo with Elizabeth.

1005
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,711
-I see.
-What's important here

1006
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,462
isn't whether or not you're a good dancer.

1007
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:58,091
It's about how much connection
there is between the two of you.

1008
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,175
Understood?

1009
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,594
Understood.

1010
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,889
Elizabeth, let's do this!

1011
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,016
Okay. We'll start shooting right away.

1012
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,560
Get ready!

1013
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,902
Relax your face.

1014
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,116
Okay...

1015
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,659
Action!

1016
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,025
Cut!

1017
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,485
What are you doing?

1018
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,195
Elizabeth keeps going somewhere else.

1019
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,030
Sorry, sir.

1020
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,783
Commune with her.

1021
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,451
Sorry.

1022
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,744
I'll go again, sir.

1023
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,335
Elizabeth... What's wrong?

1024
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,963
Help me out, please?

1025
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,757
We'll start from where you face each other
and dance the mambo.

1026
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,467
Yes, sir.

1027
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,970
Please, Elizabeth.

1028
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,430
Okay... Action!

1029
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,186
Cut!

1030
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,563
Joon-ki, it looks like Elizabeth
is running away.

1031
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,024
-I'll try again, sir.
-Try to get through to her first.

1032
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,068
Okay.

1033
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,488
Okay... Action!

1034
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,617
Cut!

1035
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,202
Cut!

1036
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,745
Cut!

1037
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,539
Cut.

1038
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,041
Cut!

1039
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,673
Elizabeth...

1040
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,011
Joon-ki, is this all you want to do today?

1041
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,680
We've had more than 40 outtakes.
Do you know that?

1042
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,432
Sorry, Director.

1043
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,768
I gave you a whole day to work on it.
How can you not get it still?

1044
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,687
And this... Gosh.

1045
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:19,107
What are you going to do?
Elizabeth is hiding in her shell.

1046
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,900
-What are you going to do?
-Sorry?

1047
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,778
She chose to hide. How am I supposed to...

1048
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,322
You know her best.

1049
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,284
Talk her into doing this.

1050
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,410
Excuse me?

1051
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,662
How am I supposed to...

1052
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,456
I don't know!

1053
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,208
Then let's take a break
until she comes back out.

1054
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,837
Goodness. I can't believe this is what
I have to put up with.

1055
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,464
Sorry.

1056
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,426
This is killing me.

1057
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:53,141
Elizabeth... Come on out.

1058
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:56,728
I need to go on a date with Seo-jin today.

1059
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:01,357
Elizabeth... Hello?

1060
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,610
Why are you being like this?

1061
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,030
Come on out. Please?

1062
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,539
Okay, done.

1063
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,296
Here you go. I'm done.

1064
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,049
-You finished that huge pile?
-Yes.

1065
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,093
Are you sure you did it properly?

1066
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,678
Not at all.
I didn't eat or go to the toilet.

1067
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,639
I worked on it with all my might
and finished.

1068
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,436
-Well done. Go on now.
-Thanks.

1069
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,063
See you tomorrow.

1070
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,109
I'm so tired.

1071
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,863
She really has it out for me.
I wonder why.

1072
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,076
Still, I'm happy that I finally get to

1073
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,369
go on a date with Joon-ki.

1074
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,998
Why isn't he calling?

1075
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:07,340
Elizabeth... Come on.

1076
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,300
Come out already.

1077
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,512
Elizabeth!

1078
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,274
Hi, Seo-jin.

1079
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,693
Where are you? I'm here.

1080
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,112
Well...

1081
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,240
I'm still shooting.

1082
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,493
What? You're still there?

1083
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,121
I have just one scene left,

1084
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,790
but Elizabeth won't cooperate.

1085
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,418
Wait just a little longer, okay?

1086
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,086
I'll get there as soon as I can.

1087
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,172
Fine.

1088
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,258
-Hurry, okay?
-Okay.

1089
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,010
Sorry. Bye.

1090
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,390
Elizabeth. You heard that, right?

1091
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,643
Seo-jin's waiting for me.

1092
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,189
Please help me out.

1093
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,066
Elizabeth, please.

1094
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,445
You know I've got
some ideas of my own, too.

1095
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,326
Turtle, Turtle

1096
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,953
Show me your head

1097
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,915
If you do not

1098
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,876
I will cook you and eat you

1099
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,590
Shit, even this won't work.

1100
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,384
What am I supposed to do?

1101
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,770
Elizabeth, you finally came out.

1102
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,856
Did the song work?

1103
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,901
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Thanks for coming out!

1104
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,361
Oh my gosh.

1105
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,489
Don't tell me.

1106
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:58,243
You understood what I was saying?

1107
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,703
What the hell?

1108
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,873
Then did you and I succeed

1109
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,625
in communing?

1110
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,462
Elizabeth...

1111
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,759
So this actually works!

1112
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,470
Oh, Elizabeth!

1113
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,597
Thank you!

1114
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,727
Okay... Action!

1115
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,589
Cut! Okay! That was great!

1116
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:56,342
I could really feel
that you were connected!

1117
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,512
Great job, Joon-ki. You're awesome!

1118
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,639
Thank you!

1119
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,727
Elizabeth, I won't ever forget this.

1120
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,395
Thank you!

1121
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,569
Oh, right. Director, please excuse me.
I have to go.

1122
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,862
Sure.

1123
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:19,324
Thank you!

1124
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,419
What are you so happy about?

1125
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,881
I'm coming back from seeing Ah-young.

1126
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,175
She's not mad anymore.

1127
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,093
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1128
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,721
So I'm calling to ask her out
on a date tomorrow.

1129
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,101
But why isn't she answering?

1130
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,820
Why is her phone turned off?

1131
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,614
It was ringing just now.

1132
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,285
Can't you see? She's avoiding your calls.

1133
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,955
-Why would she do that?
-Do you have to ask?

1134
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,375
She must still be mad.

1135
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,626
That can't be.

1136
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,087
Earlier I asked,
"You're not mad, are you?"

1137
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,089
And she answered, "No, I'm not."

1138
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:19,217
Then I asked, "Are you really okay?"

1139
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,720
and she went, "Yeah, I'm really okay now."

1140
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,305
You fool.

1141
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,933
-That doesn't mean she's really okay.
-What do you mean?

1142
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,727
If she answered, "No, I'm not"
in that situation,

1143
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,938
it means she's really pissed.

1144
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,232
"Yeah, I'm really okay now" means

1145
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:37,151
that she's really not okay
and that she's hurt.

1146
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,112
-That's what she was saying.
-What?

1147
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,740
So you're telling me that not being mad
means she is mad

1148
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,618
and okay means she's not okay?

1149
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,954
-Exactly.
-Why talk like that?

1150
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,667
You really don't know women, do you?

1151
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,293
-Is it sarcasm?
-Yoon-ah!

1152
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,962
Hey! Where's Yoon-ah?

1153
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,172
-I think she's on the third floor.
-Really?

1154
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,050
What's up with him?

1155
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,512
Yoon-ah!

1156
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,807
I found it. I finally found it.

1157
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,142
Found what?

1158
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,643
A way for us to kiss.

1159
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,187
You're talking about that again?

1160
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,607
I told you already.

1161
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,569
It's not because I want to kiss you,

1162
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,613
but I need to be energized.

1163
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:27,285
Okay, fine. So what's your solution?

1164
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,046
What do you think?

1165
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,341
You won't feel ticklish
because of my breath now, right?

1166
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,346
Must you go this far?

1167
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,975
Well... as I told you,

1168
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,020
it's not because I want to kiss you.

1169
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,607
I'm feeling out of sorts, so--

1170
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,066
Never mind.

1171
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,987
But it's our first kiss
and you're so task-oriented.

1172
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,489
You're unbelievable.

1173
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,163
I'm sorry.

1174
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,333
It seemed like there was no other way.

1175
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,127
I was childish, wasn't I?

1176
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,129
I'm sorry.

1177
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,091
Why are you so foolish, Dong-goo?

1178
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,177
Sorry? Foolish?

1179
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:29,388
You're not ticklish, right?

1180
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,767
-No, I'm not.
-There you go then.

1181
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,090
See? Simple.

1182
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,971
From now on,
just tell me if you want to kiss.

1183
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,347
I'll kiss you.

1184
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:12,974
Pardon?

1185
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,476
Okay.

1186
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,437
Then I'll see you downstairs.

1187
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,523
Okay.

1188
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,286
One more time. One more time!

1189
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,788
Seriously, that Elizabeth.

1190
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,416
Seo-jin must be fuming.
I have to take a cab.

1191
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,918
Joon-ki, are you done shooting?

1192
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,253
Yeah, just now.

1193
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:43,337
Can I help you?

1194
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,214
I told you I'd set up

1195
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,549
a meeting with my CEO.

1196
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,843
He's around here for a meeting

1197
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:49,760
and wants to see you.

1198
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,430
Right now?

1199
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,181
I talked you up plenty,

1200
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,602
so if the meeting goes well,
you might be able to sign today.

1201
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,896
Really?

1202
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:02,982
Why? Is something wrong?

1203
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:08,279
The thing is, I have plans
with my girlfriend right now.

1204
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,363
What?

1205
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,117
Are you out of your mind?

1206
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,952
Opportunities like this
are hard to come by.

1207
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,038
I know. I know that,

1208
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:20,708
but my girlfriend
has been waiting for hours.

1209
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,835
I'm really sorry,

1210
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,421
but could I take a raincheck?

1211
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,673
Is a date a bigger priority
than your acting career?

1212
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,258
You think you'll be able to sign

1213
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,011
with a management company like ours
if you miss this chance?

1214
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,265
You must not be serious about acting.

1215
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,101
Fine, do whatever the hell you want.

1216
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,873
JOON-KI

1217
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,712
Hi Joon-ki. Are you done?

1218
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,756
Yeah, we just wrapped up.

1219
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,926
Seo-jin. I'm really sorry,

1220
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,345
but I don't think I'll make it today.

1221
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,639
What? Why?

1222
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:20,601
See, there's this management company
I really want to sign with,

1223
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,813
and the CEO wants to meet with me
right away.

1224
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,314
What?

1225
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:27,900
So?

1226
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,778
I'm really sorry Seo-jin.

1227
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,948
Can we have dinner next time?

1228
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,746
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

1229
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,790
This is a huge opportunity for me.

1230
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:47,003
So can you please understand?

1231
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,797
Fine.

1232
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,091
Really?

1233
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,926
You're not mad, are you?

1234
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,178
No, I'm not.

1235
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,639
Are you sure? You're really okay?

1236
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,766
Yes, I'm really okay.

1237
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,310
Thank you, Seo-jin! Thanks so much!

1238
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,730
I'll see you at home, okay?

1239
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,657
I'm okay.

1240
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,077
Really...

1241
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,372
I am.
