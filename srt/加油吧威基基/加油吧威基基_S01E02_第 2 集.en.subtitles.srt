1
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,647
Ouch, my butt.

2
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,817
You're in a good mood!

3
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,611
Sol, did you sleep well?

4
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,280
-Did you sleep well, too?
-Yes.

5
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,407
-You're up early today.
-Yoon-ah, good morning.

6
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,159
Yes, did you sleep--

7
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,204
Don't be surprised.
He does that every day.

8
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,955
What was that called?

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,209
-Gr-gr--
-Grooming! Grooming, you idiot.

10
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,669
These days, men have to look pretty, too.

11
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,507
Ah, Yoon-ah...
you see, I'm actually an actor.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,883
Actor.

13
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,385
Wow, an actor? That's so awesome.

14
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,221
An actor, my ass.

15
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,224
You never even speak.
You just stand in the back like scenery.

16
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,770
Oh, Writer Bong,
you're always so kind with your words.

17
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,898
Doo-sik, you're a writer?
Wow, what kind of things do you write?

18
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,109
Well, I've written some classic novels

19
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,027
and also write a web-based novel,

20
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,404
but my ultimate dream is to write scripts.

21
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,572
You're living that script

22
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,367
writing about the imaginary life
of a fictitious student.

23
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,703
He once wrote a whole speech

24
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,666
for an elementary school class president
for a mere bag of chips.

25
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,918
He's not a writer but a joke!

26
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,878
-A total joke!
-How dare you... Are you done?

27
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,047
-You're a joke!
-Just stop already.

28
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,384
Neither of you are that great.
You're both just full of hot air.

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,094
Hey, at least we're better than you.

30
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,012
What kind of director gets fired

31
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,015
because he burned down the movie set
while grilling a sweet potato?

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,228
Why talk about that right now?
And it was just a regular potato.

33
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,772
Hey, sweet potato or regular potato,
it burned all the same!

34
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,232
How are they the same?

35
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,068
Potato is one word, sweet potato is two.
How are they the same?

36
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,404
What's with the word count?
This is about setting a fire!

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,697
They're different!

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,199
Are you talking back to me, too,
this early in the morning?

39
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,035
Why are you being like this?
Please calm down!

40
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,329
Why open your big mouth?

41
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,623
But I'm taking your side right now!

42
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,541
Be quiet!

43
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,043
Seriously, guys are so childish.

44
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,336
Yoon-ah, forgive them.

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,630
The guys in this house... are all weird.

46
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,383
What? Weird?

47
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,636
If we're talking about weird,
you take the prize, Chewbacca.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,847
Chewbacca? What's the meaning of...?

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,849
You know,
that furry creature in Star Wars.

50
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,019
Hold on a second. Here it is.

51
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,479
-Chewbacca.
-Oh!

52
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,815
But what's that have to do with Seo-jin?

53
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,567
See, this Chewbacca and Seo-jin have--

54
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,820
Don't you dare say anything!

55
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,697
Fine, I won't! I won't!

56
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,366
Ah-choo-bacca!

57
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,701
Ah-choo-bacca!

58
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,703
You're dead! You're so dead!

59
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,206
Hey, hey, he's your elder.
You shouldn't...

60
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,208
Look at this little punk!

61
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,127
Aren't we a fine picture of siblings...

62
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,463
They're really strange people.

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,926
Is it really okay... to be living here?

64
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,136
Oh!

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,263
My little Sol, are you hungry?

66
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,140
Let's eat!

67
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,100
Sol, let's eat some food.

68
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,727
Oh, yes, you were hungry, weren't you?

69
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,479
Yummy milk, yummy milk.

70
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,190
Oh, my goodness!

71
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,108
-That girl's the weirdest of all.
-No doubt.

72
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,610
What the heck?

73
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,696
ANYONE CAN BECOME WOLVERINE

74
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,620
So... should we start cleaning now?

75
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,290
Yeah. Seo-jin said
she was going to inspect.

76
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,793
Let's do it before we get yelled at again.

77
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:16,089
But... is it really necessary
for all three of us to clean?

78
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,549
What I'm saying is...

79
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,677
wanna make a bet?

80
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,262
What kind of bet?

81
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,561
You're saying you can put on pants
without using your hands?

82
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,522
That's absurd.

83
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,233
-How is that even possible?
-Exactly.

84
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,904
Okay... so if I lose,
I'll also do all your chores by myself.

85
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,283
However, if I win,
I'm exempt from my chores.

86
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,784
All right? Deal?

87
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,202
-Deal.
-Deal.

88
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,463
Let's do this!

89
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,423
You have 30 seconds.

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,388
He doesn't stand a chance.

91
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,684
What's this?

92
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,477
What's happening?

93
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,771
What the...

94
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,398
-What is this?
-Is this possible?

95
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,485
Wait, what?

96
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,863
What just happened?

97
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,239
What are you doing?

98
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,118
I told you to clean up,
not fool around like idiots!

99
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,745
-I was just about to clean.
-Me, too.

100
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,706
Wait, where you going? Hey! Hey!

101
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,542
Hey! I won, okay?
I won, so I'm exempt from cleaning!

102
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,294
Exempt, my ass.

103
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,212
-Follow me.
-No, I'm exempt!

104
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,132
I'm telling you I won! I'm exempt!

105
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,430
This is killing me.

106
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,932
With all these guests suddenly,
there's so much more to do.

107
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,852
Jeez, you haven't even done much.

108
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,022
Hurry up and get a move on!
It's almost time for check-in.

109
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,190
All right.

110
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,067
Aren't you going to the library today?

111
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,152
-Why, so you can slack off?
-No, not that.

112
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,697
But you're graduating soon.
How's the job hunt going?

113
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,658
Well, of course I want to find employment.

114
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,203
I really want to, but it's not that easy.

115
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,205
Finding a job is no joke these days.

116
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:13,915
But don't give up.

117
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,958
You know, you've been a great help.

118
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,044
Oh, whatever.

119
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,630
To think I could end up
just like you if I slack off

120
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,256
motivates me to keep going.

121
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,341
Thanks, Doo-sik!

122
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,970
That little...

123
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,558
What are you doing?

124
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,018
You're just vacuuming all day?

125
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,313
Get the bedsheets and wash them,
and clean the rooftop, too.

126
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,649
And clean up the tree in the living room.

127
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,693
-Christmas was how long ago, but--
-Fine, I got it, so stop nagging me.

128
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,946
I'm already depressed as it is.

129
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,988
What's so depressing?

130
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,491
-I broke up with Soo-ah.
-I know.

131
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,245
In addition to getting dumped,
you got caught pawning your couple ring.

132
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,914
But you're still hung up on her
and just follow her around.

133
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,415
-Who said that?
-Joon-ki.

134
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,126
He's got such a big mouth.

135
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,045
Once a girl turns her back, it's over.
Just let her go.

136
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,340
Soo-ah and I were together for four years.
How can it be over so quick?

137
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,675
I can't accept that, no way.

138
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,094
-So just meet up and tell her.
-She won't even meet me!

139
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,720
She avoids my calls, texts.

140
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,013
She refuses to even see me.

141
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,266
Soo-ah must be really determined.

142
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,684
Isn't she being too extreme?

143
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,271
Hey, in your eyes... am I also a loser?
A failure as a man?

144
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,647
No hope for a good future?

145
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,775
Oh... I can't believe it's already time.

146
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,236
-Time for what?
-Time for me to go to the library. Bye.

147
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,656
Sheesh.

148
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,326
Even my only little sister
looks down on me.

149
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,913
Man, I'm so exhausted.

150
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,583
I may die from cleaning so hard.

151
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,294
You've all worked hard.
Would you like a drink?

152
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,670
-Yes.
-No, I'm okay.

153
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,840
-Stop putting on makeup already.
-Hey, punk.

154
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,844
This T-zone becomes oily quickly,
so I have to touch it up.

155
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,680
Also, I'm filming today,
so I'm paying extra attention.

156
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,806
What's the movie?

157
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,057
You guys know X-Men?

158
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,852
This is a Korean version of X-Men

159
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,104
about a fight between humans and mutants.

160
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,189
Who's playing the lead?

161
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,316
In-sung Cho.

162
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,403
This is going to be a hit, without fail.

163
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,946
Then what happens?

164
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm going to be a star.

165
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,492
Once I'm a star, what happens?

166
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,120
It's just a matter of time
until I don't have to see your dull faces.

167
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,207
Well, this star better get going now.

168
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,124
Bye, have fun.

169
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,085
See you later!

170
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,880
Oh, no! What do I do?

171
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,049
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

172
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,884
Yes, I'm okay.

173
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,261
Jeez, you should've been more careful.

174
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,055
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,853
Hey... I haven't yet given my permission
for you to stay here.

176
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,149
Remember, if your work is unsatisfactory,
I'll send you away.

177
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,694
Yes. Don't worry, I'll do well.

178
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,085
Just go. I'll clean up here.

179
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,753
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,755
You have to give me the gloves
before you go.

181
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,798
Oh, right.

182
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,599
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my!

183
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,269
-I'm sorry!
-The soap, the soap!

184
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,107
Seriously? From the start of the day!

185
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,027
-I'm sorry.
-Stop saying sorry and just leave already.

186
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm so-- I mean...

187
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,532
Please forgive me.

188
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,743
Seriously. What the...?

189
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,581
I don't like her. I really don't like her.

190
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,000
You can't blame her.
She's distracted by her baby.

191
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,837
But you're really irritable lately.
Is it because of Soo-ah?

192
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,133
-It's not like that.
-Don't lie to me.

193
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,385
-It's written all over your face--
-I said it's not!

194
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,012
I said it's not!

195
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,057
I said it's not, so why do you keep
saying it is? So annoying!

196
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,100
You clean this up!

197
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,228
Ugh... put me in a bad mood.

198
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,814
Why does he always take it out on me?

199
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,149
I can hear you!

200
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,695
Director.

201
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,032
-Is everything ready to shoot?
-Yes, we're nearly done.

202
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,701
Radioactive mutant!

203
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,880
Where are you?

204
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,385
-Hello, Director.
-Yes, hi.

205
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,639
Your makeup is good. Good job.

206
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,433
We'll begin as soon as In-sung arrives,
so be on standby.

207
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,726
Yes, sir!

208
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,561
Next, where's the genetic mutant?

209
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,605
Genetic mutant!

210
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,231
Hello?

211
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,525
What? What did you say?

212
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,527
This is terrible.

213
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,446
Fine, got it.

214
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,823
-I'm going to go crazy.
-What's wrong?

215
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,659
In-sung got into a car accident.

216
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,661
He's in the hospital right now.

217
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,913
Then what about the shoot?

218
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,955
What about it?

219
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,999
We can't film without the lead actor.

220
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,795
Excuse me, Assistant Director,
what should I do?

221
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,339
For now, remove the makeup, and tomorrow--

222
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,508
What are you talking about? Remove it?

223
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,467
The makeup costs a lot!

224
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,138
You, go home just like this
and come exactly like this tomorrow.

225
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,557
Wait, you mean... just like this?

226
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,979
If your makeup gets damaged,
I'll get rid of your role, got it?

227
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,649
-But...
-Dang it.

228
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,317
Get rid of my role?

229
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,361
We'll end the shoot for today!

230
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,696
But... where is everyone...?

231
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,075
How am I supposed to...?

232
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,493
Wait...

233
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,834
Hello. How--

234
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,385
What is that?

235
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,719
Who is he?

236
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,805
Huh...

237
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,104
This is so embarrassing.

238
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,356
Why are there so many people?

239
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,449
I can't mess up any of this makeup.

240
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,242
Hey!

241
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,726
Pardon me.

242
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,187
You should be more careful.

243
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,944
Hello. Hi.

244
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,656
What is this?

245
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,242
I asked her to clean the towels,
but they're still here.

246
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,745
That girl can't do anything right.

247
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,121
Sheesh, so annoying.

248
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,665
-Dong-gu.
-What?

249
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,876
Oh, crap, what the heck? What are you?

250
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,753
It's me, you punk.

251
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,506
Joon-ki? But what's with your face?

252
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,884
The lead actor had an accident,
so the shoot was postponed.

253
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,761
But since the makeup is expensive,

254
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,388
the director said keep it on
and go like this tomorrow.

255
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,683
You sure have a difficult life, seriously.

256
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,477
That's enough.

257
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,229
I'm already so embarrassed, I could die.

258
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,406
Hey Doo-sik, hold the phone up to my ear.

259
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,787
Hello? Yes, this is Joon-ki Lee.

260
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,373
What? The police?

261
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,960
We caught a pickpocket,
and he had your wallet.

262
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,962
My wallet? One minute, please.

263
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,674
What the-- Why that little-- My wallet!

264
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,470
Yes, yes. Yes, I'll go right now.

265
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,180
-Hang up the phone.
-Wait a minute.

266
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,265
Looking like that?

267
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,600
I have to. My wallet has my ID,
credit cards, money--

268
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,310
Ah, wait, I have no money.

269
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,689
That jerk, he's going to get it.

270
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,734
Goodness. Nothing's normal around here.

271
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,779
What is all this?

272
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,323
And who left the refrigerator open?

273
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,871
All this food is going to spoil.

274
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,375
This is all her doing again, isn't it?

275
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,127
Hey, Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah!

276
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,423
Yes, did you call me?

277
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,716
All this...

278
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,342
Did you do all this?

279
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,553
I was cleaning the fridge
when the baby started crying...

280
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,639
-I'll clean it up right away.
-Forget it.

281
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,682
Take care of Sol first.

282
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,812
What is this?
The mushrooms are growing mushrooms?

283
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,732
-Throw this away later, okay?
-Yes, okay.

284
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,067
Sol, you ate well, right? Let's sleep.

285
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,236
Hey, let's do a better job here.

286
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,572
-I'm sorry.
-And if you're really sorry,

287
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,575
stop doing things to be sorry for, okay?

288
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,743
Again? What happened?

289
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,912
It's all because of you, you jerk!

290
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,081
You and Joon-ki.
What kind of place is this?

291
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,208
I'm always the bad guy.

292
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,921
-Why's he getting mad at me?
-I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

293
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,130
No.

294
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,758
Yoon-ah, give me Sol.

295
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,135
I'll take care of her
so you can clean this up first.

296
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,262
But still, I feel so bad.

297
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,722
It's okay.

298
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,182
I don't have much to do before work.

299
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,895
Plus, Sol likes me very much.

300
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,605
Isn't that right, Sol?

301
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,406
You like me so much, you threw up on me?

302
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,878
So how about showing me some leniency
and be nice just this once, eh?

303
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,715
What? Want to get hit, you punk?

304
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,133
Excuse me?

305
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,260
Yes, how can I help-- whoa!

306
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,388
You...

307
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,014
Wh-who are you?

308
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,100
I received a call to come down.

309
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,519
I'm Joon-ki Lee.
They said my wallet is here.

310
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,312
Please, the gun...

311
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,816
Oh! You're the victim I talked to earlier?

312
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,026
-Yes, yes.
-You scared me.

313
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,528
But what's with your face?

314
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,992
I'm an actor, but the shoot got postponed.

315
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,411
But I heard my wallet is here?

316
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,037
-There it is!
-Wait a minute!

317
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,998
I have to check your ID first.

318
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,541
Let's see.

319
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,501
Joon-ki Lee.

320
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,463
Are you really Joon-ki Lee?

321
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,382
Yes, that's correct. I'm Joon-ki Lee.

322
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,511
It looks like you,
but doesn't look like you...

323
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,097
Look closely. I'm Joon-ki Lee.
We're the same.

324
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,142
I can't verify your identity
because of the makeup. Can you remove it?

325
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,519
No, I can't. I'll get fired.

326
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,939
Let's check your fingerprint, then.

327
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,399
Let's see.

328
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,112
Can I pull out this hair?

329
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,781
No way! I told you I'd get fired
if it gets damaged.

330
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,366
Then what do you expect me to do?

331
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,369
You can do a DNA test.
You can draw some blood.

332
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,747
You want a DNA test
just to verify your identity?

333
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,583
Send your blood and hair
to National Forensics?

334
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,834
Is that a bit much?

335
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,463
But this is really my wallet.
Please, just give it to me.

336
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,882
I have to confirm your identity first!

337
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,968
Aren't you a detective?
Can't you tell I'm him?

338
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,638
So, you're saying
you couldn't get your wallet?

339
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,099
He said I can't
until he confirms my identity.

340
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,351
How can he be a detective
with his lack of insight?

341
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,188
How can this makeup

342
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,482
possibly hide my handsome face?

343
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,649
I'm home.

344
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,735
Hey, Chewbacca,
you're back from the library?

345
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,278
I told you not to call me--

346
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,613
Oh, my goodness!

347
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,324
-What is this?
-Who else would do something like this?

348
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,786
-Joon-ki? What's with your face, though?
-I don't know, crazy girl!

349
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,621
What kind of girl reacts by hitting?

350
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,581
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you.

351
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,001
Well, if you had known,
you would've gone all out hitting me.

352
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,213
Thanks for hitting me with such restraint.

353
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,215
Let's eat.

354
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,591
Enjoy your meal.

355
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,761
It's mushroom stew. It looks delicious.

356
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,057
Doo-sik, give me Sol and go eat.

357
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,225
You're not eating?

358
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,644
I ate some bread, so I'm not hungry.

359
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,395
Go to your mom, Sol.

360
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,689
There you go, Sol.

361
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,529
Damn it.

362
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,574
Wow, this tastes pretty good.

363
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,576
Right, Dong-goo?

364
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,370
It's not bad.

365
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,746
Oh, what a relief.

366
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,957
I was worried you wouldn't like it.

367
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,461
-Joon-ki?
-Yes?

368
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,755
-Try some mushroom stew, too.
-Oh, yes.

369
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,179
-Hey, hey.
-What are you doing? Are you an animal?

370
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,518
Yoon-ah, I have a favor to ask.

371
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,061
What is it?

372
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,490
Must you eat like that?

373
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,785
I told you, if I mess up my makeup,
I'll get fired.

374
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,995
Have some broth, too.

375
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,959
Wow, that's refreshing.
It tastes good, Yoon-ah.

376
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,711
Enjoy!

377
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,847
Hello? Soo-ah? Can we meet just once?

378
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,932
Just give me one minute of your time.

379
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,394
I'll explain everything.
This can't be the end of us--

380
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,312
Hello?

381
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,148
She hung up on me again. I'll call again.

382
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,653
Goodness. My stomach.
Why's it like this all of a sudden?

383
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,203
Oh, what the heck?

384
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,038
-Why are you all here?
-Don't talk to us.

385
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,334
Chewbacca! Hurry up!

386
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,752
I'm dying, dying!

387
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,128
I'm also dying!

388
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,797
At least you can talk, but I-- oh, gosh!

389
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,095
What is this? Your stomach hurts, too?
Doo-sik, you, too?

390
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,890
My stomach started hurting after lunch.

391
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,184
I can't hold it in!

392
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,769
It hurts!

393
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,479
Hey! Hey!

394
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,022
What's going on?

395
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,150
What did we eat?
Wait, what was for lunch?

396
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,860
Mushroom stew, kimchi, and--

397
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,154
Mushroom stew?

398
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,740
No way.

399
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,080
What's wrong?

400
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,876
By any chance...

401
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,754
did you use these mushrooms in the stew?

402
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,007
-Yes. Why?
-What do you mean "why"?

403
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,178
I told you to throw these away earlier,
that they're rotten!

404
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,430
What? Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

405
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,557
I was distracted by Sol.
I must not have heard you.

406
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,393
Is "sorry" going to make things right?

407
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,353
Everyone is sick right now!

408
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,024
Oh, no! I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

409
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,526
Forget it.

410
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,656
This was the last straw.
So pack your bags and leave immediately.

411
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,911
Dong-goo!

412
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,556
Until the East Sea dries

413
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,017
And Mount Baekdu falls

414
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,229
The Almighty

415
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,568
Will help us

416
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,823
Aha!

417
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,995
OUT OF ORDER

418
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,213
What's your problem?

419
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,424
I'm sorry!

420
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,676
Soo-ah.

421
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,846
Wait a minute, just wait!

422
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,973
-Let's talk, please.
-I have nothing to say.

423
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,143
Wait, just wait. Just one minute.

424
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,730
Fine, one minute. What do you want to say?

425
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,398
So, what I'm saying is--

426
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,944
Soo-ah, I...

427
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,073
I'm so sorry,

428
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,284
-but can we talk in a bit?
-Forget it.

429
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,036
Okay, let's talk now!

430
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,456
-Why is it right now? This is crazy.
-What?

431
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,458
Oh, nothing. I'll speak.

432
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,671
Soo-ah, I really messed up.

433
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,924
-I'm really sorry.
-What are you sorry for?

434
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,927
-For everything.
-For everything, what?

435
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,928
Tell me specifically.

436
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,347
Specifically? Okay.

437
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,099
So...

438
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,690
Oh! Pawning our couple ring.

439
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,192
And what else?

440
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,443
Being irresponsible.

441
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,278
-What else?
-There's more?

442
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,448
Yes, of course.

443
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,699
What else is there...

444
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,417
Did you just... fart?

445
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,503
In this situation?

446
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,297
No, no! It was this sound.

447
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,550
You're joking around
even in this situation.

448
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,926
Forget it. I'm done.

449
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,345
No, Soo-ah, that's not it!

450
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,063
Aren't you going to stop me?

451
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,232
-I want to, but--
-Forget it.

452
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,609
This is really the end. The end, okay?

453
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,404
Wait a minute, Soo-ah!

454
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,328
Soo-ah, forgive me!

455
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,179
Bathroom!

456
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,889
A bathroom!

457
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,111
PUBLIC TOILETS FOR SALE

458
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,405
Look around first and then decide.

459
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:54,451
These kind of portable toilets
are quite popular these days.

460
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,744
-Would you like to see?
-Great.

461
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,705
Why is this locked?

462
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,499
-What's going on?
-It's occupied.

463
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,460
Excuse me, but who are you?

464
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,713
What kind of question is that?

465
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,759
-What are you doing in there?
-Be patient, I'm almost done.

466
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,219
Done? What do you mean?

467
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,678
This fellow is so annoying.

468
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,431
What do you think
I'm doing in a toilet, rolling gimbap?

469
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,557
Wait, what?

470
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,352
Hey, you! Come out right now!

471
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,480
-Come out right now!
-What's with this guy?

472
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,191
I'm almost done, I said!
Let's talk when I'm done!

473
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:31,029
What do you think you're doing
in someone else's business property?

474
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,155
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,242
I thought this was a public toilet,
and I was desperate.

476
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,954
However desperate you were,
this is an unsold, brand-new item!

477
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,081
How could you poop in there? Poop!

478
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,540
What am I to do now?

479
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,501
It's so disgusting!

480
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,253
Who's going to buy this now? Who?

481
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,214
I'm sorry. I'll take full responsibility.

482
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,590
Dong-goo?

483
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,470
Yoon-ah. How'd you find me here?

484
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,889
You got food poisoning because of me,
so I got some medicine.

485
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,394
But, Dong-goo,
did you really poop in there?

486
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,231
-Well, that is...
-Don't even talk about it.

487
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,399
He took a huge dump in there!

488
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,457
Hey, Dong-goo...
that's a bit much, isn't it?

489
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,297
Seriously, we have a perfectly working
bathroom. Why'd you buy this?

490
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,633
No. After what happened today,

491
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,677
I felt we didn't have enough bathrooms.

492
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,639
So we can just add more toilets.
Why did you have to buy that?

493
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,107
Oh, no!

494
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,989
I'm sorry.

495
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,575
Gosh, you should be more careful.

496
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,910
That's the only award
Dong-goo ever received.

497
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm sorry.

498
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,419
No, it's okay.
It's not like you did it on purpose.

499
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,130
A person is allowed mistakes, right?

500
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,632
-Don't worry about it.
-What's with you?

501
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,134
You kicked her out earlier today.

502
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,011
That was just a shock strategy.

503
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,888
You know, a way to encourage
better performance.

504
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,310
Yoon-ah, let's forget about everything
that's happened so far.

505
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,062
And let's get along.

506
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,064
-Yes?
-You understand?

507
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,608
Yes.

508
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,490
In exchange, you'll take today's events
with you to the grave.

509
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,785
Don't worry.

510
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,038
Thank you.

511
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,005
Welcome--

512
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,760
Hello.

513
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,887
Oh, goodness.

514
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,022
Forget it. I'll pick it up. Just get on.

515
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,566
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,447
I'm sorry, sorry.

517
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,743
What kind of life is this?

518
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,248
I better work hard and land a main role.

519
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,547
Genetic mutant?

520
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,085
Oh.

521
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,600
Seo-jin!

522
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,560
Yoon-ah...

523
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,819
YOU SEE, IT'S A SECRET

524
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,832
But how in the world?

525
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,960
I copied my brother and father
because shaving looked fun.

526
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,589
After that, it started growing thicker.

527
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,053
Well, big deal. So you just have
to shave once in a while.

528
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,805
It's not once in a while.

529
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,974
Now if I don't shave for half a day,

530
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,768
I look like a caveman.

531
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,646
How pathetic.

532
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,065
Why would you imitate shaving,
of all things?

533
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,484
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

534
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,152
Hence the nickname Chewbacca?

535
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,446
Not just Chewbacca.

536
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,116
There's Bayaba, Zhang Fei,
Im Guk Jeong, Jang Seung Up...

537
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,410
-everyone who is hairy--
-Enough already!

538
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,496
Hey, hey, it's okay.

539
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,623
Is it a sin to have facial hair?
Don't worry.

540
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,542
Thanks, Dong-sik.

541
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,088
Hello? Oh, hey, Yoo-jin. What's up?

542
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,257
What? Tae-hyun is coming?

543
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,343
Okay, great! I'll go now!

544
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,471
Tae-hyun? The guy you had a crush on
since freshman year in college?

545
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,057
-It's not like that.
-Whatever.

546
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,685
What a lucky girl you are
to have time to date.

547
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,146
I'll take care of my own life,
so you just mind your own, too, okay?

548
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,273
Okay.

549
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,774
I better get ready to go!

550
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,443
Look at you, so excited. Good for you.

551
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,321
What's the point? She can't even
confess her feelings to him.

552
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,700
If you think about it,
Seo-jin is a romance train wreck.

553
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,870
You're one to talk.
You've never had a girlfriend.

554
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,914
-Yoon-ah?
-Here he goes again.

555
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,959
We're out of bread and eggs.
What happened?

556
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,877
Oh, no!

557
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,920
It must've slipped my mind! I'm sorry.

558
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,505
How could you forget that?

559
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,134
Didn't I say to buy them in advance
for our guests' breakfast?

560
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,261
I'm sorry. I'll go buy them now.

561
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,178
Hurry!

562
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm telling you,
she can't do anything right. Sheesh.

563
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,559
Stop picking on her.

564
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,060
She's doing her best.

565
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,103
Her best?

566
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,648
That girl, any mistakes she makes
all turn into huge accidents.

567
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,775
She'll get better as time goes on.

568
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,777
Just have a little faith and wait.

569
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,238
Why did you come back?

570
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,033
Because I left the shopping cart.
I'll be back.

571
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,036
See, look at that.

572
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,412
Develop faith in that?

573
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,914
Forgetting is normal, okay?

574
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,335
-Back again?
-I left my wallet.

575
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,796
I'll be back.

576
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,340
Goodness.

577
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,262
What is it this time? What?

578
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,972
Where is the market?

579
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,116
How many times have we come here?
But you still can't find your own way.

580
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,451
I'm sorry.

581
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,995
Actually, I'm terrible with directions.

582
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,705
But I'll definitely remember now.

583
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,790
Right.

584
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,335
I'm more worried
that you feel so certain of yourself.

585
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,420
I'm getting tired of nagging you, too,

586
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,589
so just use common sense
and do well, okay?

587
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,716
I said okay?

588
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,597
What are you doing over there?

589
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,724
The toys are on sale right now.

590
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,394
Honestly, I've never bought Sol
a toy like this.

591
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,147
They're still so expensive, even on sale.

592
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,735
-Let's just go.
-Hey... just pick one.

593
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,195
Really?

594
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,947
Yeah, but just one.

595
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,325
Thank you! Thank you so much!

596
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,622
I don't know whether
she's brazen or just naive.

597
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,962
-Oh, pardon me.
-No, that's okay.

598
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,380
Soo-ah.

599
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,675
Who is he? Is he someone you know?

600
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,635
He's... a friend.

601
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,931
Friend? Min Soo-ah.

602
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,809
Who is this guy? What is he to you?

603
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,311
Hello.

604
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,523
I'm Soo-ah's partner, Yoon-seok Lee.

605
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,774
Partner?

606
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,821
I have a Thai restaurant in the area,

607
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,906
but stop by sometime and I will treat you.

608
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,991
Why would...

609
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,410
Dong-goo! I picked one.

610
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,870
Buy me this one, please.

611
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,288
Who's she?

612
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:01,956
Huh?

613
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,378
She's my girlfriend. Why?

614
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,963
Girlfriend?

615
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,465
You're already seeing someone?

616
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,966
You are. Why can't I?

617
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,802
I didn't say that...

618
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,847
but what does she do?

619
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,931
Huh?

620
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,434
SHE'S A DOCTOR

621
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,145
A neurosurgeon.

622
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,940
That's why she always picks out
these kind of toys.

623
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,486
-What's going--
-Oh, you...

624
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,072
My little dummy who only cares about work.

625
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,115
-Oh, so cute.
-What are you doing?

626
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,658
Ooh!

627
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,286
Soo-ah, meeting like this
seems like fate.

628
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,705
Should we all grab a cup of tea together?

629
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,041
No, it's okay. We're not even that close.

630
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,168
What's there to be awkward about?

631
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,713
How about we finish shopping
and have dinner together at my restaurant?

632
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,884
Well, Dr. Han is quite busy,
so I'm not sure we'll have time.

633
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,011
But we'll see. If possible, we'll go.

634
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,012
Let's go, Yoon-ah.

635
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,807
-Excuse us.
-Oh, yes.

636
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,266
Beep, beep!

637
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,771
Dong-goo, what's going on?

638
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,981
-Be quiet, please. Don't say a word.
-Okay.

639
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,150
Was that Soo-ah? She's so beauti--

640
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,570
-Please be quiet, I beg of you!
-Yes.

641
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,241
-You're still buying this for me?
-Yes, I'll buy anything you want.

642
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,910
Anything you want, so please be quiet.

643
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,417
What? Soo-ah already has another man?

644
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:30,920
What does he do?

645
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,506
I don't know.
Runs a Thai restaurant or something.

646
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,010
That jerk said to come by his place.
So arrogant.

647
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,681
But why lie and say
Yoon-ah is your girlfriend?

648
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,474
To make it worse, a doctor?

649
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,852
I just got so angry
seeing Soo-ah with another guy.

650
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,145
I wasn't thinking.

651
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,524
How sad. I guess it's really over now.

652
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,067
No, it's not.

653
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,320
You never know.
This could be your last opportunity.

654
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,030
What opportunity?

655
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,532
I promise you.

656
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,993
You're going to hear from Soo-ah soon.

657
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,245
No way!

658
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,082
What's this? For real?

659
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,960
See, what did I tell you?

660
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,753
What's the text say?

661
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,549
"Great seeing you.
Your girlfriend is pretty."

662
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,968
No, no, that's not it.

663
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,554
"Great seeing you.
Your girlfriend is pretty."

664
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,514
That's the message.

665
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
Do, re, mi, fa, sol-- sol tone.

666
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,602
That totally bugged-out tone, you know?

667
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,562
What? No way.

668
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,064
Gosh, you amateurs.

669
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,691
-Hey, Dong-goo Kang.
-Me?

670
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,026
Yes, you.

671
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,237
You powerless, immature man without
a future, not worth his weight in gold,

672
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,363
who got dumped.

673
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,866
But she finds out you're now dating

674
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,744
this feminine and well-respected doctor.

675
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,078
How would Soo-ah feel?

676
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,165
-"That poor girl got herself into a mess."
-No, that's wrong!

677
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,958
Soo-ah is so confused right now.

678
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,169
Her thoughts are a big jumble.

679
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,422
"How the heck? Why?
Why is that girl with Dong-goo?

680
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,966
Maybe Dong-goo wasn't so bad.

681
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,886
Was there something special
about Dong-goo I didn't see?

682
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,514
I'm going crazy, completely crazy!"

683
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,267
Oh, yeah, makes sense. So?

684
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,895
So, if you just use this opportunity well,

685
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:14,065
you and Soo-ah can definitely
get back together.

686
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,235
Really? Joon-ki, what should I do, then?

687
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,029
What do you mean "what"?
That guy invited you to his store.

688
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,408
So you gotta go. With Yoon-ah.
Like lovebirds.

689
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,202
And then?

690
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,996
You show her what a great guy you are.

691
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,539
Make her regret dumping you.

692
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,959
-How?
-That all depends on Yoon-ah--

693
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,878
It depends on Dr. Han.

694
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,465
What? What do I have to do?

695
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,969
Yoon-ah, please help me. I beg of you.

696
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,346
I do want to help you,
but I really don't think I can do this.

697
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,806
Don't be like this!

698
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,351
If you help me this once,
I'll forget all the trouble you caused.

699
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,520
So please, just help me. Please?

700
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,773
All right, fine.

701
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,984
Thank you! Thank you, Yoon-ah!

702
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,694
Now what should we do?

703
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,613
Dr. Han, let's start with your clothes.

704
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,534
You need to look elegant and gorgeous.

705
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,506
Goodness, my bag!

706
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,010
What are you doing here?

707
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,137
Oh, that...

708
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,182
I went to the career center and thought
of you guys, so I just stopped by.

709
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:34,228
What time is Tae-hyun coming?

710
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,813
So you came to see Tae-hyun.

711
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,565
What? No, I came to see you guys.

712
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,025
Enough already.

713
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,820
Tae-hyun called earlier to say
he's running late because of an interview.

714
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,697
I'll get going first.

715
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,783
Oh, okay. I'll be going soon, too.

716
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,535
I'm really leaving soon.

717
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,345
You look pretty good dressed up.

718
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,138
Normally, you look like a bum.

719
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,682
Because I don't get dolled up.

720
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,101
When I do, I look as good as anything.

721
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,979
Good as my foot.
You're not that great.

722
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,397
Can I really trust you?

723
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,317
Just do as I say
and everything will go well.

724
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,819
None of your past advice
has ever worked, though.

725
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,321
I'm not sure if this will work.

726
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,614
Just trust me, you punk.

727
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,992
You have a lot of flaws, but your
inability to trust is the biggest.

728
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,661
Enough already. Why isn't she coming out?

729
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,020
How do I look?

730
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,523
I haven't used makeup in so long,
it was a bit awkward.

731
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,024
It looks weird, right?

732
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,236
No.

733
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,905
You're pretty. Very pretty.

734
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,115
Right, Joon-ki?

735
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,158
Seriously.

736
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,702
You're like a totally different person.

737
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,455
-Right, Dong-goo?
-What?

738
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,207
Well...

739
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,459
it's not bad.

740
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,170
-It's time, so let's go.
-Yes.

741
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,090
Is it okay to leave Sol?

742
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,716
Don't worry, go ahead.

743
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,093
We'll take good care of Sol.

744
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,012
Okay. Then I'll see you later.

745
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,766
Come back victorious, Dong-goo!

746
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,435
Sol, let's cheer!

747
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,062
Go, Mom!

748
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,065
What a loud cheer.

749
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,567
Such a filial daughter.

750
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,026
Can you hold her?

751
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,611
I'm gonna go cheer some more first.

752
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,780
What cheer? Joon-ki! Joon-ki!

753
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,492
HANKUK UNIVERSITY PAPER

754
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,252
Why's it so empty here?

755
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,631
Seo-jin.

756
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,427
-Kang Seo-jin!
-Yes? What, what?

757
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,098
Tae-hyun!

758
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,224
It's been a long time.

759
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,020
Yes, it's been a while.

760
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,815
I was so late,
I thought no one would be here.

761
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,817
But I'm so thankful you waited for me.

762
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,362
Oh, no, I wasn't waiting for you.
I didn't even know you were coming.

763
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,865
-Really, truly.
-All right, all right.

764
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,200
No need to fuss.

765
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,496
Do you want to see the renovated archives?

766
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,841
Wow, it's really clean now.

767
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,595
I remember when there were ants and mice.

768
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,680
It was like a haunted house.

769
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,894
-Wow, this is still here.
-Why? What is it?

770
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,020
This...

771
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,358
is the very first article
that reporter Kang Seo-jin wrote.

772
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,528
How's the job hunt going?

773
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,447
I'm just trying my best right now.

774
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,116
Join our newspaper.
It would be fun to work together.

775
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,618
I did apply...

776
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,828
but I got denied.

777
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,413
Hey, it's okay.

778
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,958
I got rejected twice before getting in.

779
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,002
You'll get in next time. Don't lose hope.

780
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,352
I'm hungry. Should we go eat?

781
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,728
Really?

782
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,439
Let's eat something delicious.

783
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,443
-What's wrong with this?
-Why won't it open?

784
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,822
Oh, no!

785
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,241
Why won't this open?

786
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,867
Seo-jin, give me your phone.

787
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,496
I left it on the table.

788
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,623
I left my bag out there, too.

789
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,334
Oh, no, what should we do?

790
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,970
Yoon-ah, let's review one last time.

791
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,806
-Your occupation?
-Korea's top neurosurgeon.

792
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,267
-Parents?
-Hospital director and painter.

793
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,351
Where did we first meet?

794
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,812
The third table in the hospital cafeteria.

795
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,772
-Okay, you're ready, right?
-Yes!

796
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,732
I will do my best!

797
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,860
Great. Then let's go.

798
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,668
I didn't think you'd show up.
I'm surprised.

799
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:54,089
Dr. Han finished early today,
so we stopped by.

800
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,802
I thought this was gonna
be some huge restaurant...

801
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,554
but it's rather small.

802
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,930
Is it?

803
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,683
But I guarantee the quality of the food.

804
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,269
Let's order first. What would you like?

805
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,812
Order as you see fit.

806
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,651
Excuse me. We'll order now.

807
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,152
We'd like...

808
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,870
One of each. And...

809
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,377
-Please prepare those things.
-Yes, sir.

810
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,422
The dishes sound like Muay Thai wrestlers.

811
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,341
Quite aggressive.

812
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,593
Any alcoholic beverage?

813
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,471
I'll pass. I'm breastfeeding now...

814
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,431
What? Breastfeeding?

815
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,060
Oh, it's not that.

816
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,313
No, not breastfeeding, but surgery.

817
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,899
Dr. Han has an important surgery tomorrow.

818
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,110
Oh, surgery.

819
00:44:58,695 --> 00:44:59,696
What kind of surgery?

820
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,031
What?

821
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,827
Well, it's...

822
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,204
related to the small intestine.

823
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,455
Pardon?

824
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,167
A neurosurgeon also does
small intestine surgeries?

825
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,878
That... that's...

826
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:21,593
Dr. Han specializes in neurosurgery,
but practices several types of medicine.

827
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,222
She's licensed in internal medicine,
general surgery, and gynecology.

828
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,851
How could a woman
like Yoon-ah date a guy like--

829
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:37,109
To others, it may look like
Dong-goo has nothing to offer,

830
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,610
but they're wrong.

831
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,779
But I saw clearly.

832
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,781
Dong-goo's bright future.

833
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,493
Oh, no, that's not...

834
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,745
No. I'm certain.

835
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:53,000
I believe you're going to become
the best director in the world.

836
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,461
My intuition has never been wrong,

837
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,463
so you can trust me.

838
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,092
I can't stop her.

839
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,553
However, he still hasn't...

840
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,890
opened his heart to me.

841
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,641
It's really painful.

842
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,644
I already told you.

843
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,855
My heart hasn't fully recovered yet.

844
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,775
It's okay. I'm not pressuring you...

845
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,360
or asking you for anything.

846
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,490
Forgive me.

847
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,075
I don't deserve you.

848
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,420
We're locked in.

849
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,174
We can only leave in the morning
when people come.

850
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,302
Still, since I'm here with you...

851
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:47,971
it's not that bad.

852
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,475
That's... well...

853
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:56,813
Seo-jin, I have something...

854
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,649
to say to you.

855
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,359
What is it?

856
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,740
Honestly, for a while now...

857
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,911
I--

858
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,708
What? Why are you like that?

859
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,752
You have...

860
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,338
below your nose...

861
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,341
-Is there something below my nose?
-Yes.

862
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,801
One second.

863
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,184
Shoot. My mustache is growing again.

864
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,936
My razor is in my bag. What should I do?

865
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,356
What's wrong? Something happen?

866
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,652
It's nothing.

867
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,446
-It must've been some dust.
-I see.

868
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,157
Anyway, what I wanted to say--

869
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,076
Don't come any closer. Don't.

870
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,954
-What's wrong?
-I said don't, so don't come closer.

871
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,040
I have to get out of here.

872
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,751
If he finds out, it's the end.

873
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,715
Hello! Hello, we're in here!

874
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,093
Save us! Save us!

875
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:12,014
-Seo-jin, what's wrong all of a sudden?
-Don't come any closer, I said!

876
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,393
Here, in here! Do you hear us?

877
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,769
We're locked in here.

878
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,314
Seo-jin, calm down!

879
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,608
In here! Please open the door!

880
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,612
Did you enjoy the meal?

881
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,488
Well, it was fine.

882
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,159
But it wasn't as good
as the traditional food we had in Bangkok.

883
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,744
Is that so?

884
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,330
But you should have one more drink
before you go.

885
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:42,377
I'd love to, but, sadly,
Dr. Han has surgery tomorrow.

886
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,129
Next time, it's our treat.

887
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,465
-Take care.
-Okay. I will.

888
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,384
I had a nice evening, Yoon-ah.

889
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,469
Yes, me, too.

890
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,762
Let's go, Dong-goo.

891
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,055
Okay.

892
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,225
Closer, get closer to me.

893
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,310
Like this?

894
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,687
Dong-goo, how'd I do?

895
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,148
You did great! Great acting.

896
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,316
It was perfect.

897
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,776
Thank you.

898
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:10,864
Why is my mother... with your father?

899
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,117
It can't be.

900
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,036
-It can't be.
-It can't be.

901
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,412
There's no way.

902
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:21,249
Then you... are my father's daughter?

903
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,085
-Daughter!
-Oh, sorry Sol.

904
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,252
How is this...?

905
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,921
Then you're my half-sister?

906
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,298
Half-sister, half-sister!

907
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,300
That's impossible! Impossible!

908
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,303
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

909
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,138
Why do you think it's impossible?

910
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,600
-Why do you think it's impossible?
-Nothing's impossible in the world.

911
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,727
There are only nasty desires...

912
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,355
that you try to hide.

913
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,482
-So s-scary.
-What are you talking about?

914
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,360
Thirty years ago,
you abandoned Geum-ran Yoo.

915
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,946
He knows Geum-ran Yoo, he knows.

916
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,614
How do you know that girl?

917
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,617
Because that woman's daughter... is me.

918
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,994
What? What are you saying?

919
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,789
Then you're also my daughter?

920
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,542
-Daughter? Daughter?
-Crazy!

921
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,962
I'd made up my mind.
I swore to get my revenge on you.

922
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,297
What are you saying?

923
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,632
You demon!

924
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,676
Demon!

925
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,927
You're a demon!

926
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,650
There's no limit to the imagination.
I just can't help but applaud.

927
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,653
I would've never dreamed
the wife is his daughter.

928
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,113
Me neither!

929
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,323
How are we going to wait until tomorrow?

930
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,034
-I'm so curious, I could die.
-Seriously.

931
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,202
Why?

932
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,412
Oh, you're back.

933
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,413
Hey.

934
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,165
How'd it go?

935
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,041
The beginning was a little bumpy,

936
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,252
but Yoon-ah is a better actor
than you think.

937
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,504
Really? Yoon-ah, you're awesome.

938
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,715
I just did my best is all.

939
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,091
But...

940
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,426
will this really work?

941
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,927
Of course.

942
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,055
She's probably a hundred times
more confused now.

943
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,851
"Why'd I dump a guy like him?
Was I a fool?" is what she'll be thinking.

944
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,937
I hope that's the case.

945
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,106
Did Sol give you guys a hard time?

946
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,901
Not at all.
She just vomited five times, pooped seven,

947
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,737
peed about nine times? Right, Sol?

948
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,199
-Goodness, something's happening again.
-I can take Sol now.

949
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,993
-Ah, finally.
-My little Sol.

950
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,912
My arms are sore. I'm gonna eat something.

951
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:22,996
Go ahead, eat something.

952
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,123
-I'm gonna go play some games.
-Yeah, go for it.

953
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,001
Sol, you gave your uncles
a hard time, didn't you?

954
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,920
Did you miss your mommy?

955
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,215
Mommy missed you, too.

956
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,716
Mommy?

957
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,510
What's the meaning of this?

958
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,847
Soo-ah! What are you doing here?

959
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,808
Yoon-ah left her bag.

960
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,519
I see.

961
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,020
Thank you.

962
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:50,398
What's with "mommy"?
You two had a kid together?

963
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:51,858
Since when?

964
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,570
Wait... were you two together
while dating me?

965
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,573
No way! What kind of question is that?

966
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,076
-Then what is it?
-Well, you see...

967
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,330
Yoon-ah adores kids,
so she lets them call her "Mommy."

968
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,414
It's a habit.

969
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,208
-Right, Yoon-ah?
-Yes, that's right.

970
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,793
Would I have a kid at this young an age?

971
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,462
-Oh, you're so cute.
-Then whose kid is she?

972
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,297
Wait a minute...

973
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:18,009
come to think of it,
isn't she the baby the guest left here?

974
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,637
Yeah, that...

975
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,390
we decided to raise her.

976
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,934
Why? Why raise a stranger's kid?

977
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:30,105
Well, that...

978
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,108
she's Joon-ki's.

979
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,154
What? Joon-ki's baby?

980
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,866
Then the one who left her here

981
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,742
was Joon-ki's girlfriend?

982
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,329
Yup. You know Joon-ki's a scumbag.
He's getting punished.

983
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,581
Is this true, Joon-ki?

984
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,173
Yeah. I'm a lowlife.

985
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,926
True, you would do something like this.

986
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,804
Thank you for bringing the handbag!

987
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,556
It's late, so you should get going!

988
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,476
Since we're here, it's a shame to just go.

989
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,021
Can you give us a tour of the guesthouse?
Let's have beer, too.

990
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,440
Yes, of course.

991
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,067
Yoon-ah, can you show them
the third floor?

992
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,736
I'll bring up some beer.

993
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,446
Yes, okay.

994
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,532
Sol, let's go to Daddy. There's Daddy.

995
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,494
Daddy. Daddy. Daddy...

996
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,332
It's my precious little daughter.

997
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,917
Please come this way.

998
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:36,296
Please go up first.
I'll follow with the beer.

999
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,090
What the heck? Are you crazy?

1000
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,009
It was an emergency. It just came out.

1001
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,347
Forget about it.

1002
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,307
It's fine.

1003
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,935
So don't worry and just go on up.

1004
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,645
-Forgive me.
-Don't touch me.

1005
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,562
Sorry.

1006
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,237
Sol.

1007
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,045
What do I do? It's getting thicker.

1008
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,381
If Tae-hyun sees this,
it's over between us.

1009
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,132
This is driving me crazy.

1010
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,013
I'm so sleepy.

1011
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,724
Why am I so tired?

1012
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,477
No! I can't!

1013
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,523
I can't fall asleep. Absolutely not.

1014
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,325
I must've dozed off.

1015
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:01,923
What is this?

1016
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,258
What are you doing?

1017
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,509
It's not what you think.

1018
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,721
-I thought you might be cold.
-I told you not to come near me!

1019
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,891
Tae-hyun!

1020
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,227
Tae-hyun! Wake up!

1021
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,813
Tae-hyun, I'm sorry! It was a mistake.

1022
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,065
Open your eyes!

1023
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,318
Tae-hyun, are you okay?
Have you come to your senses?

1024
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,697
My head... my head hurts.

1025
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,247
Hey, you have...

1026
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,916
a mustache.

1027
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,922
I'm really so sorry!

1028
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,552
I'm truly sorry.

1029
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,060
The atmosphere of your guesthouse
is really great. And cozy.

1030
00:55:55,894 --> 00:56:00,315
Dr. Han insists I close the guesthouse
and focus on filmmaking,

1031
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,317
but it doesn't feel right.

1032
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,819
I want to be successful on my own

1033
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,448
without relying on her financial support.

1034
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,033
I see.

1035
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,576
Yoon-ah, forgive me.

1036
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,204
I'm so selfish.

1037
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,789
Don't say that.

1038
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,836
Emergency! Sol is crying for food!

1039
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,297
I urgently request you come quickly!

1040
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,842
Pardon me, I'm just going
to use the restroom.

1041
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,554
Yes, of course.

1042
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:32,931
Okay, then!

1043
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,308
Shall we toast to your dream?

1044
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,559
Shall we?

1045
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,354
We're short one beer.

1046
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,773
I'll go get one.
I also have to use the restroom.

1047
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,778
Okay, then.

1048
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,623
Sol, you were hungry, weren't you?

1049
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,708
Are you happy eating Mommy's milk?

1050
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,002
There you go, my little Sol.

1051
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,298
Yummy food. Yummy food.

1052
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,508
There you go.

1053
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,055
Hey, Joon-ki--

1054
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,516
Yoon-ah...

1055
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,393
what...

1056
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,020
are you doing right now?

1057
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:22,856
Soo-ah!

1058
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,983
Why... are you...

1059
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,528
Why are you breastfeeding Joon-ki's baby?

1060
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,240
Oh, no, that's not it.

1061
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,700
I bought the diapers--

1062
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,285
Soo-ah.

1063
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,496
Joon-ki, why is Yoon-ah
breastfeeding your baby?

1064
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,708
You see, that's because...

1065
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,794
she's donating breastmilk.

1066
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,005
Breastmilk builds the immune system.

1067
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,549
What? You're getting breastmilk
from Dong-goo's girlfriend?

1068
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:50,758
Wait a minute.

1069
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,635
How can an unmarried woman have milk?

1070
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,138
-That's...
-Right, she's unmarried.

1071
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:59,767
But once in a while, when Yoon-ah
is in a good mood and she focuses really--

1072
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,768
Stop talking nonsense!

1073
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,897
Yoon-ah, tell me the truth.
What's going on?

1074
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,107
So, you see...

1075
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,402
the truth is... Sol is my daughter.

1076
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,488
What? Your daughter?

1077
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,116
-You said she's yours.
-Right, right, she's my daughter.

1078
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,910
You said your ex-girlfriend
left the baby here.

1079
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,870
So how can she be Yoon-ah's baby?

1080
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,748
Then is Yoon-ah your ex-girlfriend?
That's impossible.

1081
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,048
Why do you think it's impossible?

1082
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,426
Nothing's impossible in the world.

1083
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,929
There's only nasty desires
that you try to hide.

1084
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,306
What are you talking about?

1085
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:43,144
Then Yoon-ah is your ex-girlfriend
and this baby came from that relationship?

1086
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,897
I tried to keep it secret to the end.

1087
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,274
Then Dong-goo doesn't know?

1088
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,235
I wanted to tell him the truth at first,

1089
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,445
but it was so hard for him
after the breakup.

1090
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,447
I just couldn't tell him.

1091
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,741
Yoon-ah, is this the truth?

1092
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,868
Well, actually...

1093
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,578
Shut your mouth, Yoon-ah!

1094
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,247
You have no right to say anything!

1095
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:06,167
Soo-ah, this girl will do anything
to get what she wants.

1096
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,796
You're the only one who can save Dong-goo
from her evil witch grasp.

1097
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,257
Please, will you go back to Dong-goo?

1098
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,303
I beg you.

1099
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,223
-Hey.
-Yes?

1100
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,849
-You plotted this with Dong-goo?
-No.

1101
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,018
You know what'll happen
if I catch you lying?

1102
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,272
Look straight into my eyes and speak.
You two plotted this, right?

1103
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,941
I don't think so?

1104
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,568
You little...

1105
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,946
-You won't tell me the truth?
-I will, I will.

1106
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,782
-What is it?
-It was one drop at a time...

1107
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:40,368
-that became a huge river.
-What the hell are you talking about?

1108
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:41,286
It was--

1109
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:46,374
I still can't forget the night sky
above Dr. Han's Malibu home.

1110
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:51,045
It was like gold dust
sprinkled in the sky.

1111
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,049
The four of us
should go together sometime.

1112
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,801
Oh, I would love to.

1113
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,511
Great.

1114
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,555
Oh, you're here.

1115
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,474
Soo-ah, we were just talking
about the four of us

1116
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,394
taking a trip to Dr. Han's home in Malibu.

1117
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,687
You're okay with that, right?

1118
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:12,317
Why are you staring like that?
Is there something on my face?

1119
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,445
No. On the back of your head.
I'll take it off for you.

1120
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,834
Soo-ah. I'm sorry, I was wrong.
Please forgive me.

1121
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,086
Let go before I hit you again.

1122
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,088
Wait, Soo-ah.

1123
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,965
Why would I go to this extreme?

1124
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,593
I really love you.
I don't want to break up with you.

1125
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,262
Really? But what can I say?

1126
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,890
Whatever little affection I had for you
is totally gone now.

1127
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,352
I don't ever want to see your face again,

1128
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,479
so don't you dare show up
in front of me again.

1129
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,316
Soo-ah.

1130
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,860
Soo-ah.

1131
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,964
Dong-goo, please stop drinking.

1132
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,426
Hey, stop, stop. You drank too much.

1133
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,844
Leave me alone.

1134
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,556
I want to drink till I die.

1135
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,017
Things never go well
when we listen to you.

1136
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,144
I didn't think it'd turn out like this.

1137
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,480
This is crazy.

1138
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,790
Both siblings are putting on
a pathetic show. Pathetic.

1139
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,169
Be quiet, punk!

1140
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,004
Tae-hyun...

1141
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,132
Soo-ah!

1142
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,427
I'm exhausted.

1143
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,848
-Tae-hyun!
-Soo-ah!

1144
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,350
Come down from there.

1145
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,768
You're so noisy!

1146
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,020
Soo-ah!

1147
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,777
Stop drinking, stop drinking.

1148
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,157
Let go!

1149
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,092
How long are you going to be like this?

1150
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,594
A new girl can help you move on.

1151
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,430
I'm sure you'll meet someone. Have hope.

1152
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,850
Hee-ja Kim? Korea's top actress?

1153
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,769
I'll do everything you say, Director!

1154
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,605
This is about swimmers.
Have you ever seen hairy swimmers?

1155
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,524
Hello. I'll be taking care of you today.

1156
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,070
Is this the end of my manhood?
This is the end of Joon-ki Lee!

1157
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,573
-Seo-jin!
-Would you like to officially date?

1158
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,159
They're filming a drama movie, a drama.

1159
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,161
He picks his nose all the time.

1160
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:13,456
And he doesn't wash his hands,
but eats gimbap right away,

1161
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,666
and then pinches my cheeks.
I'm going crazy.

1162
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,793
He's getting married soon.

1163
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,295
How will he feel finding out
that Yoon-ah had his child?

1164
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,339
What are you talking about?
She had my child?

1165
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,882
Do you want to ruin my life?

1166
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,550
You should feel grateful for this.

1167
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,261
How do I know
you're not just playing games?

1168
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,304
Wait a minute!
