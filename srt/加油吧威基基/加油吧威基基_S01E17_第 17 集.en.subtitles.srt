1
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,838
What's this?

2
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,050
Then say, "I like you."

3
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,012
Dong-goo, I like you.

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,556
-Make it cute.
-I like you.

5
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,724
With more gusto.

6
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,060
I like you a lot.

7
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,826
What is this?

8
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,922
I like you.

9
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,799
I really do, Dong-goo.

10
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,012
Do you want to date seriously?

11
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,140
Yoon-ah.

12
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,364
Really? Yoon-ah said she likes you?

13
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,908
You finally did it.

14
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,284
Good for you, Dong-goo.

15
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,702
-Congratulations.
-Good for you.

16
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,038
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

17
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,625
This feels a bit weird.

18
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,545
I'm congratulating my ex
for getting together with someone else.

19
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,754
Should I do that?

20
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,465
I know. Soo-ah's relaxed and cool.

21
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,300
You're human dry ice.

22
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,761
I can see the breath come out.

23
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,268
-There she is. Dong-goo's woman.
-The couple.

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,353
Yoon-ah, I'll take that.

25
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,480
You're up early.

26
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,816
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

27
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,568
What do you do today? Baking class?

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,237
-Yes.
-What will you do then?

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,865
-Go to the bakery?
-Yes.

30
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,287
Oh, I see.

31
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,249
Sol must be awake.

32
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,463
What was that awkwardness?

33
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,174
-Are you sure you two are dating?
-Yes.

34
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,428
Yoon-ah said she liked me
and suggested we start dating.

35
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,179
Did you say yes?

36
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,891
Do you have to say so?

37
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,309
Of course you do.

38
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,311
How are you dating
if you didn't say anything?

39
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,604
-Right, Doo-sik?
-What?

40
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,566
Yes. It's invalid
if you didn't say you're dating.

41
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,859
Is it?

42
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,986
Then are Yoon-ah and I not dating yet?

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,488
If you want to know, ask her.

44
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,282
I can't ask her that now.

45
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,784
What if you find out later
that it was one-sided?

46
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,286
Is that right?

47
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,414
Okay. I need to go ask.

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,837
He really went to ask.

49
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,255
He's such a fool.

50
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,550
Hey. You become a fool
when you're in love.

51
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,011
But he's a real fool.

52
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,140
-Silence.
-Why can't I join in?

53
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,099
Look at you.

54
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,894
-Is it fun to tease someone?
-It's so much fun.

55
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,229
Me too.

56
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,939
Me three.

57
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,025
-Stop it.
-You won't laugh?

58
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,867
Yoon-ah. Can I come in?

59
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,452
Yes.

60
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,757
Yoon-ah. Can I ask you something?

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,925
Yes.

62
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,719
So...

63
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,639
Yesterday, do you remember
saying you like me?

64
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,226
You sent me a video saying so

65
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,811
and suggested we start dating.

66
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,272
We faced each other and smiled, too.

67
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,564
Yes.

68
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,027
What I wanted to ask is...

69
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,654
are we dating?

70
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,698
Yes.

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,117
Right? We're dating, aren't we?

72
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,536
See, I was right.

73
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,913
Those cheeky idiots.

74
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,336
-Get back to what you were doing.
-Okay.

75
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,260
How fun.

76
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,637
Hey. Did you ask her?

77
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:05,805
What did she say?

78
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,598
We are dating.

79
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,726
See? I told you we were dating.

80
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,977
Really?

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,397
Her reaction earlier was so weird.

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,857
What was weird about that?

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,317
Think about it.

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,985
You like someone.

85
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,154
You confessed and got together.

86
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,613
How would you feel?

87
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,116
I'd feel so good
it would feel like flying.

88
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,659
That's it.

89
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,370
-That's exactly the state you're in.
-Yes!

90
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,957
But Yoon-ah doesn't look like that at all.

91
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,126
Right? Right, Doo-sik?

92
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,462
He's right.

93
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,466
She looks a bit downcast. Dejected.

94
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,633
She does?

95
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,721
The look on her face had bothered me.

96
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,347
Do you think

97
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,017
Yoon-ah has regrets?

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,061
Regrets? Of what?

99
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,438
She suggested that you two date.

100
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,649
It's possible that she slept on it
and now regrets it.

101
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,026
Right, Doo-sik?

102
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,112
Yes, that happens.

103
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,655
It's never happened to me,

104
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,658
but it happens a lot in movies or novels.

105
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,118
That can't happen.

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,036
It really can't.

107
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,205
How about you go to her

108
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,040
and ask her out on a date?

109
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,834
You need to earn points
before she changes her mind.

110
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,212
If you don't, you'll get dumped again.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,342
That can't happen.

112
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,564
FOR COUPLES JUST STARTING

113
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,399
Yes.

114
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,277
Dong-goo and Yoon-ah are out on a date.

115
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,738
Lunch?

116
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,366
I ate already.

117
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,452
Did my Bacca enjoy her lunch?

118
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,288
How annoying.

119
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,289
Where's his tongue?

120
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,834
I miss you, too.

121
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,503
See you later.

122
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,172
You hang up first.

123
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,342
My Bacca, you hang up first.

124
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,053
-Darn you.
-Why...

125
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,638
What did you just do?

126
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,723
You're such an idiot.

127
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:13,891
Right, Doo-sik?

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,521
I'd love to be in that situation myself.

129
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,150
Joon-ki and Dong-goo are all in love

130
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,235
and I'm all sad and alone, right, Sol?

131
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,030
Fall in love, too.

132
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,365
You're sitting next
to another lonely soul.

133
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,075
Who?

134
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,202
Oh, Sol?

135
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,330
Her? Suarez?

136
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,207
Yes.

137
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,378
The lonely should get together
and comfort each other.

138
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,379
Are you crazy?

139
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,673
Why would you try to set me up
with this thing?

140
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,051
Hey, I don't want an ignorant girlfriend
who doesn't know

141
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,220
the four arithmetic rules and thinks
Yoo Ah-in is Prince Sado.

142
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,680
-I'll kill you.
-Canceled.

143
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,475
Anyway, she's not an option,

144
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,810
-so don't say something that scary.
-Hah.

145
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,896
It's even worse for me.

146
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,813
What a joke.

147
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,610
I can't even stand her ignorant back.

148
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,113
Sol, you can't grow up
to be ignorant like her.

149
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,658
Let's read the newspaper
and become smart, okay?

150
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,620
Is there anything fun in the news?

151
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,704
DISCOURAGED FATHERS

152
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,207
"Discouraged fathers."

153
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,875
"Voluntary resignation."

154
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,921
It must be really tough, don't you think?

155
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,255
Isn't that obvious?

156
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,591
I bet they can't even face
their wife and kids.

157
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,470
That's why I'm not sure
if I should get married or not.

158
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,138
Don't worry.

159
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,473
You won't get to.

160
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,809
How can you say something so horrible?

161
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,979
What fell out?

162
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,610
Community centers teach
all sorts of things these days.

163
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,238
"Games to stimulate baby's senses."

164
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,948
PARK EUN-JI, INSTRUCTOR

165
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,451
Hey.

166
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,370
What's this sound?

167
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,038
What's this?

168
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,250
Hey. Is that your heart beating?

169
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,378
Joon-ki. I think

170
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,255
I'm in love.

171
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,298
With whom?

172
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,299
Her?

173
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,095
You're saying that after
just looking at a photo?

174
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,808
We're going to the community center.

175
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,228
-Come on, get up.
-Me too?

176
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,772
No, Chewbacca will kill me if she hears.

177
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,399
You don't have to see her.

178
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,485
I'll meet her. Just come with me.

179
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,571
Come on. Let's do this.

180
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,989
Let's go to the community center.

181
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,367
I want to become a fool for love!

182
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,665
Why is Yoon-ah so quiet?

183
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,209
She looks downcast.

184
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,212
Does she really regret
deciding to date me?

185
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,673
That's not good.

186
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,217
The weather's lovely.

187
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,637
Yoon-ah, what should we do first?

188
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,055
Shall we eat something?

189
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:58,973
Yes.

190
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,019
What shall we eat?

191
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,520
Sundae, your favorite?

192
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,688
Yes.

193
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,691
Shall we go then?

194
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
Yes.

195
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,111
What's going on?

196
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,155
Why does she only say yes?

197
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,324
Does she not want to talk to me?

198
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,619
This is making me feel really anxious.

199
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,752
I feel like I'll be sick.

200
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,589
It's our first date
and what's up with this vibe?

201
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,882
Darn it.

202
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,593
I need to change the vibe.

203
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,636
Yoon-ah.

204
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,805
Where shall we go after this?

205
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,308
How about an amusement park
since the weather's nice?

206
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,684
Sure.

207
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,104
Do you like going on rides?

208
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,522
Yes.

209
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,572
-Honey.
-Thanks.

210
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,033
It's delicious.

211
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,082
-Yoon-ah.
-What?

212
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,043
Open your mouth. I'll feed you.

213
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,127
You don't have to.

214
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,505
Come on, I want to feed you.

215
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,881
Open wide.

216
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,341
It's okay. I'll eat on my own.

217
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,552
Come on, I just want to feed you.

218
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,137
-No, it's okay.
-But...

219
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,889
Why do you keep saying no?

220
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,474
I said it's okay.

221
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,979
-Are you okay?
-Ouch.

222
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,400
That stings.

223
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,443
I think salt got in my eye.

224
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,737
I need to go to the bathroom.

225
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,282
-Ouch...
-I'm sorry, Yoon-ah.

226
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,659
I'm...

227
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,245
This is just crazy.

228
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,962
Doo-sik. Don't you think

229
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,965
people have a huge misunderstanding
about us?

230
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,341
Like what?

231
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,137
There's something on your lip.

232
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,725
What are you doing?

233
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,395
They're already staring at us.
Are you crazy?

234
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,605
Sit away from me. Go on.

235
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,065
What did I do?

236
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,317
Hello. Hello.

237
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,489
Hello.

238
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,658
Are you here on your own?

239
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,034
Yes.

240
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,788
I thought we were the only guys,
but there are others.

241
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,331
This is fascinating.

242
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,793
The thing is, I run a business

243
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,336
and I'm so busy.

244
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,505
I neglected my child a bit.

245
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,840
So I made some time.

246
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,051
-Good for you.
-I see.

247
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,305
Do you know if the instructor's married?

248
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,849
I don't know. She might be single.

249
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,392
Really?

250
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,477
That's a relief.

251
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,354
-Hello.
-Hello.

252
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,691
I see some fathers, too.

253
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,692
It's nice to meet you all.

254
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,489
Are you angry?

255
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,117
Why are you so down?
How about some applause?

256
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,077
Today I'll teach you a massage

257
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,580
that will help your baby poop.

258
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,125
Put the mats, oils and baskets
back in their places.

259
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,794
Hey. Get up.

260
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,465
You're both her uncles, right?

261
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,717
How was the one-day class?

262
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,927
If you liked it,

263
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,721
-I can help you register.
-No, I respectfully decline.

264
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,474
Why don't you think about it?

265
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,727
A massage will improve
the baby's growth and development...

266
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,020
No thanks.

267
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,522
-Hey!
-Yikes.

268
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,106
Get up. We're leaving.

269
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,525
Okay.

270
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,248
Where did you two go?

271
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,751
I experienced the side-effects
of an IT powerhouse.

272
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,754
-What?
-I wasted energy for nothing.

273
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,089
Sorry.

274
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,262
The massage got Sol's bowels going, I see?

275
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,640
The sound of her pooping
is louder than usual.

276
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,476
-It is. I'll get a diaper.
-Okay.

277
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,187
Let's change your diaper.

278
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,522
Was she wearing this?

279
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,191
What's this?

280
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,112
-Doo-sik.
-What?

281
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,823
Did the instructor say the massage

282
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,074
could cause things to show?

283
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,577
-Why? Does Sol have something?
-Yes.

284
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,370
-What?
-A penis.

285
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,378
What's going on? This isn't Sol.

286
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,297
It's not.

287
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,299
I thought she felt odd.

288
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,050
What do you mean it's not Sol?

289
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,261
Where's Sol then?

290
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,262
Where's Sol?

291
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,306
Hey. We swapped.

292
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,391
-At the community center.
-What?

293
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,059
You took a kid without checking?

294
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,395
You rushed me and I had no time to check.

295
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,606
Be quiet. You have no time to fight.

296
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,982
Go and get Sol back.

297
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,901
O-okay. Sol...

298
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,695
Sol. Sol, Sol...

299
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,155
Sol!

300
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,781
Oh no.

301
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,420
Yoon-ah. I'm sorry.

302
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,421
Is your eye okay?

303
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,840
Yes.

304
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,093
-Can you go on a ride?
-Yes.

305
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,095
What now?

306
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,722
She looks even worse.

307
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,642
Darn it. I must cheer her up.

308
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,769
I need to make up for my mistake.

309
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,024
Yes, that's it.

310
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,069
The right amount of thrill and touch.

311
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,822
The ride that'll change the mood
and show my manliness.

312
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,908
Yoon-ah. Shall we ride the Viking?

313
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,036
What? Okay.

314
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,829
Let's go.

315
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,000
The Viking's ready to go.

316
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,877
The safety bar's going down.

317
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,007
It's been a while since I rode a Viking.

318
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,677
Yoon-ah, hold tight.

319
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,220
Okay.

320
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,264
If it gets too scary for you,

321
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,393
you can lean on me, okay?

322
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay.

323
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,563
Let's go!

324
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,984
To the world of the unknown.

325
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,248
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

326
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,549
Hang on. Was the Viking always this scary?

327
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,177
What's this? This is...

328
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,680
Why is it going so high up?

329
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,189
It's too high. It's...

330
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,026
I'm so scared. Stop.

331
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,153
Stop. Stop.

332
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,237
Stop!

333
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,574
Mister! Mister! Stop this thing!

334
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,035
Let me off! Stop!

335
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,083
Mister, I need to get off!

336
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,836
-I want to get off.
-Calm down.

337
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,135
Dong-goo. Relax.

338
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,388
-I need to get off.
-It's fine. You'll be okay.

339
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,435
The safety bar's going up.

340
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,523
Dong-goo, it's okay now. Sit up.

341
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,984
-Really?
-Yes.

342
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,407
It really stopped.

343
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,743
I thought I was going to die.

344
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,539
I'm sorry, Yoon-ah.

345
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,249
I'm really...

346
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,506
Oh no.

347
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh dear. No...

348
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,011
Dong-goo.

349
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,933
It's hard enough making a living.

350
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,477
Must I take half a day off

351
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,979
to prepare for your family's
memorial rites?

352
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,400
Poor me.

353
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,904
-Hello?
-Hello?

354
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,739
Is this Hee-dong's dad?

355
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,700
I'm Sol's uncle.
We met at the community class.

356
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,161
Oh yes. Why did you call?

357
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,039
I think the kids got swapped.

358
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,874
We have Hee-dong

359
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,460
and I think you have Sol.

360
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,755
What? What sort of nonsense are you...

361
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,303
What is it? What's going on?

362
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,471
No, it's nothing.

363
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,852
Second floor bathroom. In one minute.

364
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,815
What's taking him so long?

365
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,693
Doo-sik, it's bad enough for us,

366
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,821
but how could a dad not know
his kid got swapped?

367
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,865
Is he a dad? He's a failure.

368
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,368
Hee-dong. My Hee-dong.

369
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,289
Mister. Where's Sol?

370
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,000
Well... There was a problem.

371
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,793
What problem? Where's Sol?

372
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,755
I'm sorry, but can you do me a favor?

373
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,299
What? What favor?

374
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,719
The thing is... I'm jobless.

375
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,972
I lost my job two years ago.

376
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,224
My wife's the breadwinner

377
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,517
and live under her constant gaze.

378
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,062
-So what?
-My wife looks down on me

379
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,898
for being useless in life.

380
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,026
She'll divorce me if she finds out
I swapped our kids.

381
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,986
What do you want us to do?

382
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,031
Could we swap the kids
without my wife noticing?

383
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,617
What? Are you kidding?

384
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,369
Stop yapping and bring Sol over.

385
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,664
Did I ask for too much? I get it.

386
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,626
I'll just tell the truth and get divorced.

387
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,961
Let's go.

388
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,173
Hey, hey. Okay, fine.

389
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,176
What do you want us to do?

390
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,430
I have a great plan.

391
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,897
There are the cacao nibs.

392
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,652
Cacao nibs. My favorite.

393
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,071
Oops.

394
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,574
Buy one get one free.

395
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,204
Hey, they're really cheap, too.

396
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,878
Hello, Sol.

397
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,047
They're not buy one get one free.

398
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:15,023
How much longer do we have to do this?

399
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,734
He might get divorced.

400
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,777
I feel sorry for him.

401
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,029
Why get us in this mess
by going to the class?

402
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,364
You swapped the kids.

403
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,573
Are you blaming me?

404
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,076
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

405
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,454
Where is this guy anyway?

406
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,626
Mister. What are you doing?

407
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,044
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,005
My wife might see us.

409
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,258
-Could you crouch down?
-What?

410
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,386
-You need to stand guard.
-What?

411
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,887
Stop looking at me.

412
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,979
Mister. How much longer must we do this?

413
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,274
Sorry. Let's say you're saving my life

414
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,109
and help me out.

415
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,236
We want to help you,

416
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,822
but your wife won't give us a chance.

417
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,157
Which is why

418
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,867
I have a fool-proof plan.

419
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,121
What is it this time?

420
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,926
This is the plan.

421
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,804
The only place to swap Hee-dong and Sol

422
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,931
without my wife noticing
is at the checkout.

423
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,644
It's the only place my wife
looks away from the stroller.

424
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,398
When she's done scanning,
the cashier will say this.

425
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,941
That's 158,000 won.

426
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,360
Is it cash or credit?

427
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,154
Credit card.

428
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,406
My wife will let go of the stroller

429
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,365
to get her wallet.

430
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,411
The time she needs to get it
is five seconds.

431
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,622
-Are you a member?
-I'll give you my number.

432
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,250
The time she needs to input
her number is five seconds.

433
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,835
The card is swiped

434
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,129
and the receipt printed in five seconds.

435
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,298
A total of 15 seconds.

436
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,051
Those 15 seconds is the last chance

437
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,803
to swap Hee-dong and Sol.

438
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,062
The code to signal the start is

439
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,897
"Is it cash or credit"?

440
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,066
-Remember that.
-Ma'am.

441
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,026
The total is 158,000 won.

442
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,195
Is it cash or credit?

443
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,114
-I'll pay by card.
-Okay.

444
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,014
Sol.

445
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,214
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

446
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,467
We're just...

447
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,679
Why are you holding my baby?

448
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,306
What?

449
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,932
Well...

450
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,226
Mister.

451
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,229
What's going on? Do you know them?

452
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,732
No. We've never met.

453
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,650
What? Mister.

454
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,194
What are you saying?

455
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,279
Who are you?

456
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,198
How dare you touch my Hee-dong?

457
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,366
What are you doing, mister?

458
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,827
You dare touch my baby?

459
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,496
My poor Hye-sook

460
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,124
works all day to make a living
because I'm a useless husband.

461
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,337
I never took her abroad once

462
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,796
or bought her pretty clothes.

463
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,340
Our dear Hee-dong

464
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,800
is the fruit and result of our love.

465
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,053
How dare you touch him?

466
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,471
If you want something,

467
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,806
I'd rather you kill me instead.

468
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,143
-What?
-Why would I kill someone?

469
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,103
You said you were...

470
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,898
Shut up. Keep your mouth shut!

471
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,777
You nameless young man.

472
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,363
Please just turn a blind eye.

473
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,656
I beg of you.

474
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,699
You nameless man.

475
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,701
This is just wrong.

476
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,664
Please save the life
of this useless husband.

477
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,420
You caught me.

478
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,757
I've never seen
a better husband in my life.

479
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,675
Lady.

480
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,845
You should be happy
your husband's such a great guy.

481
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,640
I'm leaving.

482
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,141
Go.

483
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,647
Don't you dare
show yourselves again, scumbags.

484
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,858
Honey.

485
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:13,154
I didn't know you cared
that much about me.

486
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,157
Honey...

487
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,290
Thank you, nameless young man.

488
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,208
You're welcome.

489
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,461
Good luck to all the dads out there.

490
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,308
I'm sorry, Yoon-ah.

491
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,144
I felt so nauseous.

492
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,646
Are you okay?

493
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,315
Yes.

494
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,443
Are you sure you aren't angry?

495
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:53,945
Yes.

496
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,115
She's angry. She is.

497
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,367
Her expression's so stiff.

498
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,288
I threw sundae at her
and threw up on her on our first date.

499
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,081
Why wouldn't she be angry?

500
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,585
I'm done for. She looks like
she regrets this so much.

501
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,586
Yoon-ah.

502
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,297
Are you thirsty? Shall I buy something?

503
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,506
Yes.

504
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,927
Wait here.

505
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,951
It's over. I'm done for.

506
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,954
She looks sullen and
only said "yes" all day.

507
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,833
I bet she regrets agreeing to date me.

508
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,419
I'm ruined.

509
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,671
It's over.

510
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,016
SEO-JIN

511
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,354
Hi, Seo-jin. We're on our way back.

512
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,730
Is Sol okay?

513
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:16,986
Yes. Sol had a really great day.

514
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,572
What about you? Did you enjoy your date?

515
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,784
To be honest, being alone with Dong-goo

516
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,662
is so nerve-racking
that I don't know what to say.

517
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,414
My mind was blank all day.

518
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,292
All I could say was "yes".

519
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,837
What if Dong-goo's angry?

520
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,964
I'm so worried.

521
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,842
I'm a bit out of it right now.

522
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,885
Let's talk when I'm back.

523
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,388
Okay. Bye.

524
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,185
Dong-goo.

525
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,818
So that was it.

526
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,321
I had no idea.

527
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,698
What?

528
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,288
Dong-goo.

529
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,918
Are you crying?

530
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,131
No, I thought

531
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,010
that because you looked sullen
and didn't say much,

532
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,929
I thought you regretted
agreeing to date me.

533
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,308
I was bothered and worried all day.

534
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,353
I was afraid we'd end up breaking up.

535
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,606
Why would I break up with you?

536
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,357
Just being with you

537
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,276
makes my heart pound
and gives me butterflies.

538
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,403
Really?

539
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,324
Then you should've said so.
You're so mean.

540
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,368
You tortured me all day.

541
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,540
Yoon-ah.

542
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,085
Are you sure you don't regret dating me?

543
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,631
-Yes.
-Then is today

544
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,633
our first day as a couple?

545
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,223
Then now that we're a couple,

546
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,185
can we hold hands?

547
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,375
Yoon-ah. Do you want to go on

548
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,127
another proper date tomorrow?

549
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,212
Yes.

550
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,923
Do you have nothing to say but yes?

551
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,176
Yes.

552
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,136
Forget it then.

553
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,848
Let's just go home.

554
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,278
You know we have many reservations today.

555
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,364
Make sure to clean every corner, okay?

556
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,282
-Yes.
-Okay.

557
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,575
Jeez.

558
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,286
Give me that.

559
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,495
I'll do it.

560
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,289
It's really okay.

561
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,623
Thank you, Dong-goo.

562
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,500
You're welcome.

563
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,752
Take Sol inside and rest.

564
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,254
I can't.

565
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,177
Seo-jin, stop cleaning and take a break.

566
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,722
Why clean when you worked late yesterday?

567
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,723
Thanks.

568
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,349
You're the best.

569
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,394
Will you all stop it?

570
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,147
The poor guy flying solo can't stand it.

571
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,357
Find yourself a girlfriend then.

572
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,985
You're being petty
just because you're jealous.

573
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,362
Wait and see.

574
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,907
I'll find a girlfriend who's much nicer

575
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,743
than Yoon-ah and Seo-jin.

576
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,454
Will you?

577
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,040
I wonder if there's another woman

578
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,209
like Yoon-ah who's as pretty, sweet,

579
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,837
and innocent like morning dew.

580
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,047
You're right.

581
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,507
There won't be another woman as cute

582
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,093
and adorable as Bacca who grows a beard

583
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,596
nicer than Park Chan-ho's.

584
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,139
Stop it already.

585
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,602
What did you do that for?

586
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,146
Will you stop it? You aren't kids.

587
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,440
Where's Soo-ah?

588
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,817
I don't know. Is she in her room?

589
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,818
What?

590
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,863
What's she doing in there
when we're all cleaning?

591
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,624
What are you doing?

592
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,586
Huh? I wasn't doing anything.

593
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,339
Were you giving yourself
a cucumber facial?

594
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,299
No.

595
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,677
I sliced them to cook later.

596
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,387
Why were they on your face then?

597
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,555
Oh, those?

598
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,642
I'm pickling them. There was no salt.

599
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,935
My skin's salty.

600
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,852
What a joke.

601
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,521
Come and help us clean.

602
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,939
I have a shoot later

603
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,774
and need to care for my skin.

604
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,859
That's your problem.

605
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,070
You're already leeching off us. Now this?

606
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,406
I'm leeching off you?

607
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,532
I'm a long-term resident.

608
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,283
Long-term resident, my ass.

609
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,412
Why are you fighting again? Stop it.

610
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,914
Why do you never get along?

611
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,874
She has no concept of propriety.

612
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,584
What? Propriety?

613
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,128
How dare you? I'm older.

614
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,921
Are you done talking?

615
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,256
Yes, I'm done.

616
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,299
I can't treat you with respect
unless you earn it.

617
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,761
-How dare you?
-Will you just stop it?

618
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,513
-What?
-What?

619
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,601
I'm dead tired.

620
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,312
I have no energy to sit up.

621
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,689
Well done, guys.

622
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,329
Welcome.

623
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,130
Who are you?

624
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,886
What?

625
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,596
What language is that?

626
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,847
Did she book a room?

627
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,526
-Are you Angela?
-Yes, yes. Angela.

628
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,487
-Angela.
-So...

629
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,573
What language did she speak?

630
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,075
She's from Ukraine.

631
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,243
Can she not speak English?

632
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,496
-Can you speak English?
-No, no.

633
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,707
What's she saying?

634
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,751
She can't speak English.

635
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,919
It can't be helped.

636
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,505
I'll take you to your room.

637
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,131
Follow me.

638
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,676
Wait.

639
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,189
She's so pretty.

640
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,441
She looks like a doll.

641
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,068
Right, Doo-sik?

642
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,277
What's this?

643
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,906
What's this noise? Hey.

644
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,242
Hey. Is it your heartbeat again?

645
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,787
Joon-ki. I think

646
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,622
I'm in love.

647
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,624
What? Again?

648
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,918
You fall in love all the time.

649
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,254
This time it's real.

650
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,132
I've never felt
the pull of fate this strong.

651
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,384
Wake up, will you?

652
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,220
You can't nab a woman like her.

653
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,515
Hey. Don't even look up
a tree you can't climb.

654
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,850
You'll crack your skull.

655
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,727
Hey. Wake up. Hello?

656
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,105
You're totally out of it.

657
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,523
Angela...

658
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,920
Angela. Do you want to drink this?

659
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,838
Drinking?

660
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,635
What did she say?

661
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,472
Do you like the room? Need anything?

662
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,935
I can't understand a word.

663
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,438
Right, the app.

664
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,610
Angela, it was love at first sight.

665
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,663
What? Did she not understand?

666
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,290
Did it not work?

667
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:55,463
Angela. Do you have a boyfriend?

668
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,601
Angela. Angela?

669
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,852
Angela.

670
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,022
Darn it. What happened?

671
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,774
The translation app didn't work?

672
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,400
What now?

673
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,447
Wipe it until it's spick and span.

674
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,574
Okay, that's what I'm doing.

675
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,076
You don't deserve to talk back.

676
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,829
It's the producer.

677
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,540
Hello.

678
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,042
"Hello."

679
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,544
Hey, it's me. Are you enjoying your break?

680
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,545
Yes.

681
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,048
I'm having a great time.

682
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,259
Oh, okay, that's great.

683
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,429
I'll email you something right now.

684
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,516
Send me a summary by 8 a.m. tomorrow.

685
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,017
It's for my grad school assignment.

686
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,520
-Okay?
-What? Me?

687
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,397
What? You don't want to do it?

688
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,900
Well, no. I'll do it.

689
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,818
Bye.

690
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,445
Darn her.

691
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,030
What was it about?

692
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,158
A superior from work wants me to do
her grad school assignment.

693
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,036
What? Why did she make you do that?

694
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,079
I don't know.

695
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,665
She's my superior, so I can't refuse.

696
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,501
You always talk straight back at me,

697
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,003
but can't say a word to your superior.

698
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,462
Be quiet.

699
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,047
Finish up the dishes.

700
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,884
I was enjoying my hard-earned holiday.

701
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:31,058
It's payback time. You're paying.

702
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,988
-What are you doing?
-Studying Ukrainian.

703
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,073
I can't understand a thing.

704
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,118
-Do you think studying will help?
-What should I do then?

705
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,704
I need to try something to talk to her.

706
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,830
Don't worry, friend.

707
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,958
We found a way you can talk to Angela.

708
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,419
Really? What's that?

709
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,839
-Come in, come in.
-Come on in.

710
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,091
-Hey.
-Hello.

711
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,385
Who are these people?

712
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,470
Aren't they our guests?

713
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,180
Hear me out.

714
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,475
The problem is that you and Angela
can't communicate.

715
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,520
Why? Because Angela
can only speak Ukrainian.

716
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,980
-Right?
-Yes.

717
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,232
Now it gets a bit complicated.

718
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,651
Keep your wits about you and keep up.

719
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,861
Okay.

720
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,531
Mark from Germany speaks Ukrainian.

721
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,284
Bruno from France speaks German.

722
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,078
Hanako from Japan

723
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,954
happens to speak
a little French and Korean.

724
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,707
-Do you get it?
-Not at all.

725
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,876
What does this have to do with Angela?

726
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,795
Will you keep up?

727
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:45,049
So Angela will speak Ukrainian to Mark.

728
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,718
Mark will speak German to Bruno

729
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,638
and Bruno will speak French to Hanako.

730
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,016
Hanako will be able to
speak to you in Korean.

731
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,685
-Understood?
-Oh, so basically

732
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,772
we have one, two, three people
to go through?

733
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,065
That's it.

734
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,234
At least you can talk.

735
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,945
What? You don't like it?

736
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,614
-Then forget it.
-No, no, no.

737
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,782
Thanks a lot.

738
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,660
-Go and confess your love.
-Right.

739
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,328
Hey. Follow me, follow me.

740
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,623
-Follow me.
-Let's go!

741
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,459
-Let's go.
-Go, go, go.

742
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,712
He looks so happy.

743
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,049
Even if they can communicate,

744
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,634
do you think Angela will like him?

745
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,803
Does that make sense?

746
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,972
They say you should grant
someone's dying wish.

747
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,974
He can just have a go.

748
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,894
Though it's obvious
he'll get miserably rejected.

749
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,981
Shall we go and comfort him?

750
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,482
Shall we?

751
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,944
He'll cry again.
Shall we bring some tissue?

752
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,780
-Shall we bring two boxes?
-Shall we head over?

753
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,873
Go on, tell her how you feel.

754
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,125
Okay...

755
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,253
So...

756
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,380
It was love at first sight.

757
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,383
At first? When?

758
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,968
What did you like about me?

759
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,887
Hanako.

760
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,221
It's not you.

761
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,183
Pass the message on to Angela.

762
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,517
I was mistaken.

763
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,118
No, no, Angela.

764
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,412
Not him. It's not him. Him.

765
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,789
This guy. He feels like that about you.

766
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,545
Now... ask what she thinks about me.

767
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,173
Okay.

768
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,900
Good for you. She likes you.

769
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,611
Really? Really?

770
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,449
Ask, "Angela, will you date me?"

771
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,909
-Yes, yes.
-Go ahead.

772
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,412
Yes.

773
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,790
-Really? That's true?
-Yes.

774
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,416
Really, Angela?

775
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,628
Thank you. Thanks so much.

776
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,173
Joon-ki, Dong-goo, thanks so much.

777
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,675
I owe it to you.

778
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,260
Thank you so much.

779
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,053
Good for you.

780
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,014
I didn't do anything.

781
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,566
I'm done at last.

782
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,735
Why must I work all night on my day off?

783
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,529
If she weren't my superior I'd just...

784
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,325
No. I should hold back.

785
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,911
It'll just mess up my life at work.

786
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,664
I'm starving.

787
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,417
Shall I get something to eat?

788
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,546
Can I borrow the hair dryer?

789
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,175
My phone.

790
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,761
What are you doing?

791
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,014
Sorry. Did I do it on purpose?

792
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,849
You're so careless.

793
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,309
I said I'm sorry.

794
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,810
Just pick it up.

795
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,406
I can't see. Shine the light properly.

796
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,325
Okay, that's what I'm doing.

797
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,326
More this way.

798
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,203
-Okay.
-There it is.

799
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,049
It's working. I got it.

800
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,759
It's out.

801
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,346
What's this? What happened?

802
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,098
What's going on?

803
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,851
Darn it.

804
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,561
My hair got tangled in your brush.

805
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,479
What'll you do now?

806
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,023
You kept moving close to me,
so why are you yelling at me?

807
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,819
-Will you stay still?
-Darn it.

808
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,990
What should I do?

809
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,494
That hurts.

810
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,662
-Ouch.
-It hurts.

811
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,332
There's nothing I can do.

812
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,209
It won't come out.

813
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,126
Really?

814
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,088
This is insane. What should we do?

815
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,508
Could someone at a salon help?

816
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,968
-A salon?
-A salon?

817
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,804
Cheers.

818
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,976
Angela, here.

819
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,402
You know,

820
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,947
Angela has really low standards.

821
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,409
-Right?
-I guess so.

822
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,078
Isn't that couple way too unbalanced?

823
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,122
Exactly.

824
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,208
It's like Beauty and the Beast.

825
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,878
Or more like Beauty and the Tiny Dwarf?

826
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,923
Why? I think they look good together.

827
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,093
Are you jealous
that Doo-sik has a pretty girlfriend?

828
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:23,804
Why would we be?

829
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,682
I have a beautiful girlfriend like you.

830
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,308
Why would I be jealous?

831
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,479
I'm jealous. I'm so incredibly jealous.

832
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,731
I feel very displeased.

833
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,277
Why? How could Doo-sik
date someone like Angela?

834
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,364
Of course not. Why would we be jealous?

835
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:46,493
I have a cute and adorable
girlfriend like Seo-jin.

836
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,661
It hurts.

837
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,122
I'm so jealous, my insides hurt.

838
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:53,917
It feels as if I have
a huge boulder inside me.

839
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,712
The frustration is boiling up inside.

840
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,426
This looks bad.

841
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,471
It's so terribly tangled
that it won't come out.

842
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,805
You'll have to cut your hair.

843
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,266
What? Cut our hair?

844
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,768
I can't. It'll cramp my style.

845
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,353
Will you stay like this forever then?

846
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,606
One of you has to lose the bangs

847
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,066
if you're both to go free.

848
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,819
It can't be helped. Cut yours.

849
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,321
What? Hey.

850
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,699
I run an online mall
and a model for that mall.

851
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,493
What am I to do without my hair?

852
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,827
Should I cut mine then?

853
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,704
These are all the bangs I have.

854
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,248
How am I to go to work
and do interviews then?

855
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,167
I don't care. I won't cut mine.

856
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,461
I'd rather die than cut my hair.

857
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,921
It's your fault, you cut yours.

858
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,423
Why is it my fault? No, cut your hair.

859
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,258
You're such a nuisance.

860
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,968
Who is it now?

861
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,553
It's my superior.

862
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,097
Hello?

863
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,724
I got the file you sent.

864
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,477
Can you come over to my place?

865
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,145
What? Right now?

866
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,440
I'm in a kind of bind.

867
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,193
I don't care. Get here in 30 minutes.

868
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,820
Wait. Hello?

869
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,406
This is crazy.

870
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,283
-What is it?
-I don't know.

871
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,826
She wants me to come over.

872
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,662
Cut your hair right now.

873
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,830
Why should I? You're the one in a hurry.

874
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,542
I have nothing to lose.

875
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,960
Oh, you don't?

876
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,211
You won't give in?

877
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,589
Hey, hey.

878
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,133
It hurts. What are you doing?

879
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,808
Where are our board games?

880
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,434
Angela wants to play. Do you want in?

881
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,644
No thanks.

882
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,854
-Me neither.
-Okay then.

883
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,235
Doo-sik.

884
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,737
-Are you really okay?
-What?

885
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,076
-About what?
-Angela.

886
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,911
Did you check on her
before getting together?

887
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,705
-What do you mean?
-You know,

888
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,290
she's so pretty.

889
00:47:56,373 --> 00:48:00,210
It doesn't make sense
that she doesn't have a boyfriend.

890
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,045
Think about it.

891
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,840
There's this really pretty woman.

892
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,717
Would guys have left her alone?

893
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,304
That's right. That's just impossible.

894
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,764
Are you saying she could be a two-timer?

895
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,976
I'm not saying that's for sure,

896
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,854
but when you're traveling you say
you don't have a boyfriend when you do

897
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:22,774
and you want to cheat
and things like that.

898
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,276
Yes, yes.

899
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,154
Isn't that what everyone does
when traveling?

900
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,073
Should I ask her if she has a boyfriend?

901
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,075
I guess you could.

902
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:50,177
I was just concerned for him.

903
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,013
Me too. I don't want him to get hurt.

904
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,358
Angela, I'm sorry to have to ask this.

905
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,069
Do you have a boyfriend in Ukraine?

906
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,237
Ask her for me, Hanako.

907
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,530
Okay.

908
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,533
She doesn't. You're her first.

909
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,411
She's pretty and naive, too.

910
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,580
I can't stand her.

911
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,418
Really? I'm your first?

912
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,755
-Yes.
-That's a relief. That's great.

913
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:29,966
What?

914
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,677
She doesn't have a boyfriend

915
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,263
and you're the first guy she ever dated?

916
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,973
Yes.

917
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,226
I'm her first love.

918
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,561
Really? That's great.

919
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,896
Yeah.

920
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,314
That's great.

921
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,733
Good for you. Congratulations.

922
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,110
Thanks.

923
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,778
Doo-sik.

924
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,114
Do you have to give us that look?

925
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,658
Do you know that look's really offensive?

926
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,994
Is it? Sorry, I'll be more careful.

927
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,624
Silence!

928
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,252
Can you watch your footsteps?

929
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,754
Your footsteps are so loud.

930
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,757
-They get on my nerves.
-Do they?

931
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,426
Sorry, I'll be more careful.

932
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,654
We're here. Get out.

933
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,614
Get out on my side.

934
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,534
That door doesn't open
from the inside. Get out.

935
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,120
You never give in, do you?

936
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,705
Will you wait a bit?

937
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,915
What are you doing?

938
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,460
Are you actually trying to retaliate?

939
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,295
Not at all.

940
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,673
Something happened, you see.

941
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,384
Whatever. This is mine.

942
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,927
Exchange it at the department store.

943
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,429
-What?
-I have

944
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,139
an important appointment this evening.

945
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,769
I had entrails and soju late last night

946
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,728
and it doesn't fit.

947
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,231
I called the store.
You just have to exchange it.

948
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,649
Okay.

949
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,028
Go on. There's no time. Get going.

950
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,533
What is wrong with her?

951
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,202
Why is she telling you to do that?

952
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,038
I don't know. Let's just go.

953
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,708
Hey, talk before you walk. It hurts.

954
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,380
I'm her first love. This is incredible.

955
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,507
Isn't it?

956
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,424
It is.

957
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,760
Good for you, Doo-sik.

958
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,637
But...

959
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,931
will you be okay?

960
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,935
-What is it this time?
-An overseas relationship

961
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,938
is really hard to maintain.

962
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,898
That's right.

963
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,441
It's exhausting

964
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,320
and when someone else comforts you,
you fall for them.

965
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,613
That's what happens.

966
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,490
Isn't that what always happens?

967
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,116
Is it?

968
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,536
I should go and ask.

969
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,082
She's an exchange student.

970
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,042
If she's willing to stay,

971
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,336
do you think we'll end up getting married?

972
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,587
Maybe.

973
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,674
-That is just great.
-It is.

974
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,009
I can't believe this.

975
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,054
You know what, Doo-sik?

976
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,556
What about your parents?

977
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,307
-My parents?
-Yes.

978
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,393
You're dating a foreigner.

979
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,355
Our Confucianism-based culture
is still prejudiced towards it.

980
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,440
Do you think your parents

981
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,985
will allow you to date Angela?

982
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,653
That's right.

983
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,531
Everyone around me would object.
Isn't that always the case?

984
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,159
You're right. I didn't think about that.

985
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,373
I've never heard my parents
sound so overjoyed before.

986
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,918
I can't believe they're already
calling her their daughter-in-law.

987
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,671
Wow. Good for you.

988
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,966
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, Doo-sik.

989
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,134
Thanks.

990
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,221
Doo-sik, can you not show your gums
when you smile?

991
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,681
It's really disgusting!

992
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,266
Is it?

993
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,809
Sorry, I'll be careful.

994
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,770
Doo-sik, can you not

995
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,856
flare your nostrils when you laugh?

996
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,900
It looks like they're mocking me!

997
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,444
Does it? Sorry, I'll be careful.

998
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,032
Oh, Angela and I are going
to have some beers.

999
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,700
I'll be upstairs.

1000
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,079
Those fingers...

1001
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,876
-My stomach.
-Mine hurts, too.

1002
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,132
Here's your outfit.

1003
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,134
What took you so long?

1004
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,595
Can't you even do this properly?

1005
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,431
-Sorry.
-Ouch.

1006
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,267
Forget it. Get lost.

1007
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,519
What a nuisance.

1008
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,649
I don't believe this.

1009
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,319
We did her errand
and she didn't even thank us.

1010
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,696
Leave it. Let's go.

1011
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,741
Hey. You always fight me.

1012
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,534
Why do you give into her?

1013
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,328
This isn't like you at all.

1014
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,705
What can I do? She's my superior at work.

1015
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,792
I took her on thousands of times
in my mind already.

1016
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,960
Did you?

1017
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,129
If only you could, would you take her on?

1018
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,422
So what?

1019
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,299
What are you planning?

1020
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,302
Don't. You'll just ruin my career.

1021
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,805
Don't worry. We won't be found out.

1022
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,766
Where's the nearest convenience store?

1023
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,017
A convenience store?

1024
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,771
There she is.

1025
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,650
Darling. I'm about to leave.

1026
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,611
Okay, see you soon. Bye.

1027
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,532
What's this?

1028
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,411
What's going on?

1029
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,328
Why...

1030
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,664
Oh dear.

1031
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,294
Why won't my hand come off?

1032
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,506
Hey! Who did this?

1033
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,553
Do you think it'll come off easily?

1034
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,222
That's superglue.

1035
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,183
Is this okay?

1036
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,395
You bet it is. You sow what you reap.

1037
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,481
You mean you reap what you sow?

1038
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,025
You're so ignorant.

1039
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,569
Why is that important?

1040
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,987
We taught her a lesson.

1041
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,072
Go on and drive.

1042
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,741
We really can't get caught.

1043
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,784
We won't get caught.

1044
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,078
Lean over a bit and she won't see us.

1045
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,957
-Even so.
-Hey, I bought 20 liters of water

1046
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,710
and put a lot of work into it. Step on it.

1047
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,129
I don't care now.

1048
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:46,134
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

1049
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,765
Duck.

1050
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,277
Who are you?

1051
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,571
Hey!

1052
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,619
Good riddance.

1053
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,580
That's why you should be nice.

1054
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,833
I feel so good. That was great.

1055
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,919
Don't you feel much better?

1056
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,337
I do. Thanks.

1057
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,422
Can I put cucumbers on my face then?

1058
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,757
No, never.

1059
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:29,594
Hey, I helped you get revenge
and you won't pay me back?

1060
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,638
I will pay you back.

1061
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,056
You know I hate being in debt.

1062
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,141
What'll you do?

1063
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,571
Why do you both have long faces?

1064
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,989
Did something bad happen?

1065
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,825
I don't know.

1066
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,953
I suddenly feel so unmotivated.

1067
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,955
Me too.

1068
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,874
I suddenly feel miserable,
have no appetite,

1069
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,709
and feel utterly unmotivated.

1070
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,254
I wonder why.

1071
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,714
-I'm back.
-I'm home.

1072
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:07,924
Hi.

1073
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,551
Hello.

1074
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,261
You've been out for...

1075
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,433
Seo-jin, what happened to your hair?

1076
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,186
What is it? I have no energy.

1077
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,861
My goodness.

1078
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,072
Where were you, my love?

1079
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,991
Who wants a banana?

1080
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,993
Stop it.

1081
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,911
Why did you turn into Chu Sa-rang?

1082
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:37,829
What happened?

1083
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,581
Something happened.

1084
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,001
I don't owe you anything now.

1085
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,836
Okay, okay. I got it.

1086
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,089
You never give in, do you?

1087
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,051
Come on, come on.

1088
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,636
That sounds like Doo-sik.

1089
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,013
Why is he so upbeat?

1090
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,057
He and Angela started dating today.

1091
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,351
-They get on so well.
-Really?

1092
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,228
Good for Doo-sik.

1093
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,939
Why do I have indigestion?

1094
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,941
My stomach hurts.

1095
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,736
Why does my tummy suddenly hurt?

1096
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,155
Oh dear... My stomach...

1097
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,823
What's wrong?

1098
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,370
Cheers. Drink up.

1099
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,914
Bottom's up.

1100
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,627
I feel sleepy.

1101
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,545
Let's stop drinking and go to bed.

1102
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,757
Let's drink a bit more.
We're all having fun.

1103
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,760
As if. Fun, my ass.

1104
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,595
"As if"? What?

1105
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,806
Hanako. Who taught you Korean?

1106
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,683
You learned all the bad words.

1107
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,935
I need to pee.

1108
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,686
I'm off to the toilet.

1109
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:45,855
Tell Angela.

1110
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,857
Is it pee or poop?

1111
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,400
Must I tell you?

1112
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,570
We need to know how long we must wait.

1113
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,072
Jeez. Okay, fine.

1114
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,532
I need to pee, okay?

1115
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:56,991
Okay.

1116
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,214
What did she say? It's so hard to pee.

1117
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,049
Angela, wait just a little bit.

1118
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,217
I'll be right back.

1119
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,011
You guys go on having fun.

1120
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,426
What if I end up actually marrying Angela?

1121
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,721
Wait, then should we have
a Ukrainian wedding

1122
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,514
and a Korean tradition wedding?

1123
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,599
A total of two weddings?

1124
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,142
What about the guests?

1125
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,935
Should I charter a plane?

1126
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,812
I don't know what to do.

1127
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,732
Angela, my Angela.

1128
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,699
Gosh.

1129
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,035
Why do you look so terrible?

1130
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,996
I had insomnia
and couldn't sleep all night.

1131
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,081
Not a wink.

1132
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,668
I guess I was stressed out about my shoot.

1133
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,046
The insomnia's getting bad.

1134
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,048
Really?

1135
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,549
That's terrible.

1136
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,095
How strange. Where is she?

1137
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,597
What is the problem?

1138
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,890
Are you looking for someone?

1139
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,060
When I got up this morning,
Angela was gone.

1140
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:47,977
Her luggage is gone.

1141
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,689
Hey, Hanako. Did you see Angela?

1142
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,024
Angela?

1143
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,943
She left early this morning
with her things.

1144
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,153
What?

1145
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,072
What do you mean she left?

1146
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,575
Yesterday, Angela and Mark
stayed up together

1147
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,244
until early morning.

1148
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,581
-Things got a bit odd between them.
-What?

1149
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,000
Then this morning they both were gone.

1150
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:16,714
Hey, what do you mean? Hey.

1151
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,759
Then did Angela and Mark

1152
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,719
run off together?

1153
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,763
Oh dear.

1154
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,766
The two ran off together.

1155
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,434
They can communicate and he's handsome.

1156
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,396
Isn't that how all couples get together?

1157
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,233
No way. It can't be.

1158
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,734
Angela. Angela.

1159
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,070
Angela. Angela!

1160
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,322
Oh dear.

1161
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,950
I feel sorry for poor Doo-sik.

1162
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,578
I really hoped he'd get a girl this time.

1163
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,372
Me too.

1164
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,334
I prayed all night that Doo-sik

1165
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,086
would finally get to date someone.

1166
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:59,549
I feel so sorry for him.

1167
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,429
What?

1168
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,265
They have insomnia
and they just fell asleep?

1169
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,728
They're even smiling in their sleep.

1170
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,191
Are they enjoying nice dreams?

1171
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,178
A fan? I have a fan, too?

1172
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,971
He's grinning from ear to ear.

1173
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,431
Do you know when our last date was?

1174
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:49,432
Shall we watch a movie?

1175
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:50,933
Really? You promised.

1176
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,351
Why won't he call?

1177
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,604
-Joon-ki.
-What are you doing here?

1178
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,189
I changed all the photos to mine.

1179
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,192
Why do you tease Doo-sik so much?

1180
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:02,111
Nothing's more fun than teasing Doo-sik.

1181
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,905
Doo-sik, did you fall for Ah-young?

1182
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,698
Ask her out if you like her.

1183
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,034
I want to ask Ah-young to date me.

1184
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,535
Isn't this too harsh?

1185
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,537
You two look like newlyweds.

1186
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,040
How far did you go with her, Dong-goo?

1187
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,249
You kissed, right?

1188
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:19,086
Give up the cheap idea that love is
measured by levels of physical contact.

1189
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,839
I want to kiss her. I want to kiss her.

1190
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,925
Dong-goo, do you not hear me?

1191
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,969
There's actually something
I want to tell you.

1192
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:27,970
-What?
-Yoon-ah.

1193
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,181
Can you kiss me?
