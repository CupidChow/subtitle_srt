1
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,631
Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah!

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,718
-You can't enter, sir. It's dangerous.
-Move. My friend's inside.

3
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,471
-It's too dangerous.
-I don't care! Get out of my way!

4
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,891
Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah!

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,768
Dong-goo.

6
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,611
What's the matter? Why are you here?

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,538
What's wrong, Dong-goo?

8
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,916
You're not hurt, are you?

9
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,834
You're okay, right?

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,336
I'm fine...

11
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,507
but can you please let go of me?

12
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,554
Did you come

13
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,139
because you were worried about me?

14
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,684
Sorry? No, I...

15
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,229
I was worried about our neighbors

16
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,105
and you happened to be here, so...

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,274
Why did you hug me then?

18
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,276
Well...

19
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:55,281
I have a habit of hugging
when I'm worried about something.

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,827
Oh, ma'am!

21
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,411
Are you okay?

22
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,705
Hey, Dong-goo. Why...

23
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,334
Sir, are you all right?

24
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:11,256
Mr. Policeman, I'm sorry
for interfering with your duties.

25
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,966
Mr. Firefighter!

26
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,051
Mr. Kim!

27
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
Thank you for your hard work, sir!

28
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,099
For goodness' sake.

29
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,853
You have a heart condition, so it was
acting up a bit. And you call that fate?

30
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,106
That's enough.
I'm worried enough as it is.

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,025
What's wrong with you?

32
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,528
I hurt myself
when I broke the dish earlier.

33
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,739
You should've been careful.
Where's Dong-goo?

34
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,618
Something must've happened.
He ran out of here like a madman.

35
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,620
That's right. Did you hear about
the fire at the supermarket?

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,289
-Huh?
-What?

37
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,249
-The supermarket in our neighborhood?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,086
Yoon-ah went to get groceries.
I wonder if she's all right.

39
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,296
Yoon-ah went where?

40
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,798
Call her. Call her quickly.

41
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,757
We're home.

42
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,052
Yoon-ah, are you okay?
I heard there was a fire.

43
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,681
I'm okay. I stopped by
to get some chicken on my way

44
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,016
and that's when it happened.

45
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,267
Really?

46
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,685
What a relief.

47
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,230
I heard you ran out of here like a madman.

48
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,648
Were you looking for Yoon-ah?

49
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,651
No.

50
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,905
Our neighbors were on the news
and I got worried.

51
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,657
You know I'm BFFs
with the community chairperson.

52
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,451
-Since when?
-Huh?

53
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,328
Since forever.

54
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,373
Dang, I was so scared

55
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,500
my BFF would get hurt!

56
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,510
I've gone insane!

57
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,138
I must really like her.

58
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,806
I must be out of my mind.

59
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,476
Why did I go there?

60
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,437
Dong-goo, come and have some chicken.

61
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,272
That's okay.

62
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,608
I'm not in the mood for chicken.

63
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,485
Come on, now.

64
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,446
Don't be like that. Come join us.

65
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,450
I said I don't want any.

66
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,622
We'll put some aside for you.
Have it later then.

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,637
I'm crazy. I've completely lost it.

68
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,555
Why'd she grab me?

69
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,516
This is insane!

70
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,934
PRETTY WOMAN

71
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,310
What do I do?

72
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,063
I was going to eat that one!

73
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,564
Give it back!

74
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,857
Stop!

75
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,360
-Where's Dong-goo?
-He doesn't want any.

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,820
Is something wrong?

77
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,738
He's in bed with the covers
pulled over his head.

78
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,991
What? He has covers
pulled over his head?

79
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,952
He's in sulking mode.

80
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,372
Don't worry. That's his M.O.
when he's sulking.

81
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,418
Sol must be awake.

82
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,419
You guys eat first.

83
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,173
What the hell?

84
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,426
You just ate a drumstick.
You're taking another one?

85
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,637
Well, I don't like breast meat.

86
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,391
Does that mean you get both drumsticks?
Do you even have a conscience?

87
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,518
All this over a drumstick?

88
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,729
Forget it. I won't eat it.

89
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,063
-Then don't!
-I'll eat it.

90
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,607
-What the hell?
-Seriously?

91
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,235
Look at her holding onto that drumstick
till the very end.

92
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,613
Shameless bitch.
She's in a league all her own.

93
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,366
I almost forgot. Seo-jin,
I have to pay my credit card bill.

94
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,868
Can you loan me some money?

95
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,953
Do I look like I have money to spare?
I don't have a dime.

96
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,956
Good for you. You must be so proud.

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
What's that you're looking at?

98
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,711
Isn't this a mukbang program?

99
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,713
Why would you watch such a thing?

100
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,923
-It's entertaining.
-Sure it is.

101
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,884
I don't understand these people.

102
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,511
Why show the world what you're eating?

103
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,097
What a bunch of pathetic losers.

104
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,932
Pathetic?

105
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,227
Do you have any idea how much money
these BJs make?

106
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,440
The popular ones make upwards
of 100 million won per year.

107
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,610
One hundred million?
All they do is freaking eat!

108
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,694
Yeah, 100 million won.

109
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,911
One hundred million.

110
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,622
Where's Doo-sik's laptop?

111
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,336
Hey.

112
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,004
Doo-sik, where's your laptop?

113
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,214
Last time I saw it--

114
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,965
Why do you look like that?

115
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,470
Some guys were hitting on Mal-geum.

116
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,930
What?

117
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,266
So you got into a fight with them?

118
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,601
A gentle guy like you?

119
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,396
I got so mad seeing Mal-geum cry.

120
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,816
I don't know why I did it.

121
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,192
Why do you think?

122
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,693
You have feelings for her, that's why.

123
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,280
-Is that why?
-No shit.

124
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,158
Who would get beat up over a girl
he doesn't even like?

125
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,246
Just tell her how you feel already.

126
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,165
Tell her how I feel?
No way. It's too soon.

127
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,709
Don't you know love is all about timing?

128
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,505
One minute-- no, one second
can make a difference.

129
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,132
What will you do if some other guy

130
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,634
sweeps Mal-geum off her feet
while you're being all hesitant?

131
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,428
That can't happen!

132
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,764
How do I tell her how I feel?

133
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,433
What do you mean, how?

134
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,227
Be straightforward and driven!

135
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,230
Straightforward and driven?
Tell me how!

136
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,566
Jeez, you're a real beginner at this.

137
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,278
Look carefully.

138
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,780
There was man named Lee Joon-ki.

139
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,240
This is what he's like.

140
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,076
When he see a girl
that he likes, he walks.

141
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,579
He keeps on walking and walking straight.

142
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,164
The Earth is round so he's bound
to walk into her.

143
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,125
So what does he do? He keeps walking
until he's standing in front of her.

144
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,335
Then what does he do? Confidently...

145
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,045
he grabs her arm.

146
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,089
Then he takes action.
He pushes her into a wall...

147
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,094
and tells her how he feels.
How? Like this.

148
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,016
Because it was a good day.
Because it was a bad day.

149
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,602
-I'm sorry.
-Huh?

150
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,936
I love you.

151
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,898
I... love you.

152
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,608
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

153
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,692
Are you a couple now?

154
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,404
-What, couple?
-No way.

155
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,532
You're talking nonsense. What the hell?

156
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,452
Please continue.

157
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:19,123
Whether you date
or get married is... goodness.

158
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,919
Why'd he go like this?

159
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,879
What is he talking about?
Did you get it?

160
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,632
Walk towards her. Keep walking.

161
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,136
When will they ever grow up?

162
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,222
I'm plenty upset as it is.

163
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,517
-Dong-goo, you're up.
-Oh gosh.

164
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,729
-Why are you so startled?
-Me? I wasn't startled.

165
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,941
You're hungry.

166
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,693
Let me heat up the chicken for you.
It'll just be a moment.

167
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,914
I actually like that woman? Why?

168
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,959
She's not good at her job,
nor is she pretty.

169
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,710
She's not even cute--

170
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,345
She's cute.

171
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,972
She is.

172
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,849
Has she always been this cute?

173
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,352
What are you staring at?

174
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,483
I wasn't staring. You silly woman.

175
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,196
Why are you so irritated?

176
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,614
Are you mad at me about something?

177
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,741
No.

178
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,952
Then what is it?

179
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,205
Is it because...

180
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,879
of the stain on your camera bag?

181
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,716
How do you know about that?

182
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,761
That was you?

183
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,764
I spilled the sauce while cooking.

184
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,225
Don't worry about it.
It's not because of that.

185
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,893
Then is it because the lens cover broke?

186
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,812
How do you know about--?

187
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,064
Don't tell me that was you, too.

188
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:12,028
I was cleaning up the sauce
and stepped on it.

189
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,906
I'm really sorry.

190
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,579
Forgive me, will you? Please?

191
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:25,082
Forgive me, Dong-goo. I'm so sorry.

192
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,960
-I'm sorry--
-Stop! I told you I'm not mad!

193
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,630
Dong-goo!

194
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,259
What do I do?
He must really be mad.

195
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,187
She's cute.
She's so freaking cute.

196
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,024
I almost forgave her
for something she didn't do.

197
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,028
How can someone be so cute
when they're apologizing?

198
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:58,908
Gosh.

199
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,661
What are you doing here?

200
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,081
Huh? It's nothing.

201
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,957
Shall I clean up?

202
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,169
What's wrong with him?

203
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,713
And why is his face so flushed?

204
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,513
ZERO VIEWERS

205
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,308
Joon-ki. Lend me your shaver.

206
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,976
Goodness gracious.

207
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,187
Is that the only thing you need from me?

208
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,980
Mine's broken.

209
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,649
It's over there.

210
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,110
-What is that?
-I'm going to try doing a mukbang.

211
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,403
I have to clear my credit card debt.

212
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:40,116
Trying to make money by hosting a mukbang?
You think anyone can be a BJ?

213
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,537
Don't you worry.
I can eat as well as the next guy.

214
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,250
Why isn't anyone coming in?

215
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,754
Someone's here!

216
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,299
Hello, Gangnam Parvenu!

217
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:02,263
Bursting onto the mukbang scene,
I am the pretty boy,

218
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,557
BJ Joon!

219
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,518
Shut it and start eating.

220
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,311
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,315
You must be quite impatient, Mr. Parvenu.

222
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,528
Who does he think he's talking to?

223
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,241
Yes, Mr. Parvenu.

224
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,578
I'll get started on this plate
of fried chicken, then!

225
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,752
It's chickeny.

226
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,466
-So crispy.
-You suck at this.

227
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,722
This is actually my first mukbang.

228
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,059
Okay then, Mr. Parvenu.

229
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,061
I'll eat it really well this time.

230
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,114
You're delicious, aren't you?

231
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,163
Hi Dong-goo, how was the gig?

232
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,457
Dong-goo?

233
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,375
What's up with him?

234
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,795
I think I'm the one

235
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,256
-he's mad at.
-What?

236
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,092
I spilled some sauce on his camera bag

237
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,427
and broke the lens cover.

238
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,389
What? You should've been careful!

239
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,684
That camera is his most prized possession.

240
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,896
Really? What'll I do?

241
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,274
How do I make him feel better?

242
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,319
I'm not sure-- oh, right.

243
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,571
-There is one way.
-What is it?

244
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,948
Acting cute.

245
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,533
He may seem cold,

246
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,825
but that's his weakness.

247
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,911
Acting cute?

248
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,339
I can't even look at her anymore.

249
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,634
She seems cuter every time I look at her.

250
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,220
Dong-goo.

251
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,013
Dong-goo!

252
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,558
Yoon-ah was a very bad girl.

253
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,518
Can you please forgive me?

254
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,229
Pretty please?

255
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,531
What the heck?

256
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,533
Why is he like that?

257
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,828
Why do you think?
Because you weren't cute at all.

258
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,455
He usually falls for the slightest hint
of cuteness.

259
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,749
You must really be bad at it.

260
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,001
Really?

261
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,628
I thought I did pretty well.

262
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,338
Was I that bad?

263
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,466
Ahh, she's so freaking cute!

264
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,427
How can she sound so cute?

265
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,139
I thought my heart was going to stop.

266
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,350
Oh, my God!

267
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
What are you doing here?

268
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,314
Well, I was just...

269
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,190
Do you have something to say to me?

270
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,736
No.

271
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,242
Why is he acting so strange?

272
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,953
How do you feel?

273
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,497
Look at your lips.

274
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,501
They're all busted. Those scumbags.

275
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,130
It's okay. I'm fine, so don't worry.

276
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,301
Anyway, we start shooting tomorrow.
It'll get really hectic.

277
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,636
Yeah.

278
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,307
I must've overdone it during my workout
this morning.

279
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,768
You work out? What do you do?

280
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,311
It's called Krav Maga.

281
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,647
It's so fun that I lose track of time.

282
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,066
Krav... I see.

283
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,528
This is nuts.

284
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,031
I want to tell her how I feel,
but I can't put the words together.

285
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,534
Right, a man must be
straightforward and driven!

286
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,578
Confess like a man. Do it!

287
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,955
Hey, Mal-geum!

288
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,623
Yeah?

289
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,845
Oh my God! I'm so sorry!
Are you okay, Doo-sik?

290
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,686
I'm fine. What was that?

291
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,521
How did you do that?

292
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,399
That's what Krav Maga is.
Lethal contact combat.

293
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,650
What Won Bin did in
The Man From Nowhere.

294
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,654
You're saying Krav Maga is a martial art?
Not something like Pilates?

295
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,408
Yeah. So you can't just grab me like that.
I'm trained to react automatically.

296
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,494
Huh? Okay. I understand.

297
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,378
Hello? Yes, sir.

298
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,798
I'll be right there. Bye.

299
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,428
I have to go to my fan meeting.

300
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,431
A fan meeting? You go to fan meetings?

301
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,182
Can I come, too?

302
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,852
Huh? That's a bit...

303
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,895
I have something to say to you.

304
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,444
Cherry! Cherry!

305
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,446
We're here. This is it.

306
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,655
I see.

307
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,700
Enjoy your fan meeting.
I'll be at a coffee shop.

308
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,119
Mr. Bong?

309
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,912
Hello, sir.

310
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,372
What brings you here?

311
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,251
You came to attend Cherry's fan meeting.

312
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,463
-Sorry? No, that's not why I'm here.
-Thanks for coming. Let's go inside.

313
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,131
I'll escort you
to the best seat in the house.

314
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,883
No, it's really fine--

315
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,398
We'll now kick off Cherry's fan meeting.

316
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,402
Let's welcome her with a big cheer!

317
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,112
Whoo-hoo!

318
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,076
Cherry! Cherry!

319
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,078
Cherry!

320
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,164
Cherry! Cherry!

321
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,541
Cherry!

322
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:09,463
Cherry! Cherry!

323
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,227
Here. Do you see this bone?

324
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,603
All bones here.

325
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,979
One chicken--

326
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,565
One chicken down!

327
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,192
Now I'll...

328
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,069
move onto the second one.

329
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,488
Before I eat the second chicken,

330
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,532
those who want to send star balloons

331
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,283
can go crazy.

332
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,661
Time for star balloons!

333
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,917
Okay, then. If there are no star balloons,
I'll move on.

334
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,421
Now I will start eating
the second chicken.

335
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,466
Wait, are you throwing that away?

336
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,637
You mean this, sir?

337
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:03,809
These are the bones
from the first chicken I ate.

338
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,187
One hundred star balloons
if you eat the bones.

339
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,108
You'll give me 100 star balloons

340
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,361
if I eat the bones?

341
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,701
Hey, I'm streaming live!

342
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,829
Why are you considering it?

343
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,622
Don't tell me you're actually
going to eat those.

344
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,707
Of course!

345
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,667
One hundred star balloons
is the equivalent of 10,000 won!

346
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,295
Still, how can you eat chicken bones?

347
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,754
I have credit card debt to clear!

348
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,840
I would eat chicken feathers

349
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,092
if it means I won't end up a delinquent.

350
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,012
-You'll die!
-Let go.

351
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,972
Ah, yes.

352
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,559
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Parvenu.
"Hairy" wouldn't leave me alone.

353
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,312
Now we'll begin BJ Joon's

354
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,023
mukbang for chicken bones!

355
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,484
Wow! I can smell the calcium
and magnesium.

356
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,862
I feel healthier already!

357
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,030
Here we go.

358
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,117
Seriously...

359
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,797
Unbelievable.
He's really eating chicken bones!

360
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,424
How can he eat chicken bones?

361
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,717
Does he have no shame?

362
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,637
Guys, let's study hard

363
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,388
so we don't end up like him.

364
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,185
Look.

365
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,478
I swallowed it. It's gone.

366
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,730
So Mr. Parvenu.

367
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,690
Where are my star balloons?

368
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,235
Okay, fine.

369
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,031
GANGNAM PARVENU HAS SENT YOU
100 STAR BALLOONS!

370
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,449
That's 100!

371
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,701
Thank you, Mr. Parvenu!

372
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,996
Mr. Parvenu-- no, boss. Thank you!

373
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,374
I love you, boss!

374
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,291
I got 100!

375
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,307
He's going to get himself into trouble.
Goodness.

376
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,184
What's going on?

377
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,186
What are you doing, Yoon-ah?

378
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,939
Oh, I...

379
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,902
Is he still mad at you?

380
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
Even after doing what I said?

381
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,282
No, I haven't sent it yet.

382
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,117
Why not? That'll do the trick.

383
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,703
That's worked on everyone I know.

384
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,037
Really?

385
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,915
Fine. Then I'll really send it.

386
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,333
Do it.

387
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,588
I haven't been able to eat all day
because of Yoon-ah.

388
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,720
It's Yoon-ah. What did she send?

389
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,431
-Do you want to be forgiven that badly?
-Yes.

390
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,890
Then say, "Forgive me."

391
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,601
Dong-goo. Please forgive me.

392
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,396
-Cuter.
-Forgive me, please.

393
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,314
Now be lovable.

394
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,316
Will you please forgive me?

395
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,233
Be adorable.

396
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
Forgive me, please.

397
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,320
Be tough.

398
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,155
Please forgive me!

399
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,701
What, is he mad?

400
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,494
What is it?

401
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,710
I have to take this during my show?

402
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,795
You're eating ramyun?

403
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,964
That looks all chewy and nice.

404
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,050
Hey!

405
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,217
No, that's mine!

406
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,178
That's for my heart condition!

407
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,472
-Dong-goo!
-What the heck?

408
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,223
He must still be mad.

409
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,142
Let's just give up.

410
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,353
You suck big time at acting cute.
A big, fat zero.

411
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,524
Was I really that horrible?

412
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,531
She's so cute, I can't stand it!

413
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,200
She's like a cute little doll.

414
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,077
Thank goodness
there was heart medication nearby.

415
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,163
I could've died from a heart attack!

416
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,581
Hey, Dong-goo.

417
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,001
What's with you?
Just tell me what you want to say.

418
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,837
I don't... have anything to say to you.

419
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,926
What on earth is wrong with him?

420
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,054
Hold on.

421
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,768
Is he... still not over me?

422
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,980
Up next is the highlight
of today's fan meeting, the lucky draw!

423
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,776
Let's first introduce
today's special prize!

424
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,194
What is it?

425
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,947
Today's special prize is none other than

426
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,573
the bikini that Cherry wore

427
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,160
in Bikini Investigation Unit 3!

428
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,920
Let's all calm down.

429
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,382
Please take a look at the lucky ticket
you received on your way in.

430
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,886
Cherry will draw the ticket herself.

431
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,556
BIKINI INVESTIGATION UNIT 3
FAN MEETING

432
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,025
-I have 30!
-Cherry!

433
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:08,238
The lucky winner of Cherry's bikini is...

434
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,282
number 38!

435
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,036
Where is 38?

436
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,122
Who is it?

437
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,498
Where are you?

438
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,958
Who has number 38?

439
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,334
No one has it!

440
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,794
Number 38.

441
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,676
It's me?

442
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:34,055
Do over! Do over!

443
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,934
Thirty-eight! He's right here!

444
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,938
There he is.

445
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,815
Please come forward.

446
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,358
-Thirty-eight!
-Congratulations.

447
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,360
Please give him a big hand.

448
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,707
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PRIZE
CHERRY

449
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,170
Hello, everyone.

450
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,631
BJ Joon will now begin

451
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:11,509
a mukbang for all the bones in the world.

452
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,388
I've prepared a variety of bones today.

453
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,140
Let's start here.

454
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,768
First, we have chicken bones.

455
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,604
Next, pork backbone.

456
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,066
Here we have baby back ribs.

457
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,485
Rockfish bone

458
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,071
and hairtail bone.

459
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,697
This is what we have today.

460
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,866
And today's highlight...

461
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,414
Pig feet bones!

462
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,250
Let's put this aside now.

463
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,544
We'll begin with rockfish bone,

464
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,006
which is known to be tough and sharp.

465
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,716
Let's go!

466
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,933
He's crazy. That punk--

467
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,875
Dong-goo! Dong-goo!

468
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,965
Give it to me. I can do it.

469
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,551
I'll do it. Go back inside.

470
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,845
But I can do it myself.

471
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,138
Dong-goo...

472
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,890
are you still mad at me?

473
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,394
I said I'm not mad at you.

474
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,648
Then why are you acting this way?
Tell me.

475
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,322
See? You can't tell me.

476
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,866
You're mad because of the camera.

477
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,200
Fine!

478
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,538
I was mad at you because of my camera.
But I'm all better now.

479
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,832
So stop worrying, okay?

480
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,417
Are you sure?

481
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:12,756
Thank God.
I've been so worried the past few days.

482
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,051
Dong-goo, I promise I won't make
any mistakes from--

483
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,517
-Jeez.
-I'm so sorry.

484
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,645
I have a bit of a cold, so...

485
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,939
It's okay.

486
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,944
Why are you dressed so lightly?
No wonder you're getting sick!

487
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,654
This is the thickest coat I have.

488
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,616
It's actually quite warm.

489
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,412
I forgot I left the stove on.
I have to go.

490
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,331
Oh, goodness...

491
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,340
BJ JOON'S MUKBANG
FOR ALL THE BONES IN THE WORLD

492
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,467
GANGNAM PARVENU HAS SENT YOU
10 STAR BALLOONS!

493
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,426
Goodness!

494
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,971
Mr. Parvenu! Thank you, boss!

495
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,390
VENUS HAS SENT YOU
20 STAR BALLOONS!

496
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,810
Thank you, Venus!

497
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,438
You've given me so much support
for the rockfish bone.

498
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,067
BJ Joon is beside himself.

499
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,568
Thanks again!

500
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,948
Thanks to your support,

501
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,575
we'll move onto

502
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,997
the king of all bones, the pig foot!

503
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:33,711
Getting star balloons ready.
Dogs love that shit. Ruff!

504
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,802
I'm fine!

505
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,222
I'll start eating now.

506
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,142
Ow, my stomach...

507
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,561
I...

508
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,146
I can do this!

509
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,314
Ow!

510
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,484
I'm dying.

511
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,911
Why did I have to win this?

512
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,372
I can't even throw it away. Jeez.

513
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,129
Sorry I made you wait so long.

514
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,464
It's all right.

515
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,632
You must be freezing. Drink this.

516
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,510
Thanks.

517
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,810
It was pretty embarrassing, wasn't it?

518
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,190
I'm sorry, but that's life for me.

519
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,317
What are you talking about?

520
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:41,905
I didn't start out wanting
to be in this line of work.

521
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,867
I shot a few dramas and movies
in the beginning.

522
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,747
But it didn't work out
and I needed the money.

523
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,458
I told myself it would be a one-time deal.
Somehow, I ended up here.

524
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,336
What's wrong with being
an adult film actress?

525
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,379
Because this isn't my dream.

526
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,676
I want to be in dramas
and movies like before,

527
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,389
but that door has closed
because of people's impressions of me.

528
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,143
It's not too late to quit.

529
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,980
I'm still bound by my contract,
so I have no choice.

530
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,694
I don't know what to do anymore.

531
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,324
Sorry.

532
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,077
I can't stop crying these days.

533
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,995
I almost forgot.

534
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,122
You said you had something to tell me.

535
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:38,878
It's nothing. We can talk another time.
Drink your tea.

536
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,597
So I bought it,
but how do I give it to her?

537
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,185
"This is for you." No, that's not it.

538
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,939
"I picked it up on my way."
No, she'll find out!

539
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,359
Why the hell did I buy this?

540
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,613
What if she catches on that I like her?

541
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,951
Are you all right?

542
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,703
Careful.

543
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,581
What is it? What's wrong?

544
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,541
We were at the ER

545
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,835
because Joon-ki is sick.

546
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,336
The ER?

547
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,588
Where is he hurting?

548
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,797
Please don't tell her.

549
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,967
Well, he ate rockfish bone.

550
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,760
Rockfish bone?

551
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,555
You did that again?

552
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,056
Well...

553
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,769
I'll go tidy up his room.

554
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,854
Okay.

555
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,940
Why did I buy this? I'm such a fool.

556
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,111
Were you home?

557
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,238
Pardon? Yes, I was.

558
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,657
What are you hiding?

559
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,035
The thing is...

560
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,166
Here, Yoon-ah.

561
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,752
He's so heavy.

562
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,754
-Why are there so many people?
-What are you doing, Dong-goo?

563
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,007
Did you buy that for Yoon-ah?

564
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,343
What? No.

565
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,345
I wanted her to give it to Soo-ah
for me but I can do it myself.

566
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,262
Here, Soo-ah.

567
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,433
What is it?

568
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,102
A coat?

569
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,229
Why, all of a sudden?

570
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,648
Because it was pretty.

571
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,151
Guys, I'm sick right now.

572
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,695
Let me lie down, then you can give her
the coat or whatever you want.

573
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,282
Sorry. This way, Joon-ki.

574
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,202
You're so heavy.

575
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,621
I guess I forgot to turn this off.

576
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,669
-What is this?
-Goodness.

577
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:43,962
He's back.

578
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,755
-He must've gone to the hospital.
-There's Hairy again.

579
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,340
What the hell is this?

580
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,008
Why are you so surprised?

581
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,512
Hey. Look at this!

582
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,807
-What's going on?
-Why are there so many people?

583
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,851
Twenty-three thousand four hundred
star balloons?

584
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,187
-Twenty thousand?
-Since each one is worth 100 won,

585
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,481
you have more than 2,000,000 won!

586
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,860
I had less than 200 just now.

587
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,570
What happened?

588
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,574
-Hey Seo-jin?
-Yeah?

589
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,034
Isn't this you?

590
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,245
What? Why am I...

591
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,831
Where's his shaver again?

592
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,961
Here it is.

593
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:26,963
Is that woman shaving?

594
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,172
Is her mustache for real?

595
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,465
Today's show is legendary.

596
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,843
-They must both be high.
-Hilarious.

597
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,470
Now it's a shaving show?

598
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,055
What the hell is this?

599
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,684
I was being broadcast live?
While shaving?

600
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,185
Thanks, Chewbacca.

601
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,355
Thanks to you I won't become
a credit delinquent!

602
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,609
That's not what's important, you jerk!
The whole country saw me shave.

603
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,530
What are you going to do about this?
What will you do?

604
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,576
I didn't do it on purpose.
Who told you to come in here to shave?

605
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,078
Huh? Looks like someone's coming in.

606
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,834
So I bought it,
but how do I give it to her?

607
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,586
No, that's not it.

608
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,841
"I picked it up on my way."
No, she'll find out!

609
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,553
What if she catches on that I like her?

610
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,892
What? Why?

611
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,604
What the hell?

612
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,653
Hold on. What were you saying?

613
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,530
What did you mean,
"What if she catches on"?

614
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,908
Well...

615
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,452
-Do you...
-The thing is...

616
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,953
...still have feelings for Soo-ah?

617
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,330
Huh?

618
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,540
No, you're mistaken.

619
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,959
There's even proof!

620
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,920
No, that's not what this is.

621
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,923
Dong-goo, can we talk outside?

622
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,176
What?

623
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,805
Okay, sure.

624
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,434
Why does she...?

625
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,523
He's such a pushover.

626
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,695
You know it's over between us.

627
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,780
What?

628
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,576
-Of course I know. I know very well.
-Then why would you do this?

629
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,912
Is it that difficult to get over me?

630
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,289
No, I can.

631
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,874
I'll get over you. I'll do it right now.

632
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,669
Let's get over Soo-ah,
let's erase Soo-ah.

633
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,838
Don't worry about it, okay? I'm off.

634
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,717
Dong-goo,
what are we going to do with you?

635
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,977
It is pretty.

636
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,487
So what if he can't get over me?
He doesn't even know my size.

637
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,074
What are we going to do with you,
Dong-goo?

638
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,494
What are we going to do with you,
Soo-ah?

639
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,205
Is this why you moved in?

640
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,707
To get back together with Dong-goo?

641
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,751
You're wrong.
I have a conscience too, you know.

642
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,171
I can't bear seeing you back together,

643
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,215
so do whatever it takes
to make him give up.

644
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,133
Got it?

645
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,051
Okay.

646
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,347
Jeez.

647
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,437
Soo-ah.

648
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,939
Why'd you want to meet outside?

649
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,735
Well... I gave it some thought,

650
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,946
but I don't think I can accept
your feelings.

651
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,823
This again?

652
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,410
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

653
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,914
How can I not?
You shouldn't have let me find out.

654
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,042
That's why I prepared something.

655
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,169
Prepared what?

656
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,253
A blind date.

657
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,381
What? A blind date?

658
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,510
You want to set me up with someone?

659
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,387
There she is. Ye-rin, over here.

660
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,016
Hi... Hello.

661
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,437
This is Lee Ye-rin.

662
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,190
This is my friend, Kang Dong-goo.

663
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,942
Hello, I've heard so much about you.

664
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,528
Nice to meet you.
I wonder what she said...

665
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,697
Good luck, Dong-goo.

666
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,574
-What?
-I'm leaving.

667
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,326
Where are you going?

668
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,037
Hey, Soo-ah.

669
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,830
She really left.

670
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:42,176
DYING YOUNG

671
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,303
I'm back.

672
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,222
-Hi.
-What?

673
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,057
Why are you back so soon?
What about Ye-rin?

674
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,725
Well...

675
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,686
We didn't stay long.

676
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,146
So? How was your blind date?

677
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,190
-Did you make plans to meet again?
-What?

678
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,610
No.

679
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,613
Why not? She's totally your type.

680
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,866
Well...

681
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,827
her looks are,

682
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,122
but I like a girl that's smart.

683
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,540
Ye-rin's really smart.

684
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,835
She graduated with a business degree
from SNU and studied at Harvard.

685
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,086
She's even a member of Mensa.

686
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,673
Really? So I get that she's pretty
and also smart,

687
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,051
but I don't like it when a girl
doesn't have a sense of humor.

688
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,261
She's a comedienne.

689
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,138
She's a JBC comedienne.
Recruited for their 17th class.

690
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,222
She's hilarious.

691
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,141
Really?

692
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,601
How should I put this?

693
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,272
I don't get the feeling she's the one.

694
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,481
Shut it!

695
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,317
It's because of Soo-ah, isn't it?

696
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,693
You're still not over her!

697
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,403
No, I told you that's not it!

698
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,822
Then why won't you meet her again?

699
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,032
Well...

700
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,075
Dong-goo, you have to stop.

701
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,618
Why are you giving me a hard time?

702
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,204
I told you that's not it.

703
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,716
Fine. I'll ask her out. Happy?

704
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,384
Call her right now in front of us.

705
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,635
What?

706
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,097
Okay.

707
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,726
I'll do it. I really will.

708
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,811
I'm calling, damn it.

709
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,731
I asked her to help clean up.
What's taking her so long?

710
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,108
Why aren't you coming down?

711
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,613
I'm sorting out clothes I don't wear.

712
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,201
This isn't sorting. You're making a mess.
Jeez.

713
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,329
-This is the coat Dong-goo got you?
-Yeah.

714
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,122
It's small on me.

715
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,332
It's not like I can throw it away.

716
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,417
Do you want to wear it?

717
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,419
Are you serious?

718
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,174
Well, then I'll just have to wear it...

719
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,052
It's small on me, too.

720
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,514
You should try it on.

721
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,557
Me? No, it's okay.

722
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,142
Just try it.

723
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,270
Come on. Here you go.

724
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,776
It's perfect.

725
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,486
It is.

726
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,570
Want to wear it, Yoon-ah?

727
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,157
I can't do that. He got it for you.
No thanks.

728
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,369
I guess it could be weird. I don't know.

729
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,705
Look at all these clothes.
How come you have so much?

730
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,251
Isn't this Moire Moussi?

731
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,342
I'm right! Moire Moussi.

732
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,053
Moire Moussi? What's that?

733
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,847
You don't know Moire Moussi?

734
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,181
It's a designer brand,

735
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,560
but what's important

736
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,853
is that the 2017 F/W Vintage Collection

737
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,565
was so hot that everybody who's anybody
has worn it. Song Hye-kyo,

738
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,066
Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Tae-hee, you name it.

739
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,610
But why won't you wear this?

740
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,904
Just 'cause. I don't find myself
reaching for it much.

741
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,822
You should have it.

742
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,576
Really? Thank you, Soo-ah.

743
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,869
Thank you so much.

744
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,121
Don't worry about cleaning today.
Just rest.

745
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,791
I'll do it all. Love you!

746
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,588
I'm taking all the Moire Moussi, okay?

747
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,672
Sure.

748
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,132
Whoo-hoo!

749
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,805
Why are you doing this to me?

750
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,973
Excuse me?

751
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,561
Why would you insert a scene
that's not scripted without discussing it?

752
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,646
Gil-song, turn the lights on.

753
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,399
Don't act like an amateur.

754
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,151
Why are you making a fuss over nothing?

755
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,987
I won't do the film if you act this way.

756
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,490
Are you refusing to shoot?
Then pay up for breach of contract!

757
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,532
What did you say?

758
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,117
If you don't have the money,

759
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,577
then just shut up and listen.

760
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,163
Are you in or out?

761
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,915
Let me go get some air.

762
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,375
What a brat.

763
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,391
Get up.

764
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,144
-Doo-sik.
-Get up now.

765
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,231
What's wrong? Where are you going?

766
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,566
Doo-sik, what's wrong?

767
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,779
You said you don't want
to do this anymore.

768
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,449
Then don't.
Don't do something you don't want to.

769
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,076
Live your life doing what you want.

770
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,247
I can't. There's the contract issue and--

771
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,708
I'll take care of that, so just go home.

772
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,835
I'll call you once everything
has been taken care of.

773
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,758
Doo-sik.

774
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,267
Mr. Bong, what did you say?

775
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,145
Cherry can't do the movie?

776
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,940
No, she can't.
So please don't contact Cherry--

777
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,985
Mal-geum-- again.

778
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,779
Who are you to decide that?

779
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,324
So you'll pay for damages
for canceling on the movie

780
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,411
and also for breach of contract
with my management company?

781
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,413
Yes, I will.

782
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,831
How much is it?

783
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,006
Forty million won?

784
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,718
What am I going to do now?
I must've gone insane!

785
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,389
Ta-da!

786
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,100
Joon-ki. How do I look?

787
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,979
You look like a really warm
homeless person!

788
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,607
Have you decided to become a beggar
instead of getting a job?

789
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,608
What? Homeless?

790
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,818
This is a designer item.

791
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,738
Moire Moussi's 2017 F/W
Vintage Collection.

792
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,031
Moire what?

793
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,366
Never mind.
You don't even know what fashion is.

794
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,243
Forget it! I'm off to the library.

795
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,661
Yeah, yeah. Stay warm.

796
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,205
-Hi, Doo-sik.
-Hey.

797
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,583
What's up with the warm
homeless person look?

798
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,126
Why are you carrying an onion mesh bag?

799
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,211
This isn't an onion mesh bag!

800
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,838
This is part of Moire Moussi's 2017--

801
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,381
Moire what?

802
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,467
Forget it. Both of you.

803
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,552
I'm the idiot for trying to talk
to you two.

804
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,346
You fools don't know a thing
about fashion.

805
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,181
Who does she think she is?

806
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,308
Who knows where she got that garbage?

807
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,894
Hand her a can
and she'll totally look the part, right?

808
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,022
Totally. Right, Joon-ki.
That beggar is not the problem right now.

809
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,106
I'm in deep shit.

810
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,443
Deep shit? What do you mean?

811
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,738
What? You have to pay
for Mal-geum's breach of contract?

812
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,158
Yeah. I felt so bad for her that I...

813
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,702
It doesn't matter how bad you felt.
Why'd you pull that shit?

814
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,537
I had no idea it'd be so much.

815
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,040
What do I do?
Look into a moneylender?

816
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,792
Do you think they pass out loans
to just anybody?

817
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,669
You don't even qualify, you imbecile!

818
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,088
Then what can I do? This is nuts.

819
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,385
There is one thing you can try.

820
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,430
What is it? Please tell me.

821
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,235
This place hasn't changed.

822
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,238
What is this place?
Don't they hold track cycling here?

823
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,697
Isn't this illegal?

824
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,199
It's completely legal.

825
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,284
They have a permit and everything.

826
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:08,497
There's no better place when you need
to make big money in a short time.

827
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,792
Really? There's no guarantee
we'll make money, though.

828
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,794
There is a way to guarantee it.

829
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,132
-Have you heard of the Cycle Prophet?
-Cycle Prophet?

830
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,718
He's got this superpower to predict
the winner like a prophet,

831
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,096
hence the name.

832
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,475
I wonder where he is today...

833
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,023
That's him over there.

834
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,112
So if we just follow his picks,

835
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,031
it's easy money all the way.

836
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,160
How would we know who his picks are?

837
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,036
Where there's a will, there's a way.

838
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,663
Follow me.

839
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,000
-What are you doing?
-Just stand there.

840
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,251
-Stand where?
-Shh!

841
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,796
Get lost!

842
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,340
Jeez.

843
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,093
-What do you think you're doing?
-Sorry, sir.

844
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,928
He had too much to drink.

845
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,264
You shouldn't come here when you're drunk.

846
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,601
Here you go, sir.

847
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,937
Sorry about that.

848
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,356
Why'd you push me?

849
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,567
I saw it. I saw
all of Cycle Prophet's picks.

850
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,444
Really? Who did he bet on?

851
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,492
Go all in on this one.

852
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,328
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Why?

853
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,623
My intestines have been grumbling
since the rockfish incident.

854
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,124
I'll be right back. All in, okay?

855
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,043
Okay, hurry.

856
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,426
Are you going on your date, Dong-goo?

857
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,719
Yes.

858
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,304
Have a good one, okay?

859
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,556
Treat her to something good.

860
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,437
Soo-ah. Do I have to go?

861
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,152
Why? Is it

862
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,529
because of me again?

863
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,948
No, that's not why.

864
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,033
I'm low on funds
because we don't have guests.

865
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,451
Going on a date is costly.

866
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:13,622
It's not right for me to be dating
anyone in this situation.

867
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,208
-I think that--
-Dong-goo, I'm here.

868
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,879
Hi, Ye-rin. What are you doing here?

869
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,465
Going out costs too much money.

870
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,802
I thought we could stay in
and cook together.

871
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,971
I'll whip something up.

872
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,389
Where's your kitchen?

873
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,682
No, that's not necessary...

874
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,268
The kitchen's this way. Follow me.

875
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,478
Thank you.

876
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,942
Do you see how thoughtful she is?

877
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,737
So don't worry about money
and enjoy yourself, okay?

878
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,281
Okay, thanks.

879
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,993
How is she so thoughtful?

880
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,120
It's unbelievable.

881
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,794
What took you so long?
They started already.

882
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,672
Sorry. I don't feel so good.

883
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,132
Did you place your bet?

884
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,634
Yeah, right here.
How do you read this thing?

885
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,969
You look at--

886
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,513
RACE 10, 6/1

887
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,431
Hey.

888
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,560
I told you to bet on 1 and 9.
How come this says 6 and 1?

889
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,313
What are you saying?
You wrote 6-1 right here!

890
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,480
What?

891
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,276
It's upside down, you bastard!

892
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,654
You should've looked at it this way.
You fool!

893
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,197
Then you should've said so.

894
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,158
We're ruined, thanks to you!

895
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,285
Shit, man.

896
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,162
What do we do now?

897
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,371
This can't be happening.

898
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,220
No way. Oh my God!

899
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,558
1ST PLACE, NO.6 JUNG HA-JIN

900
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,019
-Hooray!
-What just happened?

901
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,772
You made the right pick.

902
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,814
We hit the jackpot!

903
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,734
-So you're saying we won money?
-We did!

904
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,821
Awesome!

905
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,037
This is insane.

906
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,916
This should be enough to put out the fire.
Shall we go?

907
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,376
Hold on, Doo-sik.

908
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,211
Wouldn't it be unfair to leave now?

909
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:29,007
We bet your life savings of 48,000 won
and made this in mere minutes.

910
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,427
If we'd bet all of this,
then how much would it be now?

911
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,262
An exorbitant amount. Why?

912
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,681
Why do you think?

913
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,933
Hit the jackpot one more time
and Mal-geum's penalty aside,

914
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,643
we can finally achieve
our lifelong dream...

915
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,728
of making our movie.

916
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,480
Doo-sik...

917
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,316
let's do this!

918
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,985
Our movie?

919
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,076
You're amazing, Ye-rin.
Isn't she, Dong-goo?

920
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,078
I guess.

921
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,746
Would you like some gimbap?

922
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,039
Let me feed you one.

923
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,834
No, that's all right. I can eat it myself.

924
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,585
But I want to.

925
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,586
Say "ahh."

926
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,587
I said, no.

927
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,715
I'm sorry,

928
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,925
I just wanted to feed you myself.

929
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,680
A word?

930
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,098
Why?

931
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,892
We were just about to eat.

932
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,810
Why?

933
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,566
-Dong-goo. Why are you acting like this?
-What did I do?

934
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,860
Why didn't you go "ahh"
when Ye-rin was trying to feed you?

935
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,319
Why didn't you go "ahh"?

936
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:35,490
-I wanted to eat it myself.
-Bullshit.

937
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,992
It's because of me.

938
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,703
You didn't go "ahh"
because you were thinking about me.

939
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,872
No, that's not why.

940
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,707
Then why wouldn't you go "ahh"?

941
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,626
She's trying to feed you something
delicious, so why didn't you go "ahh"?

942
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,837
Fine, I'll go "ahh."

943
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,089
I will go "ahh." Happy?

944
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,390
How is it? Do you like it?

945
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,559
Yes, it's delicious.

946
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,854
Then you can have another one.

947
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,522
But I just had one.

948
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,242
My goodness.

949
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,963
They just can't take their eyes off of me.

950
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,424
They sure know what's hot.

951
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:39,971
It's not Moire Moussi for nothing.

952
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,185
Ooh, tteokbokki.

953
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,772
It looks yummy.

954
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,649
One portion of tteokbokki, please.

955
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,609
You, uh...

956
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,070
have money, right?

957
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,280
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

958
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,949
Well,

959
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,785
-you have to pay in advance.
-Oh...

960
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,620
I see.

961
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,958
Auntie, one basket of onions please.

962
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:08,875
Which one would you like?

963
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,919
-This one, please.
-This one?

964
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,339
I'm out of plastic bags. What to do?

965
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,800
Oh, look.
There's an onion mesh bag right here.

966
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,260
-I'll put them in here.
-Okay.

967
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,511
This is great.

968
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,097
MUAN ONIONS

969
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,810
My bag. Where did it go?

970
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,688
My bag.

971
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,356
Lady...

972
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,440
what do you think you're doing?

973
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,818
-Who are you?
-Why are you

974
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,736
putting onions in my bag?

975
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,655
This is yours?
I thought it was an onion mesh--

976
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,365
It's not, okay?

977
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,536
This is from Moire Moussi's 2017 F/W
Vintage Collection!

978
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,914
Never mind. Get out of my way.

979
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,875
No, wait!

980
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,420
It reeks of onions.

981
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,462
Sorry...

982
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,299
-My poor bag.
-Who would buy that?

983
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,056
Hi, Hye-won.

984
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,475
What? Fill in on a blind date?

985
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,896
I can't. I need to get a job first.

986
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,024
What? He looks like Kang Daniel?

987
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,693
Goodness. Where are you again?

988
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,743
Hye-won, I'm here.

989
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,994
Oh, hi--

990
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,162
Seo-jin.

991
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,835
Sorry I'm late.

992
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,756
Seo-jin, what's that smell?

993
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,174
Is it onions?

994
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,344
Sorry. There was an incident.

995
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,390
Sorry about that.

996
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,684
That's all right. It's fine.

997
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,605
I'm Kang Seo-jin.

998
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,775
Was the food to your liking, Dong-goo?

999
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,277
Yes, it was delicious.

1000
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,862
Would you like a piece of gum?

1001
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,493
-Say "ahh."
-That's okay. I'll just--

1002
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,961
Are you in pain?

1003
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,964
I have a headache from all the stress
I've been put under.

1004
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,174
Really? A foot massage
will work wonders on that.

1005
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,968
Shall I give you a foot massage?

1006
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,052
-Excuse me?
-Give me your feet.

1007
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,096
No, no.

1008
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,264
Why would you give me a foot massage?
That's all right.

1009
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:32,310
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to relieve your stress.

1010
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,356
It's fine. I don't need a foot massage.

1011
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,317
Dong-goo, a word?

1012
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,070
Why?

1013
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,450
-Why are you doing this again?
-What did I do?

1014
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,454
Why not take the foot massage?
Ye-rin's offering, so why won't you do it?

1015
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,747
What?

1016
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,583
I just met her yesterday.
That'd be weird.

1017
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,003
There you go again.
You think I don't know

1018
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,338
that it's because of me?

1019
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:04,050
You're wrong.
It's not because of you.

1020
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,594
Then why won't you let her give you
a foot massage?

1021
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:10,098
Even a one-minute massage
can work wonders.

1022
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,224
Why the hell won't you do it?

1023
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,978
Fine, I will!
I'll get a foot massage from her.

1024
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,702
Where did he go?

1025
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,079
Did he go to the restroom?

1026
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,709
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1027
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,212
The man that was just here.
Where did he go?

1028
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,048
He settled the bill and left.

1029
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,174
He left?

1030
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,803
Where'd he go in the middle of our date?

1031
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,353
Hi, Hye-won.

1032
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:03,610
Dae-young split while I went
to the toilet. What's wrong with him?

1033
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,572
Why'd you have to dress like that?
And what's with the onion mesh?

1034
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:11,534
It's not an onion mesh bag.
It's a net bag.

1035
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,495
And I'm wearing Moire Moussi.

1036
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,455
It's expensive stuff.

1037
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,378
So Dae-young ran off
because of what I'm wearing?

1038
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,007
Don't deny it. Fine, bye.

1039
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,095
I'm speechless.

1040
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,389
Ignorant fools who don't know fashion.

1041
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,017
Kang Daniel's pores look better
than he does.

1042
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,653
Does this make any sense?

1043
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,447
How is it possible that we couldn't even
get one right?

1044
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,282
I don't know.

1045
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,618
We lost all the money we made
because of you.

1046
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,499
I said we should leave.
What the hell?

1047
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,000
Damn it.

1048
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:05,088
Doo-sik, I'm sorry.

1049
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,673
Hey, Doo-sik.

1050
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,092
I'm sorry. Doo-sik!

1051
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,803
I'm sorry, Doo-sik.

1052
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,013
I said I'm sorry.

1053
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,015
Forget it! What are you going to do now?

1054
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,725
We don't even have money for the bus!

1055
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,436
Jeez.

1056
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,688
It's not like we can walk home.

1057
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,023
I guess you blew your bus fare
as well, huh?

1058
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,109
Hello, sir.

1059
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,777
Greed invites disaster.

1060
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:31,739
Take this.

1061
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,828
In exchange, promise you'll never
come back here. Can you do that?

1062
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,038
Yes, of course.
We'll never come back here.

1063
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,084
Thank you, sir.

1064
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,502
Sure thing. I'm off.

1065
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,963
You'll never be able to quit.

1066
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,174
Thank you!

1067
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,384
I'm so relieved.

1068
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,220
Thanks to Cycle Prophet,
we'll be able to go home. Right, Joon-ki?

1069
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,391
There's the bus. Let's go.

1070
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,684
Hold on, Doo-sik.

1071
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:00,977
What is it this time?

1072
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:06,149
Wouldn't it be unfair to leave like this?
Just one more race.

1073
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,610
What? We don't even have any--

1074
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,446
You want to use this money to gamble?

1075
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,323
What will you say to Mal-geum?

1076
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,825
She put her faith in you.

1077
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,870
One good shot and we can take care
of Mal-geum's penalty,

1078
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,497
make our movie, and if all goes well...

1079
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,666
you can marry Mal-geum.

1080
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,546
Doo-sik, let's do this! Let's go!

1081
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:30,757
Marriage?

1082
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,940
Shit, man. I can't believe I trusted you.
I'm such a fool! I should die!

1083
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,735
I had a good feeling this time.

1084
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,320
Shut up! Just keep walking.

1085
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,198
It's freezing. When will we get home? Go!

1086
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,574
Doo-sik.

1087
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,455
Look. It's 500 won.

1088
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,415
What are you going to do with 500 won?

1089
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,710
No way. You actually want to go back?
Are you insane?

1090
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,171
One good shot and we can take care
of Mal-geum's penalty,

1091
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,799
our movie, your wedding with Mal-geum,

1092
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,133
and your kids--

1093
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,135
they'll be born rich.

1094
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:20,515
Doo-sik, let's do this. Let's go!

1095
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,560
Born rich?

1096
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,279
I'm the idiot for trusting you!

1097
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,864
You imbecile!

1098
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,659
I really thought we'd get it this time.

1099
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,287
Doo-sik, look.

1100
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,873
It's a beer bottle!

1101
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,293
What about it?

1102
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,795
You can get 130 won for this.

1103
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:54,591
A few more of these,
and we can sell them for seed money

1104
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,384
and if we hit it big,

1105
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,510
the penalty, our movie,

1106
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,637
your wedding, your kids!

1107
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,723
How about it? Doo-sik!

1108
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,475
Let's do this! Let's go!

1109
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,187
You maniac. You'd sell bottles to gamble?
You've lost your mind!

1110
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,148
We just need a few more.

1111
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,899
Be ambitious, Doo-sik!

1112
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:12,942
Let's go!

1113
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,403
Cut the crap and let's go home!

1114
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,405
Follow me, you maniac!

1115
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,906
-Hey.
-Come on!

1116
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,076
We're hosting a White Day event
for the launch of our new product.

1117
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,703
Please come join us.

1118
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,414
-Round-trip tickets to Jeju if you win.
-What is this?

1119
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,499
Come join us.

1120
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,918
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1121
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,337
May I participate?

1122
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,632
Why, yes, of course.

1123
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,934
FOURTH PLACE

1124
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:49,937
I got fourth place!

1125
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,191
What do I win?

1126
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,069
-Here you go.
-Wow!

1127
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,155
That's amazing!

1128
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:00,948
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1129
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,955
Thank you!

1130
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,648
This lollipop is really yummy.

1131
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,132
We could've bet one more time
had we sold that bottle.

1132
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,384
I saw five more bottles on our way here.

1133
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,553
You've got to be ambitious!

1134
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,889
Shut up! Enough!

1135
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,726
Hey... Doo-sik.

1136
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,895
-I know that face.
-What are you talking about?

1137
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,190
Isn't that Seo-jin?

1138
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,942
I think it is.

1139
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,820
It is her.

1140
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,238
Hey, Seo-jin.

1141
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,865
Wake up.

1142
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,742
Leave me alone!

1143
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,578
Ignorant fools who don't know fashion...

1144
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,871
She reeks of alcohol.

1145
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,790
Where'd she go to drink at this hour?

1146
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,794
Look at that.
She got herself a can after all.

1147
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,341
-Hey, Doo-sik.
-What now?

1148
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,678
Look at this. It's money.

1149
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,264
Why is there money in her can?

1150
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,058
If we leave now, we can place one more bet
before they close.

1151
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,977
-How about it?
-What?

1152
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,438
You want to go back again?
You're out of your mind!

1153
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,774
If God has a conscience,
He won't look the other way.

1154
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,319
Doo-sik, let's do this!

1155
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,070
-Let's go!
-Shut your mouth!

1156
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,239
You're crazy.

1157
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,911
Fine, let's not bother.

1158
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:13,456
Then you won't be able to pay
Mal-geum's penalty or get married.

1159
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:17,168
You'll die a miserable death
after living like this all your life.

1160
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,712
-Forget it.
-That can't happen.

1161
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,882
Doo-sik. Just one more bet.

1162
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,511
Doo-sik, let's do this!

1163
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,054
Let's go!

1164
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,808
I can't die a lonely man.

1165
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,477
Let's do this! Let's go!

1166
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,941
Let's do this!

1167
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,449
Bye, Dong-goo.

1168
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,451
Get home safely, Ye-rin.

1169
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:54,956
You know what? I really like you.
Do you want to start dating?

1170
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,667
Pardon?

1171
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,047
Ye-rin...

1172
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,550
please don't take this the wrong way.

1173
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,011
You're pretty and smart,

1174
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,139
you have a sense of humor,
you're thoughtful,

1175
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,642
you cook well
and you give great foot massages.

1176
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,270
You're even great at cleaning ears.
You're perfect.

1177
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:22,984
I don't think I'm good enough for you.

1178
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,819
-And--
-Hold on.

1179
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:26,612
Am I being dumped?

1180
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,364
No, that's not it.

1181
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,908
Why? Do you have someone you like?

1182
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,829
Excuse me? The thing is...

1183
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,163
So I was right.

1184
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:40,543
Right about what?

1185
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,713
Are you talking about Soo-ah and me?

1186
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,132
Soo-ah is just a friend.

1187
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,759
-It's totally platonic.
-I wasn't talking about Soo-ah.

1188
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,053
-I meant Yoon-ah.
-Sorry?

1189
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,805
See? I'm right.

1190
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,765
How did you...

1191
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,935
I'm very smart,
so don't even think about lying.

1192
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,813
I'm sorry, Ye-rin.

1193
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,065
Could you keep this between us?

1194
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,026
Sure. I'll get going now.

1195
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,028
Thank you.

1196
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,405
-Goodbye then.
-Bye.

1197
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,034
Bye.

1198
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,790
The seemingly perfect Ye-rin

1199
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,792
turned out to have a flaw after all.

1200
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,628
What?

1201
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,924
-Dong-goo likes Yoon-ah?
-That's what I'm telling you.

1202
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,302
I asked him out
and he flat-out rejected me.

1203
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:35,139
And in that moment, I could just feel it.
So I asked him and he confessed.

1204
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,017
He confessed?

1205
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,896
Okay. Bye.

1206
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,360
Does that mean he really likes Yoon-ah?

1207
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,071
Wait...

1208
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,615
What if she catches on that I like her?

1209
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,659
I wanted her to give it to Soo-ah
for me but I can do it myself.

1210
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,077
Here, Soo-ah.

1211
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,830
It's perfect.

1212
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,416
Didn't Yoon-ah say she was going
to the supermarket?

1213
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,920
Where are you going?

1214
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,634
Shall I start cleaning now?

1215
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,346
Hey, Dong-goo. You...

1216
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:16,639
You!

1217
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,183
What is it?

1218
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,395
That's why you ran out
when the supermarket was on fire

1219
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,396
and the coat...

1220
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,941
So the person you like

1221
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,193
isn't me, but Yoon-ah?

1222
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:31,654
What?

1223
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,657
What are you talking about?

1224
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,159
Don't play dumb.
Ye-rin told me everything!

1225
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:41,330
What? She said she'd keep it a secret!
She told you already?

1226
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,587
Did you see Ye-rin off?

1227
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,089
Pardon?

1228
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:53,134
You can't.

1229
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,594
What?

1230
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,723
I'm speechless.

1231
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,391
This is pretty amazing.

1232
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,187
What's the matter, Soo-ah?

1233
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:08,482
So it turns out that Dong-goo
doesn't like me,

1234
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:12,111
-but likes--
-Hey, Soo-ah! Why don't we...

1235
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,257
Yoon-ah, take this.

1236
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,134
Soo-ah and I are just friends.

1237
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,970
There's someone else that he likes.

1238
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,638
Please don't cry, Sol.

1239
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,765
What's wrong with you lately?

1240
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,683
Do you mind if I try?

1241
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,268
How fascinating.

1242
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,269
Thank you.

1243
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,271
We have a new lecturer today.

1244
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,315
Let me introduce him.

1245
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,816
Don't you know him?

1246
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,901
He's celebrity chef Song Hyun-joon.

1247
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:54,278
She's that first love you mentioned
before, right?

1248
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,030
Seeing these photos reminds me
of old times.

1249
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,990
We were inseparable.

1250
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,117
When did you start liking me?

1251
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,285
What do you mean?

1252
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:03,037
-No way. Am I your first love?
-What?

1253
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,040
You've got a pretty regular napping
schedule for someone who's job hunting.

1254
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,166
I envy you.

1255
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,709
You jerk! Do you want to die?

1256
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,586
Enough already.

1257
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,129
That's how it begins.

1258
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,589
What begins?

1259
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,424
Even if I was stuck on a deserted island
with him and it was just the two of us,

1260
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,135
it still wouldn't happen.
