1
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,402
What the hell?

2
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,950
Water... I need water.

3
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,336
What is this?

4
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,233
Hello?

5
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,528
Yes, speaking.

6
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,823
Excuse me?

7
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,827
I'm... I'm so sorry.

8
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,954
If you could give us some more time,

9
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,123
we'll make payment by the end of the week.

10
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,000
Excuse me?

11
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,087
Then how do you expect us to run
a business? You can't--

12
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,172
Hello?

13
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,805
What's with all the noise?
What's going on?

14
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,143
They're cutting our water off
because we're behind on payment.

15
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,561
What?

16
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,356
-When?
-Right away.

17
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,697
You jerk. Do you think this is funny?

18
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,075
You know I hate pranks like this.

19
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,205
Hey, seriously...

20
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,793
Dong-goo,
turn the water back on right now.

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,794
Joon-ki.

22
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,880
-What?
-This way.

23
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,508
Hey, Dong-goo, stop kidding around
and turn the water back on!

24
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,385
Kidding around, my ass.

25
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,012
They cut us off.
We're behind on the water bill.

26
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,473
They cut us off?

27
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,024
That's why I told you to pay
the utilities on time!

28
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,818
Did I have a choice?
We don't have any money!

29
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,445
How much could water cost?

30
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,405
-420,000 won.
-420,000 won?

31
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,199
-Yeah.
-That's quite a lot.

32
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,452
Still, how can a CEO not have 400k?

33
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,498
-This is all your fault.
-What?

34
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,124
"The guesthouse is a blue ocean"?

35
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,169
"Chinese tourists will flood in
as soon as we open"?

36
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,213
"We'll hit the jackpot and make a movie"?

37
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,424
Did I know THAAD
would become an issue? Did I?

38
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,260
How could I have predicted the change--

39
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,344
Enough!

40
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,972
Do you know
how much interest we owe on our loan?

41
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,598
We're about to go under!

42
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,142
How are we to stay in business
with no water?

43
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,603
-Huh?
-Don't worry.

44
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,023
The three of us can surely come up
with 400k.

45
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,401
He's right.
At least things can't get any worse.

46
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,486
Let's be positive, Dong-goo.

47
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,822
What? "Be positive"?

48
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,951
You're right. My bad.

49
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,036
I almost made a huge mistake.

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,330
Guests show up once in a blue moon,

51
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,083
the interest on our loan is snowballing,
and we have no water.

52
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,876
I was pessimistic for no reason.

53
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,837
How could I have been so stupid?

54
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,673
-Shall I kneel or something?
-No, that's not what I meant.

55
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,300
-Dong-goo...
-What, what?

56
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,634
-You little--
-Hey!

57
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,845
Why are you taking it out on Doo-sik?

58
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,804
It's all right.

59
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,348
Right, I guess I'm the crazy one here.

60
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,977
I must've been out of my mind
to go into business with you jerks.

61
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,354
Right, it's all on me.

62
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,525
What? "Be positive"?

63
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,943
Die!

64
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,196
Nothing's working out.

65
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,950
That-- he has
serious anger management issues.

66
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,077
It's all right. There, there.

67
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,495
Are you crying?

68
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,333
Why are you crying?
Let's be positive!

69
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,174
What?

70
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,385
"Let's be positive"
since "it can't get any worse"?

71
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,513
We'd be in hell if it got any worse!

72
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,725
What was that?

73
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,896
What's that sound?

74
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,672
There's a baby here?

75
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,551
Joon-ki! Doo-sik!

76
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,053
What is it?

77
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,639
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

78
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,932
-What is it?
-It's...

79
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,809
-Why?
-Why? What's there?

80
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,519
-Go look.
-What is it?

81
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,770
What is it?

82
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,979
-Take a look.
-Huh?

83
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,234
It's a baby. A baby doll.

84
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,902
-It's moving.
-What?

85
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,085
It moved.

86
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,463
-He looked right into my eyes.
-It moved.

87
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,937
NEW WORLD

88
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,487
Why on earth--?
Why? Why is it here?

89
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,822
Does it belong to a guest?

90
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,657
We haven't had a guest in forever!

91
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,909
That's why we drank all day yesterday!

92
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,786
They could've come when we were drunk.

93
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,037
You think?

94
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,582
I blacked out. I can't remember a thing.

95
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,500
Don't you remember? You didn't drink.

96
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,003
I went to bed early. I have a shoot today.

97
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,046
Let's go through that bag first.

98
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,091
-There might be a phone number inside.
-Should we?

99
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,227
Nothing here.

100
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,688
What the hell is going on?

101
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,065
Maybe they went out for a bit
and left their bag behind.

102
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,817
Does that make any sense?

103
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,237
What kind of parents would go out,
leaving a baby behind?

104
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,032
Hey, hey. He's crying.

105
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,493
Do something!

106
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,036
-What do I do?
-Do something!

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,123
Why... why are you crying?
Are you hungry?

108
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,793
Or... do you need a diaper change?

109
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,593
-What is this?
-What?

110
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,677
Hold on.

111
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,183
Damn it, he took a shit!

112
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,540
I'm...

113
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,960
going in.

114
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,138
What's wrong? Is it all over the place?

115
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,850
No, he's-- the thing is...

116
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:24,355
He doesn't have it. There's nothing there.

117
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,774
-It-- it's a girl.
-So what?

118
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,361
I mean, I know she's a baby,

119
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,781
but I don't know if I can just change
a girl's diaper like this.

120
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,491
What a man of manners.

121
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,119
-You're a gentleman, aren't you?
-What?

122
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:42,832
So you should stop with the nonsense
and just change the damn diaper!

123
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,874
Fine!

124
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,628
Sorry.

125
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,719
-Wet wipes.
-Wet wipes!

126
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,013
Hurry, damn it!

127
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,389
Give me one, too.

128
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,267
Wet wipes. I need more!

129
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,351
-More!
-Here you go.

130
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,813
Oh, jeez. Diaper!

131
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,481
-Diaper, now!
-Here!

132
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,949
Okay, it's all good.

133
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,492
Well done.

134
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,577
Well...

135
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,163
It was nothing.

136
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,545
Wet wipes.

137
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,923
Wet wipes!

138
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,759
Hey, kiddo.

139
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,888
I gave you formula and changed you.

140
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,891
Why are you still crying?

141
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,934
Should we just call the police?

142
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,020
What if a guest just went out for a bit?

143
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,688
He's right. Let's give it a day.

144
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,774
The police station would be tough
for a baby.

145
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,775
She's so loud.

146
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,653
We have no guests and no water...

147
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,279
and a baby to take care of?

148
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,074
You can't make this stuff up.

149
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,201
Ouch, my back.

150
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,912
Jeez, my back...

151
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,543
What? She's not crying!

152
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,504
That's crazy!

153
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,757
That's a relief.

154
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,886
-What?
-Damn!

155
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,473
-Why are you crying again?
-What did you do just now?

156
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,391
Do it again!

157
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,767
Stand up. Come on!

158
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,977
I just stood up and...

159
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,813
bent my waist, bounced back up--

160
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,111
-Keep doing that!
-You want me to keep doing this?

161
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,654
What else?
She'll keep crying otherwise.

162
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,864
But how can I continue doing this?

163
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,492
Switch with me. This is so tiring.

164
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,621
Goodness, look at the time.
I have a movie shoot today. Bye now.

165
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,706
You said it was in the afternoon.

166
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,626
Hey, it's with the godfather
of the movie industry, Park Sung-woong.

167
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,254
I need to get there early to prepare.

168
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,255
Bye, then.

169
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,758
You don't have to be there for hours!

170
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,595
Doo-sik.

171
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,014
I have to go to my part-time gig. Bye!

172
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,766
Where are you going? What gig?

173
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,601
-At the convenience store.
-You can't.

174
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,270
-You can't go.
-See you!

175
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,980
You can't just leave me here!

176
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,610
This is driving me nuts.

177
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,619
Hello? Hi, Soo-ah. What's up?
Something important to discuss?

178
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,830
Right now?

179
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,748
Okay, good. Nice.

180
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,042
Okay.

181
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,254
You look good. Okay.

182
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,338
Smile.

183
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,757
Last one.

184
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,553
That's a wrap. Good job, Soo-ah.

185
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,138
Thank you.

186
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,902
YOUR LOAN OF 12,316,340 WON
IS OVERDUE. PLEASE MAKE PAYMENT.

187
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,408
Hi, Soo-ah. I'm here.

188
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,035
Hey.

189
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,078
What's with the baby?

190
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,250
The thing is... when we woke up
this morning, a guest--

191
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,419
I don't know. It's a long story.

192
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,004
-Hang in there.
-Thanks.

193
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,925
Seriously, you're the only bright spot
in my life, Soo-ah.

194
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,052
-What is it you wanted to say?
-Oh, that.

195
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,178
Let's break up.

196
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,306
What?

197
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,143
Break up? What do you mean?

198
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,021
It's just... let's break up.

199
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,691
Why? What's the reason?

200
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,818
I could talk for days
and it wouldn't be enough.

201
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,736
Let's just break up.

202
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,154
So tell me why!

203
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,448
You can go on for a whole year
for all I care!

204
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,784
Really? Fine.

205
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,619
First, you're too immature.

206
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,579
Second, you're not capable enough.

207
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,248
Third, you have no future.

208
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,708
Fourth, you... fifth... sixth...

209
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,795
seventh... 87th... 89th...

210
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,213
I hate your hairstyle.

211
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,132
90th, I hate the sounds you make
when you chew.

212
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,842
-91st, you--
-Enough already!

213
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,637
I got it, so stop.

214
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,433
Wow. How the hell did you
put up with me this long?

215
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,810
Did you even love me?

216
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,271
Love you? Of course.

217
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,731
Love alone isn't enough.

218
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,567
Do you know how shallow you sound?

219
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,611
It's not me who's shallow.
You're the one who's immature.

220
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,364
Anyways, it's been fun.

221
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,408
You can have this back.

222
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,452
Fine, let's break up.

223
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,373
I don't need that damn ring.
Throw it away or do whatever you want.

224
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,001
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
for dating a loser like me!

225
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,169
Have a good life, damn it!

226
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,352
Nice. Let's do that scene one more time.

227
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,729
Yes, sir!

228
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,814
-You have to do well today.
-Hey.

229
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,149
Hi, Joon-ki.

230
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,194
I practically begged the director to give
you this role. Do a good job, okay?

231
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,155
Of course I will.

232
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,658
You'll pay me
as soon as the shoot's over, right?

233
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,743
I will, don't worry.

234
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,787
That's right. Have you said hello
to Sung-woong yet?

235
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,955
No, I haven't.

236
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,124
-Let's go. I'll introduce you.
-Okay.

237
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,052
Sung-woong, this is Joon-ki.
He'll be working with us today.

238
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,595
COLD-BLOODED

239
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,389
Nice to meet you, sir.

240
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,977
It's an honor to have the opportunity
to act with my idol, sir.

241
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,441
Excuse me?

242
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,032
Sorry?

243
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,079
Yes, sir?

244
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,126
Sung-woong!

245
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,754
What's up with him?

246
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,423
-Did I do something wrong?
-Why are you so dense?

247
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,301
He complimented you on your eyes.
Why didn't you get it?

248
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,347
-When?
-When he went like this!

249
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,976
Is that what that meant?
He could've said so.

250
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,894
He's not a man of many words.

251
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,398
He hates when you don't understand
what he says, so be careful.

252
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,024
-Understood?
-Yeah.

253
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:24,942
Catch you later.

254
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,738
He doesn't talk but hates it
when you can't understand him?

255
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,198
What am I supposed to do?

256
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,745
That's charisma right there.

257
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,541
Charismatic, indeed.

258
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,257
Ready!

259
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,759
Action!

260
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,515
Cut! What's wrong, Sung-woong?

261
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,233
Me?

262
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,822
Excuse me?

263
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,620
What did I...?

264
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,671
Sung-woong, where are you going?
Sung-woong!

265
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,635
Who brought that sucker?

266
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,636
Sorry, Director.

267
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,222
Jeez.

268
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,975
How can you?

269
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,561
Wake up, will you?

270
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,021
What did I do?

271
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,149
Sung-woong told you to take a step back.
Why didn't you get it?

272
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,942
He told me to step back?

273
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,070
-When?
-He kept on...

274
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,280
going like this and told you three times.

275
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,365
Earlier, you said it meant
he liked my eyes.

276
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,992
It depends on the situation!

277
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,119
Why are you so dense?

278
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,289
Sung-woong!

279
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,502
He should've just said so.

280
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,922
I'm going nuts.

281
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,722
He could've just given me an advance.
Is that so hard?

282
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,352
What do I tell Dong-goo now?
This is driving me insane.

283
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,190
How am I supposed to know--?

284
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,026
This is crazy. How am I supposed to know
what this means?

285
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,445
Joon-ki!

286
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,448
-Are you done with work?
-Yeah.

287
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,451
-Back from the convenience store?
-Yeah. You want one?

288
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,246
-Only three days past peak freshness.
-That's all right.

289
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,165
Stuff yourself silly, okay?

290
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,877
Why are you so on edge?
Something happen?

291
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,631
That's right. You had a shoot
with Park Sung-woong today!

292
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,967
How was it? Is he really that charismatic?

293
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,594
Yeah, I guess he is.

294
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,722
-But he's strange.
-What do you mean?

295
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,432
He won't talk...

296
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,768
but hates it if you don't understand
what he's saying.

297
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,605
He doesn't talk but wants you
to understand what he says?

298
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,024
-It doesn't make sense.
-That's what I mean!

299
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,111
Here. Pretend I'm Park Sung-woong
and you're me.

300
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,988
While shooting, he went...

301
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,949
like this. What do you think that means?

302
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,951
-Take a step back.
-How'd you know that?

303
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,119
I can just tell.

304
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,332
Okay, fine.
Then how about this? We just met.

305
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,002
I told him it was an honor to meet him.

306
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,378
And then he went...

307
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,797
like this. What does that mean?

308
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,674
-He likes your eyes.
-You know that, too?

309
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,967
How come I didn't?

310
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,719
Using common sense, that's all.

311
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,470
-You're so dense.
-What?

312
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,139
-How can you be an actor?
-What?

313
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,557
How can you...?

314
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,894
This damn finger, ugh!

315
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,607
We're home.

316
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,944
Where's the baby's mom?

317
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,696
Are you sick?

318
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,866
Then what is it? Something happen?

319
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,079
Is not talking a thing these days?

320
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,706
Talk, you dumbass!

321
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,374
I broke up with Soo-ah.

322
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,669
What? Why, all of a sudden?

323
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,880
Why? I stopped listening
after reason number 90.

324
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,757
She'd have gone on all night if I let her.

325
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,175
Why, what's wrong with you?

326
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,801
It's obvious, isn't it?

327
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,972
She's not so young anymore. I'm sure
her parents are talking about marriage.

328
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,515
Look at him.

329
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,227
He doesn't have a decent job,
any wealth,

330
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,728
nor a future, really.

331
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,439
On top of that, this guesthouse
is on the brink of going under.

332
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,982
I'd break up with him, too.

333
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,859
Jeez.

334
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,489
Dating is a luxury for have-nots like us.

335
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,244
So, you're wallowing in sorrow
because a girl dumped you?

336
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,955
You didn't cling on to her
like some loser, right?

337
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,248
Who clung to whom?

338
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,167
I was like,
"Fine, I don't need you either!"

339
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,753
I threw my ring at her
and got out of there!

340
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,756
Why? It was a gold ring. Do you know
how much gold costs these days?

341
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,384
That would've been more than enough
to pay the water bill.

342
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,386
Leave it to you to be so foolish!

343
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,720
Can we go find it?

344
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,974
Are you crazy? No way, man.
A man's got his pride, you know.

345
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,643
Stay here and keep that pride.
We'll go get the ring.

346
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,728
-Let's go!
-Enough! Were you able to get some cash?

347
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,480
-Tuna with mayo?
-Gimme.

348
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,941
Fine, stuff yourselves.

349
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,318
I didn't expect much from you two anyway.

350
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:23,532
I'll get paid after the shoot tomorrow,
so don't worry, okay?

351
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,077
By the way, what do we do with the baby?
We can't wait forever.

352
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,203
I don't know.

353
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,997
Let's just go to the police.
I'm exhausted.

354
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,999
Hang in just a little longer, Dong-goo.

355
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,751
Yeah, until tomorrow.
Don't you feel bad for her?

356
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,337
If you feel bad,
then you should look after her!

357
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,798
I have a headache from swinging her
back and forth all day!

358
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,383
Switch. Undo me.

359
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,260
-Walk forward a bit more.
-Okay.

360
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,636
This thing right here.

361
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,222
Undo this--

362
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,392
-Where are you going?
-Come here! Get in!

363
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,269
Get over here!

364
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,604
Open the door! You locked it?

365
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,232
I'm going to break it!
I'll bash the door in!

366
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,651
I'm so angry I'll do it!
I'm getting the hammer!

367
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,154
You don't think I'll do it, huh?

368
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,239
You bastards!

369
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,868
Open it! Now!

370
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,453
Damn it!

371
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,834
Come on, open it!

372
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,674
I'm aching all over
because of this tiny little thing.

373
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,509
These bastards.

374
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,510
They left already?

375
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,304
So early?

376
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,432
They've become new men, I tell you.
Seriously.

377
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,392
Hello?

378
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,685
Yes, speaking.

379
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,104
Pardon? The electricity bill?

380
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,773
By the end of this week?

381
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,067
We got our water cut off.
How do you expect us

382
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,403
to stay in business without electricity?
We're a guesthouse-- hello?

383
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,406
He hung up. I got hung up on again!

384
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,159
What will we do?

385
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,328
Help me, please.

386
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,670
Come on, you're embarrassing me.

387
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,262
I can't. A man's got his pride.

388
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,442
What brings you by?
Soo-ah isn't here yet.

389
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,070
Oh, really? Do you mind if I wait inside?

390
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,988
-Sure, go ahead.
-Thank you.

391
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,989
By the way...

392
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,700
did you clean the studio yesterday?

393
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,119
No. Why do you ask?

394
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,537
It's nothing.

395
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,935
What are you doing here?

396
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,855
Oh, hey.

397
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,650
Well, the thing is... I, uh...

398
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,194
You acted like you'd never see me again,
so why are you back?

399
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:11,783
Well, what happened is...
I had something to ask you.

400
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,536
-What is it?
-Well, see...

401
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,330
When do you think
the THAAD conflict will be resolved?

402
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,461
You came here to ask me that?

403
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,297
Yeah.

404
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,049
We've split up, but as concerned citizens
of the Republic of Korea

405
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,260
we can discuss diplomatic issues
our country faces, no?

406
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,096
Don't you think so?

407
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,308
I mean...

408
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,604
the two of us can meet to discuss...

409
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,070
Wait.

410
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,614
What? Why?

411
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,202
Shouldn't the threat from North Korea
be dealt with first?

412
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,495
I think a two-track strategy is needed
for tougher sanctions

413
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,372
on North Korea and the resumption
of six-party talks.

414
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,502
Great! That's a great idea.

415
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,379
But is that the best we can do?

416
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,428
Then what do you think should happen?

417
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,014
How would I know?
That's for the politicians. I'm off.

418
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,307
What the...?

419
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,146
What a klutz.

420
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,483
Dong-goo! Hey, Dong-goo!

421
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,236
GOLD SILVER JEWELRY

422
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,155
PURE GOLD JEWELERS

423
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,699
Welcome.

424
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,451
Hello. Do you buy gold rings?

425
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,078
Yes, we do.

426
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,829
What do you want to sell?

427
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,623
This.

428
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,254
I'm sorry. It's right here.

429
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,549
How much can I get for it?
It's gold, 18-karat gold.

430
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,053
Is that what you came back for?

431
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,183
Soo-ah.

432
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,897
Why didn't you tell me?
We could've looked for it together.

433
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,317
We're behind on our water bill
and our water was cut off.

434
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,529
-The electricity will be, too.
-Is that so? Then...

435
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,740
you should sell this, too.

436
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,328
You left your phone behind.

437
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,749
Soo-ah...

438
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,562
Sung-woong, you're hilarious.

439
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,522
How did all that really happen to you?

440
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,653
Unbelievable.

441
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,199
Hello, sir.

442
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,499
I apologize for not understanding you
properly yesterday.

443
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,876
Please forgive me!

444
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,515
Thank you for your forgiveness.

445
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,444
You understood this time.

446
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,112
You're finally getting it.

447
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,782
Really? I got it right?

448
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,783
Yeah.

449
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,827
He went like this
and even patted you on the shoulder.

450
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,539
Make sure you don't upset him
anymore, okay?

451
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,458
Sure.

452
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,462
This really works!

453
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,768
Oh, my. Sorry.

454
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,938
Cut! Okay!

455
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,816
That's a wrap!

456
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,903
Thank you, sir.

457
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,953
Thank you for complimenting me.
I'll do my best.

458
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,421
What? Really?

459
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,718
Got it, Sung-woong!

460
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,846
Listen up, everyone!
Sung-woong has offered

461
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,764
to treat us to a beef party tonight!

462
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,896
Park Sung-woong!

463
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,650
Park Sung-woong!

464
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,788
Sung-woong, you should make a toast.

465
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,546
Thank you for the food!

466
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,630
Thank you!

467
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,548
Cheers!

468
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,633
Cheers!

469
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,442
My stomach's having a field day.
Loving the beef.

470
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,363
Thank you for the great meal, sir.

471
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,579
What's wrong?

472
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,957
Excuse me?

473
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,295
Huh?

474
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,924
Why...

475
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,641
I'm home.

476
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,024
What happened? What's with the mood?

477
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,319
Joon-ki's done with acting.

478
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,904
-Why?
-Park Sung-woong

479
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,991
told him he had rice on his face,
but Joon-ki kissed him instead.

480
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,618
Why'd he do that?

481
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,539
He had a strange look.
Anybody would've misunderstood.

482
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,751
I thought he wanted a kiss
in return for buying us beef!

483
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,336
What's wrong with you?

484
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,883
He found his ring and took it
to the jeweler, and Soo-ah caught him.

485
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,800
What?

486
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,262
That's how she looked at me--

487
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,306
full of contempt.

488
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,685
But that means we can pay
the water bill, right?

489
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,228
I didn't sell it.

490
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,356
I know I've hit rock bottom,
but I couldn't sell the ring.

491
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,526
What are we going to do?
How can we have guests without water?

492
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,445
That's what I'm saying.

493
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,993
We're a bunch of pathetic losers,
aren't we?

494
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:56,456
How is it the three of us can't come up
with 400k over two days?

495
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:08,593
I think it's about time we gave up.

496
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,554
Give up? What do you mean?

497
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,098
The guesthouse. Let's close down.

498
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,185
What? We were going to make money
together, make a movie,

499
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,354
-and go to Cannes!
-Wake up, man.

500
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,815
A movie? In our situation?
We can barely make ends meet.

501
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,778
He's got a point. This isn't right.

502
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,324
The guesthouse and the movie.
We should just give it all up.

503
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:36,245
All I've done in my life is give up.
What kind of life is this?

504
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,332
What do we do about her?

505
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,418
What else?
We have to take her to the police.

506
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,629
She was abandoned.
How can we take responsibility?

507
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,006
Let's feed her one last time, then.

508
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,841
We're out of formula.

509
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,524
Is this the formula she's on?

510
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,820
Why is it so expensive?

511
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,322
Do you have money?

512
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,907
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

513
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,200
That's ours.

514
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,744
We picked it up and put it down.
We were going to buy it.

515
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,830
Whoever picks it up keeps it.

516
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,332
I just told you, it's ours.

517
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,001
What are you doing? Let go.

518
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,588
What's the matter?
What's going on?

519
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,383
These guys are insisting
this formula is theirs.

520
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,219
We just put it down for a second.

521
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,596
You're making a fuss over nothing.

522
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,017
You guys should just give up.

523
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,393
Excuse me?

524
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,439
You want us to give up?

525
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,107
Why?

526
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,692
Why should we give up?

527
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,110
I just meant that...

528
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,320
We tried our best, but it didn't work out.

529
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,782
We gave our all, but the world
wasn't on our side. What are we to do?

530
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,703
We built that place from the ground up--
painting, decorating, pasting wallpaper!

531
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,205
It was our last ray of hope!

532
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,168
-What... are you guys talking about?
-We can give up everything else,

533
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,336
but not this formula, got it?

534
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,130
Give it to me!

535
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,550
-Me neither!
-Me three!

536
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,633
Did you see the look on that woman's face?

537
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,386
-She turned pale.
-I know.

538
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,181
She shouldn't have messed with us.

539
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,520
What a great day to have formula.

540
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,980
A warm bottle of formula.

541
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,193
What are you doing?

542
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,528
Filming a movie?

543
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,656
What's the harm in having some fun?

544
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,200
-You're such a party pooper.
-I know.

545
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,204
Hey, you saw how we protected
your formula, right?

546
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,373
Remember this, okay?

547
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,001
Seriously. You'd better not forget.

548
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,920
That's right, little fellow.

549
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:50,857
They're sleepy?

550
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,875
Let's go!

551
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,378
Let's go! We've got guests!

552
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,591
Let's go!

553
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:21,971
Guests?

554
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,347
Guests.

555
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,894
-Guests?
-Guests!

556
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,445
What on Earth is happening here?

557
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,363
-This isn't a dream, is it?
-Seriously.

558
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,866
We haven't had this many people here
since the opening party.

559
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,160
The baby was our good-luck charm.

560
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,161
Seriously.

561
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,456
So we settled our utility bills with this.

562
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,667
If we keep this up, we can pay off
our loan and make our movie.

563
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,837
Happy, aren't you?
Didn't you want to give up earlier?

564
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,340
Well, that was just...

565
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,051
I meant we should give up
on giving up, man.

566
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,844
Get out of the way.

567
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,056
Punk.

568
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,726
I'm exhausted.

569
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,314
Really, is that so?

570
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,150
Is our princess feeling good right now?

571
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,195
You like me that much, huh?

572
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,030
Do you have to talk like that?

573
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,409
Does it bother poor little Dong-goo
when I talk like this?

574
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,621
-Enough.
-Have some respect, man.

575
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,249
Is our Dong-goo upset?

576
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,043
-You're so scary.
-Don't.

577
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,671
Let's hide from him. He's the devil.

578
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,589
I told you to stop! Enough, already!

579
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,012
Why did you yell? She's crying now!

580
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,474
Wait, I think she's hungry.

581
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,018
-Where's the formula?
-In the kitchen.

582
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,479
Coming right up, little princess.

583
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,023
I'll be right back with your milk.

584
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,316
How cute.

585
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,819
Come here.

586
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,247
By the way, did her parents
really abandon her?

587
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,457
How could they do that
to such a cute baby?

588
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,252
I'm sure there's a reason.

589
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,920
What if they never come for her?

590
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,755
Then we'll raise her, punk.

591
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,215
You saw customers line up,
thanks to her.

592
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,092
I'm afraid her mom
will actually come for her.

593
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,970
Anyhow, it doesn't make sense
for us to raise her.

594
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,722
Whatever! We can think about that later.

595
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,725
Time to feed our lucky charm.

596
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,603
-Jeez.
-Time to eat, our little--

597
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,106
Where is she?

598
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,151
Hey! Our lucky charm!

599
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,570
What is it?

600
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,327
Stop right there!

601
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,621
It's a thief!

602
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,457
Catch him!

603
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,523
Hey! Stop right there!

604
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,401
Thief!

605
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,028
Stop!

606
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,112
Hey, you!

607
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,284
Why'd you stop?

608
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,223
-Are you all right?
-Sorry, ma'am.

609
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,641
Get up.

610
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,394
After him.

611
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,067
You're one hell of a runner, aren't you?

612
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,486
You're dead meat. Look at me.

613
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,824
Oh, my.

614
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,326
Are you all right? You're not hurt?

615
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,953
I'm Lee Joon-ki.

616
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,457
Your name is?

617
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,338
FAMILY TIES

618
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,133
I'm sorry, Sol.

619
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,678
Mommy's so sorry.

620
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,763
I was wrong. I'll never do it again.

621
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,932
I'm sorry.

622
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,726
I'm really sorry, Sol.

623
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,520
Is her name Sol?

624
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,482
You shouldn't have abandoned her
in the first place.

625
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,069
You're being too harsh.

626
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,865
Was it tough?
Need a shoulder to cry on?

627
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,367
Really? In this situation?

628
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,535
Why? What did I do?

629
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,786
Stop it, both of you.

630
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,664
Why did you leave the baby?

631
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,832
Yeah, why?

632
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,835
Where's the baby's dad?

633
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,170
The dad?

634
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,174
-Then where do you live?
-Right, where?

635
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,052
Stop crying and say something!

636
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,305
Then we can at least take you home.

637
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,891
She must have her reasons.
Stop pushing her!

638
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,230
Sorry for all the trouble.
I'll leave now.

639
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,566
Now? Do you have a place to stay?

640
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,236
You can't just go anywhere
with a baby at this hour.

641
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,905
Stay here for the night.

642
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,199
For the night? What are you saying?

643
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,701
-We don't have rooms.
-She can sleep in Seo-jin's room.

644
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,953
She won't be home until tomorrow anyway.

645
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,122
That's all right. I don't want
to cause any more trouble.

646
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,750
It's no trouble.
You should stay the night.

647
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,419
Don't mind this jerk.

648
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,215
He's so twisted right now
after being dumped by his girlfriend.

649
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,299
Who got dumped?

650
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,343
We mutually agreed to break up.

651
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,803
I don't have feelings for Soo-ah anymore.

652
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,264
Why would you bring that up?

653
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,520
Fine. No need to get upset, man.

654
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,063
-You punk!
-Stop it.

655
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,983
It's all right.
Don't worry about him. Follow me.

656
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,070
Calmly and slowly.

657
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,336
I'm so sleepy.

658
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,881
I have to sleep.

659
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,384
I have to sleep...

660
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,190
Who are you?

661
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,567
Are you a thief?

662
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,193
No, that's not it. I'm...

663
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,988
What the hell is that?

664
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,157
-What's going on?
-It's a fire!

665
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,450
It's a thief!

666
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,618
-What happened?
-What happened?

667
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,245
Thief! There's a thief!

668
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,706
Right here... a thief.

669
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,584
Shit... I really thought something was up.

670
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,128
You made a fuss over nothing.

671
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,298
Yoon-ah, are you all right?
You must've been startled.

672
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,133
What? You know her?

673
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,261
You see, her name is Yoon-ah.
She came here last night.

674
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,555
Hey, Chewbacca. You look good.

675
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,140
You're all woman now.

676
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,060
What? You bastard.

677
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,896
-Get out! Now!
-Don't.

678
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,485
So that's what happened.

679
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,695
You should've called me or something.

680
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,948
I don't believe we're close enough
that I'd call about something like this.

681
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,661
-I guess not.
-I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

682
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,455
Not at all.
I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

683
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,917
Anyway, it's late.
Sleep with Yoon-ah just for tonight.

684
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,002
-I have to sleep with her?
-Should she sleep with me?

685
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,089
You know I can't sleep with anyone else.

686
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,591
I said no, but they insisted.

687
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,759
There are other rooms.

688
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,178
We are fully booked.

689
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,930
Not a single room is empty? How?

690
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,598
It's a long story,
but that's what happened.

691
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,183
so you should just sleep with her tonight.

692
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,395
How am I supposed to share a bed
with someone I just met?

693
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,355
Stop making a fuss.

694
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,481
Sleep on the floor, then!

695
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,776
You just had to wake everyone up,
didn't you? Put this away!

696
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,446
Hey, this isn't your room. Let's go in.

697
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,573
Sleep inside. Let go of this.

698
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,743
Gosh.

699
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:41,697
Oh, my God!

700
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,742
You should've woken me up.

701
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,328
You were sleeping so peacefully.

702
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,206
I'm sorry. I'm pretty active when I sleep.

703
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,793
Did I do anything to offend you?

704
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,671
No, you farted a few times is all.

705
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:58,922
It didn't even smell much.

706
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,646
-Thank you.
-Gosh.

707
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,774
Your toast looks like it's bleeding.

708
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,904
Cover your mouth.
We have guests here, you know.

709
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,990
I didn't sleep well. It was uncomfortable.

710
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,617
-Why?
-Why do you think?

711
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,244
I slept in the same bed
with someone I just met.

712
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,623
I'm about to fall asleep, the baby cries.
Then the mom would snore.

713
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,584
That woman has a gift
of making people feel uncomfortable.

714
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,419
On top of that--

715
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,420
What?

716
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,472
I'm sorry about last night.
I'll get going now.

717
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,682
You have nowhere to go.
Stay a few more days.

718
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:51,600
What was that?

719
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,311
You punk, she has nowhere to go.
You're so cold-hearted.

720
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,105
No, it's really okay.

721
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,982
Then you should at least have
some breakfast.

722
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,944
No, it's really all right.
I'm not hungry at all.

723
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,115
-Jeez.
-Sit down. Have some toast.

724
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,993
What a mess.

725
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,052
Eat slowly.

726
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,429
Drink some milk as well.

727
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:33,433
Doo-sik is looking after the baby,
so don't worry.

728
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,227
I'll get you some more.

729
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,232
What do I do?

730
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,900
Why, what's wrong?

731
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,778
I don't know. She just started crying
and won't calm down.

732
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,905
Gosh, look at the time.

733
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,366
Thank you.

734
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,244
You must be hungry. Mommy's sorry.

735
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,787
Let me feed you.

736
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,459
Two pieces of toast coming up--

737
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,506
-She startled me.
-What the hell?

738
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,716
-What?
-What was that?

739
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,009
-Did you see?
-No.

740
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:10,095
What did I say?
She makes you feel uncomfortable, right?

741
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,224
What's happening? That's strange.

742
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,643
What is it?

743
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,605
She won't take my nipple.

744
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,523
Then should I mix some formula?

745
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,067
No, Sol has a weak immune system,

746
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,320
so I was going to breastfeed her
until her first birthday.

747
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,739
Should I extract?

748
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,907
Extract what? How?

749
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,993
I don't even have a breast pump.
What'll I do?

750
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,871
-What's a breast pump? Do you know?
-How would I know?

751
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,372
-Ask her.
-Excuse me.

752
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,583
What's a breast pump?

753
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,168
A breast pump is...

754
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,545
a machine that extracts breast milk.

755
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,423
You have to extract it
when the baby can't suck correctly.

756
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,218
Where... where can I get one of those?

757
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,845
Well...

758
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,847
They carry it at baby stores.

759
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:58,060
But it's actually a bit expensive,
and I don't have any money.

760
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,436
Okay, we'll get it for you.

761
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,648
We'll get it. Please just stay still.

762
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,734
-I'll go.
-I'll come with you.

763
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,860
I have to get to my shift.

764
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,445
No way!

765
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,740
Take me with you, please.

766
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,492
We have guests.

767
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,535
-You need to stay.
-Stay, Seo-jin.

768
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,536
-Sorry.
-Why?

769
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,413
She makes me uncomfortable.

770
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,832
-Please take me.
-Take care of her, Chewbacca.

771
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,626
Joon-ki, please!

772
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,721
I mean, I know they say
moms only care about their babies,

773
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,057
but how could she expose herself
in front of us guys?

774
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,310
I was shocked.

775
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,812
I know.

776
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,815
They have all sorts of things here.

777
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,484
What does a breast pump look like?

778
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,653
They sell clothes, too?

779
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,116
What? There's nothing inside.

780
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,909
Why is it...?

781
00:49:58,995 --> 00:49:59,830
Hello. How are you?

782
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,208
What you're looking at right now
is a breastfeeding dress.

783
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,294
What is it, you ask?
When you're out with your adorable baby

784
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,839
and he suddenly cries because he's hungry,

785
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:13,009
but there are so many people around
that it's difficult to breastfeed,

786
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,594
not to worry, sir.

787
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,390
Just open this zipper right here,
take your breast out,

788
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,852
and you'll be able to breastfeed
without coming into anyone's view.

789
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,731
In short, it's a "breast pocket."

790
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,232
A breast-- oh...!

791
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,276
A breast pocket.

792
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,696
So many interesting things.

793
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,198
What's this?

794
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,118
Hello. How are you?

795
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,079
What you're holding right now
is called a nursing pad.

796
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,414
What is that, you ask?

797
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,625
Your baby sucks and sucks Mommy's nipple
and eventually becomes full.

798
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,503
Then what does he do?
He takes his mouth off of her nipple.

799
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,839
Then what happens?

800
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:56,219
The breast milk will begin to spurt out
like a fountain.

801
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,014
When that happens,
you can apply a nursing pad

802
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,600
and breathe a sigh of relief.

803
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:07,063
In short, it's a protective film
for breast milk.

804
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:15,614
Is there something you're looking for?

805
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,575
I came to buy a breast pump.

806
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,343
The awkwardness is killing me.

807
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,929
I have to say something. Anything.

808
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,101
Look at how dark the baby's eyebrows are.

809
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,312
Oh, how chubby.

810
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,980
So dashing, you little prince.

811
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:49,981
She's a girl.

812
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,734
I see.

813
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,320
She has a boyish charm.

814
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,239
Girl crushes are in these days, right?

815
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,491
She must be a total daddy's girl!

816
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,408
We split up.

817
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,830
I see.

818
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,917
Being a single mom
isn't the end of the world.

819
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,126
Who cares about the dad?

820
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,671
Her grandparents
can give her twice the love.

821
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,674
They both passed away.

822
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,759
In a fire...

823
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:19,886
when I was two.

824
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,482
Dong-goo, come home. Hurry!

825
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:38,864
There are manual breast pumps
and electric breast pumps.

826
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:42,075
With the manual breast pump
you take this funnel,

827
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:46,580
put it right up against the breast,
then pull the handle so it goes...

828
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,584
zip, zip, zip, zip...

829
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,836
and you're able to extract
the breast milk.

830
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,256
With the electric breast pump, all you
need to do is press the power button

831
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,383
and 40 to 50 times a minute,
the pump will go...

832
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,427
zip, zip, zip, zip...

833
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,185
Okay, enough. Please just give us
anything. Stop explaining.

834
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,271
Please, I beg you.

835
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,568
The culture shock is earth-shattering.

836
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,529
-Right?
-Yeah.

837
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,949
Do you want a Xanax?

838
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,410
That sounds good.

839
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,371
Hey, that's Soo-ah.

840
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,583
Dong-goo, I just saw--

841
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,670
Dong-goo?

842
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,131
What are you doing?

843
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,302
Oh, my, there's a pillar here.

844
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,721
Wow, look how sturdy it is.

845
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,641
No shit, pillars are sturdy.

846
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,936
Don't tell me...

847
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,938
-Hey, Soo-ah!
-What are you doing?

848
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,483
Stop. Don't. What's wrong with you?

849
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,235
-Stop it.
-Jeez.

850
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,656
Get on your knees and beg
if you can't get over her!

851
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,116
Why? Why would I get on my knees and beg?

852
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,327
Selling your ring
isn't something to be proud of.

853
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,412
That was...

854
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,040
I told you not to bring that up. Don't!

855
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,626
I can tell
you still have feelings for her.

856
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,169
I said I don't!

857
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,840
Fine, keep that damn pride of yours

858
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,218
and live a life filled with regret.

859
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,678
Soo-ah went that way.

860
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,554
And I'm going that way. Bye.

861
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,932
-You stay here.
-I'm coming with you.

862
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,517
Wait for her to leave.

863
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,626
Ah, fuck it.

864
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,964
What good will keeping my pride do?
Fine, I'll get down on my knees.

865
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,383
Better than regretting it
the rest of my life.

866
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,437
Hey... Soo--

867
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,563
Soo-ah!

868
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,775
Yoon-suk, you're late.

869
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,945
Sorry, but I'll make up for it
with a delicious bowl of pasta.

870
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,114
Let's go.

871
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,745
-What's wrong with him?
-Who?

872
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,456
He just fainted. Hold on.

873
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,500
Are you okay?

874
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,462
Are you in pain?

875
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,465
Excuse me.

876
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:46,843
Excuse me.

877
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,470
Lift your head.

878
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,388
Excuse me, sir.

879
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,016
Hang in there, okay?

880
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,227
Joon-ki!

881
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,480
What took you so long?

882
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,024
Stop it, you're suffocating me!

883
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,901
It was so awkward, I was going insane!

884
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,487
I was about to go crazy myself
over this thing.

885
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,447
Why? Did something happen?

886
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,616
Don't even ask.
I don't want to think about it.

887
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,367
-That's why--
-Enough! Go inside.

888
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,411
Go on.

889
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,331
Yoon-ah, your breast pump is here.

890
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,958
Thank you.
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

891
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,420
It was nothing. Sol must be hungry.
You should feed her.

892
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,923
Sol, you must be starving.

893
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,050
Let's get you some milk.

894
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,135
There, there.

895
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,595
So this is what it looks like.

896
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,182
Damn it.

897
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,187
-What's wrong with her?
-What did I tell you?

898
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,731
She makes you feel uncomfortable.

899
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,320
-What's wrong with this?
-Why? What's the matter?

900
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,155
I still can't get any milk to come out.

901
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,034
-My glands must be clogged.
-Her glands?

902
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,286
What's a gland?

903
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,164
It's where the milk comes from.

904
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,707
It must be clogged.

905
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,334
Then what do we do about that?

906
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,045
I'll need to get a massage to unclog it,

907
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,756
but the lactation specialist
is quite expensive.

908
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,592
Okay, fine. I'll get you one
even if I have to take out a loan!

909
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,345
So please, just stay still!

910
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,435
Excuse me? 100,000 won per visit?

911
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,353
It is very expensive.

912
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,188
Can she come right away?

913
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,525
Pardon? No, that won't work.

914
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,194
-Okay, thank you.
-What? Can't she do it?

915
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,699
They're fully booked up until next week.
What do we do?

916
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,325
That's too bad.

917
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,789
-What's wrong?
-My breasts are engorged and the pain is--

918
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,583
Oh, no.

919
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,672
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

920
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,466
-You do it.
-Do what?

921
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,634
-What do you want me to do?
-The massage.

922
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,052
Massage her breasts.

923
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,138
It's not rocket science.
Just squeeze them.

924
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,347
Are you crazy?

925
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,433
You want me to massage
a stranger's breasts?

926
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,310
Should I do it? Of course, I want to.

927
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,897
I'd take it on as a profession if I could.
What do you think? Should I just do it?

928
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,608
-You're insane!
-So you do it!

929
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,110
Don't you feel bad?
She's in so much pain.

930
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,445
Ouch, that hurts.

931
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,113
I do feel bad. Really, I do...

932
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,033
But how can I massage
someone else's breasts?

933
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,659
Just do it.

934
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,495
Really, it's fine. I'm okay--

935
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:21,623
That really hurts.

936
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:28,171
I'm going nuts.

937
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,216
You're going nuts?

938
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,889
Excuse me, are you all right?

939
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,434
I'm going nuts.

940
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,145
Please leave. Leave, you bastard!

941
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,397
Yoon-suk, let's just go.

942
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:51,569
How can we just go?
I can't leave a sick man behind.

943
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:55,114
Leave me.
Please leave me behind and go, you jerk.

944
00:58:59,035 --> 00:58:59,869
Over here.

945
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,832
Did you make the call?

946
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,293
He suddenly collapsed
and is unable to get back up.

947
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,796
I think he hurt his face.

948
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,005
Really?

949
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,051
Sir, can you hear me?

950
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,803
Please stand up.

951
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,015
This won't do. We'll have to force him up.

952
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,475
Grab him.

953
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,687
On three. One, two...

954
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,817
Sir, please relax. Let's go again.

955
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,402
One, two...

956
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,157
He's so stiff.
Call a hospital for help.

957
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,701
Hold on.

958
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,997
Okay, I'll get up.

959
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,623
Are you feeling better now?

960
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,544
This is going to be so embarrassing.

961
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:50,628
Ah, fuck it.

962
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,994
Sir.

963
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:27,540
Are you okay?

964
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,003
Oh, my God, he must've hurt his head.

965
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,708
I'll...

966
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,627
get started, then.

967
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,800
I'm so tired.

968
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,844
When will I be able
to stop working part-time?

969
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,015
Goodness.
I'm probably the only CEO in the world

970
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,850
who does part-time gigs to pay the bills.

971
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,440
What's this?

972
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,989
What's happening?

973
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,701
Oh, my God! Unbelievable.

974
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:48,246
Goodness! Oh, my God!

975
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,711
What happened? Did you succeed?

976
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:56,671
Can't you tell?

977
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,382
I thought I struck an oil well
or something.

978
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,342
What a relief.

979
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,971
You did good. I'm so proud of you.

980
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,891
Shut up. Where's the breast pump?
She wants me to bring it.

981
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,602
The breast pump? It's in the living room.

982
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,983
By the way, is she older than you?
She looks so much younger.

983
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:17,900
What?

984
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,486
I've been too easy on you lately,
haven't I?

985
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,864
Just playing with you. It was a joke.

986
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:23,781
Joke, my ass.

987
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,991
-It's a joke.
-Come here.

988
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,411
It's a joke! I was just messing with you!

989
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,913
God, that feels good.

990
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,042
Let go.

991
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,336
-You punk!
-You startled me!

992
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,963
What are you doing,
you crazy son of a bitch?

993
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,048
-What? What did I do?
-"What"?

994
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,343
Why, do you ask?

995
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,596
Do you know what this is?

996
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,389
Stop hitting me! Isn't this a massager?

997
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,640
Massager, my ass!

998
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,977
This is used to extract-- you jerk!

999
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,228
It feels good! Try it.

1000
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,397
Try what? Do you know how sacred this is?

1001
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,401
Do you even know how much this costs?
You punk!

1002
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,988
You are our only problem.

1003
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,156
Joon-ki.

1004
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,035
Why do you look like that?
What happened?

1005
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,454
Don't ask.

1006
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,211
Why is it so quiet? Where are the guests?

1007
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,630
They're holding a party on the rooftop.

1008
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,591
-They went crazy over grilled pork belly.
-Yeah, they did.

1009
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,301
That's great. Well done.

1010
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,595
Oh, right.

1011
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,430
The woman and the baby. Did they leave?

1012
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,892
Yeah, of course they did. They left.

1013
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,520
That's great.

1014
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:39,816
Doesn't the house feel empty without Sol?

1015
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,110
I wonder how Yoon-ah's doing.
They've got nowhere to go.

1016
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,862
-I'm so worried.
-Right, Joon-ki?

1017
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,906
I know. They could've just stayed here.

1018
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,991
You're worried about them, aren't you?

1019
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:50,910
What is this?

1020
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,079
Why are you all so suspicious?

1021
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,958
You're hiding something from me.

1022
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,544
-What is there to hide?
-What are you talking about?

1023
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,921
-Have some faith.
-Seriously.

1024
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:11,013
Isn't that the sound of a baby crying?

1025
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,182
I didn't hear anything.

1026
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,393
-Me neither.
-Me three.

1027
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,941
Seo-jin, my glands are clogged again.
Can you help?

1028
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,155
Why is she still here?

1029
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,782
You said she left.

1030
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,409
Who? That woman?

1031
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,619
That's not Yoon-ah. It's someone else.

1032
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,580
Yes, Yoo-sun. She'll be right there.

1033
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,916
Is that so? Okay, then.

1034
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,295
You think I'm a sucker, is that it?
You fools!

1035
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,131
Hey, hey. Dong-goo!

1036
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,008
Don't you feel bad for her?

1037
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,844
We may not be rich,
but we're warmhearted people.

1038
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,220
We're neither, you scumbag!

1039
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,431
Hey, Dong-goo!

1040
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,266
-We have spare rooms, and--
-Let go!

1041
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,601
I said let go!

1042
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,519
Let's do this! What--

1043
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,731
Let her stay here, please?

1044
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,650
Yoon-ah, go inside!

1045
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,737
-It's all right.
-Go inside!

1046
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,273
That woman...
she'll definitely get into big trouble.

1047
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,275
Oh, my gosh!

1048
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,568
Oh, my gosh!

1049
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,571
-Oh, my gosh!
-I don't like her.

1050
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,615
-I really don't like her.
-Can you buy this for me?

1051
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,659
-Who is she?
-My girlfriend.

1052
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:55,743
Girlfriend?

1053
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:59,330
It's a Korean version of X-Men.
It'll be a big hit!

1054
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:02,083
I'll get rid of your role if you mess up
the costume. Got it?

1055
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,250
Take this!

1056
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,335
Oh, my gosh!

1057
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,670
Freeze!

1058
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,297
What a tough life you lead.

1059
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,924
Chewbacca? Seo-jin.

1060
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,258
Yoon-ah.

1061
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,095
I can't go half a day
without my mustache growing out.

1062
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,639
Chewbacca! I'm dying here!

1063
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,100
Did you cook that stew with this mushroom?

1064
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,435
-Everyone's sick right now because--
-I'm so sorry!

1065
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,563
I can't let this go on.
Pack up and go, right now.

1066
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,148
What are you doing?

1067
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,275
Soo-ah...
