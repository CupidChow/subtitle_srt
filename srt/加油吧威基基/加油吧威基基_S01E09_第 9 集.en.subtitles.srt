1
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,256
Shall I start cleaning now?

2
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,593
Hey, Dong-goo. You...

3
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,345
That's why you ran when the supermarket
was on fire and the coat...

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,683
So the person you like isn't me...

5
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,060
but Yoon-ah?

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,728
What?

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,689
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,983
Don't play dumb.
Ye-rin told me everything!

9
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,276
What?

10
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,154
What? She said she'd keep it a secret!
She told you already?

11
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,489
You--

12
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,161
Did you see Ye-rin off?

13
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,662
Pardon?

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,626
I'm speechless.

15
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,211
This is pretty amazing.

16
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,132
What's the matter, Soo-ah?

17
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,675
So it turns out

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,302
that Dong-goo doesn't like me, but likes--

19
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,137
Hey Soo-ah! Why don't we...

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,140
Come here. I have to talk to you!

21
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,017
What's going on?

22
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,852
What's wrong with them?

23
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,443
-I couldn't breathe!
-Sorry.

24
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,404
Do you really like Yoon-ah?

25
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,989
Then why'd you act like it was me?

26
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,658
Well...

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,785
I was worried she'd find out.

28
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,036
What?

29
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,122
So you've been using me

30
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,373
just so she wouldn't find out?

31
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,626
It just happened that way. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,670
But Soo-ah,

33
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,463
can't you keep it a secret for now?

34
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,091
-Why would I do that?
-Well...

35
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,927
I'm still a bit confused.

36
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,387
Please?

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,057
I beg of you.

38
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,145
-Fine! So stop it.
-You promise?

39
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,564
Just leave. Hurry.

40
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,023
Okay, I'm leaving.

41
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,362
Hey, Soo-ah.

42
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,905
Can you give that coat to Yoon-ah?

43
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,449
-I bought it for her.
-What?

44
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,036
She keeps getting sick
because she's very fragile.

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,080
-Her coat is too thin.
-Okay, fine.

46
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,541
I'll give it to her. Happy?

47
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,295
Thanks, Soo-ah. You're the best!

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,549
What a jerk.

49
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,342
That was a blow to my pride.

50
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,137
My goodness. I can't believe it.

51
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,144
"SECRET"

52
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,690
Who knew I'd come back here voluntarily?

53
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,026
This is crazy.

54
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,333
-Hello, sir.
-Mr. Bong,

55
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,085
when do you plan on returning
Mal-geum's signing bonus?

56
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,921
I'm sorry. Please give me some more time.

57
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,298
I'll get you the money somehow,

58
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,383
so please don't say anything to Mal-geum.

59
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,636
Please, sir.

60
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,182
Hello-- Hello?

61
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,269
I'm going to lose my mind!

62
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,692
Darn it.

63
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,161
You'll end up spending more than
you make on pain relief patches!

64
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,288
How will you save up enough at this rate?

65
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,416
What else can I do?
I have to do something.

66
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,543
Does she even know
what you're going through?

67
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,711
She doesn't, right?

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,672
So just confess and tell her how you feel.

69
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,299
I need to pay back
the signing bonus first.

70
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,467
-You...
-Ow!

71
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,719
Doo-sik, there's someone here for you.

72
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,471
Who's here to see me?

73
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,353
Mal-geum.

74
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,900
She's that first love
you mentioned before, right?

75
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,735
What? Yeah.

76
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,490
Where's the milk again?

77
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,783
There it is!

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,827
Hey, that's mine!

79
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,578
Mal-geum likes to drink lattes.

80
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,705
For goodness' sake.

81
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,957
You're really lively for someone

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,543
who looked like he was about to die.

83
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,296
The power of love is quite amazing,
isn't it?

84
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,133
You're right. The power of love
is really an amazing thing.

85
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,093
-Don't you agree, Dong-goo?
-What?

86
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,012
I don't know.

87
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,348
Yoon-ah, take this.

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,226
Excuse me? Why would I...

89
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,227
You should wear it.

90
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,147
It was way too small for me.

91
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,692
Still, it was a present
Dong-goo got for you. How could I...

92
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,445
It's fine.
Dong-goo won't care one little bit.

93
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,488
-Am I right?
-Sorry?

94
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,325
Oh, yeah... Sure.

95
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,578
Don't worry about me. You should take it.

96
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,457
Soo-ah and I are just friends.

97
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,335
Right. We're friends.

98
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,212
His love must be elsewhere.

99
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,256
Pardon?

100
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,764
Anyway, you should take this. Okay?

101
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,141
What the hell?
Did you have to throw it at her?

102
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,601
I don't want to throw it either,

103
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,438
but Sol cries like mad
whenever I get within a meter of her.

104
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,939
Are you serious?

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,316
Want to see?

106
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,695
Why'd you make her cry?

107
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,576
What? That's incredible!

108
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,412
Wow, she already knows
how to distinguish good from evil.

109
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,790
What a genius!

110
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,666
You're the devil! And she's a genius!

111
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,214
Joon-ki, what did you just say?
Do you have a death wish?

112
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,007
I must've lost it for a second.

113
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,887
Seeing these photos reminds me
of old times.

114
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,390
You and I were inseparable. Remember?

115
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,144
I'm curious. When did you start liking me?

116
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,312
What?

117
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,523
Why would you ask that?

118
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,484
Then explain this to me.

119
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,236
What's this?

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,239
You see...

121
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,490
You liked me, right?

122
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,826
Since when? Am I your first love?

123
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,702
No, this is...

124
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,787
Doo-sik, I brought you the patches--

125
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,081
I didn't know you had a guest.
Who is she?

126
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,125
She's a friend.

127
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,044
Friend? Oh!

128
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,546
Is she that first love you told us about?

129
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,755
Seo-jin!

130
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,841
What are you saying? That's not true!

131
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,758
Go. Now.

132
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,760
Fine, I'll go.

133
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,346
Here I am, doing you a favor
and you're getting mad at me?

134
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,723
Go!

135
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,893
-Enjoy yourselves!
-Hey!

136
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,775
What's with the patches?
Are you injured?

137
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,987
It's nothing. I just hurt myself
while working at the construction si--

138
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,280
A construction site?

139
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,867
My friend asked me to help out

140
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,034
because he was short-handed.

141
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,746
Is it because of me, by any chance?

142
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,914
Because of my contract?

143
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,542
No, that's already taken care of.

144
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,295
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

145
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,505
So stop worrying about that

146
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,090
and do well on your audition
for the drama.

147
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,143
I couldn't even work
because I caught a cold.

148
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,188
When will I be able to pay them back?

149
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,442
I feel like dying.

150
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,945
TESTING FOR NEW DRUGS
HIGH PAYING PART-TIME JOB

151
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,326
Two million won per week?

152
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,702
Two million?

153
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,329
-Two million?
-Yeah.

154
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,957
Let me in on it, too.

155
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,668
It's for cold meds,
so you have to have a cold to qualify.

156
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,045
A cold?

157
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,047
I'll get myself a cold, dammit.

158
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,465
How?

159
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,176
Let's do this!

160
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,012
Joon-ki, must you go this far?

161
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,098
I must.
It's for two million won a week.

162
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,226
Two million!

163
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,562
-Do it!
-I don't know anymore.

164
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm doing it.

165
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,819
-Man, that's cold.
-Are you all right?

166
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,613
I'm saying it's cold.

167
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,657
Let's catch this cold!

168
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,999
Let's do this! Let's get sick!

169
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,548
Don't cry, Sol. Let's see here.

170
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,467
Stop crying, baby.

171
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,140
Let's see.

172
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,143
What's wrong, Sol?

173
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,979
-Let's take a look at you.
-Got you!

174
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,397
Please stop.

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,731
What's the matter?

176
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,525
Help Mommy out, please?

177
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,194
Give me a sec.

178
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,906
Excuse me. Do you mind if I try?

179
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,242
Pardon?

180
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,618
Hold on, Hoon.

181
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,751
Hello!

182
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,798
Isn't that an interesting sound?
Fascinating, right?

183
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,134
You can stop crying now.
Play with this with your mommy, okay?

184
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,846
That's really cool.

185
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,973
Babies love these sorts of sounds.

186
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,974
They have sensitive ears.

187
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,769
Thank you. You saved me.

188
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,938
It was nothing at all.

189
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
Thanks.

190
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,901
-Take care.
-Bye.

191
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,321
Let's go home, Sol.

192
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,743
Dad, what are you staring at?

193
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,663
It's just she reminds me of myself.

194
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,210
I was exactly like her
when you were young, Hoon.

195
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,421
I was out of sorts
because I didn't know what I was doing.

196
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,507
I don't think that's why.

197
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,136
Dad, did you...
fall in love at first sight?

198
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,226
Where are Joon-ki and Doo-sik?

199
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,562
Doo-sik's sick in bed with a cold

200
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,940
and Joon-ki's probably doing something
absolutely absurd.

201
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,817
What's the rush?

202
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,527
You should sit down and eat slowly.

203
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,321
I have to eat when I can.

204
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,280
Why?

205
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,494
That's why.

206
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,667
Sol's been acting up recently.
I'm worried about her.

207
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,128
She can't even sleep
after struggling all day long.

208
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,130
I didn't know.

209
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,887
What the hell are you wearing?

210
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,888
Where'd you go dressed like that?

211
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,432
-I went for a walk.
-A walk?

212
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,184
In this weather? Wearing that?

213
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,560
I need to catch a cold.

214
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,104
You need to do what?

215
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,271
What are you saying?

216
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,606
Help us understand you.

217
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,192
The thing is, I need to participate
in a clinical trial,

218
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,320
but I have to be sick to do it.
What's a good way to catch a cold?

219
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,238
He's insane.

220
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,823
I'm dying.

221
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,324
Good one.

222
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,244
What the hell?

223
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,912
Why would you suck on my lollipop?

224
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,664
What do you think?
To catch your cold.

225
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,542
That's nasty! Do you really think
you'll get sick that way?

226
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,001
This won't do, right?

227
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,420
Take it back.

228
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,213
Damn it!

229
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,507
I need a sure-fire plan
to catch a cold....

230
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,595
Yes, this is it.

231
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,348
What's with your tongue?
Don't look at me like that!

232
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,766
Huh?

233
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,726
I came up with a foolproof way
of catching a cold.

234
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,437
Doo-sik...

235
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,480
let's kiss.

236
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,983
What? You want to kiss me?

237
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,900
Are you nuts?

238
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,277
Don't come close. Go away.

239
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,611
I've never done it before. Go!

240
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,613
-I said, go!
-No worries, man.

241
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,198
-It'll be over in a second.
-Crazy son of a bitch!

242
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,409
I've never done it before! Shit!

243
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,661
It'll be over before you know it.
Come on, Doo-sik.

244
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,455
While we're eating? Geez, you punks.

245
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,703
Sol...

246
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,164
do you know where your mom--

247
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,042
What on earth?

248
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,923
What the hell is going on here?

249
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,093
Dong-goo! Yoon-ah! Wake up!

250
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,478
Why would you sleep here?

251
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,021
Huh?

252
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,234
I fell asleep while studying
after I put Sol to bed.

253
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
Why are you sleeping here...

254
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,657
next to Yoon-ah?

255
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,161
What? Oh, that. It's because...

256
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,208
Ow, I have a headache.
I must've drank too much last night.

257
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,795
I didn't even know I fell asleep here.
I'm serious.

258
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,257
-God, I'm hung over.
-You shouldn't drink so much.

259
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,633
Don't you feel sorry for your liver?

260
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,344
Aren't you hungry?

261
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,512
I'll make breakfast.

262
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,556
-I'll help, Yoon-ah.
-Thanks.

263
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,765
You take Sol.

264
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:56,103
Yeah, sure. Good morning, dear Sol.

265
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,897
Did you sleep well?

266
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,070
Sure, just a moment.

267
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,122
What are you doing, Yoon-ah?

268
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,957
What do you mean?

269
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,251
Oh my God!

270
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,086
Ouch!

271
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,257
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

272
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,259
I'm okay...

273
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,555
I'm sorry. I'm a bit out of sorts.

274
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,307
This won't do.

275
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,851
Yoon-ah, you're on leave starting now.

276
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,394
So don't do anything

277
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,188
and go do everything
you've always wanted to.

278
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,066
-Pardon? I'm really okay.
-Hey.

279
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,610
Listen to me, okay?
I'm your boss, remember?

280
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,278
That's not--

281
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,114
What are you going? Go already!

282
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,158
Yeah, you need a break.

283
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,701
But still...

284
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,079
Just go. Hurry along.

285
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,497
Say bye to Mommy!

286
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,294
You're all set.

287
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,838
Keep pressure on it
until the bleeding stops.

288
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,342
Make sure you take this
at exactly nine o'clock on the dot.

289
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,927
Thank you.

290
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,931
This is a sweet deal.

291
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,183
I could do this forever!

292
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,102
I know, right? Two million a week

293
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,562
and all we have to do is give some blood,
take a pill and lie down all day?

294
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,440
-It's easy money, right?
-Totally.

295
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,406
MAL-GEUM

296
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,909
Isn't it Mal-geum?

297
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,328
Why won't you answer?

298
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,082
Just 'cause. I don't want to worry her.

299
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,043
Why would she worry? It's a sweet gig.

300
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,676
Sol, today's your mom's day off,

301
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,804
so let's have fun together, okay?

302
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,224
How devoted are you?

303
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,600
You're even taking care of her kid.

304
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,104
You were so selfish when we were dating.

305
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,480
You're a completely different person now.

306
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,816
No, I'm not.

307
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,446
What is it?

308
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,822
Would you like some?

309
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,408
You know you can't.

310
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,704
No, you can't.

311
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,081
Nope!

312
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,461
Now that you've filled up
on abalone porridge,

313
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,881
let's sit here for a while, okay?

314
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,258
Are you happy? I am, too!

315
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,846
Where is the birthday party file?

316
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,141
Time to take the pill.

317
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,185
Again? We just had--

318
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,938
-What's wrong with my voice?
-I don't know. You sound--

319
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,232
What's wrong with my voice?

320
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,818
Is it because we're sick?

321
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,533
Hey, you.

322
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,826
Don't I sound sexy?

323
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,455
Doo-sik.

324
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,832
It's been a while.

325
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,960
Please don't. Stop it.

326
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,754
That was really sexy.

327
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,964
I said, stop.

328
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,549
Excuse me.

329
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,551
Just take your pills.

330
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,220
Okay, we will.

331
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,347
But I don't want to!

332
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,390
Do you want me to feed you?

333
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,850
Kiss me, Joon-ki.

334
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,727
Oh, my God.

335
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,483
Oh, my God!

336
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,952
I'm so tired.

337
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,124
How much longer do I have to
take the birthday party gigs for?

338
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,584
I miss working on movies.

339
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,420
-What are you doing?
-Can't you see?

340
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,382
I'm editing birthday party videos
while drinking coffee.

341
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,800
Are you? What about Sol?

342
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,927
Sol? She's right here.

343
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,346
Where is she?

344
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,265
Why isn't she here?

345
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,850
Sol!

346
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,477
You think she'd be hiding in there?

347
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,603
Where is she?

348
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,313
I'm looking for her right now!

349
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,815
Where is she?

350
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,066
She's gone!

351
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,067
-Sol!
-Sol!

352
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,777
Is she here? No, there's no way.

353
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,195
-Sol!
-Sol!

354
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,613
Where are you, Sol?

355
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,073
Sol?

356
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,741
Where are you, Sol?

357
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,742
Are you here?

358
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,369
Hey, Sol! Where are you?

359
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,496
Are you here? No, you're not.

360
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,582
Sol...

361
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,003
Sol!

362
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,213
Where could she have gone?

363
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,757
What are you going to do now?

364
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,635
-What if something happened to her?
-I don't know!

365
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,431
How on earth will we find her?

366
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,351
Soo-ah.

367
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,610
This is what you had in mind?

368
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,237
Sol cries whenever Soo-ah
comes within one meter of her.

369
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,865
This will be much faster.

370
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,534
Are you looking for water?

371
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,452
Am I a radar?

372
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,787
You're really horrible to me these days.
Do you know that?

373
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,748
What can I do? We have to find her.

374
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,916
Spread your arms out.

375
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,627
Nice. Here we go.

376
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,506
This way.

377
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,384
Good.

378
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,932
What is it? Isn't that Sol crying?

379
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,562
Take a look.

380
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,231
There's nothing here.

381
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,359
I'm sure I heard something.

382
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,028
-Is she on the bed?
-Are you serious?

383
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,404
How would she get on the--

384
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,032
Here you are!

385
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,700
-Look at you.
-What?

386
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,496
What? How did she get on the bed?

387
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,206
Does this make sense? It doesn't?

388
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,708
That's not important.
As long as we found her.

389
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,253
How did you get up here, Sol?

390
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,880
Do you know how worried I was?

391
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,507
I'm glad she's fine.

392
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,720
Wait a sec. Why are her cheeks so flushed?

393
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,931
Just one second, Sol.

394
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,268
-She has a fever.
-What?

395
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,188
She does. What's the matter?

396
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,398
Sol.

397
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,236
Lee Joon-ki, Bong Doo-sik.
Wake up, please.

398
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,529
Time to take your blood.

399
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,782
Really? Okay.

400
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,914
What's wrong with my voice?

401
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,958
What's wrong with your--

402
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,252
What's wrong with my voice?

403
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,670
What is this?

404
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,381
Why do they sound like that?

405
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,258
Wait, I sound like that, too!

406
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,345
Same here.

407
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,889
What's going on? Oh, no!

408
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,308
Goodness. Doctor!

409
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,476
What the hell is going on?

410
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,187
What's wrong with my voice?

411
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,564
This is crazy.

412
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,610
Ah, ah.

413
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,446
Electronic.

414
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,031
Argentina.

415
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,618
Help. Doo-sik.

416
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,747
One plate of sundae, please.

417
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,749
-Wait just a moment, please.
-Thanks.

418
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:18,879
Hello.

419
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,258
You're the man
who helped calm Sol down, right?

420
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,093
Yes, we meet again.

421
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,512
Where is that adorable baby?

422
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,430
How come you're alone?

423
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,516
She must be with her dad today.

424
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,561
No, Sol doesn't have a dad.
I'm raising her alone.

425
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,022
I see.

426
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,650
I left Hoon with our helper.
It's been a while since I came out.

427
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,196
Are you on a date with your wife?

428
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,991
No. My wife died six years ago.

429
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,788
We don't even know each other's names.

430
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,289
I'm Song Hyun-joon.

431
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,083
I'm Han Yoon-ah.

432
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,751
It's nice you meet you again, Yoon-ah.

433
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,503
Likewise.

434
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,798
You have something right here...

435
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,759
-on your clothes.
-Excuse me?

436
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,011
Sol must've...

437
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,307
So the baby's the culprit, huh?

438
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,435
Hoon used to spit up so much as a baby.

439
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,187
He ruined all of my clothes.

440
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:19,981
Hold on.

441
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,528
Hey, Seo-jin. What's up?

442
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,696
What?

443
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,408
Sol does? Okay.

444
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,328
All right. I'm coming now. Bye.

445
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,788
Is something wrong?

446
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,040
Sol is sick. I have to go. Bye.

447
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,625
Bye.

448
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,092
Sol...

449
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,136
What's the matter with her?

450
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,597
She has enteritis.

451
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,016
Enteritis? All of a sudden?

452
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,852
She was fine this morning!

453
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,562
It's something she ate.

454
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,605
I didn't give her anything.

455
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,899
I can't even get within one meter of her.

456
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,317
There's got to be something.

457
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,696
I gave her something to eat.

458
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,573
What was it?

459
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,117
A tiny piece of bread from my corn dog...

460
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,952
From your corn dog?

461
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,538
I really wasn't going to give her any,

462
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,207
but she looked at me
with such desperation.

463
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,878
It was organic, though.

464
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,671
That's it, right?

465
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,758
A little bit of ham and abalone--

466
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,636
Excuse me? Ham and abalone?

467
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,305
It was abalone porridge.

468
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,098
Are you crazy?

469
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,435
How can you feed her ham and abalone?
She's still on breast milk!

470
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,187
How can you be so thoughtless?

471
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,565
I'm sorry... I didn't know.

472
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,610
I'm really sorry, Yoon-ah.

473
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,822
It's okay.

474
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,908
I should've told you.

475
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,578
I'm sorry, Sol.

476
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,538
I shouldn't have gone out.

477
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,333
I'm so sorry.

478
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,505
Damn it. What the hell?

479
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,217
What kind of side effect is this?

480
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,053
What if our voices never return?

481
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,971
Seriously.

482
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,391
How can those sons of bitches
make us take those pills?

483
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,518
Let's head home first.

484
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,687
Taxi!

485
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,357
Taxi!

486
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,072
Can you take us to Huam-dong?

487
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,491
Huam-dong.

488
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:38,119
To Waikiki Guesthouse.

489
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,122
What's wrong?

490
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,376
Is it because of how we sound?

491
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,170
We're not kidding around.

492
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,964
We took part in a clinical trial

493
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,840
and this is the side effect.

494
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,968
We're not playing with you, promise.

495
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,807
Why are you getting out?

496
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,436
What's the matter?

497
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,231
Really, it's a side effect.
We're not kidding around.

498
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,357
Bullshit, you punks.

499
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,442
You guys are mimicking me.

500
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,695
You're mocking me!

501
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,737
You're dead meat.

502
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,948
I'll kill you both!

503
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,743
-No!
-Die!

504
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,412
Die!

505
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,052
What are you doing?

506
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:37,971
Hey.

507
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,181
You should go in.

508
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,350
I want to,

509
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,229
but I can't face them.

510
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,568
Why am I such a fool?

511
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,406
Can I ask you something?

512
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,074
What is it?

513
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,243
Your liking Yoon-ah...

514
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,413
Did you consider Yoon-ah's
circumstances and Sol?

515
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,498
What do you mean?

516
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,792
Her situation isn't ordinary.

517
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,294
She has Sol, too.

518
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,797
Can you take all of that on?

519
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,220
Don't tell me you haven't
given it any thought.

520
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,350
I may be out of line saying this,

521
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,477
but if you're not ready
to handle her situation

522
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,354
then don't start something with her
in the first place.

523
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,066
She has a lot of scars as it is.

524
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,493
You said it'd take a few days.
Why are you back so soon?

525
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,620
Are you done with your gig?

526
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,750
So did you make any money?

527
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,629
How much did you get paid?

528
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,551
It's so frustrating.
What the hell are you saying?

529
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,636
Ouch, that stings.
Why did you hit me?

530
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,471
Goodness. Why do you sound like that?

531
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,100
It's a side effect from the drug.

532
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,646
This is all your fault, you punk! Where
on earth did you find such a shitty job?

533
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,772
Who asked you to come?

534
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,899
You're the one who followed me there.

535
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,192
Are you yelling at me?

536
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,610
What did I do that was so wrong?

537
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,071
You got us to take that shitty gig
which is why I sound like this!

538
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,906
What are they, Minions?

539
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,741
Those two are really something.

540
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,118
It's all your fault!

541
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,582
MAL-GEUM

542
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,167
It's Mal-geum.

543
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,837
I can't take her call with this voice.

544
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,090
Seo-jin, can you answer for me?

545
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,592
Fine.

546
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,096
Hello?

547
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,600
Yes, this is Doo-sik's phone.
He just went to the bathroom.

548
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,602
I'll pass on your message
if you have something to tell him.

549
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,398
Uh-huh. Yes. Bye.

550
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,484
She has something to say

551
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,652
and wants to see you outside.

552
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,822
Something to say? What could it be?

553
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,324
Maybe she wants to confess her feelings.

554
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,076
Confess?

555
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,662
No way. That can't be.

556
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,622
You know you love it.

557
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,458
You're looking forward to it.

558
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,376
Look how coy you are.

559
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,420
Stop it.

560
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,506
I want to come and watch.

561
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,348
Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.

562
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,227
I have something to say to you.

563
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,023
The thing is...

564
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,192
I...

565
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,571
decided to go back to the agency.

566
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,781
What?

567
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,407
What are you talking about?

568
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,827
Doo-sik. What's wrong with your voice?

569
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,207
I caught a cold.

570
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,837
What do you mean, you're going back?

571
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,798
So you'll continue doing adult films?

572
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,758
No.

573
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,470
They're working on a drama
with a Chinese production company,

574
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,514
and he says he'll give me a part in it.

575
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,599
So I'm going to China.

576
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,268
-When?
-Tomorrow.

577
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,188
I'm leaving in a rush
due to the shooting schedule.

578
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,190
So soon?

579
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,028
Did he say something to you?

580
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,780
Like what?

581
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,992
Oh, that you'll pay him
for my signing bonus?

582
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,829
I already knew about it.

583
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,289
Also that you're taking on part-time jobs
because of me.

584
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,543
I just pretended not to know.

585
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,337
I wanted to avoid the situation.

586
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,715
Are you working with him again
because of the signing bonus?

587
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,717
Mal-geum, I'll do whatever it takes
to get the money.

588
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,344
-So--
-No.

589
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,346
That's not the only reason.

590
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,181
I want to do it.

591
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,685
I can't do anything here
no matter how hard I work

592
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,603
because of my past experiences.

593
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,983
So I want to start over
where no one knows me.

594
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,445
Do you have to go?

595
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,241
Can't you stay?

596
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,577
It's a great opportunity.

597
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,912
I don't want to miss it, Doo-sik.

598
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,293
You'll cheer me on, right?

599
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,300
Thank you. It means a lot.

600
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:26,968
I almost forgot.

601
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,971
I found these pictures

602
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,016
while I was packing.

603
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,484
Thanks for everything, Doo-sik.

604
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,652
I'm so grateful.

605
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,407
I'll get going now.

606
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,575
Take care.

607
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,767
Why did you draw hearts around her name?

608
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,226
She's my first love.

609
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,604
YOON MAL-GEUM

610
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,502
Mal-geum...

611
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,088
Mal-geum.

612
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,010
Do you feel better now, Sol?

613
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,555
Your tummy went ouchie-ouchie
because of this mindless fool, did it?

614
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,307
Goodness.

615
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,685
You're nuts.

616
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,728
How can you feed ham and abalone to a baby

617
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,022
who hasn't been weaned?

618
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,274
That's enough. He didn't know.

619
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,818
Don't let it bother you, Dong-goo.

620
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,569
Sol is all better now.

621
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,155
Come here, baby.

622
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,534
You're all better now, aren't you?

623
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,829
I may be out of line,

624
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,956
but if you're not ready to handle her
situation,

625
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,666
then you shouldn't start something
in the first place.

626
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,004
She has a lot of scars as it is.

627
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,131
Will I be able to handle it?

628
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,426
I can't look after Sol properly.

629
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,346
-You all right?
-And I can't even take care of myself.

630
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,932
Geez.

631
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:42,895
Why is he acting like the victim
when it was his fault?

632
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,734
What a great life you lead, Seo-jin.

633
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,112
You've got a pretty regular napping
schedule for someone who's job hunting.

634
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,823
I was up all night preparing
for interviews. I laid down for a second.

635
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,741
What about you?

636
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,202
You call yourself an actor,
but all you do is weird part-time gigs.

637
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,662
What? Weird?

638
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:04,459
I sacrificed my body for the advancement
of pharmaceutical medicine.

639
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,335
How about this?

640
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,963
You should give up on getting employed
and look into doing clinical trials.

641
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,049
You know, for, like,
female hair removal products.

642
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,258
Bearded women are hard to come by.

643
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,676
So stubbly.

644
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,594
You jerk!

645
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,762
Do you want to die? Do you?

646
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,888
Chewbacca's out to kill!

647
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,891
Jedi. Help me, Jedi.

648
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,642
Stop it, you two.

649
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,144
How come you're always fighting?

650
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,105
Leave them be. That's how it begins.

651
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,024
What begins?

652
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,984
How can you say something so heinous?

653
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,862
This jerk right here
is the one guy I consider

654
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,322
as the worst in the whole world.

655
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,574
Even if I was stuck on a deserted island
with only him,

656
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,368
-it still wouldn't happen.
-I feel the same way.

657
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,578
Even if I was on a deserted island
with you...

658
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,497
I'd prefer to live with a sea turtle

659
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,456
over you. Never.

660
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,792
Sea turtles don't grow beards.

661
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,085
It's very smooth.

662
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,878
I just received a call
from that sea turtle,

663
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,713
and she tells me she hates
losers like you.

664
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,298
-What? Loser?
-What?

665
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,508
Why, you little...

666
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,260
Gosh.

667
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,598
-This is mine.
-Why is that yours?

668
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,230
Why'd you buy the same phone?
It's confusing.

669
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,606
I bought it first!

670
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,650
There's nothing about you I like.

671
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,362
-I love you like crazy
-What's that?

672
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,072
What's that noise?

673
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,158
Here I wait for you

674
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,246
I'm just an average guy

675
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:28,251
Shamelessly I want to be with you

676
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,254
Does he want to sing
that song with that voice?

677
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,005
Try to understand.

678
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,590
Mal-geum leaves today.

679
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,760
His voice isn't coming back.

680
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,054
He was really diligent about
taking the pills. Goodness.

681
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,056
Looking for you

682
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,560
This feeling of love

683
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,438
-That I have for you
-Talk some sense into him.

684
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:55,027
I want to hold onto you

685
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,656
Please love me

686
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,410
-Don't make me cry
-Gosh, look at that.

687
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,537
Though I want to say this

688
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,167
More than anything

689
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,128
I can't say it confidently

690
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,965
And I always shy away

691
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:22,180
Because I am a coward

692
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,639
What's up with him?

693
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,186
Everyone in this house has issues.

694
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,355
Please love me

695
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,609
Don't make me cry

696
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,278
Though I want to say this

697
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,532
More than anything

698
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,035
-Doo-sik!
-Dong-goo!

699
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,330
I'm a coward.

700
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,123
Dong-goo...

701
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,126
I'm a coward!

702
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,211
"'MY DEAR DESPERADO'"

703
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,879
Mal-geum...

704
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,632
I'm Kang Ji-wan of Seoul District
Prosecutors' Office.

705
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,426
Do want to come with me quietly
or do you want to fight?

706
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,178
It's up to you guys.

707
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,889
But if you choose to fight,

708
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,016
you'll have to put your lives on the line.

709
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:08,976
What are you doing?

710
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,229
Can't you see?

711
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,521
What's your role this time?

712
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,608
I'm a prosecutor.

713
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,777
I'm a passionate prosecutor

714
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,403
who fights organized crime.

715
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,614
A prosecutor? With that face?

716
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,532
You're sure you're not the bad guy?

717
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,034
The director must be blind.

718
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,577
Chewbacca, watch what you say to me.

719
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,081
I'm going to have some ramyun.

720
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,583
The least you could do is cheer me on.

721
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,295
What's wrong with the stove?

722
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,464
Joon-ki, take a look at this.

723
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,050
Now you need my help.

724
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:42,843
Come on.

725
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,346
What's wrong?

726
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,181
Why doesn't it work? It's fine.

727
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,516
Move.

728
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,435
Why isn't it working?

729
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,481
Let's see.

730
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,692
The valve is on, so why--

731
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,654
Joon-ki!

732
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,867
Damn it, what the hell?

733
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,997
You little brat.
How could you turn on the stove

734
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,332
when my face was right there?

735
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,625
Sorry.

736
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,378
I had no idea it would turn on like that.

737
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,338
You turned it on!

738
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,301
This is ridiculous.

739
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:27,096
How can I go to the shoot
looking like this?

740
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,765
What's wrong with you?

741
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,933
Are you worried about something?

742
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,727
Let him be.

743
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,562
He's always trying to look like
he's up to something.

744
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,480
Stop it, you prick!

745
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,982
That's enough.

746
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,525
I'm not in a good mood--

747
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,197
What the hell is up with your eyebrow?

748
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,033
Did you wax it off?

749
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,951
It's killing me!

750
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,953
Don't laugh, you bastard!

751
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,079
This is all your sister's fault.

752
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:52,997
Stop laughing!

753
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,170
-What's that?
-It's a plastic model.

754
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,379
A plastic model?

755
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,007
Your voice is back.

756
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,884
It slowly returned this morning.

757
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,302
What's with the plastic model?

758
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,637
Just 'cause.
I was feeling a bit blue.

759
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,395
What's up with your eyebrow?
Are you crazy?

760
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,897
Don't laugh!

761
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,775
You looked like you were about
to die just now.

762
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,278
Why would you buy a plastic model
when you're feeling blue?

763
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,948
This helps me organize my thoughts.

764
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,784
You're right.

765
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,328
Let me join you, Doo-sik.

766
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,705
I have a lot on my mind these days.

767
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,582
Sure, if you want.

768
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,668
Isn't his face hilarious?

769
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,670
Totally.

770
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,840
You should shave the other side, too.

771
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,175
Who are you, Harvey Dent?

772
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,635
Stop laughing!

773
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,934
Hey, have you ever done this?

774
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,311
It's harder than you think.

775
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,772
It's not for everyone.

776
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,065
What did you say?

777
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,485
I can make it in a few hours
with my eyes closed.

778
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,153
Really?

779
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,989
Once I open the box

780
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,951
I don't eat or sleep until I'm done.

781
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,577
Will you be all right?

782
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,788
If you're doing to give up halfway,

783
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,415
you might as well step aside now.

784
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,959
There is no way I'll give up,

785
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,379
so you should butt out
if you're not confident.

786
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,383
Then, shall we begin?

787
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,717
Let's.

788
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,266
Hey, Soo-ah. How's this?

789
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,602
You look like a fool
who filled in his eyebrows.

790
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,479
What, a fool?

791
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,647
Damn you.

792
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,444
Soo-ah, how about this one?

793
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,195
You look like a fool who stuck on tape.

794
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,947
What, tape fool?

795
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,117
This is driving me insane.

796
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,120
This is all because of Seo-jin. That brat.

797
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,708
YOU'RE NOT SAFE FROM HAIR LOSS
BE PREPARED

798
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,419
Joon-ki.

799
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,464
Call them and ask if they have
wigs for eyebrows.

800
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,798
Are you kidding me?

801
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,843
Add fuel to fire, why don't you?

802
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,136
Never mind then.

803
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,430
There it is.

804
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,681
Hey, Seo-jin.

805
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,600
What are you going to do about this?

806
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,143
How will I go on set like this?

807
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,145
I said I'm sorry.

808
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,605
I'm off to my interview.

809
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,939
Hey!

810
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,400
How can you just go for your interview
after ruining my shoot?

811
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,736
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

812
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,738
See you!

813
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,906
MONA LISA WIG

814
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,284
-Hold on a sec, Seo-jin?
-What's it now?

815
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,710
Do well on your interview.

816
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,587
I'm always here for you.

817
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,047
Good luck!

818
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,926
Um... thanks. Good luck to me.

819
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,260
High five!

820
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,930
Let's go!

821
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,984
You're next. Be on your toes.

822
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,819
CHOYOUNG DAILY
EMPLOYMENT INTERVIEWS

823
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,448
Final question.
Why do you want to be a reporter?

824
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,035
A reporter has the power
to change the world.

825
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,248
With the articles I write,
the unjust can be righted.

826
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,542
I can help make the world a better place

827
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,003
by becoming the voice
of those who are in need.

828
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,049
That's the reason why
I would like to become a reporter.

829
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,593
Understood. Good job today.

830
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,596
-We'll be in touch.
-Thank you.

831
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,477
Ms. Kang?

832
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,313
Yes? What is it?

833
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,359
You have something on your back.

834
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,947
What? Why is that...

835
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,409
What is this?
You're not safe from hair loss.

836
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,160
Be prepared?

837
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,080
Did you bring this for me?

838
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,208
No, sir! Really.

839
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,377
Okay, then. You may leave.

840
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,175
How the hell did this...

841
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,803
Hold on.

842
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,764
I'm always here for you.
Good luck!

843
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,392
That's what he was doing?

844
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,479
Joon-ki, that crazy asshole!

845
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,903
Are you messing with me?

846
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,197
What's with your face?

847
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,116
What happened to your eyebrow?

848
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,454
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry doesn't cut it.

849
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,581
How is this the face of a top prosecutor?

850
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,292
Can we get the makeup team on this?

851
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,627
Do you know how expensive that is?

852
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,754
Gosh, this is insane.

853
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,423
We have to start shooting.
I don't need this right now!

854
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,052
Wait.

855
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,142
This is what we'll do.

856
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,935
What's that?

857
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,565
I'm Kang Ji-wan of Seoul District
Prosecutors' Office.

858
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,400
Do want to come with me quietly
or do you want to fight?

859
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,069
It's up to you guys.

860
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,196
But if you choose to fight,
you'll have to put your lives on the line.

861
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,783
Don't move, you son of a bitch.

862
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,328
Prosecutor or not.
Take one step and I'll...

863
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,498
Cut!

864
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,084
What do you think you're doing?

865
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,211
You call that acting?

866
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:36,715
You've got the scariest face out there.
That's the best you can do?

867
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,841
I'm sorry, sir.

868
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,552
We switched roles all of a sudden, so...

869
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,721
I'll give it another shot.

870
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,556
Again.

871
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,060
This is all because of that brat, Seo-jin.
What the hell?

872
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,654
YOU'RE NOT SAFE FROM HAIR LOSS

873
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,573
Just wait until he comes home.

874
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,994
-Hey!
-Hey, Lee Joon-ki!

875
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,580
You did this, didn't you?

876
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,833
Do you know what happened to me
at the interview because of this?

877
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,503
I was yelled at and lost my role
because of you.

878
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,004
I already apologized for that!

879
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,757
Do you even know how important
today's interview is to me?

880
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,343
Will you take responsibility
if I don't get the job? Will you?

881
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,762
What? Hey!

882
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,681
Then you take responsibility
for my eyebrow.

883
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,057
What? You asshole!

884
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,695
What is it, Seo-jin?

885
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,114
What does it say?

886
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,492
We're sorry to inform you...
From Choyoung Daily

887
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,208
Hey!

888
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,501
What was it?

889
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,298
Seo-jin didn't get the job.

890
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,592
-What?
-Really?

891
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,719
Why'd you pull such a prank?

892
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,095
What?

893
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,806
Are you saying it's my fault?

894
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,350
I'm also a victim.

895
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,604
Geez.

896
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,521
My goodness.

897
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,025
What will we do about Seo-jin?

898
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,569
What can we do? She didn't get the job.

899
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,616
Are they still not done?

900
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,785
They haven't eaten all day.

901
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,829
Aren't they hungry?

902
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,130
I'm starving.

903
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,551
My back hurts, as do my eyes.
I'm dying here.

904
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,263
I'm so exhausted I can't think straight,

905
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,057
let alone organize my thoughts.

906
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,060
Isn't he tired?

907
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,229
Damn, he's determined.

908
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,980
I'm tired.

909
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:01,026
I'm so exhausted,
I can't organize my thoughts.

910
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,903
I feel paralyzed.

911
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,323
Why does he seem so fine?

912
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,408
Damn, he's determined.

913
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,744
Hey, Doo-sik.

914
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,955
How far along are we?

915
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,164
Are we almost done?

916
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,625
I don't know. Shall we see?

917
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,793
Shall we?

918
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,092
What the hell? There's so much left to do!

919
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,426
Fuck.

920
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,053
Damn it.

921
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,097
When will we ever finish?

922
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,598
I'm dying here.

923
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,523
Hey, Doo-sik.

924
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,442
Of course I can keep going,

925
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,363
but it's time for Men on a Mission.

926
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,740
You know I never miss it.

927
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,617
I'm an avid fan. Want to watch?

928
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,745
Say you'll watch it. Please.

929
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,291
Let's please take a break for an hour,
you jerk.

930
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,544
Well, you know I can go on all night,

931
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,255
but like you, I'm also an avid fan
of Men on a Mission.

932
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:08,427
Then we can keep going as soon
as Men on a Mission is over.

933
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,304
Thank God.

934
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,556
Who cares what we watch?

935
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,349
Let's take a break!

936
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,978
Where are you going? Are you finished?

937
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,021
No, not yet.

938
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,691
Men on a Mission just happens to be
on today.

939
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,984
I'm an avid fan.

940
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,154
Me too. I never miss it.

941
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,614
I was even in Seo Jang-hoon's fan club.

942
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,157
-Wow.
-Seriously.

943
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,074
Really?

944
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,909
But it's cancelled today.

945
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,501
Is that right?

946
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,672
Then I guess we should keep going

947
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,132
since the show was cancelled.

948
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,675
Of course.

949
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,472
We should keep on going
since Men on a Mission was cancelled.

950
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,939
Where are Dong-goo and Doo-sik?

951
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,692
I don't know.
They're working on that plastic model.

952
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,779
-They didn't come to the room last night.
-They're still at it?

953
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,198
They're more persistent than I thought.

954
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,408
They must really be going through
a rough patch.

955
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,619
I feel for them.

956
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,249
Where's Seo-jin?

957
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,334
She doesn't feel like eating.

958
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,587
She's been crying under the covers
all day. I'm worried about her.

959
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,049
You should go apologize.

960
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,511
Why would I do that? I'm the victim.

961
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,887
Don't you see this?

962
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,098
Still, you were pretty harsh.

963
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,849
Give in this one time.

964
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,519
You should. She won't stop crying.

965
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,854
Fine.

966
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,649
I'll have to be the bigger person. Brat.

967
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,375
Chewbacca, won't you eat?

968
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,460
I don't want to talk to you. Leave.

969
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,759
I'm sorry.

970
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,304
I didn't know you'd be at your interview
with the flyer on your back.

971
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,390
Forgive me, okay?

972
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,100
I said, leave.

973
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,436
Can't you accept my apology?

974
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,690
To be frank, it's not all my fault
you didn't get the job.

975
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,316
I know.

976
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,694
I know it's not your fault
I didn't get it.

977
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,821
Then why are you acting like this?

978
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,407
You've been rejected many times before.

979
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,575
But this

980
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,702
was my last interview.

981
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,704
What do you mean?

982
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,621
Your last interview?

983
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,625
I told myself I'd give up
on being a reporter

984
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,627
if I didn't make it this time.

985
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,298
But now that it's actually happened...

986
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,425
It's so upsetting.

987
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,805
So mind your own business
and get out of here.

988
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,766
Leave me alone!

989
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,624
Hey. You guys.

990
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,125
What are you doing?

991
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,544
Sleep in your beds. Why sleep here?

992
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,463
Sleep? Who's sleeping?

993
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,506
Me?

994
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,341
I wasn't sleeping.

995
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:38,178
I was just blinking very slowly.

996
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,933
She must've been talking about you,
Doo-sik.

997
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,518
I wasn't sleeping.

998
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,061
I was thinking

999
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,523
about how I can do a better job.

1000
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,442
Actually, I slept.

1001
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,361
It was sweet.

1002
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:58,532
I woke just as I was about
to enter REM sleep.

1003
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,618
I want to sleep comfortably
in my own bed.

1004
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,622
But he'll look down on me if I suggest it.

1005
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,874
Damn it.

1006
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,668
I want to sleep.

1007
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,212
My eyelids are drooping.

1008
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,464
Should I just go and sleep?

1009
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,426
But then he'll look down on me
and tease me

1010
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,178
to no end.

1011
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,847
What do I do?

1012
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,106
Oh my God? What do I do?

1013
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,816
Why? What's the matter?

1014
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,109
Look at this.

1015
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,822
My fingers are glued together.

1016
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,034
What? Gosh.

1017
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,411
My fingers are stuck too.

1018
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,704
What about it?

1019
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,498
The thing is... The thumb and index finger
are most important

1020
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,419
when it comes to assembling
a plastic model.

1021
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,505
But I can't do a thing

1022
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,550
since they're stuck together.

1023
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,010
That's what I'm saying.

1024
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,428
It's a shame,

1025
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,014
but what can we do?
Our fingers are glued together.

1026
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,475
I really wanted to complete it,

1027
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,644
but I guess this is the end of the road.

1028
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,439
Do you want to finish that badly?

1029
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,190
Of course.

1030
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,191
Damn straight.

1031
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,277
Don't worry. I have nail polish remover.

1032
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,447
This will take the glue right off.

1033
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,364
I'll do it for you.

1034
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,533
No way. You can't...

1035
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,577
It's not possible.

1036
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,454
This is a really strong adhesive.

1037
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,415
There's no way nail polish remover
can get unstick our fingers.

1038
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,542
It'll take a really long time.

1039
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,253
It won't come off easily.

1040
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,384
-Doo-sik.
-Me too?

1041
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,477
See? It worked right away.

1042
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,103
You can assemble to your heart's content.

1043
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,605
Nail polish remover...

1044
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,363
Son of a bitch. Stay right there.

1045
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:06,076
Prosecutor or not, take one step
and I won't leave you alone--

1046
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,912
I won't leave you...

1047
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,999
That brat.

1048
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,086
I can't act because I'm worried about her.

1049
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,301
-Hello?
-Hello.

1050
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,220
Is this Kang Seo-jin's phone?

1051
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,347
Excuse me? Kang Seo-jin?

1052
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,640
What...

1053
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,269
I brought her phone by mistake.

1054
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,022
What's this about?

1055
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,651
I'm calling from Choyoung Daily. Ms. Kang
has a second round interview today.

1056
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,821
But she got a text yesterday
saying she didn't get the job.

1057
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,698
She passed the first round of interviews.

1058
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,282
There must've been a mistake.

1059
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,701
What?

1060
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,494
How can you say that now?

1061
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,747
Never mind. What time is her interview?

1062
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,001
What? At two o'clock?

1063
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,795
SONGNAE STN - EURWANGNI

1064
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,095
What is this?
Is there another Hairy from Huam-dong?

1065
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,931
Hello?

1066
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,516
Seo-jin, it's me.

1067
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,185
It's you, Joon-ki?

1068
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,104
Why?

1069
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,814
The thing is...

1070
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,568
I took your phone again by mistake.

1071
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,944
Again?

1072
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,156
What, so my number is saved as
Hairy from Huam-dong?

1073
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,615
That's not important.

1074
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,492
Seo-jin, you passed the first round.

1075
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,911
What? What are you saying?

1076
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,247
Choyoung Daily just called your phone.

1077
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,665
They want you for the next round.

1078
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,959
Are you serious?

1079
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,170
So go to the seminar room
on the 10th floor

1080
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,546
by two o'clock.

1081
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,840
Two o'clock?

1082
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,427
-What am I going to do?
-What's wrong?

1083
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,804
Just get ready and take a cab.
You'll get there in time.

1084
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,849
I'm on my way to the beach
to get some air.

1085
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,309
I'm almost there.

1086
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,020
I'll never make it on time.

1087
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,772
Will you just give up then?

1088
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,774
You said this was your last interview!

1089
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,151
But there's not enough time.

1090
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,529
I'll try to find a solution,
so just get yourself over there.

1091
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,822
Bye.

1092
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,204
Sir!

1093
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,539
Please stop.

1094
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,458
Let's get started!

1095
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,793
Stand by.

1096
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,628
Okay!

1097
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,015
Excuse me. Where are you going? Hey!

1098
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,309
We have a new lecturer today,

1099
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,061
so I'll introduce him to you.

1100
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,021
Please come in.

1101
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,861
Hyun-joon?

1102
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,907
Hi, Yoon-ah. What are you doing here?

1103
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,160
Excuse me.
Please introduce yourself first.

1104
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,621
Sorry about that.

1105
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,997
Let's talk later.

1106
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,833
Yeah, sure.

1107
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,629
Hello.

1108
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,799
My name is Song Hyun-joon
and I'm your lecturer starting today.

1109
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,467
Nice to meet you.

1110
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,140
I can't believe it.

1111
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,766
-Unbelievable.
-Why?

1112
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,017
Is he that famous?

1113
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,478
He's one of the best in Korea.
A celebrity patisserie.

1114
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,938
He is?

1115
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,196
-Good work today.
-Thank you.

1116
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,492
-Excuse me.
-My gosh.

1117
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,703
How much time is there
until the interviews are over?

1118
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,080
-They just ended.
-They're finished?

1119
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,541
Could you wait just a little bit longer?

1120
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,919
The directors are busy,
so it'll be difficult.

1121
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,675
What happens if someone doesn't show up?

1122
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,178
Then they'll be dropped, most likely.

1123
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,471
Dropped?

1124
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,848
That's not fair!

1125
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,183
It's all because of your mistake.

1126
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,018
I wasn't told anything.

1127
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,436
What do I do?

1128
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,606
INTERVIEW APPLICANTS THIS WAY

1129
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,360
This is insane.

1130
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,113
Hey. Where are you going?

1131
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,073
Thanks for your hard work.

1132
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,909
You can't go in there!

1133
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,036
What is this?

1134
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,079
Freeze.

1135
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,331
What do you think you're doing?

1136
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,167
What on earth?

1137
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,796
Don't move.

1138
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,924
Prosecutor or not, no wait.

1139
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,013
Interviewer or not, move a muscle
and I won't leave you alone.

1140
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,932
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

1141
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,141
Shut up!

1142
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,268
Stay still if you don't want to get hurt.

1143
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,186
Got it?

1144
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,979
This guy needs to be taught a lesson.

1145
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,731
What did you say?

1146
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,194
So what are you going to do?

1147
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,490
APPLICATION SCREENING
AND INTERVIEWS

1148
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,950
Why are you getting up?

1149
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,827
What's taking so long?

1150
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,371
What the...

1151
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,385
-Hey, you.
-Yes?

1152
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,804
Let's have a word. Come here.

1153
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,265
Why are you doing this? Please don't.

1154
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,100
Let's talk.

1155
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,561
Please don't. No!

1156
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,034
Save me. Help.

1157
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,911
Please help!

1158
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,053
10th floor.

1159
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,892
Excuse me.

1160
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,645
I'm Kang Seo-jin.

1161
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,731
I'm here for my interview.

1162
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:10,648
Hold on, please.

1163
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,692
We're dealing with a maniac right now.

1164
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,653
-Who do you think you are?
-Let go!

1165
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,156
-Let go of me!
-Gosh!

1166
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,450
Goodness.

1167
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,042
Goodness.

1168
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,509
Sorry about that!

1169
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,479
Can you believe that guy?

1170
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,357
Do you know him by any chance?

1171
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,775
Sorry?

1172
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,735
No.

1173
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,737
You said your name is Kang Seo-jin, right?

1174
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,322
-Yes.
-You're a bit late.

1175
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,365
I'm sorry.

1176
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,576
Director, we have one interviewee left.
What do you want to do?

1177
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,870
We'll see her. Let's go inside.

1178
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,830
Thank you.

1179
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,425
I've reached my limit.

1180
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,637
I can't hold on any longer.

1181
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:27,016
Still, I can't be the first one
to call it quits.

1182
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,354
What to do?

1183
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,867
Oh my God!

1184
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,536
Where did I put it?

1185
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,788
What... What happened?

1186
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:53,126
The radar I was working
on vanished into thin air!

1187
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,003
I can't go on.

1188
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,923
Why? You can't assemble it
without the radar?

1189
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,092
Of course not! An aircraft carrier
without a radar

1190
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:04,178
is like a guesthouse with no guests!

1191
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,597
Gee, I really wanted to complete it.

1192
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,892
This has lost all meaning.

1193
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,230
Are you sure you didn't sit on it?

1194
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:16,899
No, I didn't.

1195
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,487
Who knows? Stand up.

1196
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,408
Fine, I will.

1197
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,785
I'll get up.

1198
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,087
It's not there.

1199
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,465
I told you I didn't sit on it.

1200
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,926
I really wanted to complete it.

1201
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,553
I'm off.

1202
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,263
Geez.

1203
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,224
How can the radar go missing, Doo-sik?

1204
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,602
It's a shocker.

1205
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:56,147
Gee, I'm really upset.

1206
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,940
How did that happen?

1207
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:02,111
For goodness' sake.
I won't be able to sleep.

1208
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,699
Damn it.

1209
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,202
I can't do this because I'm worried.

1210
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,705
-What now?
-I'm worried about Dong-goo.

1211
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:16,417
I'm trained for this so I'm fine,

1212
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,921
but the mental shock that comes
from losing the radar

1213
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:23,007
is just incredible.

1214
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,176
-Really?
-I'm telling you it is!

1215
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,387
You wouldn't understand

1216
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,974
how awful it is.

1217
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:36,229
Are you all right, Dong-goo?
You must be shocked.

1218
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:39,232
Dong-goo... Are you okay?

1219
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,192
Your radar went missing!

1220
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,634
What are you doing?
Enjoying drinking alone?

1221
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,179
I told you to go home and rest.
You didn't have to come here.

1222
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,014
Just 'cause.

1223
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,268
Pour me a shot.

1224
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,605
How did the interview go?

1225
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,107
You didn't make any mistakes?

1226
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,025
It went well.

1227
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,820
What happened to your shoot?

1228
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,113
Huh?

1229
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,451
I just... quit.

1230
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,789
Did you quit because of me?

1231
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:37,790
You're wrong.

1232
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:39,667
The thing is...

1233
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,004
You know I'm the smart, intellectual type.

1234
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,340
The prosecutor role was perfect for me,

1235
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,343
but the gangster role didn't suit me.

1236
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,973
Anyway...

1237
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,434
thank you for today.

1238
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,561
You're making me cringe.

1239
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,106
It's fine. Let's just drink.

1240
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,960
You're drinking soju like it's water.

1241
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:29,884
Today, I was a tiny bit touched

1242
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,137
by what you did today.

1243
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,683
There's no need to be touched.

1244
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,560
Didn't you say

1245
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,146
that it was a really important interview?

1246
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,315
I may have.

1247
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,692
You said it was your last interview.

1248
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,402
Yeah.

1249
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,612
So...

1250
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:54,742
make sure you get the job, okay?

1251
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,535
Okay!

1252
01:05:57,078 --> 01:06:00,456
When I get the job,

1253
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,876
I'll pay for your eyebrow tattoo.

1254
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,170
A nice one.

1255
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,507
Thanks.

1256
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:11,968
But...

1257
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:15,346
I don't want a tattoo.

1258
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,391
Can we transplant your beard instead?

1259
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:21,227
Do you want to die?

1260
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,772
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

1261
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:30,820
You know what? Earlier when I saw you...

1262
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,031
my heart fluttered.

1263
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,910
I wonder why.

1264
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,663
Am I nuts?

1265
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,211
Let go! What are you doing?

1266
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:49,547
Let me take a look at you.

1267
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,424
-Jeez.
-It's ridiculous.

1268
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,850
I just don't understand.

1269
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,520
Why am I falling for him?

1270
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,448
What happened last night?

1271
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,201
Alcohol is the devil.

1272
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,036
How dare you... My little sister?

1273
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,788
Get your ass over here!

1274
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,166
My name is Kang Seo-jin.

1275
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,461
The masked singer who has won
for seven weeks in a row.

1276
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:11,545
I'm a reporter.

1277
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,464
Are you messing
with the citizens' right to know?

1278
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,673
Did you find out who it is?

1279
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,592
How do you plan on staying a reporter?

1280
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:17,593
Call it quits.

1281
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,678
You're Blushing Webfoot Octopus, right?

1282
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,722
I'm certain it's Soo-ah's ex.

1283
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:22,973
Did you catch that con man?

1284
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,643
-What are you doing?
-I'll stand guard myself.

1285
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:27,520
-Get me a cola.
-Yes, boss.

1286
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,688
-Doesn't it piss you off?
-Why are you late?

1287
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,982
Doo-sik. Let's eat some meat
before we go. I'll buy.

1288
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,317
This is my studio.

1289
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,277
You can practice here. I'll help.

1290
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,571
Are you mad at me about something?

1291
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,989
Dong-goo, are you crying?

1292
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,908
You're more of a coward than I thought.

1293
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:44,036
-So what if you fail and break up?
-That's why I'm going to confess.

1294
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,746
Yoon-ah. I have something to say.
