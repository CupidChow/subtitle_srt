00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,796
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
YOUR EXAM. PLEASE CHECK WEBSITE

2
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,881
FOR MORE INFORMATION.

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,553
Yoon-ah.

4
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,448
It's been a long time.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,034
Sung-min.

6
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,702
How've you been?

7
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,206
What brings you here?

8
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,583
I came to beg for your forgiveness.

9
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,754
Even though I know that's impossible.

10
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,382
It's unnecessary, so just leave.

11
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,304
-Yoon-ah--
-It's unnecessary, so just leave, please!

12
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,892
Yoon-ah, what's wrong?

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,853
Who's this person?

14
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,856
Who is it that you're so upset?

15
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,133
I didn't know.

16
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,135
I really didn't know.

17
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,595
I'm sorry, Yoon-ah.

18
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,514
I'm really sorry.

19
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,474
There's nothing to be sorry about.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,518
Sol is my daughter...

21
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,020
She's not your concern.

22
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,108
I'll take responsibility.

23
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,318
I'll take complete responsibility.

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,445
Take responsibility?

25
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,323
How are you going to do that?

26
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,368
How dare you say that now.

27
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,453
Where were you when I was suffering?

28
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,499
You weren't by my side
when every day was a living hell.

29
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,042
You didn't even call, not once!

30
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,632
There's someone else who held my hand
during that time.

31
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,552
And now...

32
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,096
I love him.

33
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,392
-Yoon-ah--
-Enough.

34
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,186
I decided to give birth to Sol.

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,314
She's my daughter. She's not your concern.

36
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,150
We broke up back then.

37
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,777
So let's live like strangers.

38
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,947
Take care.

39
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,783
Yoon-ah.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,161
Yoon-ah!

41
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,082
Let's go, Dong-goo.

42
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,101
Kang Seo-jin.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,270
What did you just say?

44
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,980
That we should take some time to think?

45
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,941
Let's rethink...

46
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,609
our relationship.

47
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,945
Rethink what?

48
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,404
Why are you like this so suddenly?

49
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,449
Is it because I didn't keep our date?

50
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,618
Or is it because of the scandal?

51
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,206
What is it? Tell me so we can fix it.

52
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,458
Everything is just so hard.

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,211
It's hard not seeing you often
because you're so busy.

54
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,380
It's hard
not being able to freely date you.

55
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,007
It's hard hiding that you're my boyfriend,
all of it's hard!

56
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,267
Okay, I get it..

57
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,437
Then I'll tell the reporters the truth,
and I'll fix everything. Okay?

58
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,606
No, don't do that.

59
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,693
You struggled for so long
and are just starting to make it.

60
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,361
I don't want to hold you back.

61
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,321
You don't want this or that.

62
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,783
-Then what am I supposed to do?
-I don't know either!

63
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,120
But I can't help that it's hard.

64
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,496
I'm always disappointed...

65
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,915
and I feel pathetic.

66
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,922
I thought I was a really strong person,

67
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,716
but I guess I'm not.

68
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,969
Joon-ki...

69
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,221
I really can't look at you right now.

70
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,098
Can you leave?

71
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,351
-Seo-jin.
-I said leave!

72
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,186
Leave now!

73
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,605
Wait, Seo-jin.

74
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,733
Seo-jin!

75
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,651
Seo-jin!

76
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,800
BECAUSE IT HURTS

77
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,473
The zombie president

78
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,975
pulled energy from his lower abdomen

79
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,895
and channeled it into his fingers.

80
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,396
Finally,

81
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,107
his super-ultra-powered finger jab

82
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,485
struck the alien.

83
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,780
The alien gripped its destroyed eye,

84
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,782
and shook its head.

85
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,160
Seriously, a kid like him?

86
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,828
Why?

87
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,706
How can Min Soo-ah,
the legendary beauty queen of Huam,

88
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,834
like Bong Doo-sik?
He's a sweatshirt-wearing,

89
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,836
weird web fiction writer.

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,297
No. There's no way.

91
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,882
Of course not.

92
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,928
What are you staring at?

93
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,641
Why? The more you look,
the more handsome I become?

94
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,145
It was a joke.

95
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,438
What's with the serious face?

96
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,861
There are things you shouldn't joke about.
How can you joke about that?

97
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,115
Was it that terrible of a joke?

98
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,408
Enough! Don't talk to me, you pig!

99
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,789
Why is she calling me a pig again?
Have you ever seen a pig this slim?

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,333
Did I gain some weight?

101
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,961
You're home. How was your date?
Did it go well?

102
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,674
What's going on with you two?

103
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,385
-Did you argue?
-I'm going to get some rest.

104
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,220
Okay.

105
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,851
Why is she like that?
Did something happen?

106
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,064
What?

107
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,941
Sol's dad showed up?

108
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,028
Why all of a sudden? For what reason?

109
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,906
I don't know.
It wasn't the right time to ask either.

110
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,409
What on earth is all this?

111
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,870
You're leaving in a week, too.

112
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,997
You must be worried.

113
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,191
Soo-ah, everyone's
standard of happiness differs.

114
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,484
You still have time

115
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,196
to find work that will make you happy
for the rest of your life.

116
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,447
I just gave it a try.

117
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,449
Why? It looks good!

118
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,369
This unconventional style
is a trend these days.

119
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,662
Do you want to try, too?

120
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,167
What the heck? Why do I keep thinking
about Doo-sik? Why?

121
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,878
I'm going crazy.

122
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,217
The doctor told me not to drink so much...

123
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,055
Whatever, I don't care.

124
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,950
Surely it's not because
I like Doo-sik, is it?

125
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,372
MIN BONG SOO DOO AH SIK

126
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,791
What?

127
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,004
Twenty percent?

128
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,756
I don't like him that much.

129
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,925
What a relief.

130
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,388
Hold on. Does 20 percent still mean
I like him?

131
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,391
This just got confusing!

132
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,435
Wait!

133
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,564
BONG MIN DOO SOO SIK AH

134
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,319
Sixty-four percent?

135
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,740
That means Doo-sik likes me more.

136
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,910
Does that make you happy? Yes.

137
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,038
Are you happy
because this might be true?

138
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,915
Min Soo-ah, you've gone crazy!

139
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,960
You've totally lost your mind!

140
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,807
Why doesn't she come down
when it's time to eat?

141
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,893
She makes me come wake her up.

142
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,648
Is this a pigsty or what?

143
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,483
She even drank?

144
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,654
Min Soo-ah. Hey!

145
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,031
Get up.

146
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,408
-Why are you sleeping here?
-What?

147
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,245
What is it?

148
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,705
Why are you so startled?

149
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,166
Why did you drink so much?

150
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,419
It's none of your business
whether I drink or not, you pig!

151
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,048
Hey! Why do you keep calling me a pig?
It's so childish.

152
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,926
That's right, I'm childish. So what?

153
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,428
Forget it.

154
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,223
Also, you should clean up after yourself.

155
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,100
It's so messy.

156
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,062
Whatever. My stomach hurts,
so stop nagging me.

157
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,021
Ouch, my stomach...

158
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,648
So messy.

159
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,360
Hold on.

160
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,487
BONG MIN DOO SOO SIK AH

161
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,368
-Bong Doo-sik!
-You startled me.

162
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,494
Why are you yelling?

163
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,289
Give that to me. It's mine! You thief!

164
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,418
Now I'm a thief?

165
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,380
Wow, that was close.

166
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,770
Wait, why isn't it here?

167
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,314
Where did it go?

168
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,442
Why isn't it here?

169
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,198
Did you sleep well?

170
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:22,992
Yes.

171
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,244
I grilled your favorite, mackerel.

172
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,873
-Looks tasty, right?
-Yes.

173
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,957
Thank you.

174
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,667
Why aren't you eating, Doo-sik?

175
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,086
I ate so many insults this morning,
I'm not hungry.

176
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,505
Why? Did something happen?

177
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,757
You see, Soo-ah--

178
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,888
Min Soo-ah! What are you doing now?

179
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,848
None of your business! Just eat, you pig.

180
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,268
-See? There goes another insult.
-Is anyone home?

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,734
Sung-min. What are you doing here?

182
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,196
I have something to say to you.

183
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,034
What is wrong with you?

184
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,619
There's nothing more for us to talk about!

185
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,580
What's wrong, Yoon-ah?

186
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,498
Who is he?

187
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,250
Come with me.

188
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,670
Dong-goo?

189
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,464
Who is he?

190
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,715
Surely it's not...

191
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,180
Why are you doing this?

192
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,391
I said let's live like strangers.

193
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,393
Nothing will change by you doing this.

194
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,896
I'm not asking for you to take me back.

195
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,105
I don't have the right.

196
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,650
But Yoon-ah...

197
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,152
I know I have no right...

198
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,821
but it doesn't change the fact
that I'm still Sol's dad.

199
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,702
I know this is unfair to you,
but I want to make it up to Sol...

200
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,664
and do what I can for her,
and be forgiven, even if just a little.

201
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,999
-Is even that not possible?
-No.

202
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:55,918
It's not.

203
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,421
I'm saying this one more time.

204
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,507
Sol is my daughter.

205
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,384
She's not your concern.

206
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,221
So don't show up ever again.

207
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,393
Why did Sol's dad come here?

208
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,771
Seriously. I wonder if Yoon-ah is okay.

209
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,944
Forgive me for the intrusion.

210
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,425
Daddy.

211
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,684
I'm sorry for the trouble.

212
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,935
I'll get going.

213
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,813
Goodbye.

214
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:14,914
-Sol just called him "daddy", right?
-Yeah...

215
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,919
No matter how hard Dong-goo tried,
she never called him that.

216
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,921
That's so interesting.

217
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,964
They say blood is thicker than water...

218
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,258
It must be true, don't you th--

219
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,176
Quiet!

220
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,138
-I'm going to rest for a bit.
-Okay.

221
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,646
How can you be so insensitive?

222
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,230
What'd I do?

223
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,840
-What are you doing?
-I'm just playing with Sol.

224
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,093
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,345
For what?

226
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,848
That person will never come again.

227
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,059
So don't worry.

228
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,352
Okay?

229
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,855
I'm not worried at all.

230
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,899
Why would I be worried about that?

231
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,235
Don't worry.

232
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,738
That's a relief.

233
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,037
You've been here since the morning?

234
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,581
What's going on?

235
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,625
Well, you see...

236
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,881
Sir, I'd like to refute the rumors
about Cindy and me.

237
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,135
What? What do you mean?

238
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,512
There's someone I love very much.

239
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,974
I don't think these rumors are fair...

240
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,267
to her.

241
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,354
Joon-ki, you're such a romantic.

242
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,982
-You're a romantic.
-Excuse me?

243
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,943
Do you think you have the freedom
to be in love right now?

244
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,404
Sir, what I'm saying is--

245
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,072
Don't be stupid!

246
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,243
A ton of actors disappear without a trace
after doing just one drama.

247
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,370
You think you're an exception?

248
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,622
I will work very hard.

249
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,584
-I'll work--
-If hard work can make you a star,

250
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,794
everyone would be one.

251
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,964
Do you know why some people
just don't make it?

252
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,009
They lack luck and opportunity.
Opportunity.

253
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,388
But you're going to throw away
this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

254
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,057
just like that?

255
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,022
Fine. Whether you deny it to
the reporters or not, do what you want.

256
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,816
But the moment you do,

257
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,777
your contract is done for.

258
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,278
Well...

259
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,741
For now, you need to stay somewhere else.

260
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,495
Pardon? I need to move?

261
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
There's probably a ton of reporters
in front of your place.

262
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,085
We have to keep this going
for at least a week.

263
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,261
Joon-ki, you can stay here
for the time being.

264
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,681
I asked them to postpone the shoot
for a few days, so don't worry.

265
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,785
JOON-KI

266
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,254
I was reading over the scenario yesterday,

267
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,257
and I didn't really like the ending.

268
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,217
Could we add some kind of twist?

269
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,427
-A twist?
-Rather than hearing your opinion,

270
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,304
I want to hear Dong-goo's thoughts.

271
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,557
Look at him. He's got ideas flowing out.

272
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,058
Quiet, everyone.

273
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,352
Dong-goo, what is it?
Are you getting any ideas?

274
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,397
DADDY

275
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,108
Daddy!

276
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,861
Daddy? So, daddy...

277
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,489
So, he succeeded in assassinating the man,
but that man is actually his dad?

278
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,075
That sounds pretty good.

279
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,452
But the main character is Korean.

280
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,913
-An Arab man can't be his dad.
-Why not?

281
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,166
He was adopted as a baby,

282
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,710
and got lost while playing outside.

283
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,130
Then he got on a ship headed toward Korea.
That could happen.

284
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,048
What? That's a little...

285
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,175
Be quiet.

286
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,344
Kang Dong-goo. You did it again.

287
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,680
I plan to retire after this movie,
so you be the director.

288
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,473
-I lost.
-Sorry?

289
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,560
From now on, all decisions
will go through Dong-goo first.

290
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,605
Starting now, he's equal to me.

291
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,815
Director Kang, I'm trusting you.

292
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,693
Yes? Yes, okay.

293
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,199
I'm director.

294
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,371
We need some additional tickets to Dubai.
Is that possible?

295
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,500
Pardon? Okay. Then please check
and get back to me.

296
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,418
Okay.

297
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,379
Jeez. I'm so busy.

298
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,011
Sol loves these toys.

299
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,265
Come on!

300
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,101
I have no time!

301
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,520
Let's go!

302
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,939
One more time.

303
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,946
I got it! Dammit!

304
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,449
Do you see this?

305
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,952
I'm not going home until I catch you!

306
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,080
Sol, I'm home!

307
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:48,997
You're here.

308
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,582
Yeah...

309
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,668
I had to pick something up.

310
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,754
-What's all this?
-What?

311
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,175
Well... Sol's dad's secretary came
and dropped this all off.

312
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,642
-Dong-goo, you're here.
-Yes.

313
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,105
-Dong-goo, all of this--
-Yoon-ah, I have to go grab something...

314
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,606
I'm in a bit of a rush.

315
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,412
What's she doing now?

316
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,831
Is she Gollum or what?

317
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,712
Hey. What are you doing?
Are you a coal miner?

318
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,838
Going to burn coal?

319
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,589
What are you looking for?

320
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,301
I told you not to worry, you baboon!

321
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,053
Baboon?

322
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,806
Have you lost your mind, you...

323
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,935
Jeez, I can't curse in front of Sol.

324
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,688
Sol, what is that?

325
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,815
Why are you holding paper?

326
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,859
There's some writing on it.

327
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,405
No!

328
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,700
-Give it to me!
-Why? What is it?

329
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,995
-Give it! It's none of your business.
-That just makes me more curious.

330
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,873
-Just let me see.
-No! Don't look at it.

331
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,790
Hey, wait.

332
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,667
-That hurts!
-Come on, let me see.

333
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,628
Dammit.

334
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,048
Hey, wait!

335
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,342
Min Soo-ah, what are you doing?

336
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,886
Oh, my goodness.

337
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,474
Did you just... eat paper? Seriously?

338
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,812
Sucker! Look!

339
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,647
I ate it all. Too bad!

340
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,738
Something's seriously wrong with her.

341
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,823
She's completely crazy.

342
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,372
That was really close.

343
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,377
Wait. Why did Sol have it in her hands?

344
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,504
How?

345
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,758
Whatever.
As long as I didn't get caught, it's fine.

346
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,142
Oh, my stomach.

347
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,436
Not again.

348
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,202
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

349
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,287
I think it's stomach cramps.

350
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,914
What did you eat?

351
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,128
I drank some alcohol yesterday.

352
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,420
And?

353
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,297
Nothing else.

354
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,134
What do you mean? You ate paper, too.

355
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,718
Paper? What kind?

356
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,846
-Sketchbook paper.
-What?

357
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,139
Why did you eat that?

358
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,975
-It wasn't like an appetizer, was it?
-No, that's not it.

359
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,855
Stop asking questions
and do something about this, please.

360
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,064
Yes, of course.

361
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,525
We'll start with a blood test
and an endoscopy.

362
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,526
Okay.

363
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,406
What's with you these days?

364
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,366
I just can't understand you.

365
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,917
Doctor... what's inside of me?

366
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,004
A bit of waste...

367
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,923
-and some gastric ulcers.
-Is that so?

368
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,929
Sir, since it's not serious,

369
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,764
please give that to me, okay?

370
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,766
There we go.

371
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,852
Finally, he let go.
Hurry, before he takes it again.

372
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,478
Yes, Doctor.

373
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,023
I don't see anything.

374
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,609
Next patient!

375
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,491
-We'll just slip this on.
-Okay.

376
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,036
All right.

377
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,247
-Hello, miss. Let's get started.
-Okay.

378
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,002
Excuse me... it won't hurt, right?

379
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,545
This is my first endoscopy.

380
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,047
Don't worry.

381
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,883
The anesthesia will put you to sleep.
You won't feel a thing.

382
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,343
Here you go.

383
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,223
Anesthesia doesn't actually work
that well for me.

384
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,646
It works pretty well.

385
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,563
Here we go.

386
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,774
Let's begin.

387
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,401
Let's see...

388
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,157
Miss, let go of this.

389
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,912
Hey! Why aren't you singing?

390
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,330
One more time.

391
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,332
She's like this from the start?

392
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,251
Why are all my patients like this today?

393
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,087
Miss, let go.

394
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,172
We have to finish the check-up.

395
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,508
I don't want to. I won't give it to you.

396
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,886
If you bring Doo-sik, I'll give it to you.

397
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,388
Doo-sik?

398
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,015
Doo-sik as in
when you teach kids to count?

399
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,141
Not that!

400
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,520
Doo-sik!

401
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,900
My really cute and cool friend, Doo-sik.

402
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,154
If you don't bring him to me,

403
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,616
I won't open my mouth, ever!

404
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,331
Excuse me, is there a Bong Doo-sik here?

405
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,126
Yes? That's me.

406
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:32,966
Mr. Bong Doo-sik?

407
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,137
Yes, that's me. But why...?

408
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,181
-She said she must tell you something.
-Pardon?

409
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,312
She insisted she wouldn't cooperate
unless we brought you.

410
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,271
Excuse me?

411
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,234
-I sincerely apologize.
-It's okay. This happens all the time.

412
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,361
Ms. Min Soo-ah!

413
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,655
Mr. Bong Doo-sik is here.

414
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,365
Tell him what you need to.

415
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,370
Oh, it's true.

416
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,832
My friend Doo-sik is here.

417
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,629
What is it? What are you doing?

418
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,508
I have something to tell you...

419
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,011
What? Hurry up and say it.

420
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,307
Doo-sik!

421
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,602
You see...

422
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,897
I think that...

423
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,484
I like you.

424
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,652
What?

425
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,405
This Min Soo-ah...

426
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,493
likes Bong Doo-sik...

427
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,412
really.

428
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,666
What?

429
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,461
What nonsense is this all of a sudden?

430
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,631
I've never seen someone
confess their feelings here.

431
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,343
An endoscopy romance? That's a first.

432
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,687
I slept so well.

433
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,608
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes.

434
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,319
Is the check-up done?

435
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,947
Is it really serious?

436
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,200
No. Other than a minor infection
in your stomach, you're fine.

437
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,119
What a relief.

438
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,917
Why are you laughing?

439
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,878
I didn't... fart or anything
during the check-up, did I?

440
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,964
No, it's not that.

441
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,592
You confessed to your friend
that you liked him.

442
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,636
What? I confessed?

443
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,389
To whom?

444
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,933
-Bong something or the other?
-Bong?

445
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,854
-Bong Doo-sik?
-Yes! That's right. Mr. Bong Doo-sik.

446
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,942
So... you're saying
I confessed my feelings to Bong Doo-sik?

447
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,736
How did that happen?

448
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,612
You refused to get the check-up

449
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,072
unless we brought your friend to you.

450
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,408
What?

451
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,702
I must be crazy.

452
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,996
I've gone crazy!

453
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,714
I'm so embarrassed.

454
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,428
How can I face Doo-sik now?

455
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,335
Hello?

456
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,004
Yes, this is he.

457
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,174
Excuse me?

458
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,390
I'm sorry to have called you so suddenly.

459
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,644
It's fine. What do you want say?

460
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,440
I wanted to thank you...

461
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,943
for taking care of Yoon-ah and Sol.

462
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,904
You're not in a position
to be thanking me.

463
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,157
I still wanted to tell you
how thankful I am.

464
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,243
And also...

465
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,955
this...

466
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,041
is a small token of my thanks.

467
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,337
What? A small token?

468
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,633
I see. You want me to take this money
and disappear.

469
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,134
Something like that, is it?

470
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,095
You've watched too many dramas.

471
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,057
This kind of thing is so lame,
it's not even in dramas anymore.

472
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,518
-No, it's--
-What, are you that rich?

473
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,979
Let's see how much you put in.

474
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,148
Seriously! Let's see, jeez.

475
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,946
TO DONG-GOO

476
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,449
What is this?

477
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,701
A letter.

478
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,372
I didn't know how else
to express my gratitude.

479
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,668
I see...

480
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,754
I thought... well.

481
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,844
I'll read the letter carefully at home.

482
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,931
Also... I have a favor to ask.

483
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,811
I want...

484
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,939
to take care of Yoon-ah and Sol.

485
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,567
What?

486
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,737
I still love Yoon-ah.

487
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,488
Love?

488
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,576
Then you shouldn't have left.

489
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,660
Do you know

490
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,371
what Yoon-ah's life has been like?

491
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,499
And now you want to take care of her?
How dare you.

492
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,376
I know, I've been a coward.

493
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,713
I know I can never be forgiven.

494
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,674
That's why I want to make it up to them...

495
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,470
even if it's late.

496
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,308
Will you help me, Dong-goo?

497
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,732
You really have watched too many dramas.

498
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,028
Did you think I would say,
"You're right..."

499
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,947
"Sol will be much happier...

500
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,616
living with her rich father
than a useless person like me."

501
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,494
"Though it hurts, I'll let them go."
Is that what you thought?

502
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,205
Listen carefully.

503
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,415
Whatever happens,

504
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,127
I'll be the one
who will protect Yoon-ah and Sol.

505
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,297
So don't contact us ever again.

506
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,758
I will never give up either.

507
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,843
Never.

508
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,941
This Min Soo-ah...

509
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,820
likes Bong Doo-sik.

510
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,197
Really.

511
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,700
That doesn't make sense.

512
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,744
Soo-ah? Likes me?

513
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,706
Oh, hey...

514
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,332
You're here.

515
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,086
Doo-sik. Want to grab a drink?

516
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,754
A drink?

517
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,382
-Why all the sudden?
-Just because.

518
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,843
I just feel like drinking.

519
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,389
Yeah? All right.

520
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,349
I fee like having a drink, too.

521
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,730
Hey, Joon-ki.

522
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,608
What? What do you mean?

523
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,405
Hey. Come in.

524
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,833
What is this place? Why are you here?

525
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,377
It just happened.

526
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,421
But what is all that?

527
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,841
Oh, this? Alcohol.

528
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,260
Dong-goo wanted to drink.

529
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,763
Really? That's great.

530
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,931
I really wanted to drink, too.

531
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:19,849
You too?

532
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,062
Then should we go all out tonight?

533
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,855
Should we?

534
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,149
It's been a while. Let's do this!

535
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,443
Let's party like crazy tonight!

536
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,195
Let's do this!

537
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,155
Let's drink until we go crazy!

538
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,908
What're you doing?

539
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,243
You guys are so childish.

540
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,161
Let's go!

541
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,455
Let's get this party started!

542
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,500
Let's do this!

543
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,175
What's going on with you two?

544
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,802
Did something happen?

545
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,806
It's been a while
since it's been just us girls.

546
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,682
Should we have a drink?

547
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,975
Should we?

548
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,479
I'd love to, but my body won't let me.

549
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,024
I'll watch Sol, so you two go ahead.

550
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,275
Really?

551
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,946
Yoon-ah... let's party!

552
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,030
Let's do this!

553
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,491
All right. Let's go!

554
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,577
-Sol, let's go!
-Let's go!

555
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,540
What?

556
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,209
Seo-jin broke up with you?

557
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,920
She said it's too hard to be with me.

558
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,216
I understand why she said that.

559
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,427
That's why I wanted to make things right.

560
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,430
But I hesitated.

561
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:46,310
At first,
I was just thankful for how far I've come.

562
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,980
But I keep wanting more.

563
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,274
So you're breaking up with Seo-jin?

564
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,694
When that happens...

565
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,988
you'll be...

566
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,533
as good as dead.

567
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,034
Stop!

568
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,037
No way will I break up with her.

569
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:05,955
Don't worry.

570
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,332
Of course not.

571
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,084
If you guys do break up...

572
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,920
you and Seo-jin...

573
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,298
will...

574
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,676
attend your own funerals.

575
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,641
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

576
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,019
Cheers!

577
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,985
It's been a while
since just the three of us hung out.

578
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,820
For real.

579
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,865
There aren't any guests,
and Sol is sleeping.

580
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,366
It's perfect.

581
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,368
It's perfect for going bankrupt.

582
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,747
But still, it's nice and fun hanging out,

583
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,582
just us girls by ourselves.

584
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,169
-Seo-jin?
-Yeah?

585
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,213
Did something happen
between you and Joon-ki?

586
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,507
Did you guys fight?

587
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,053
It's just... been hard lately.

588
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,264
-What?
-Just everything.

589
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,434
I don't think he likes me...

590
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,937
as much as I like him.

591
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,398
It's like I was making a big fuss
all by myself.

592
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,527
What? The way I see it,
Joon-ki likes you more.

593
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:19,946
Yeah.

594
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,240
I don't know...

595
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,076
I really don't know.

596
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,872
Whatever. I really don't know.

597
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,294
Drink up!

598
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,600
Dong-goo. Why are you sighing?

599
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,477
Just...

600
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,896
I'm a bit anxious.

601
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,523
Why?

602
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,818
You scared because Sol's dad showed up?

603
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,279
Are you worried Yoon-ah will go to him?

604
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,364
Hey, you jerk!

605
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,786
It's not that...

606
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,040
but he is Sol's real dad.

607
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,667
And he's capable.

608
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,964
Besides, I'm leaving Korea in a few days.

609
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,924
So I'm a bit anxious.

610
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,051
There's nothing to be anxious about.

611
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,178
A few days ago,

612
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,598
Sol called him "Daddy."

613
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,686
I felt as if my heart

614
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,063
just dropped.

615
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,234
So I can't help feeling anxious.

616
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:45,239
I'll also be away from them for a month
to shoot the movie.

617
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,783
You should propose to her, then.

618
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,702
Propose?

619
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,583
I'm in no place to propose anything.

620
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,383
Yoon-ah...

621
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,721
can I ask you something?

622
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,015
What is it?

623
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,144
Have you ever regretted

624
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,479
dating my brother?

625
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,066
No.

626
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,194
I've never regretted it once.

627
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,362
Really?

628
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,408
Yes. Dong-goo...

629
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:33,287
isn't that capable, is narrow-minded,

630
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,247
gets angry easily,

631
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,166
and seems like a child...

632
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,630
but he loves me
more than anyone else in the world.

633
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,841
I can tell just by looking at his eyes.

634
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,889
I can see how much he cherishes me
and loves me.

635
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,018
That's enough for me.

636
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,399
Jeez, that's making me nauseous.
I think I'm getting cramps again.

637
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,861
You're saying you can tell
by looking at his eyes.

638
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,321
Yup.

639
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,658
How come I can't tell?

640
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,953
Love is so hard.

641
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,250
Everything about love is hard.

642
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,504
Lately I feel like I want to die,
for real.

643
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,672
Why?

644
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,134
-Do you like someone?
-What?

645
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,886
-Who is it?
-Seriously?

646
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,930
No, don't worry about it.

647
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,566
By the way,

648
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,068
do you guys like hide-and-seek?

649
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,490
-Hide-and-seek?
-Yes.

650
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,535
I really love hide-and-seek.

651
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,203
Do you want to play?

652
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,207
Soo-ah, since you didn't drink,

653
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,418
you can be "it."

654
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,087
I'm going to go hide!

655
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,756
What's she doing?

656
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,258
What's wrong with Yoon-ah?

657
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,428
Do we really have to play hide-and-seek?

658
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,306
Hey!

659
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,390
Where are you going?

660
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,018
You're "it," aren't you?

661
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,519
I have to go hide.

662
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,480
Wait...

663
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,234
Count to ten first, okay?

664
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,654
Seriously?

665
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,739
Soo-ah!

666
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,533
I'm hiding!

667
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,953
I'm really not hiding in the laundry room,

668
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,081
you really can't come in here.

669
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,417
What is wrong with them?

670
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,587
Do I really have to go find them?

671
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,298
This is insane.

672
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,892
For you and me both,

673
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,771
life is difficult.

674
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,856
Don't you agree?

675
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,026
Yeah.

676
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,323
Why are you laughing?

677
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,659
It's funny.

678
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,329
Both of you sound like such snobs
right now, you know that right?

679
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,790
When did you become such snobs?

680
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,834
It's foolish, cowardly, and pathetic.

681
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,128
-What?
-I'm right.

682
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,505
You!

683
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,258
When did you start calculating
pros and cons in love?

684
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,720
You're worried because that guy
has money and is capable.

685
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:41,058
What's the connection between
being capable and being in love?

686
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,602
You too, Joon-ki.

687
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,022
You're not Kim Soo-hyun or Gong-yoo.

688
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,317
You have nothing to lose,
but you're terrified.

689
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,945
You refused your dad's help
to succeed on your own.

690
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,322
But that was a complete farce.

691
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,826
Am I wrong?

692
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,746
Is it normal to live like this?

693
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,709
It leaves a bitter taste.

694
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,628
I didn't think we would change.

695
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,548
Even if we were a bit...

696
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,633
petty...

697
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,928
I thought we led pretty amazing lives.

698
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,597
Right.

699
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,892
When did I become such a scaredy-cat?

700
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,687
Scaredy-cat isn't so bad.

701
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:31,609
I'm the biggest loser in the world.

702
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:33,819
Oh! That's right!

703
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,365
Want to hear

704
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,908
something really outrageous?

705
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:44,330
So apparently, Soo-ah...

706
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,249
Soo-ah likes me!

707
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,294
What?

708
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,630
Soo-ah? You?

709
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,131
You're shocked, right?

710
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,550
I was also really shocked.

711
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,136
Come on, that can't be right.

712
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,598
Yeah, that's not possible.

713
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,308
Wait a minute...

714
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,186
why is it impossible?

715
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,730
Soo-ah's pretty great.

716
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,898
Oh, jeez.

717
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,650
She's cool and pretty.

718
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,651
Jeez.

719
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,403
She's pure and innocent.

720
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,825
Who are you to look down on me?
You're dating Dong-goo's sister.

721
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,119
Hey, you punk!

722
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,954
That's wrong, you punk.

723
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,707
Yeah, punk, that's wrong.

724
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,709
That's wrong! Punk!

725
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,127
You punk!

726
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,172
That's not what I meant!

727
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,106
-A mustache?
-A lucky charm.

728
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,734
Even if I'm not there, look at this,

729
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,737
and remember I'm always by your side,
all right?

730
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,784
You know I'm always by your side?

731
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,036
Don't forget I'm always cheering for you.

732
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,415
You can do it, Joon-ki!

733
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,969
Do you...

734
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,679
not see me as a woman?

735
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,014
I see you as a man.

736
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,975
I think I like you.

737
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,520
Let's start dating...

738
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,522
Joon-ki!

739
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,737
Let's do it!

740
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,158
You struggled for so long
and are just starting to make it.

741
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,785
I don't want to hold you back.

742
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,131
Where are you going?

743
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,759
To see a fan of mine.

744
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,052
What are you saying?

745
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,220
What about meeting the CEO?

746
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,390
It doesn't matter.
He can destroy the contract.

747
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,517
Why are you suddenly like this?

748
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,689
I want to live like I did before.

749
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,649
Without plans or maturity.

750
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,028
Without being a coward.

751
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,449
Joon-ki!

752
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,083
That startled me! What was that?

753
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,046
What is this smell?

754
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,839
Who farted? Who?

755
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,178
What the... no one's here.

756
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,973
Did I fart?

757
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,684
Oh, that stinks.

758
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,400
I stayed up all night
playing hide-and-seek.

759
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,319
My whole body hurts like hell.

760
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,447
Jeez, my head.

761
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,327
Gosh, my head really hurts.

762
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,537
My stomach hurts, too.

763
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,373
What's this?

764
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,416
Why is she sleeping here?

765
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,338
How awkward...

766
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,840
I should just go sleep in my room.

767
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,268
That must've hurt a lot.

768
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,603
She must be in a deep sleep.

769
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,902
Where is it?

770
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,575
There it is!

771
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,622
Soo-ah, if you can scoot a little more...

772
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,963
That hurts!

773
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,132
Soo-ah! Are you okay?

774
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,552
Yeah. I'm okay.

775
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,387
When did you get back?

776
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,015
Oh, well... just right now.

777
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,976
I see.

778
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,813
I was in such a deep sleep,

779
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,357
I had no idea you were here.

780
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,110
It seemed like that.

781
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,238
Aren't you going to answer your phone?

782
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,867
Oh, yes, of course.

783
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,040
Hello? Yes.

784
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,667
What? Right now?

785
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,004
Okay, I got it.

786
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,259
Soo-ah...

787
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,887
will you help me out?

788
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,361
Soo-ah! What are you doing here?

789
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,487
What?

790
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,198
I was just driving by and saw you...

791
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,492
Are you going to an interview? Get in!

792
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,869
It's okay, I'll take the subway.

793
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,830
Just get in, I'll take you.
Hurry, come one!

794
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,376
-It's really okay.
-Just get in.

795
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,848
Doo-sik? You're here, too?

796
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,393
Seo-jin, take this.

797
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,939
-It's okay, I don't want it.
-I'll eat.

798
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:44,898
Can you get it for me?

799
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,776
What? This door doesn't open
and the window is broken too though.

800
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,736
Can you just grab it for me?

801
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,862
If opens a little bit.

802
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,948
Yeah, this is really good.

803
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,825
Jeez.

804
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,578
Give it here.

805
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,165
-What are you doing?
-Roll it up!

806
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:06,962
I'm stuck!

807
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,922
See, I knew this was going to happen!

808
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,507
-Success!
-Okay!

809
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,803
What do you mean? Success?

810
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,471
Soo-ah! Step on it!

811
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,431
You got it!

812
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,603
What are you doing? Where are we going?

813
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,021
Joon-ki asked us to kidnap you.

814
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,356
So stay quiet and cooperate.

815
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,942
What? You rascals, seriously!

816
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,111
-I'm getting off.
-Hey, calm down.

817
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,113
Stop right now!

818
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,781
Calm down! It's dangerous!

819
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,825
Doo-sik, do something!

820
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:37,743
It hurts!

821
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,411
Stay still!

822
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,382
Hey.

823
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,135
What are you doing?

824
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,262
Hello?

825
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,144
Yoon-ah.

826
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,521
What are you doing here?

827
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,857
I came to return some things.

828
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,363
-Yoon-ah, those things were just--
-I understand.

829
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,240
I also know

830
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,701
that you're sincerely sorry to me and Sol.

831
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,247
But whatever you do...

832
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,792
I won't change my mind.

833
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,336
I really love Dong-goo.

834
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,882
I suffered so much because of the hurt,

835
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,927
but he helped me recover and move on.

836
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,306
So I don't even blame you anymore. Truly.

837
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,934
Ever since Sol and I

838
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,311
met Dong-goo...

839
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,900
I mean... since we met our family,

840
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,737
we're really happy.

841
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,990
So, Sung-min,

842
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,035
let's just keep the good memories
and move on.

843
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,538
But if you keep doing this,

844
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,208
even those good memories will be ruined.

845
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,213
That would be too sad.

846
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,467
I'll be leaving now.

847
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,684
Call me anytime you want to see Sol.

848
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,157
All right, double check
that everything's here.

849
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,661
Let's not get to Dubai
and discover we've forgotten something.

850
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,787
Okay.

851
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,623
Dong-goo. Let me see the schedule.

852
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,000
Yes, Director.

853
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,797
-Here it is.
-Good, thank you.

854
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,237
What kind of crazy parent
leaves their tiny baby alone?

855
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,115
I'm really sorry. I'll get going now.

856
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:29,664
Yeah! Who never cries
even when lonely or sad? Candy!

857
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,166
I mean, Dong-goo!

858
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,209
-What's all this?
-Sol's 100th day celebration!

859
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,586
Thank you guys so much.

860
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:08,787
I like you.

861
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:09,996
I like you.

862
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,998
I really like you, Yoon-ah.

863
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,000
I really like you, Dong-goo.

864
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,468
Why would I break up with you?

865
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,553
When you're just next to me

866
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,722
my heart races.

867
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,241
Director, I have something to say.

868
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:50,537
LEE JOON-KI'S
EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

869
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,254
What is this? Why isn't he here yet?

870
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,839
Seriously, what's going on?

871
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,507
What is this place?

872
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,512
Who are these people?

873
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,566
There he is.

874
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,485
He's here.

875
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,214
Hello. I'm actor Lee Joon-ki.

876
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,508
Though it was short notice,

877
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,927
thank you for showing up today.

878
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,183
Today, I'd like to tell you the truth

879
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,685
about the rumors of Cindy and me.

880
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,691
CINDY WILL GET MARRIED

881
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,235
-Cindy and I--
-What is this?

882
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,820
"Cindy will marry."

883
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,864
"She's three-months pregnant..."?

884
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,450
It says Cindy is marrying
actor Lee Min-seok.

885
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,701
It's a shotgun marriage.

886
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,371
Jeez, I knew it.

887
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:19,250
Why would Cindy get involved
with a new actor like Joon-ki?

888
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,168
Let's go, hurry.

889
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,257
Wait.

890
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,093
Excuse me! Cindy and I...

891
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,470
Are you taking all the mics?

892
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,472
Reporters!

893
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,182
Excuse me! Where are you going?

894
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,683
I, Lee Joon-ki...

895
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,316
Everyone left.

896
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,318
What's this? Where'd they all go?

897
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,487
Cindy announced her wedding.

898
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,655
Why would they stay here?

899
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,284
What the hell is this?
You put on a show and everything.

900
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:57,247
Seriously. You said to bring Seo-jin,
whatever it takes.

901
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,499
Is this what you wanted to show her?

902
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,959
It's so embarrassing.

903
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,671
What are you doing?

904
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,756
I'm leaving.

905
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,927
Seo-jin! How can you just leave?

906
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,137
Let go of me.

907
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,014
I was going to tell the reporters
everything.

908
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,349
That you're my girlfriend,

909
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,309
that there's nothing between me and Cindy.

910
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,396
Are you stupid?
Did I ever ask you to do that?

911
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,817
You didn't? Then... what is it?

912
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,571
You're so thick-headed.

913
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:32,031
-Forget it, I'm going.
-Seo-jin!

914
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,660
I'm sorry.

915
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,164
I've really been a coward.

916
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,542
But I realize now

917
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,920
that the most important thing
in the world to me...

918
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:47,881
is you.

919
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,301
Truly?

920
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,012
Seo-jin,

921
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,389
I love you.

922
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,100
I really love you.

923
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,318
I can finally see it a little.

924
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,155
-What?
-Someone said...

925
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,781
that if you look at his eyes,

926
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,075
you can tell how much
he cherishes and loves you.

927
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,411
But...

928
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:23,374
now that I look at you...
I can see it... a little bit.

929
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,335
Really?

930
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,797
But you only see it a little bit?

931
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,674
That's not right.

932
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,635
Look, look closely!

933
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,720
I'm sure you'll see a lot. See?

934
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,096
That's gross, stop it.

935
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,016
I said to look! Look how much
I cherish and love you!

936
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:40,975
See?

937
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,144
Are you joking around again, even now?

938
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,830
They look good together.

939
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,749
Yeah, they do.

940
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:08,002
Why do they fight so much,
when they like each other that much?

941
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,382
Should we go to the restaurant today,
for real this time?

942
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,591
Okay!

943
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,093
Let's go! My treat!

944
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,432
I'm hungry, too.

945
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,352
Soo-ah, aren't you hungry?

946
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,188
Well, maybe a bit?

947
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,858
Yeah? Then want to go somewhere nice...

948
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:31,859
and eat something?

949
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,240
Just the two of us?

950
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,408
Why?

951
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,828
Is there a reason friends can't eat
somewhere nice together?

952
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,124
You're right.

953
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,671
But somewhere nice, where?

954
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,716
Let's see... I'll find a place.

955
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,012
Let's go.

956
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,079
Why isn't anyone home? That's strange.

957
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,340
Hello? This is Waikiki Guesthouse.

958
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,633
Yes.

959
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,428
What? Dong-goo?

960
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,556
Yes, okay.

961
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,729
DONG-GOO

962
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,661
Dong-goo, what is all this?

963
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,468
What are you doing?

964
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,304
Yoon-ah.

965
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,183
Yoon-ah,

966
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:28,685
marry me?

967
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,106
I'll make you and Sol happy
for the rest of your lives.

968
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,567
Marry me, Yoon-ah.

969
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:44,992
I don't want to.

970
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,704
What?

971
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,039
But... why?

972
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:54,252
Is it because I spoke too informally?
I'll do it again.

973
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,294
Yoon-ah,

974
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,296
would you marry me, please?

975
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,425
I don't want to.

976
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,516
But... why?

977
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,102
I'll tell you later.

978
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,730
Dong-goo, what happened with your job?

979
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,148
The director just called.

980
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,696
I just decided not to go to Dubai.

981
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,866
I just couldn't leave...

982
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,159
without you and Sol.

983
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:27,869
Why not?

984
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,163
Is it because of Sol's dad?

985
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,875
No... it's not that...

986
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,963
Jeez, this guy really requires
so much effort.

987
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,090
What?

988
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,926
Kang Dong-goo.

989
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,431
Are you that worried?

990
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,600
Why are you so worried?

991
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,853
I'm not worried at all, so why are you?

992
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,522
You're such a scaredy-cat, Dong-goo.

993
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,816
I'm not...

994
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,110
Did you think I'd be moved

995
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,404
if you did this?

996
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,491
You're giving up your dream job?

997
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,535
And because of me?

998
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,162
Don't you trust me?

999
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,538
I mean...

1000
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,165
it's not that...

1001
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,046
Dong-goo...

1002
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,507
don't worry one bit,

1003
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,592
and just go.

1004
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,095
I'll be here.

1005
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,848
I'll be by your side...

1006
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,643
forever.

1007
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,529
Forever?

1008
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,324
I'll be back.

1009
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,409
-Have fun.
-See you.

1010
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,326
Safe travels!

1011
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,248
Don't you two fight and break up
while I'm not here.

1012
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,833
Okay.

1013
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,251
Joon-ki, be good to my sister.

1014
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,919
If not, you know what'll happen.

1015
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,005
I know, you punk!

1016
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:47,592
"You'll be as good as dead."

1017
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,471
If it means I never have to hear that,
I'll treat Seo-jin like a princess.

1018
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,140
Okay, that's good, then.

1019
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,100
Soo-ah, hope business goes well,

1020
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,269
and stop scolding Doo-sik, okay?

1021
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,771
When did I do that?

1022
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,689
I've stopped doing that.

1023
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,066
-Why not?
-What?

1024
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,320
Why aren't you scolding him?
I wonder.

1025
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,947
What?

1026
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,199
That's enough, just go. Go to Dubai.

1027
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,328
Doo-sik, you too.
Don't just go on dates,

1028
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,204
finish some good scenarios, okay?

1029
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,831
What do you mean, dating?

1030
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:19,874
I don't date.

1031
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,543
Whatever, finish the scenario
before I come back.

1032
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,337
I'm going to check in regularly.

1033
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,672
All right, so stop nagging me!

1034
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,010
Yoon-ah, I'll be back.

1035
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,888
Okay. Stay healthy, and come back safe.

1036
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,014
Okay.

1037
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,809
Don't forget to eat and sleep well
while I'm not here.

1038
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:42,063
Make sure to digest everything well,
and go to the bathroom regularly,

1039
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,856
and don't even look at another man--

1040
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,192
All right, all right.

1041
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,401
Enough already. Go on.

1042
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,529
Okay. I still have to say bye to Sol.

1043
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:52,990
Sol,

1044
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,701
don't forget my face.

1045
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,912
Don't get sick. Be healthy and well.

1046
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,623
I'll be right back, okay?

1047
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,543
I'm really going now.

1048
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:07,129
Sol, see you soon.

1049
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,009
Daddy.

1050
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,596
What?

1051
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,477
Sol.

1052
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,521
What did you just say?

1053
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,606
Daddy.

1054
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,861
Did you hear that?

1055
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,572
She called me Daddy.
You heard it, right?

1056
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,283
Yeah, we heard it! You happy?

1057
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,743
Of course I'm happy!

1058
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,245
Sol, say it one more time!

1059
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,247
Say, "Daddy"!

1060
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,292
Come on, just once more. Such a tease.

1061
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,921
One more time. Just one more time.

1062
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,882
Dong-goo, enough. You'll miss your plane.

1063
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,969
Now that Sol called me Daddy,
I really don't want to go.

1064
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,221
Yoon-ah, should I not go?

1065
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,349
You're starting with that again?
Hurry and get going.

1066
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,976
Okay.

1067
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,022
I'm really going now.

1068
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,106
Okay.

1069
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:09,859
Sol...

1070
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,196
Daddy will be back.

1071
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,995
-Be safe!
-Bye!

1072
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:24,081
Stay healthy and take care!

1073
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,922
TWO MONTHS LATER

1074
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:34,800
Who are you?

1075
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,261
I know you're there.

1076
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,097
Do you want to come out,
or should I go to you?

1077
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,099
Show yourself, you scum!

1078
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,696
I'm surprised you found me.

1079
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,950
You're quick,
probably because you're the President.

1080
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,535
Be quiet!

1081
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,871
Let my people go, you alien!

1082
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,542
I'm surprised to find a president on earth
who cares about the people.

1083
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,503
But it's too late...

1084
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:14,006
we've already taken over the people
and the land.

1085
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:17,510
Don't you dare lay a finger on my people.

1086
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,553
If you do...

1087
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,646
you'll feel the wrath of my finger jab!

1088
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,064
That's absurd!

1089
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,987
Cut! No good!

1090
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:37,988
DIRECTOR KANG DONG-GOO

1091
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,074
PRESIDENT IS BRUCE LEE

1092
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,075
Hey, you idiot!

1093
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,994
How could you cough at that moment?

1094
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,539
I'm suffocating in here!
And why do I have to do this?

1095
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,082
I'm the writer. The writer!

1096
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,167
We have a small budget.
We have no choice.

1097
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,503
You can't sacrifice even this much
for your own work?

1098
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:55,714
Hey! I made time in my busy schedule...

1099
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,632
but what is all this?

1100
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,760
I'm Song Joon-seok!
Of the famous Newsroom!

1101
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,304
-Thong Thoon Theok.
-Song Joon-seok, my ass.

1102
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,516
You did that one drama
and been bumming ever since.

1103
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:06,475
What?

1104
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:10,187
I'm carefully considering my next role
right now!

1105
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:12,898
I'm doing this without a guarantee,
but you're so ungrateful.

1106
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,110
If we shoot this, will the movie
actually be released?

1107
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,028
Why are there more actors than staff?

1108
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:21,490
Hey, do more staff members
mean a better movie?

1109
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,285
We have an amazing director instead.

1110
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:27,746
-Director, my ass.
-Really, who are we kidding here.

1111
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,789
You're the joke!

1112
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,000
You're the one who wrote
a terrible script!

1113
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:31,917
What do you mean?

1114
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,378
-I'm the writer!
-You two are no different!

1115
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:37,047
-You're all making a fuss--
-Be quiet!

1116
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,428
You want me for an article,
but all you're doing is fighting?

1117
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,847
Should I write an article
about your fighting?

1118
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,017
You idiots.

1119
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,104
This movie is bound to fail.

1120
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,731
How about just quitting now?

1121
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,942
What do you mean?
Our movie's going to be a hit!

1122
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,611
For sure! We're going to go to Cannes!

1123
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,904
I'm going to get Best Actor!

1124
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,073
Dong-goo!

1125
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,785
Food's here!

1126
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,371
I brought food! Let's eat first.

1127
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,248
Yoon-ah, you're here.

1128
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,543
Our dear little Sol is here, too.

1129
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,129
-Is the shooting going well?
-Of course.

1130
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,840
It already smells like a blockbuster hit.

1131
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,636
Let's eat first!

1132
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,095
Come and eat, everyone!

1133
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,432
Hey! What are you doing there?

1134
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,269
You said you scouted the location.

1135
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,979
You didn't pay the fee, did you?

1136
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,273
What? So we've been shooting
without a permit?

1137
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,485
Well, we have a low budget...

1138
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,781
-What are we going to do?
-What else can we do?

1139
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:45,241
We run!

1140
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,326
Jeez, seriously!

1141
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,453
Hurry! Run!

1142
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,121
Stop right there!
