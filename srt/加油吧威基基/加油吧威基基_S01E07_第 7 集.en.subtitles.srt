1
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,636
Soo-ah.

2
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,182
Dong-goo.

3
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,851
What...

4
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,562
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,314
Is something wrong?

6
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,612
What should I do, Dong-goo?

7
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,380
What now?

8
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,841
We'll all get thrown out
if we can't pay the landlady back.

9
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,468
I know.

10
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,804
We don't have anywhere to go.

11
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,932
It's all your fault!

12
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,350
What'll you do now?

13
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,352
How could I know this would happen?

14
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,940
How do we make that much in a month?

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,024
This is insane.

16
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,985
You're in no position to worry about that.

17
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,071
-What do you mean?
-Dong-goo will be back soon.

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,448
The fake wedding and honeymoon.

19
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,367
You even got him in debt.

20
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,327
You don't think he'll let you off, do you?

21
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,830
I hope you rest in peace.

22
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,414
Rest in peace.

23
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,418
Doo-sik, pass Sol to me.

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,670
What for?

25
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,172
Dong-goo won't hit me if I have her.
Give her to me.

26
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,090
-No way.
-Come on.

27
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,341
-Hurry.
-I'm back.

28
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,514
Dong-goo, calm down.

29
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,266
Hear me out first.

30
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,060
Don't you say a thing.
Not a single word.

31
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,066
Go on, come in.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,110
Someone's here?

33
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,782
Soo-ah.

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,209
YOU ARE THE APPLE OF MY EYE

35
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,805
Don't think about anything else
and get some sleep, okay?

36
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,475
Dong-goo, I just don't think
this is right.

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,063
I have a conscience.
I can't accept your help.

38
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,609
-I should go.
-Min Soo-ah.

39
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,777
Where can you go so late
when you have no home?

40
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,030
Leave in the morning if you want.

41
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,823
Don't make me worry.

42
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,242
Good night.

43
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,216
What?

44
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,093
The guy she was dating was a con man?

45
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,803
He took her rent deposit

46
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,139
and money her parents gave her
to study abroad?

47
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,349
Yes.

48
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,810
Soo-ah's not the only one he conned.

49
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,855
She was targeted by an expert, then.

50
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,357
I feel so bad for her.

51
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,775
Why would you?

52
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,277
She paid for ditching Dong-goo.

53
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,071
Hey, how can you say that?

54
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,156
What? She ditched you for a rich guy

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,658
and ended up penniless.

56
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,452
Even so, how dare she come here?
She has no conscience.

57
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,870
She had nowhere to go.

58
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,247
She could go to her parents.

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,541
Her father's sick.
He'll faint if he finds out.

60
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,210
I found her crying in the park.

61
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,587
Don't give her a hard time
and be nice to her, okay?

62
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,006
You must feel so sorry for her.

63
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,467
Why? Does seeing her again
give you regrets

64
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,843
and make you want her back?

65
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,762
What are you saying?

66
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,722
It's not like that, you brat.

67
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,891
Just say no, then.
You didn't have to yell.

68
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,978
I'm sorry, Dong-goo.

69
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,481
The fruit's staring at me. Can I have one?

70
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,858
How can you think of eating
at a time like this?

71
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,611
What'll you do about the landlady's money?

72
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,446
Do whatever it takes to get it.

73
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,573
If you don't, I'll throw you out, okay?

74
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,284
I'll get it back. I will.

75
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
What's wrong with your voice?

76
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,245
Do you know what this fruit is?

77
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,789
It's okay. Can I have just one?

78
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,500
Did you sleep well, Dong-goo?

79
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,085
No.

80
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,005
All these red stickers

81
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,132
gave me nightmares all night.

82
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,718
I see.

83
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,761
I'll make breakfast right away.

84
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,222
No, it's fine. I'll just have some milk.

85
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,934
-Here's a mug.
-Thanks.

86
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,852
Ouch.

87
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,731
Is it the cold wind?
My lips keep getting chapped.

88
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,956
What are you doing?
The milk's overflowing.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,416
Oh no, what happened?

90
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,627
What were you thinking about
that you zoned out?

91
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,172
Nothing. I wasn't thinking about anything.

92
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,590
This is insane.

93
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,884
Why do I keep thinking about that?

94
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,927
I made some pies.

95
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,095
Will you try them?

96
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,347
This lovely smell was the pies?

97
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,769
Wow, they look delicious.

98
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,771
-It looks so good.
-It looks tasty.

99
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,272
Joon-ki.

100
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,066
Did you ask around for some money?

101
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,361
Wow, the pie's nice and crispy.

102
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,864
It looks pretty and Yoon-ah,
you're pretty.

103
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,199
You fool.

104
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,335
Don't do that with food.

105
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,628
Yoon-ah.

106
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,797
Did you put walnuts in these?

107
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,090
Yes. Why?

108
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,883
No way.

109
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,635
Soap, soap.

110
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,346
No, sanitizer. Antiseptic. Damn it.

111
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,764
He shouldn't waste food.

112
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,599
What was that about?

113
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,059
He has a walnut allergy.

114
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,020
If he eats walnuts, he gets a rash,

115
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,772
chills, a fever, and diarrhea.

116
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,941
The symptoms last a week.

117
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,859
I see.

118
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,069
That's a joke.

119
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,489
He overreacted because I mentioned money.

120
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,450
Soo-ah, did you sleep well?

121
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:50,868
Why did you pack?

122
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,287
I should go.

123
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,248
You found a place?

124
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,415
Don't worry.

125
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,836
If I sell these, I'll have enough
to rent a place.

126
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,338
I posted them online
and someone called right away.

127
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,923
I see.

128
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,049
Have some breakfast.

129
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,051
No, I'm fine.

130
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,011
I have a conscience.

131
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,721
I can't leech off you anymore.

132
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,434
I should get going. Take care, Dong-goo.

133
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,437
Take care, everyone.

134
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,397
Okay.

135
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,523
Bye.

136
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,401
They were all designer bags.

137
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,153
I'm glad she ditched my brother.

138
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,155
She'd have bankrupted our family
if they got married.

139
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,656
Will you stop it?

140
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,743
I think I bought her one of those bags.

141
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,122
You poor loser.

142
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,964
It's almost time.
Why isn't the person here?

143
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,971
Are you "Bag Shuttler"?

144
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,266
"Usain Bolt" who wanted to buy them?

145
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,477
-Yes. Hello.
-Hello.

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,103
Can I see the bags first?

147
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,104
Sure.

148
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,608
I cherished them more than my life.

149
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,318
They're in good condition.

150
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,820
It looks new.

151
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,822
Can I try it on?

152
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,823
Of course.

153
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,993
-Look at this, too.
-It looks exquisite.

154
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,328
Look at the color of this one.

155
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,040
I can't decide. I like them all.

156
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,210
I'll buy all of them.

157
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,961
-How much are they?
-Really?

158
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,379
Just a moment.

159
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,965
Let me see.

160
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,343
Oh dear, my shoelaces are undone.

161
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,804
Are you any good at running?

162
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,014
Pardon?

163
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,891
Not really. Why?

164
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,601
I used to

165
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,437
represent Seoul City in the sprint.

166
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,397
I see.

167
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,234
A sprint is all about the start.

168
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,652
Watch me.

169
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,820
First,

170
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,615
you prepare to run at a moment's notice.

171
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,077
Now give me the signal. Say "go."

172
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,663
-What?
-Hold up three fingers and say "go."

173
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,206
-Point upward.
-Up?

174
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,123
Upward.

175
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,417
-And say "go"!
-Go!

176
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,382
She's really fast.

177
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,425
She is a runner.

178
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,178
Usain Bolt.

179
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,721
Where are you going?

180
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,348
Hey. Hey.

181
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,892
Why that...!

182
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,812
Hey, stop where you are! Thief!

183
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:35,241
Usain Bolt, you evil wench!

184
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,078
It's freezing cold.

185
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,998
Why must we meet on a freezing morning?

186
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,000
Is the director not here yet?

187
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,752
Sorry, are you okay?

188
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,005
Yes, I'm fine.

189
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,756
Excuse me.

190
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,551
Aren't you Bong Doo-sik?

191
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,845
Pardon? Yes, that's me. Who...

192
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,973
It's me, Mal-geum.
Don't you recognize me?

193
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,309
Mal-geum?

194
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,937
Yoon Mal-geum from Yoojin Elementary,
Grade Six Class Three?

195
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,439
How long has it been?

196
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,861
Very long. You look just the same.
You're still pretty.

197
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,822
Am I? You look great.

198
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,782
Not at all.

199
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,868
You'll need a coffee. I'll get one.

200
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,953
-Go and sit down.
-Okay.

201
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,462
Mr. Bong.

202
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,172
-You're here early.
-Hello.

203
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,923
-Hi.
-Why did you ask to see me?

204
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,968
We cast the actress for our film.

205
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,803
-I want you to meet her.
-What?

206
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,513
You cast the female lead already?

207
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,098
Yes, she's called Cherry.

208
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,017
She's a rising star

209
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,102
and you'll like her when you see her.

210
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,522
-Cherry?
-She's here already.

211
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,815
Cherry.

212
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,651
-Hello, Director.
-Hi.

213
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,904
Say hello. That's Cherry.

214
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,085
I have to get going.

215
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,587
See you two around.

216
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,172
-Bye, Director.
-Bye.

217
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,882
Goodbye.

218
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,724
I liked the script.

219
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,602
You loved to write even then.

220
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,812
You became a writer.

221
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,064
What? Yes.

222
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,192
You were mature then
and you got into erotic...

223
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,071
Never mind.

224
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,448
I should go.

225
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,159
Which way do you go? I go this way.

226
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,203
I go that way.

227
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,704
See you around, Che...

228
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,623
Mal-geum.

229
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,668
Okay. Take care.

230
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,420
Bye.

231
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,852
Yeah, it's been a while. Sudden?

232
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,645
No, I just thought of you.

233
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,023
Do you remember how I saved you
when you almost drowned?

234
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,610
Yes, I'm Lee Joon-ki, your lifesaver.

235
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,529
So, do you have any money?

236
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,697
I need--

237
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,074
Hello? Hello?

238
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,493
How dare he treat his lifesaver like this?

239
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,412
I don't need friends like you.

240
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,581
Hey.

241
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,209
What should I do now?

242
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,677
Your yearbook?

243
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,473
Yoon Mal-geum?

244
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,349
Why are there red hearts?

245
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,893
She's my first love.

246
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,935
Your first love?

247
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,271
Wow, she's pretty.

248
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,815
Why are you staring at this now?

249
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,901
We met today by chance.

250
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,235
By chance?

251
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,362
How did you two meet?

252
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,491
As the scriptwriter and actress
of an erotic movie.

253
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,909
Is she still pretty?

254
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,495
What is she up to these days?

255
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,081
She's the female lead
of the erotic movie based on my script.

256
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,291
Are you crying?

257
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,252
Are you that pleased
you met your first love?

258
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,506
Joon-ki.

259
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,469
Did you like her that much?

260
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,721
You're so naive.

261
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,223
Do you like her?

262
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,774
It's so cold.

263
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,610
I have no cash or place to go.

264
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,865
Going back to Dong-goo goes against
what little conscience I have.

265
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,534
This is crazy.

266
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,330
Usain Bolt, that evil witch.

267
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,545
Soo-ah.

268
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,382
-What are you doing here?
-What?

269
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,426
I was just passing by.

270
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,806
Is this your guesthouse?
I had no idea.

271
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,558
You do know.

272
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,143
You were here every day
until a few months ago.

273
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,145
What? That was...

274
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,067
I have night blindness
and can't see at night.

275
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,361
Night blindness?
You can't see at night?

276
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,947
What? Well...

277
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,075
I got it after we broke up.
I caught it somewhere.

278
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,036
Oh, come on. Min Soo-ah.

279
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,747
Are you here because
you have nowhere to go?

280
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,292
No.

281
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm thoroughly and carefully
looking for a place I like.

282
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,256
Okay, fine, you can spend the night here.

283
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,091
Keep looking tomorrow.

284
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,052
No. I have a conscience.

285
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,596
I can't ask for help again.

286
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,681
You said you have night blindness.

287
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,183
You can't see at night.

288
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,187
Seeing how concerned you are,
I'll stay just one more night then.

289
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,612
Jeez...

290
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,954
Soo-ah. Go on upstairs to bed.

291
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,834
This night blindness
will be the death of me.

292
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,131
Darn this night blindness.

293
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,091
"Night blindness." As if.

294
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,718
Did you see her stomp her way up?

295
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,055
She talked about "conscience" and whatnot
and she came back?

296
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,266
She hasn't found a place yet.
So I brought her in.

297
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,768
What an idiot.

298
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,103
Isn't it because you
still have feelings for her?

299
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,521
No, no!

300
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,524
Why would you say that here?

301
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,234
Where else would I say it?

302
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,195
In the kitchen, bathroom or bedroom?

303
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,364
-Would I say it outside?
-Whatever.

304
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,657
Do you have the money?

305
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,078
-This is so sweet and sour.
-I knew it.

306
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,998
Don't eat anything
until you have the cash.

307
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,626
Yoon-ah, don't feed him anything tomorrow.

308
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,710
What?

309
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,253
Fine, you jerk.

310
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,006
If that's what you want, I won't eat.

311
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,551
I will get the money somehow
and throw it in your face.

312
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,886
You wait and see!

313
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,806
Gosh, I'm so scared.
As if you can find the money.

314
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,934
I'm so scared I might wet myself.

315
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,688
Hello? Hey.

316
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,107
What time is the party this weekend?

317
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,901
Oh, 2:00 p.m.?

318
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,194
Okay.

319
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,031
Hey, so could I

320
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,409
get paid in advance?

321
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:38,664
Yes. Pay me two years' salary
in advance and I'll...

322
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,915
Hello?

323
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,542
Hello?

324
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,215
Yeah. Two years' worth was too much.

325
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,218
My goodness.

326
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,262
What's this woman doing here?

327
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,056
Without a blanket?
What if she catches a cold?

328
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,058
Hang on.

329
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,437
Why am I caring about that?

330
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:07,276
Why do I keep caring for her? Why?

331
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,989
This is just...

332
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,907
Yes, fine.

333
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,327
I'm showing pity.

334
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,289
It's like how you care
for the less fortunate.

335
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,670
I'm crazy. I'm mad. That stinks.

336
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,130
What did she eat?

337
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,968
-Dong-goo.
-What? Why?

338
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,261
Why are you so surprised?

339
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,640
It's nothing. Are you leaving?

340
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,393
I should. I have a conscience.

341
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,187
-Did you find a place?
-Yes.

342
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,147
I called a friend
who told me to come over.

343
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,651
Dong-goo. I really won't
inconvenience you anymore.

344
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,611
Goodbye.

345
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,280
Bye. Take care.

346
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,948
Bye.

347
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,874
What's wrong with her today?

348
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,335
Does she have a hole in her gut?

349
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,338
That stinks. What did she eat?

350
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,215
My goodness.

351
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,634
Okay.

352
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,596
Thanks for the recommendation.

353
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,519
Do I have to do this?

354
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,064
This is insane.

355
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,695
This is insane.

356
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,657
Why is Mal-geum the lead of my movie?

357
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,701
How will I face her now?

358
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,916
Did Soo-ah really leave?

359
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,876
I wish she'd call.

360
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,961
Hey.

361
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,421
You're that worried about Soo-ah

362
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,632
and you don't see me writhing in agony?

363
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,633
Not at all.

364
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,802
Do you have the money yet?

365
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,388
I said I'll get it!

366
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,889
You expect me to believe that?

367
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,143
I'd believe a passing puppy
more than whatever you say.

368
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,186
What? A what? A puppy?

369
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,023
Do you even know what I decided
to do to get the money?

370
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,442
-What did you decide to do?
-You don't need to know!

371
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,822
What if I get the money?
What'll you do then?

372
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,616
If you somehow get the money...

373
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,535
Sure, I'll treat you with respect

374
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,579
and call you "Dad."

375
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,789
I'll take that bet and up it.

376
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,249
Crawl between my legs.

377
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,876
A race.

378
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,086
Back out if you're scared.

379
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,296
I'm not scared.

380
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,632
Just bring the money
and I'll do anything you say.

381
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,261
Kang Dong-goo,
you'd better keep your word.

382
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,432
I will get the money somehow.

383
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,642
I promise.

384
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,521
-Mournfully. To your sister-in-law.
-Mournfully?

385
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:54,401
JUDGES

386
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,070
Are you here for the audition, too?

387
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,658
Yes. The director told me to come.

388
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,077
We're looking for her partner.

389
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,413
Of course she should be here.

390
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,332
Let's begin.

391
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,591
Hello. The terminator of the erotic world.

392
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:21,803
I'm Deok-chul, Wang Deok-chul.

393
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,350
You have a nice body.
What do you think, Mr. Bong?

394
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,936
Won't he and Cherry make a nice couple?

395
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,854
What? Hang on.

396
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,148
The guy we cast today

397
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,651
will shoot bed scenes with Mal-geum.

398
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,653
With my first love?

399
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,904
What do you think?

400
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,990
Pardon? Oh, well...

401
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,121
I like everything else,
but you're bowlegged.

402
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,917
A bowlegged man can't portray
my intended message.

403
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,837
No? What is your intended message?

404
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,881
A straightforward mindset?

405
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,884
Our movie has that sort of message?

406
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,885
Yes.

407
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,975
I like everything else,
but your double eyelids stand out

408
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,393
and don't conform to my standards.

409
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,645
Next.

410
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,272
How about some milk?

411
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,648
I like everything else,

412
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,651
but your collarbone stands out.
You don't suit my character.

413
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,700
Mr. Bong, you're really picky.

414
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,787
I haven't found someone
that I think is just right.

415
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,542
Hello.

416
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,836
I am the rising star
of the adult film industry.

417
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,089
Lee Joon-ki.

418
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,133
Joon-ki.

419
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,677
Doo-sik.

420
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,110
So... the script you were writing
was for an adult film?

421
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,197
You're the one who wrote
those beastly lines?

422
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,202
You said you were writing a drama
about a family's love.

423
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,997
-It is kind of true.
-How is that...?

424
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,458
Goodbye, Sister-in-law?

425
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,376
I guess you're right.

426
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,462
Why are you here?

427
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,301
I need to earn money.
Dong-goo's giving me such a hard time.

428
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,887
I need to earn the cash

429
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,556
and throw it in his face.

430
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,060
Let's not tell anyone we met here.

431
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,853
Just what I want.

432
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,773
Let's take this secret to our graves.

433
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,944
Well done, sitting through the audition.

434
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,989
Let's share our opinions. I think...

435
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,743
Lee Joon-ki's ideal. What do you think?

436
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,536
What? Joon-ki?

437
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,705
I liked him the most, too.

438
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,123
His acting was the best.

439
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,376
His eyes have this look of decadence.

440
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,587
He's born to be an adult film star!

441
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,256
-Mr. Bong?
-What?

442
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,468
If you have no objections,
let's go with him.

443
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,803
The shoot's not far off.

444
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,971
Okay? Okay.

445
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,808
-Perfect.
-But...

446
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,187
What? Joon-ki's the male lead?

447
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,689
Then he and Mal-geum
will shoot a bed scene?

448
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,441
No. Never.

449
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,735
This can't happen. It can't.

450
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,654
Joon-ki.

451
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,075
What are you doing?

452
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,118
Can't you tell?

453
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,203
I'm beefing up.

454
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:37,707
-The director told me to.
-Oh. You got the call already?

455
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,710
Are you really going to do it?

456
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,711
You bet!

457
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,381
I'll shoot the film, get paid

458
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,592
and watch Dong-goo crawl between my legs.

459
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,512
What if later on

460
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,347
your parents watch the movie?

461
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,683
My parents? That's fine.

462
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,228
They both love erotic films.
They're very open-minded!

463
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,106
What if, later on,

464
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,732
your wife-to-be watches it?

465
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,236
My wife? That's fine.
I'll date someone who likes erotica.

466
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,155
What if, later on,

467
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,739
your kids watch it?

468
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,201
My kids? That's fine.
I'll watch it with them.

469
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,079
Sex education for young kids is important.

470
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,790
What's so bad about adult films?

471
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,043
This is a kind of art, too. It's art.

472
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,713
It is, yes, but still...

473
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,549
Wait and see. Since I'm doing it,

474
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,259
I'll put my soul into it

475
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,886
and create a bed scene

476
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,013
that goes down in history.

477
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,186
You can't. You really can't.

478
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,938
Don't! Stop!

479
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,191
Stop beefing up! Stop it!

480
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,984
Stop it. Don't do it.

481
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,278
Will you just stop?

482
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,412
I ate so many eggs
my breath smells of rotten eggs.

483
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,584
How long do I have to stay here?

484
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,340
DONG-GOO

485
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,556
Miss. How many days has it been?

486
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,892
-Did you pay extra?
-Pardon?

487
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,852
No, not yet.

488
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,771
I was going to when I leave.

489
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,814
Then pay for what you bought so far.

490
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,235
Do you think I'll run off without paying

491
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,363
the lousy sauna fee? I'll pay right now.

492
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,704
Where'd my wallet go?

493
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,707
My wallet was really right here. It was.

494
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,752
Of course it was. Things happen.

495
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,879
Let me make a quick call.

496
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,633
Hello? Is this the police?

497
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,343
Ma'am!

498
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:01,142
Why won't Soo-ah answer her phone?
It's been days.

499
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,311
Do you think she's okay?

500
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,855
You worry way too much.

501
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,148
Tell me the truth.

502
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,567
Are you over her yet?

503
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,027
You still like her, don't you?

504
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,658
Hey. It's not like that. No.
Why would you say that here?

505
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,118
Where else would I say it?

506
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,245
On the terrace?
Or on the roof to the moon?

507
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,289
Forget about it. Jeez.

508
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,249
It's not like that, okay?

509
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,792
Jeez...

510
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,963
Dinnertime already?
I should start cooking.

511
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,886
It's not like that.

512
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,263
Stop getting weird ideas.

513
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,681
Don't take it out on me.

514
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,016
I'm not.

515
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,726
Stop talking nonsense.

516
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,359
Yoon-ah, do you want my help?

517
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,278
No, it's fine.

518
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,238
Yoon-ah, so...

519
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,741
You don't misunderstand, do you?

520
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,075
About what?

521
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,036
About Soo-ah.

522
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,871
We help the unfortunate

523
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,373
and even strangers in Africa.

524
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,460
I can help an ex-girlfriend
if she's in need.

525
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,711
You can.

526
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,672
What I'm saying is,

527
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,966
I don't have any feelings for her

528
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,551
or want her back.

529
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,137
It's not at all like that.

530
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,806
Just in case you misunderstood.

531
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,516
Why would I misunderstand?

532
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,435
Take good care of her.

533
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,482
Okay. I will.

534
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,859
I'm off to get groceries.
Do you want anything?

535
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,152
I don't want anything.

536
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,613
Then just say "no."
Why are you getting annoyed?

537
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,281
I'll see you later.

538
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:47,582
My gosh. She must really not care.

539
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,211
Do you think I care about you?

540
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,088
I was just afraid she'd misunderstand.

541
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm not worried about you either.

542
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,511
Hello?

543
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,556
What? The police station?

544
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,610
Dong-goo.

545
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,325
Sorry. The officer kept saying
he'd call my parents.

546
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,035
I had no choice.

547
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,923
Get up. Let's go.

548
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,220
Let go. I really don't want to go in.

549
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,473
You have nowhere else to go.

550
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,766
Come with me.

551
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,103
This is wrong. It's just wrong.

552
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,355
Why is it wrong?

553
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,109
After what I did to you,
how can I inconvenience you?

554
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,528
You can, it's okay.

555
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,072
You should do better if you dumped me,
but look at you.

556
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,457
Stop making me worry and come inside.

557
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,628
Look. Your hands are freezing.

558
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,673
Come with me.

559
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,113
Why did this happen?

560
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,629
Lee Joon-ki.

561
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,757
You brought this upon yourself.

562
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,386
Why did you show up?

563
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,348
I hope you don't blame me.

564
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,024
Good.

565
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,073
Tasty.

566
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,500
What's this? What happened?

567
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,503
What's wrong with my face?

568
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,923
What is it? Is something wrong?

569
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,342
Oh no. My stomach hurts.

570
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,428
Doo-sik.

571
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,934
Gosh, there are hives all over your face.
What should we do?

572
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,812
The read-through is today

573
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,564
and we shoot in a few days.

574
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:40,899
What now?

575
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,318
You can't shoot in this condition.

576
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,654
Your hives don't go away for ages
and you get serious diarrhea.

577
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,116
You should give up the role, right?

578
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,328
Doo-sik, talk to the director for me.

579
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,705
-Can we postpone the shoot?
-Are you crazy?

580
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,166
Do you know what
the director hates the most?

581
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,542
It's postponing a shoot.

582
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,295
What should I do, then?

583
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,006
What else can you do but give up?

584
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,133
I'll talk to the director

585
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,053
so he doesn't sue you,
so just let it go.

586
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,347
Okay. Thanks, Doo-sik.

587
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,515
There's no need to thank me.

588
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,059
Where's the hair dryer?

589
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,562
What happened to your face?

590
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,733
There were hives all over me
when I woke up.

591
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,486
Did you eat something bad?
Did you eat walnuts?

592
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,531
No, I didn't go anywhere near them.

593
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,991
Then what is it?

594
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,661
Hang on.

595
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,331
Did you eat a walnut because
you don't think you can get the cash?

596
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,624
What?

597
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,460
How can you say
that to someone who's sick?

598
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,462
You were so sure you'd get the money.

599
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,381
You're always like that.

600
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,008
You loser.

601
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:49,926
Goodness.

602
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,595
You have no manners! How dare you?

603
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,390
Doo-sik. This won't do.

604
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,769
I think I have to just... shoot the film.

605
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,647
What? What do you mean?

606
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,901
I can't put up with the humiliation
any longer.

607
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,278
Kang Dong-goo.

608
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,531
I will crush you.

609
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,074
Joon-ki.

610
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,826
Joon-ki.

611
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,882
Why don't you just give up?

612
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,469
No. I won't give up!

613
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,097
Didn't you hear what Dong-goo said?

614
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,641
You're in no condition to film.

615
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,978
No. Even if I die on the set,

616
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,312
I can't give up.

617
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,023
No, I won't!

618
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,233
Darn it.

619
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,818
Just don't do it!

620
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,362
Why are you yelling?

621
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,614
Is there a reason I can't be in your film?

622
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,658
The thing is...

623
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,828
It's my first love!

624
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,761
Do you love me?

625
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,807
-Since when was I your first love?
-What are you talking about?

626
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,603
I'm talking about Mal-geum.
She's my first love.

627
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,520
I know.

628
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,856
How'd you know my parents
called me "Mal-geum"?

629
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,982
I mean Cherry!

630
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,193
Cherry's Mal-geum, my first love!

631
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,236
What? Mal-geum...

632
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,448
The Mal-geum in your yearbook...

633
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,117
-Mal-geum's Cherry?
-Yes.

634
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,245
Joon-ki, please, don't do it.

635
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,663
Please.

636
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,540
I see.

637
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,794
You should've said so, Doo-sik.

638
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,504
But I'm going to do the film.

639
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,215
-Why?
-I'll shoot the film

640
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,467
and watch Dong-goo crawl between my legs.

641
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,385
Or I'll die of fury.

642
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,428
Joon-ki.

643
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,891
Okay. Do you just want to get back
at Dong-goo?

644
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,644
-Right.
-Then how about this?

645
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,356
What?

646
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,526
Joon-ki enlisted? At his age?

647
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,321
Yes. The military police
dragged him off this morning.

648
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,866
He'd delayed his enlistment
with all sorts of trickery.

649
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,410
-What now?
-We have no choice.

650
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,662
With no actor, we must postpone.

651
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,249
This is just crazy.

652
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,168
The rest of your pay that you asked for--

653
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,421
-I wired it. Check your account.
-Okay, thanks.

654
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:39,637
My gosh, we kissed in public
and she's not even bothered?

655
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,057
Fine. I won't be bothered
about you either.

656
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,981
Hey, Kang Dong-goo.

657
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,441
What's that pointlessly arrogant pose for?

658
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,161
What are you doing?

659
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,290
Pay the landlady with that

660
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,625
and spend the rest on snacks.

661
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,047
It's real money. Where did you get this?

662
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,465
You don't need to know.

663
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,926
Wait.

664
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,678
You should call me "Father."

665
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,639
Do I really have to do that?

666
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,517
You won't go back on your word, will you?

667
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,019
You're Kang Dong-goo.

668
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,687
That's just low.

669
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,356
Oh, come on.

670
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,234
-Give that back.
-Father.

671
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,320
Yes, my son.

672
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,741
You made one more promise.

673
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,246
I have to do that now?

674
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,707
You won't go back on your word, will you?

675
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,794
You're Kang Dong-goo. That's just low.

676
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,174
I'll do it!

677
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,676
If that's what you want, I'll just do it.

678
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,220
Yes, my son!

679
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,388
I've waited for this.

680
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,767
Come to Daddy.

681
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,437
You worked hard to bring home
the money, Father.

682
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,774
Yes, I did, son. Come to Daddy.

683
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,944
-Come on then.
-Well done, Dad.

684
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,030
Why is it so hard

685
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,699
for a dad to raise a son?

686
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,284
Why is that?

687
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,036
You ungrateful boy.

688
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,833
As of today, I'm your father.

689
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,925
Wow, the cheonggukjang's amazing.

690
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,468
It's delicious, Yoon-ah.

691
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,512
Is it? Eat all you want.

692
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,513
Okay.

693
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,683
Dong-goo, is your appetite back
now the red stickers are gone?

694
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,311
Yes. I can finally sleep
now that we repaid the landlady.

695
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,774
Kids. Do you know who you owe this to?

696
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,943
Stop showing off, Joon-ki.

697
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,196
"Joon-ki"?

698
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,284
Stop showing off, Father.

699
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,035
That's it, son.

700
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,745
I'll watch what I say.

701
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,956
Why are you his son?

702
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,833
There's this thing. Don't ask.

703
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,293
-Good morning.
-You're up?

704
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,005
What's that? Did you catch a cold?

705
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,047
Oh, this?

706
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,175
It prevents saggy cheeks.
It's a must-have for models.

707
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,427
Model, my foot.

708
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,595
You've never modeled before.

709
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,806
-Don't.
-I thought it was dislocated.

710
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:33,144
Seo-jin, how come you say
the cutest things?

711
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,647
Oh, dear. Does your beard still grow?

712
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,152
Moisturize after you shave
or your skin will hate you.

713
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,737
And beware of folliculitis.

714
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,573
Cheonggukjang stinks.

715
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,701
Don't you like it?

716
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,244
It's not that.

717
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,330
A light Eggs Benedict
is better for breakfast.

718
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,125
What?

719
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,547
Never mind. I'll skip breakfast
and lose weight instead.

720
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,424
Enjoy your meal.

721
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,303
She's so naive. She's almost childlike.

722
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,348
I can't tell if she was conned
or on a camping trip.

723
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,058
It just doesn't show.

724
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,185
I just don't like her.

725
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,978
Dong-goo, when will you kick her out?

726
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,438
Wake up.

727
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,649
She's not living off us.
She's a long-term tenant.

728
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,236
One-hundred-percent deferred payment
with an indefinite time limit.

729
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,280
Your smart brother signed
a contract with her yesterday.

730
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,783
What? Have you lost your mind?

731
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,702
Did you have to broadcast that?
She said she'd pay me.

732
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,289
You loser.
How long will you be her prey?

733
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,208
Prey? Stop it.

734
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,586
She's immature, but she's a sweet girl.

735
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,505
Immature, my foot.

736
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,841
What's going on, sonny?
Why do you keep defending her?

737
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,136
I won't have her as a daughter-in-law,
so wake up.

738
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,391
What "daughter-in-law"?
It's nothing like that.

739
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,477
Yoon-ah, like I said, it's not like that.

740
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,062
I don't have any feelings for her.

741
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,150
-What?
-What's this, sonny?

742
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,569
Why are you explaining that to Yoon-ah?

743
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,364
Do you have feelings for her?

744
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,448
Are you a two-timer?

745
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,950
Two women? No way!

746
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,410
I'm not interested at all.

747
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,539
What kind of nonsense is that?

748
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,998
-Jeez.
-Not at the table.

749
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,708
-What? You...
-I should just...

750
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,709
Why that...

751
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,461
Son. Son!

752
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,465
He can't storm off when I'm here.
He has no manners.

753
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,717
This is crazy.

754
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,845
Why does she keep getting to me? Why?

755
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,597
Am I going crazy?

756
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,558
I'm really mad.

757
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:46,485
Son, didn't I say you'll become a pig
if you read lying down?

758
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,320
Stop it.

759
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,742
Stop it, Dad.
If you keep this up, I'll leave home.

760
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:58,205
-How long must we do this?
-I don't know. Until my fury's gone?

761
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,541
That'll be in the distant future.

762
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,919
How dare you look
at your father like that?

763
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,463
You have no manners.

764
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,094
You haven't forgotten our date, have you?

765
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,179
See you later.

766
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,973
What's that? Who texted you
that you can't stop grinning?

767
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,476
Mal-geum.

768
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,019
Mal-geum?

769
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,647
Oh, Cherry?

770
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,317
What's this?

771
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,194
Who's Mal-geum and who's Cherry?

772
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,406
She's my friend from elementary school.

773
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,783
She lived in the U.S.,
so her English name's Cherry.

774
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,036
-Her Korean name's Mal-geum.
-Mal-geum.

775
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,664
-It's a girl?
-Are you getting along?

776
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,957
Texting each other?

777
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,960
-Nothing's happening. We're just friends.
-Come on.

778
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,881
Friends become lovers, then wives,
then enemies, and you get divorced.

779
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,300
That's the nature of things. Good luck.

780
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,137
The truth is, she's been on my mind a bit,

781
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,640
but I don't know if I like her

782
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,808
or if it's just because we're old friends.

783
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,352
Why can't you tell?

784
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,647
When you like someone,
your heart beats like crazy,

785
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,774
your hands and feet get tingly,

786
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,944
and you feel dazed as if
someone hit your head with a hammer.

787
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,197
I like being with Mal-geum,

788
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,242
but it's like... I'm not certain.

789
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,828
Certainty...

790
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,834
I do know of a trick
that'll help you know for sure.

791
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:26,752
Want to know what it is?

792
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,921
A trick? What is it?

793
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,466
You know NASA, the U.S. space people?

794
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,635
A guy called Richard Freedman
developed this.

795
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,347
It took five years to calculate this
with a super computer.

796
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,765
Really? What is it?

797
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,559
-You want to know?
-Yes.

798
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,233
BONG DOO-SIK, YOON MAL-GEUM

799
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,114
We're almost there.

800
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,619
Got it. The likelihood of your liking her

801
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,037
is 80 percent.

802
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,247
That's right.

803
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,915
You definitely like her.

804
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,460
Are you kidding me?
You can't tell if I like her with this.

805
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,338
This is reasonably accurate.

806
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,424
What now?

807
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,135
Shall I figure out if you two
will fall in love?

808
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,220
-Yes.
-Watch carefully.

809
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,556
Take a mechanical pencil.

810
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,726
First, you press the back of the pencil

811
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,227
and draw a heart.

812
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,646
Then you press like crazy.

813
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,815
Get as much of the lead out as you can.

814
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,067
Then you color in the heart.

815
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,153
Keep coloring it in.

816
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,406
If you use up the lead before it snaps,

817
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,949
your love is meant to be.

818
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,117
Shut up!

819
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,746
I'm the idiot for asking you for advice.

820
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,331
-Stupid me.
-Hey.

821
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,375
Hey, hey. This is really accurate.

822
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,794
Hey, it's true. Try coloring it in.

823
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:55,674
I'm the idiot for expecting something.
Did his brain ever mature at all?

824
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:01,347
"WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN"

825
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,772
KANG DONG-GOO, HAN YOON-AH

826
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,523
What?

827
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,734
Seventy-six percent?

828
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,529
I like Yoon-ah 76 percent?

829
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,656
Is this possible?

830
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,617
No, it can't be.

831
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,329
PARK MYUNG-JA'S PORK SOUP

832
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,039
Park Myung-ja.

833
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,718
KANG DONG-GOO, PARK MYUNG-JA

834
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,595
91 percent?

835
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,265
I love Park Myung-ja--
a woman I've never met-- by 91 percent?

836
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,642
Does this make sense?

837
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,269
Yes, her pork soup is to die for.

838
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,815
But that doesn't mean I like her, does it?

839
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,151
Oh, come on.

840
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,987
There's no way this is accurate.

841
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,739
I got scared about nothing.

842
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,376
I said we're cleaning...

843
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,338
What were you doing?

844
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,675
Oh, so I was...

845
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,051
Hang on.

846
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,513
No way.

847
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,390
Are you washing your face with milk?

848
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,600
No, I wasn't going to wash my face.

849
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,727
Then why is there milk in the basin?

850
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,688
Well...

851
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,899
It's to drink. I like milk a lot.

852
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,527
Oh, do you? Then drink it.

853
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,947
What? Now?

854
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,659
You said that's what it's for.
Go on. Drink it.

855
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,121
I was going to anyway.

856
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,003
Don't you dare leave a single drop,

857
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,297
or I'll throw you right out.

858
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,220
I'm sorry, okay?
I was going to wash my face with it, okay?

859
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,473
What? How dare you shout back?

860
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,476
-I did not shout.
-What's this fuss about?

861
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,393
What's going on?

862
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,978
Look at this.

863
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,606
She was going to wash her face
with the milk we bought

864
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,483
for our guests' breakfast.

865
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,318
What? Why?

866
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,446
To maintain my smooth skin.
This is what models do.

867
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,283
Dong-goo, add the milk to the rent I owe.

868
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,243
Will that do?

869
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,205
What is wrong with her?

870
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,166
The penniless brat's
washing her face with milk?

871
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,251
Doesn't she feel sorry for the dairy cows?

872
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,796
"That's what models do," she said.

873
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,256
Let's drop it and leave.

874
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,343
-What?
-He's such a loser.

875
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,886
It's driving me insane.

876
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,597
He definitely still has feelings for her.

877
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,557
What if those two get back together?

878
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,645
Dong-goo had a tough time
after the breakup.

879
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,522
It would be nice if they reconciled.

880
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,440
Darn it.

881
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,026
She has no common sense.

882
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,445
We have no guests
and she used up all the milk.

883
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,655
Will you stop it?

884
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,739
How can I stop it?

885
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,824
I'm eating dry cereal
because there's no milk.

886
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,784
Then don't eat.

887
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,329
See? How upset must Doo-sik be

888
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,455
if even he's sighing?

889
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,582
It's not that.

890
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,334
Doo-sik met his first love again

891
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,836
and he isn't sure if he likes her or not.

892
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,838
What? Why wouldn't you be sure?

893
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,716
I don't know. I'm just a bit confused.

894
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,051
Are you?

895
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,220
When I like someone, I can tell it's him

896
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,513
just from his footsteps.

897
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,890
You can distinguish his footsteps?

898
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,642
You must be kidding me.

899
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,685
Listen.

900
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,186
When you like someone,

901
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,938
you notice everything about them.

902
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,650
In the end, you end up being able
to distinguish their footsteps.

903
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,069
Then did you

904
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,905
recognize Wangshimni
"Booger Boy's" footsteps?

905
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,199
What about the sound of him
picking his nose?

906
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,785
Hey. I told you not to mention him.

907
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,370
Don't hit me, it hurts.

908
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,538
It's supposed to.

909
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,415
Then smack me lightly.

910
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,834
You're so strong you give me
such a hard time.

911
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,795
See, I'm right.

912
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,172
It's a proven theory.

913
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:08,135
How is that possible?
What I said is right.

914
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:12,097
How can you tell if you like someone
by their footsteps?

915
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,642
-Does that make sense?
-Does your name theory make sense?

916
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,893
You bet it does.

917
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,731
My name theory was
developed by NASA's Richard Freedman

918
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,399
who used a super computer to...

919
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,782
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

920
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,576
My heart...

921
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,370
-My heart...
-What about your heart?

922
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,706
It's beating too fast.

923
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,499
What? Why?

924
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,295
I don't know. As soon as I saw
the woman who just passed by,

925
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,340
my heart started to pound,
it got hard to breathe,

926
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,176
and I felt a zing go through my hand.

927
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,222
They were definitely
the early signs of love.

928
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:58,018
-Love? Does that make sense?
-Why doesn't it?

929
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,812
Fine. We just have to check.

930
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,105
How?

931
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,192
I'll get her name and calculate our odds.

932
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,363
Yes. It's finally time to prove
Richard Freedman's theory.

933
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,989
Is that her?

934
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,950
There she is.

935
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,955
What's he doing? Is he mad?

936
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,291
Where are you going? Joon-ki!

937
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,672
Ouch.

938
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,424
Hey, excuse me! Wait, I love you!

939
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,385
Hey, wait, excuse me!

940
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,221
Darn it, she went up.

941
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,430
This is crazy.

942
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,808
What's wrong with you? Get a grip.

943
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,689
Seo-jin, that woman could be my destiny.

944
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,816
She isn't your fate
if you passed her on the street.

945
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,234
That's why we must check.

946
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,529
I just need her name, that's it.

947
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,324
What's wrong with him?

948
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,541
What's this?

949
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,960
Why is the TV on?

950
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,173
-My goodness!
-Be quiet.

951
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,217
Seo-jin will freak if she sees.

952
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,969
She went out with Joon-ki.

953
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,262
Did she?

954
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,806
I was hiding for nothing.

955
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,269
You startled me.

956
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,065
I wanted to watch TV
and needed a facial, too.

957
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,316
So I hid from Seo-jin.

958
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,985
Oh, did you?

959
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,446
Good for you. Well done.

960
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,407
That must be Seo-jin.

961
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,492
It's not her.

962
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,494
It's Yoon-ah.

963
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,247
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

964
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,165
You're right.

965
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,542
How'd you know it's her
just from her footsteps?

966
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,003
What? I don't know.

967
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,671
When I like someone,

968
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,007
I can tell it's him
just from his footsteps.

969
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,390
Wait. How do I know Yoon-ah's footsteps?

970
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,101
Does that mean I like her?

971
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,064
Why are you staring at me like that?

972
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,026
-It's not nice.
-It's nothing.

973
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,238
No way. Do I like her?

974
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,907
Does that make sense? Impossible.

975
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,827
Yes. It's only because I have
great hearing.

976
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:25,457
Yes, that has to be it.
Someone else is back.

977
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,002
Yes. These footsteps belong to...

978
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,296
-the delivery guy?
-Your parcel's here.

979
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,590
Okay, I was right. The delivery guy!

980
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,550
-Delivery guy!
-You have mail.

981
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,928
Thank you, thank you so much.

982
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,514
-What's wrong?
-I just have great hearing.

983
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,808
I have great hearing!

984
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:48,772
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Delivery Guy!

985
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,611
Here.

986
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,702
Wow, you can drink.

987
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:07,415
No, I usually can't drink much.
But I feel like drinking today.

988
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,087
The truth is, it's my birthday today.

989
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,880
What? It's your birthday?

990
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,299
Why didn't you tell me?

991
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,301
I'd have bought a gift if I'd known.

992
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,302
It's fine.

993
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,180
Drinking with me is a gift, so it's okay.

994
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,725
Shouldn't you be celebrating
with your friends?

995
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,061
Or dining with your parents?

996
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,315
Actually, since I got into this field,

997
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,902
things got awkward with my parents.
I haven't seen them in a while.

998
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,697
Nor my friends.

999
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,204
Let's quit the gloomy talk and drink.

1000
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,747
Okay.

1001
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,967
Mal-geum, I'm going to go to the restroom.

1002
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,927
Sure.

1003
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,935
Why are you eating ramyun?

1004
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,812
I was feeling hungry.

1005
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:14,649
You take such good care of your skin.
Should you be eating ramyun?

1006
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,236
That was good.

1007
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,698
I'll go to the supermarket.

1008
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,992
Yoon-ah, do you have a lot to buy?

1009
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,286
-I'll come with you.
-Okay.

1010
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,872
Soo-ah, do you want to join us?

1011
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,291
No. The cold air will dry my skin.

1012
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,418
I'm a model.

1013
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,170
See you later, then.

1014
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,714
I'll clean up. You go ahead.

1015
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,924
See you.

1016
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,679
What happened?

1017
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,015
-Oh no...
-Are you okay?

1018
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,600
Yes, I'm fine.

1019
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,519
You're not okay.

1020
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,521
You're bleeding.

1021
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,607
Yoon-ah, where's the first-aid kit?

1022
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,817
In the living room. I'll get it.

1023
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,611
No, I'll get it.

1024
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,738
You get the groceries.

1025
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,074
Sorry I can't come with you.

1026
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,868
It's fine. Get Soo-ah patched up.

1027
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,204
I will. See you.

1028
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:13,458
Soo-ah, I'll get the first-aid kit.
Wait here.

1029
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,506
I just need her name.

1030
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,050
Darn you.

1031
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,178
No, this isn't it.

1032
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,224
Where is she?

1033
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,642
Let's stop looking.

1034
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,395
We can't find her in this huge building.

1035
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,607
Why? Are you afraid
that Richard Freedman's right?

1036
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,443
Who is this darn Richard Freedman?

1037
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,736
Be prepared.

1038
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,780
I will show you just how scientific

1039
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,533
the character-counting system is.

1040
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,918
"Specialist Kim Hyo-jung."

1041
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,546
Seo-jin, this is her, isn't it?

1042
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,756
-How would I know?
-It's definitely her.

1043
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,925
As soon as I saw this photo,

1044
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,720
my heart started to beat faster.

1045
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,517
LEE JOON-KI, KIM HYO-JUNG

1046
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,607
Ninety-nine? Ninety-nine.
Ninety-nine percent.

1047
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,027
Look at this. Do you still not see it?

1048
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,280
Me and Hyo-jung are meant to be.

1049
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,991
How can you tell
if you're meant to be just by this?

1050
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,453
Kang Seo-jin. Just admit it.

1051
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,538
You look really shabby.

1052
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,418
This just proved
Richard Freedman's theory.

1053
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,920
I must go and see Hyo-jung.

1054
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,172
Are you serious?

1055
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,716
Hyo-jung.

1056
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,343
Hyo-jung. Hyo-jung.

1057
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,180
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

1058
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,349
But why am I so curious?

1059
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,519
Come in.

1060
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,479
Hyo-jung.

1061
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,484
-Take a seat.
-Okay.

1062
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,949
What brought you here?

1063
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,913
Well... it's my heart. It beats too hard.

1064
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,206
Since when?

1065
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,752
After I saw a beautiful lady
it suddenly started to pound.

1066
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:24,172
After I saw our character count
amounted to 99 percent,

1067
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,299
my heart beat as if it would explode.

1068
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,467
Any other symptoms?

1069
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,261
I felt lightheaded,

1070
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,764
my hands and feet felt tingly

1071
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,975
and I felt out of breath,
as if I'd been electrocuted.

1072
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,561
Really? I'll have a listen first.

1073
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,396
No, you don't need to...

1074
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,108
-Just a moment.
-Hyo-jung, I...

1075
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,114
-What's wrong?
-I wonder myself.

1076
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,491
-Your heartbeat's...
-You hear it?

1077
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,118
It sounds strange.

1078
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,331
Your symptoms bother me, too.
Let's run some tests.

1079
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,959
Nurse, prepare for some in-depth testing.

1080
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,544
-But...
-Let's go.

1081
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,087
What on earth...?

1082
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,382
What's all this?

1083
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,594
What is this?

1084
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,058
Excuse me. What is this?

1085
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:20,478
We're starting now, so don't move.

1086
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,521
Okay.

1087
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:26,192
What is this?
Why are they doing all this?

1088
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,363
I'm moving.

1089
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,248
What took you so long?

1090
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,041
Was the toilet that far away?

1091
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,418
Ta-da.

1092
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:44,752
A cake?

1093
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,005
A birthday requires a cake.

1094
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,090
Thanks, Doo-sik.

1095
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,135
Don't thank me.
A friend looks out for a friend.

1096
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,015
Excuse me.

1097
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,766
Aren't you an actress?

1098
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,771
What? Yes.

1099
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,858
See? I told you I was right.

1100
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:12,322
What were you in? A movie? A drama?

1101
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,448
Well...

1102
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,867
Sorry, but we were trying to talk.

1103
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,912
I remember!

1104
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:23,374
"Bikini Investigation," the adult film!
You were in that, weren't you?

1105
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,462
I knew I'd seen you somewhere

1106
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,547
and that's what I saw you in.

1107
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,218
You're all covered up nicely right now,

1108
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,470
but your figure is just--

1109
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,598
it's just amazing.

1110
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,975
I'm honored to meet you.
May I shake your hand?

1111
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,275
Don't you want to? Is she kidding?

1112
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,693
Excuse me. We're trying...

1113
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,279
Fine, forget it. Leave it.

1114
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,783
She thinks she's a star
when she was in an adult film.

1115
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,284
Yes, I'm an adult film star.

1116
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,036
Does that mean

1117
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,206
I have to shake hands
with rude jerks like you?

1118
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,168
She has a temper.

1119
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,046
That's why she can strip
in those movies--

1120
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,215
What? What did you just say?

1121
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,009
Mal-geum, don't. Let's leave. Let's go.

1122
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,845
See that? She's tough.

1123
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,224
You saw what she's like. You're a joke.

1124
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,984
How is it? Does it still hurt?

1125
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,569
No, it's fine.

1126
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,196
We have a newsflash on a fire.

1127
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,489
This afternoon...

1128
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,032
There was a fire.

1129
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,117
...some wounded and dead.

1130
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,286
Wait. Isn't that our neighborhood?

1131
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,663
It is.

1132
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,082
It looks serious.

1133
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,502
Didn't Yoon-ah say she'd get groceries?

1134
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:00,930
Joon-ki.

1135
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,641
Sit down.

1136
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,520
What did the doctor say about the results?

1137
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,773
Well...

1138
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,610
I have a heart condition.

1139
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:14,944
What?

1140
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,697
My heart beating fast,
feeling out of breath,

1141
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,618
and having tingly hands and feet
are all because my heart's weak.

1142
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,037
-Is it very bad?
-No.

1143
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:27,332
I caught it quick,
so I just need medication.

1144
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,501
That's a relief.

1145
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,046
I was scared thinking
you had something serious.

1146
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,716
If you felt scared,
how do you think I felt?

1147
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,635
I was so scared in there

1148
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,762
that I almost wet myself.

1149
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:44,766
What? It wasn't love at first sight?
It wasn't fate?

1150
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:49,604
Stop, it's embarrassing.
Wasn't it still fate?

1151
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,190
If I hadn't met that doctor,

1152
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,942
I could've died somewhere
at some random time.

1153
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,861
What's more fateful than that?

1154
01:00:56,944 --> 01:01:00,156
Sure. It was a match made in heaven.

1155
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,076
That can't be.

1156
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,663
The character counting system
said 99 percent. You saw it, too.

1157
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,540
Will you stop talking about it?
Does it make sense?

1158
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,167
What about you, then?

1159
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,586
You said you recognize footsteps
if you like someone.

1160
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,881
That's just... a figure of speech.

1161
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:21,719
Forget whatever you want to use,
everything works if you like someone.

1162
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,055
The people still caught inside...

1163
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,391
Gosh, people were hurt?

1164
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,936
HUAM-DONG SUPERMARKET FIRE

1165
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,315
A person who's on your mind all day.

1166
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:36,859
Dong-goo.

1167
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,736
Where are you going?

1168
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:51,833
You get worried when they're out of sight.

1169
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,223
Seeing that person suffering

1170
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,392
makes you feel worse.

1171
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,243
-Stop.
-You scumbag!

1172
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,121
Let go. How dare you say such a thing?

1173
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,664
Let go! Let go of me!

1174
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,458
Even if you get hurt,

1175
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,711
you can do anything for that person.

1176
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:42,175
Yoon-ah. Yoon-ah. Yoon-ah.

1177
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,344
-Stay here, it's dangerous.
-Out of my way, I know someone inside.

1178
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,304
I said it's dangerous.

1179
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,055
I don't care! Move!

1180
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,224
Yoon-ah. Yoon-ah!

1181
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,476
Yoon-ah!

1182
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,436
Dong-goo.

1183
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,832
Why are you here? Is something wrong?

1184
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:21,839
When the fact that

1185
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,760
that person exists in this world

1186
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,014
is such a relief
and such a gratifying feeling...

1187
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,309
isn't that love?

1188
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,889
I like her?

1189
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:12,849
You're crazy.

1190
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,892
Are you angry with me?

1191
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:18,187
Don't be angry, Dong-goo. I'm sorry.

1192
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,483
I thought my heart was going to stop.

1193
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,818
I can see how you feel.

1194
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,987
-I set you up on a blind date.
-What?

1195
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,656
Moire Moussi's
2017 F/W vintage collection.

1196
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,658
-You look like a warm beggar.
-A beggar?

1197
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,910
They can't stop staring at me.

1198
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,245
You do have money, don't you?

1199
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,580
What are you doing?

1200
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,914
What? A blind date?

1201
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,833
Isn't that Seo-jin?

1202
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,335
We'll kick off Cherry's fanmeet.

1203
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,838
Cherry, Cherry...!

1204
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:44,839
Wasn't it embarrassing?

1205
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,591
I won't shoot like this.

1206
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:47,717
Don't call Mal-geum.

1207
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,385
Then pay the penalty.

1208
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,471
-I think I'm in trouble.
-This is the only place

1209
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,556
to make that much so quickly.

1210
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:58,269
-Did we win?
-We hit the jackpot!
