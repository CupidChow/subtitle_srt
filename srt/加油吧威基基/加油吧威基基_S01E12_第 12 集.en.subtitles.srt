1
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,131
I see you as a man now.
What should I do?

2
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,469
-I am a man, not a woman.
-That's not what I mean.

3
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,057
I think I like you.

4
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,643
-What?
-I like you.

5
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,902
What's wrong with you? Come here.

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,988
Are you sick? You seem fine.

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,657
Are you filming this?

8
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,367
Are the others in on this?

9
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,497
-Dating a producer got your acting--
-I actually like you.

10
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,337
Wait. You're serious?

11
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,424
You like me?

12
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,468
You, me?

13
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,762
I'll ask you again.

14
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,389
To you, am I...

15
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,308
not a woman?

16
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,354
What's gotten into you?
How are you a woman? You're a friend.

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,608
I've known you for so long.
We even share razors.

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,361
Stop it. Don't say things like that.

19
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,866
Okay.

20
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,579
I get what you mean, so get out.

21
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,583
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,752
-I said get out.
-What?

23
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,921
-Get out!
-Hey, Seo-jin.

24
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,173
-Seo-jin.
-I said get out.

25
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,552
Seo-jin, open the door.

26
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,846
Let's talk this out. Kang Seo-jin.

27
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,222
-What's going on?
-Yikes.

28
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,475
Why are you banging on my sister's door?

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,395
I told you to stay away from her.

30
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,064
-I was just...
-Come with me.

31
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,400
-It's not like that, Dong-goo.
-Come along.

32
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,573
Yes. I have nothing to lose.

33
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,993
He always causes stupid problems

34
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,037
and only gets really minor roles.

35
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,638
I'M A WOMAN TOO

36
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,184
"Do I know Gon?
He's the best hoodwinker I know."

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,272
I just love Kim Hye-soo.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,233
I should live like her. She's cool.

39
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,612
I know. She's awesome.

40
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,032
-I'm back.
-Hi.

41
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,826
Why are you so late? I was waiting.

42
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,745
What? For me? Why?

43
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,163
You have something to say?

44
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,708
You told me to find something to do
that would make me happy.

45
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,544
I've thought about it,
and you know I'm pretty

46
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,129
and can sing and dance, right?

47
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,505
I don't know.

48
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,382
-So what'll you do?
-An Idol.

49
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,009
What? Be an Idol singer?

50
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,053
Make your debut at 29?

51
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,263
You're old enough to have a kid

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,806
and you're thinking like one.

53
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,560
Is that too far-fetched?

54
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,520
What should I do, then?

55
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,107
Isn't there anything you thought about?
Like what you wanted to do as a kid?

56
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:59,072
There is one thing. I wanted to study
fashion design at the university.

57
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,574
But I'm too old to take the SAT.

58
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,785
Why? Don't you watch the news?

59
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,747
There are many people
in their 70s who did and got in.

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,501
-Could I do it, too?
-Of course. I'll help you study.

61
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,170
-You?
-"You?"

62
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,090
It was said that Doo-sik
had a brilliant mind.

63
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,342
He's a writer
who does everything well but write.

64
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,427
-Shut up.
-Yes, Mr. Writer.

65
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,222
But you must promise to study hard.

66
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,057
Okay, I will. Thanks, Doo-sik.

67
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,603
I'm home.

68
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,189
Hi, Seo-jin. Have you eaten?

69
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,191
I'm not hungry. I want to rest.

70
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,906
Is something wrong?
She's been down the past few days.

71
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,536
-Why are we at a bookstore?
-What?

72
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,539
If you want to study, you need books.

73
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:55,044
First, I need to know your level.
I'll give you a simple test.

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,131
Right. Let's start with history.

75
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,759
"King Youngjo's second son
and King Jeongjo's father.

76
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,554
He acted as regent
on King Youngjo's command,

77
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,598
but then King Youngjo killed him.
What is this prince's name?"

78
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,475
-I know the answer.
-Okay.

79
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,185
-I even watched the movie.
-Yes, yes.

80
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,313
-Give me a hint.
-Okay, a hint.

81
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,522
-A rice chest.
-A rice chest?

82
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,399
-Yes.
-I know the answer.

83
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,859
-Yoo Ah-in.
-Yoo Ah...

84
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,320
He's the actor.
We're talking about a prince.

85
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,156
Yes, Yoo Ah-in. He's princely, too.

86
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,157
What's the prince's name?

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,326
-Prince something-something.
-Yoo Ah-in.

88
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,994
He says something like this.

89
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,579
"This is incredulous."

90
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,209
No, that's from Veteran.

91
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,004
-The answer's Prince Sado.
-Prince Sado?

92
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,800
Is that why the movie was called Sado?

93
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:47,638
The king kept saying "Sado" in the movie
and I thought he wanted something.

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,603
It's okay. You can always learn.

95
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,354
Don't get too discouraged.

96
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,026
Thanks.
Your positivity's quite encouraging.

97
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,528
It helps to always think positively.

98
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,031
So don't worry. Stay strong.

99
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,365
Okay. Wish me luck.

100
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,834
I haven't been able to go home
or shower in days.

101
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,171
I barely remember

102
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,300
how long it's been since I saw Yoon-ah.

103
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,522
Jeez.

104
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,440
Dong-goo.

105
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,901
Did you find all the locations?

106
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,986
Yes. Here you go.

107
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,031
You found a lot of places.

108
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,118
Were you up all night again? Good job.

109
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,662
You have to stay up tonight, too. Sorry.

110
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,163
It can't be helped.

111
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,958
Go to a sauna and take a break.

112
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,876
For just an hour.

113
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,462
One hour?

114
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,174
Soo-ah, try reading this.
Can you do that?

115
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:11,347
Hey, of course I can.
What do you think of me?

116
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,808
-Here goes.
-Okay.

117
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,937
That's a name.

118
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,316
Right, Jane. I'll try again.

119
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,872
Right.

120
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,832
I read it wrong.

121
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,668
It's not "misty."

122
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,629
What?

123
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,216
I was talking about the TV drama Misty.

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,509
With Kim Nam-ju.

125
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,261
It's my fabric drama.

126
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,680
A "fabric" is a cloth.

127
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,474
You mean "favorite."

128
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,268
I see.

129
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,980
Sorry. I'm especially bad at English.

130
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,901
No, it's just been a while. Don't worry.

131
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,444
Thanks, Doo-sik. I'll try again.

132
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,906
Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah.

133
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,782
-Hey!
-What's going on?

134
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,578
It's been a while, Dong-goo.
You're finally home?

135
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,913
Quiet. Where's Yoon-ah?

136
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,207
Somewhere in the house. Why?

137
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,167
What? I want to ask her something.

138
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,504
I don't have much time. Third floor?

139
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,840
What? Damn it.

140
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,258
Hello, Director.

141
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,678
Me? I'm at a sauna.

142
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,264
Yes, I'm putting on my underwear.

143
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm putting my right leg into the hole.

144
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,894
I'll be right there.

145
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,437
Damn him.

146
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,815
What's going on?

147
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,070
Did someone come in?
It sounded like Dong-goo.

148
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,907
Yes, but he just left again.
He wanted to ask you something.

149
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,577
Ask me something? What would it be?

150
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,418
It's not my first time.
Why am I so nervous?

151
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,172
I really want to succeed this time.

152
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,887
Shall I feed off the support
of my fans online?

153
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,890
There are no comments.

154
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,269
Is "junki_love_" that busy?

155
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,314
-Come in.
-Okay.

156
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,819
Don't be nervous. Good luck.

157
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,654
Can you do this? Yes. Okay.

158
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,285
Is covering up what the media does?

159
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,288
Twisting the truth and inciting
the public, is that the media?

160
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,500
The media shouldn't hide
or manipulate the facts.

161
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,462
Reporting news that fears the weak
and causes fear in the powerful.

162
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,380
That is...

163
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:53,593
the mission and duty of a journalist.
Do you understand?

164
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,683
That's it.

165
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,436
Well done.

166
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,316
Okay.

167
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,738
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

168
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,240
Wait.

169
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,909
Do you like bean sprout soup?

170
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,705
Pardon? I do like it.

171
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,207
Shall we talk about the character
over some soup, then?

172
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,336
Pardon? What do you mean?

173
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,798
I like your acting.
I was looking for someone new.

174
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,009
Really?

175
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,974
NEWSROOM

176
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,005
What are you doing?

177
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,176
What do you want? What's going on?

178
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,844
Nothing much.

179
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,971
Congratulations!

180
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,268
-Congratulations, Joon-ki.
-Congratulations.

181
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,438
Thanks. Thanks so much.

182
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,066
-It's Dong-goo.
-Dong-goo?

183
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,984
-Hi, Dong-goo.
-Congratulations!

184
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,153
Score big! Good luck, Joon-ki!

185
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,698
Okay. Thanks.
I'll work really hard this time.

186
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,699
Okay!

187
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,205
Come on, get up.

188
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,166
Lee Joon-ki. Lee Joon-ki!

189
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,837
Lee Joon-ki. Lee Joon-ki!

190
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,880
Thank you. Thank you.

191
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,967
Lee Joon-ki. Lee Joon-ki!

192
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,642
It's the director. Hello, sir.

193
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,270
Yes, I'm outside Announcer Park's home.

194
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,314
Thanks for setting up the interview.

195
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,777
Yes. I'll do a lot of research.
Okay, bye.

196
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,447
I'm so nervous.

197
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,867
I get to meet the great announcer
Park Chang-ho.

198
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,794
What an impressive house.

199
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,340
Ma'am, this is for you.

200
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,593
Thank you.

201
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,101
-What's wrong?
-What does he want for lunch?

202
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,937
He won't have lunch. He has an interview.

203
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,899
You did very well.

204
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,986
Go and take your vitamins
and lie down.

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,530
Thank you, ma'am.

206
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,574
-Oh, dear.
-Gosh.

207
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,000
Go on inside.

208
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,794
-Okay.
-Oh, and just in case--

209
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,215
if he asks for me, say I'm out.

210
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,800
Tell him I'm not in.

211
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,763
Please tell him that for me.

212
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,972
Okay.

213
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,935
She's out?

214
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,272
Excuse me.

215
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,784
Hello, sir.

216
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,079
I'm actor Lee Joon-ki.
I will interview you today.

217
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,040
Oh, hello. Just a moment.

218
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,628
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

219
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,837
Hello.

220
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,923
It's an honor to meet you.

221
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,717
Am I disturbing you
during your busy schedule?

222
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,930
No. Your drama will portray
the world of news anchors.

223
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,515
I must help willingly.

224
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,809
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

225
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,648
Are you writing something?

226
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,442
Yes, I'm going to publish
an autobiography.

227
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,152
I was organizing the manuscripts.

228
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,614
I plan to publish a 20-volume series.

229
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,991
20 books?

230
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:32,955
You've been an anchor for so long.
You must have a lot to say.

231
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,250
I tried to cut it down
but it's still long.

232
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,504
Shall we begin the interview?

233
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,006
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

234
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,134
I'd like to know what motivated you
to become an anchor.

235
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,430
My motivation. My motivation...

236
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,143
I think it was 1987.

237
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,352
-Okay.
-It was snowing.

238
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:59,899
It was December 12 or the night
of the 11th becoming the 12th.

239
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,109
Anyway, my house was

240
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,736
made of wood-- rare in those days--

241
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,072
and a mix of American
and Japanese architecture.

242
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,783
-Oh, I see.
-The house had two rooms.

243
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,286
My dad, Mom, me and my brother
slept in one room

244
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,997
with our two dogs Bok-shil and Teun-shil.

245
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,292
In the other room was used
by my three older sisters.

246
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,295
My family was a huge influence on me.

247
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,839
I should start with my eldest sister.

248
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,509
She was 170cm tall
which was tall in those days

249
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,511
and she was slim, weighing just 48kg.

250
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,723
Wait. Why is he telling me all this?

251
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,642
How strange.

252
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,731
She's studying hard.

253
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,608
Soo-ah.

254
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,153
Soo-ah, drink this.

255
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,490
Shall we see how far you got?

256
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,575
What? Not yet.

257
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,329
Why? Are you afraid you got it wrong?
That's okay, let me see.

258
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,666
It's okay, let me check.
It's okay. It's fine.

259
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,838
You didn't answer anything.

260
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,383
What did you do all this time?

261
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,718
"Gangnam Station Exit Four"?

262
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,346
I thought about the old days.

263
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,140
I used to draw a lot in my textbooks.

264
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,851
I was going to study
after finishing that, I swear.

265
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,854
It's okay. I scribbled a lot
in school too.

266
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,022
Keep going.

267
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,358
Thank you. I'll finish up soon.

268
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,113
So my eldest sister who loved

269
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,781
bindaetteok and kimchi pancakes

270
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,951
met her husband who researched flour
at a flour manufacturer.

271
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,830
They married in fall of 1973,
had one son and two daughters,

272
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,873
and now they live happily

273
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,669
in a red-roofed house three doors down
from a post office in Pennsylvania.

274
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,879
Okay...

275
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,382
Now I shall tell you
about my second older sister.

276
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,883
My second sister

277
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,177
is 162cm tall and weighs 50kg.

278
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,889
She has an oval-shaped face,
almost like an egg.

279
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,100
She loved poems as a girl.

280
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,270
Knitting was her hobby and...

281
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,273
Joon-ki...?

282
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,108
Joon-ki.

283
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,985
Yes? What?

284
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,490
Sir. I'm so sorry.

285
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,660
I stayed up last night
to work on my character.

286
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,914
-I apologize.
-It's fine. It happens.

287
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:25,586
Sleep is when you rest
in a natural state of unconsciousness.

288
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,380
Sleep. Sleep...

289
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,299
To understand sleep,

290
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,552
we must start with Freud's psychoanalysis.

291
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,803
To understand this discipline,

292
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,889
you must know about Freud.

293
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,141
Freud's full name is Sigmund Freud.

294
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,852
He was born in 1856 in Freiberg,
the Czech Republic

295
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,856
to Jakob Freud and his second wife
Amalia who was 20 years younger.

296
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,609
The family had a unique makeup.

297
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,943
With seven siblings,

298
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,904
his family was financially strapped.

299
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,407
When Freud was a student
when he was nine years old,

300
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,326
one of his siblings was seven

301
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,952
and they had to

302
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,748
both compete for attention
and the chance to...

303
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,671
Yoon-ah.

304
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,343
Dong-goo, what are you doing here?

305
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,720
I had some business in the neighborhood

306
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,305
and happened to see you.

307
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,267
-Your class just ended?
-Yes.

308
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,977
Why do you look like that?

309
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,522
Your eyes are so red.

310
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,108
-Did you stay up?
-No.

311
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,445
My eyes turn red very easily. I'm fine.

312
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,407
Oh, you wanted to see me yesterday?

313
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,160
They said you had a question for me.

314
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,954
Oh, that?

315
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,289
When will the THAAD missile crisis
be resolved?

316
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,958
What?

317
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,086
You might have dumped me
after just five seconds,

318
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,713
but we're both Korean citizens.

319
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,133
Can't we discuss such diplomatic issues?

320
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,470
We can, but I don't know much
about diplomacy.

321
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,684
Are you hungry?

322
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,942
Sundae is all you want to eat?

323
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,736
Yes. It's my favorite food.

324
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,115
Are you really okay?

325
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,992
You look really tired.

326
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:25,497
I'm not.
People say that I often look tired.

327
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,958
How are things for you these days?

328
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,501
Are you enjoying your classes?

329
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,837
Yes. It's great fun.

330
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,755
My classmates are so nice.

331
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,010
We learned how to bake cakes today.

332
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,095
Dong-goo?

333
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,931
Dong-goo.

334
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,893
-Yes? What?
-Did you just fall asleep?

335
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,271
No, I was just thinking.

336
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,691
Should I dip the sundae in salt

337
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,068
-or shrimp sauce?
-Your food's here.

338
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,529
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

339
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,323
Wow, it looks delicious.

340
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,699
Here.

341
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,660
Try one.

342
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,957
-Dong-goo.
-Yes?

343
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,417
What?

344
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,754
Oh, I wasn't sleeping. I was praying.

345
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,214
You've never prayed.

346
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,882
I do when I eat snacks.

347
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,134
Especially sundae.

348
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,724
I'm starving.

349
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,937
It's so good.

350
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,438
Right, Dong-goo?

351
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,889
So the Society of Jesus was born
out of the crisis of the Catholic Church.

352
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,518
Oh dear. Talking about sleep
brought us this far.

353
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,522
There is more to talk about
but I'll leave that out

354
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,856
and return to the point.

355
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,984
I'll continue to talk about
my second sister

356
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,695
who loved poems and liked to knit.

357
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,196
My second sister--

358
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,116
Joon-ki?

359
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,785
-Joon-ki.
-Yes, yes.

360
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,789
Yes, I was listening,
Freud and his psychoanalysis, yes.

361
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,086
I talked about that almost 20 hours ago.

362
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,463
-You must be very tired.
-20 hours?

363
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,843
I apologize, sir.

364
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,686
So... what will you have for lunch?

365
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,439
Meat, fish, salad, porridge? Just choose.

366
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,440
Just choose one.

367
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:01,403
I looked up all the ingredients
in an encyclopedia

368
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,531
so you just have to pick one.
Please, just pick.

369
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,120
Please. I beg of you.

370
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,796
Very well.

371
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,675
-Joon-ki, what will you have?
-Huh?

372
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,761
I'll have...

373
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,222
I'll have meat, please.

374
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,058
Meat.

375
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,768
What kind of meat?

376
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,353
Pork, beef, mutton, chicken?

377
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,688
Pork, of course. Pork.

378
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,483
Pork. Pork is nice.

379
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,026
Shall we go, then?

380
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,572
Wait.

381
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,993
Pork has to suit your constitution.

382
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,413
What is your constitution?

383
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,248
If you read Heo Jun's Donguibogam,

384
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,752
you can tell how important it is
to eat what suits your body.

385
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,589
First, you must know about
the author, Heo Jun.

386
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,841
He's a mid-Joseon medical scientist,

387
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,637
the 20th descendant
of the first Heo of his line.

388
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,597
He learned to read and write young

389
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,808
and was well-learned in many fields.

390
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,561
He was especially interested
in Confucianism, Taoism

391
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,356
and Buddhism and compared
the literature extensively.

392
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,191
The result of these studies

393
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:25,112
resulted in thoughts and theories
that spanned all ideas and fields.

394
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,279
Heo Jun also...

395
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,697
WAIKIKI GUESTHOUSE & HOSTEL

396
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,119
-My goodness.
-Soo-ah.

397
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,745
Are you still eating?

398
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,704
Yes, why?

399
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,499
You left to eat
and left me waiting for two hours.

400
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,334
Soo-ah, it's time to study.

401
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,840
Hey, you don't bother a dog
when it's eating.

402
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:49,594
Isn't this a bit too much?
I can't study when I'm hungry.

403
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,140
Really? Sorry. I'm inconsiderate.

404
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,975
Eat in peace.

405
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,477
I'm back.

406
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,940
Where were you?

407
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,943
-Park Chang-ho's interview.
-What?

408
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,154
You left yesterday. It ended today?

409
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,197
What interview takes two days?

410
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,532
Don't even ask.

411
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,493
Never in my life have I met someone
who talks so much.

412
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,664
Just to eat lunch, I learned about
prehistoric hunter-gatherers.

413
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,252
-I'm home.
-Yoon-ah.

414
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,670
-Did you have dinner?
-Yes.

415
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,840
I met Dong-goo by chance
and we ate together.

416
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,342
Sol just got up.

417
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,846
She ate with Dong-goo?

418
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,599
He went to Sokcho to search
for filming locations for a few days.

419
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,977
Really? Then why did he come back?

420
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,243
-Hello? Yes, Director.
-What's taking you so long?

421
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,663
-Where are you?
-I'm in the sauna.

422
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,415
I'm putting on my underwear.

423
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,751
My right foot's going through the hole.

424
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,212
I'll put on my pants
and will rush right over.

425
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,840
I won't bother with my shirt.
I love you, Director.

426
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,930
He'll chew me out when I get there.

427
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,020
I got to see Yoon-ah, so it's okay.

428
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,534
-Soo-ah.
-Can I come in?

429
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,119
Of course.

430
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,789
Say hello.

431
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,125
-Do you want to talk?
-Not really.

432
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,877
What did you and Dong-goo eat?

433
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,172
-Sundae.
-Oh, I see.

434
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,174
Did he go back to Sokcho then?

435
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,094
Sokcho? He went to Sokcho?

436
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:58,473
You didn't know? He left yesterday
to work on something for the movie.

437
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,433
I wondered why he'd come back.

438
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,018
It was to see you.

439
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,771
What? What do you mean?

440
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,899
Do you think he came here from Sokcho
just to have sundae?

441
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,528
Dong-goo may be immature,

442
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:15,365
has no special skills or a bright future,

443
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,825
but he's a nice guy.

444
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,705
He's kind and thoughtful and sweet.

445
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,707
I'm just saying.

446
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,625
Good night.

447
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,212
Oh, do you like the coat I gave you?

448
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,173
Yes. It's really pretty and warm.

449
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,217
Thanks, Soo-ah.

450
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,096
You should thank Dong-goo.
He bought that coat for you.

451
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,639
What?

452
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,811
Oh, you didn't know? I thought you did.

453
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:49,899
Don't let Dong-goo
know that I told you. Okay?

454
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,543
Why doesn't "junki_love_" comment anymore?

455
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,338
Is something wrong?

456
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,134
Let's send a direct message.

457
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,554
I bet she'll be really shocked.

458
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,682
"Dear junki_love_,

459
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,268
this is Lee Joon-ki.

460
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,646
Is something going on?"

461
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,899
Question mark, send.

462
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,695
Hang on.

463
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,822
What was that?

464
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,162
Seo-jin, silly girl forgot
her phone again.

465
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,373
She'll make a fuss looking for it later.

466
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,916
She's so scatterbrained.

467
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,335
What's this?

468
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,295
SPACEWIDE STAR

469
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,213
A message?

470
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,130
DIRECT MESSAGE

471
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,048
What's this?

472
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:09,187
What? Why barge
into someone else's room?

473
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,522
Kang Seo-jin.

474
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,402
What's this?

475
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,406
Were you the one
who left all the comments?

476
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,702
-Why?
-Why do you think?

477
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,838
I'm a bit busy. Can you please leave?

478
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,586
Soo-ah, how much longer will you watch TV?

479
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,546
You watched this drama already.

480
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,090
Gosh, you're way too intense.

481
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,176
Fine, I'll turn it off.

482
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,263
-What should I do?
-Huh?

483
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,432
Shall we study some math?

484
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,600
Math?

485
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,226
It's my worst subject.

486
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,646
That's okay. We'll start with the basics.
Don't worry.

487
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,983
Shall we start with this problem then?

488
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,196
Here.

489
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,491
Hey, isn't this a bit mean?

490
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,368
I may be weak at math
but I can solve this.

491
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,829
-The answer's 40.
-What?

492
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,250
Soo-ah, how is the answer 40?

493
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,211
12 plus eight is 20.

494
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,004
Multiply that by two and it's 40.

495
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,507
Soo-ah, the thing is...

496
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,342
Multiplication and division

497
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,385
has priority over addition
and subtraction.

498
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,554
So you multiply eight and two first,

499
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,264
then you add 12 later on.

500
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,642
What? Why do you multiply first?

501
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,021
The four arithmetical rules
have an order of priority.

502
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,899
Even if it comes later,
you multiply and divide first.

503
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,901
Says who? Who decided that?

504
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,821
I don't really know who made the rule.

505
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,531
What?

506
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,617
Then you taught me a rule
without knowing who made it?

507
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,869
Why should I learn something
you don't know?

508
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,956
This is unbelievable.

509
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,708
You're teaching me things
you don't even know.

510
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,461
After all that showing off,
you actually know nothing.

511
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,129
If it should be done first,
write it first.

512
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,257
Why make this kind of problem?

513
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,550
Are you mocking me or what?

514
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,177
Are you all twisted up inside?

515
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,056
Hey, because of you,
I now doubt all the fundamentals of math.

516
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,284
Do I know Doo-sik?

517
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,871
He was the most positive man I'd ever met.

518
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,666
What happened to him?

519
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,251
Hey, you blockhead.

520
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,628
You don't know rules of arithmetic
and you doubt the fundamentals?

521
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,922
Just quit trying to study, you witch.

522
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,300
If you're dumb, at least try hard.

523
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,468
Should you be watching TV?
Do you understand the dialogue?

524
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,013
You bitch. Hey, hey, hey.

525
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,473
Am I twisted? How dare you say that?

526
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,644
I helped you out of pity
and you're just an arrogant blockhead.

527
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:42,025
You bitch, I fucking quit.
I've had enough, you dimwit.

528
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,696
See you at the shoot.

529
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,740
I'll see you then.

530
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,158
Thank you!

531
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,956
Kang Seo-jin.

532
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,834
Were you the one
who left all the comments?

533
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,086
-Why?
-Why do you think?

534
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,052
SPACEWIDE STAR

535
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,763
I've fallen for Octopus Man's charm.

536
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,017
You'll become a spacewide star one day.

537
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,394
You're still charismatic,
even with no dialogue.

538
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,688
You're noticeable even for a second.

539
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,857
Your acting's the best.

540
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,276
I believe in you. Good luck.

541
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,822
-Joon-ki!
-My goodness.

542
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,242
Congratulations on making it.
I'm so pleased for you.

543
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,244
I owe it to you. Thanks.

544
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,621
What?

545
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,790
Thank you!

546
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,417
No, I should thank you.

547
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,712
You set me up with Seo-jin.

548
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,756
And today,

549
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,675
I'm taking her on a date.

550
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,677
What? A date?

551
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,888
Yes. I told her how I feel a few days ago.

552
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,640
She asked to meet today.

553
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,101
She's going to say yes, isn't she?

554
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,895
Thanks so much, Joon-ki.

555
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,648
I'll ask you again.

556
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,652
Am I not a woman to you?

557
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,114
You're a man to me.

558
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,241
What should I do?

559
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,079
-Ta-da!
-That's awesome.

560
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,290
Good luck.

561
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,086
Congratulations, Chewbacca.
Treat us when you get paid.

562
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,839
You slack off a bit but you can act.

563
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,841
I like you.

564
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,554
-Hey.
-What?

565
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,389
You can't see Seo-jin today.

566
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,808
-What? Why not?
-I'll have regrets.

567
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,685
Regrets? What are you talking about?

568
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,770
If I let her go like this,

569
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,148
I might regret it forever.

570
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,983
What?

571
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,068
If you didn't get it, fine.

572
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,625
What are you doing here?

573
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,295
Seo-jin. Let's talk.

574
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,005
I have nothing to say to you.

575
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,719
I'll give it a go.

576
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,345
What are you on about?

577
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,097
From now on...

578
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,349
I'll think of you as a woman.

579
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,478
So...

580
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,396
let's give it a shot.

581
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,732
As a man and woman.

582
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,359
Joon-ki...

583
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,745
Joon-ki.

584
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,623
We won't tell Dong-goo, okay?

585
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,666
-Okay.
-If he knows we're dating,

586
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,668
he'll beat me to death, okay?

587
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,337
I got it.

588
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,801
Let go. People are staring.

589
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,596
No, I won't let you go.
I'll never let go forever.

590
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,564
Hello.

591
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,820
-Welcome.
-Hello.

592
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,446
-Seo-jin, show them the room.
-Okay.

593
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,532
-Hello.
-Welcome.

594
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,075
Joon-ki.

595
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,744
Follow me.

596
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,918
I had some last-minute problems
with accommodations.

597
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,753
You saved my life.

598
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,256
We should thank you
for bringing guests over.

599
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,007
Will you be staying too?

600
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,093
Yes. I have to show the guys around.

601
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,970
-Come this way, then.
-Okay.

602
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,856
What, what?

603
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,442
You haven't forgotten
about our date, have you?

604
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,111
Of course not.

605
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,280
Is this our first date?

606
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,158
It's so exciting, isn't it?

607
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,869
What are you doing?
What if someone sees?

608
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,997
Who cares? There's no one here.

609
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,623
Really?

610
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,667
I'm back.

611
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:18,009
Welcome back.
You come in from Sokcho?

612
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,553
Yes. I'm dead tired.

613
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,513
Why are you two together?

614
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,475
I warned you to stay away
from my sister.

615
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,769
-Should I--
-No, no.

616
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,355
We met by chance when I was
going to the kitchen for water.

617
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,607
That's right.

618
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,608
Really?

619
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,986
-What are you doing down there?
-What?

620
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,238
I was wiping the floor.

621
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,741
There are a lot of loose hairs.
Look at them.

622
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,035
-Really?
-Gosh.

623
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,537
What's that? A present for me?

624
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,249
This? Half-dried squid,
a Sokcho specialty.

625
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,376
Ugly, just like you.

626
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,088
-Squid, squid, squid.
-What, you jerk?

627
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,258
What's that noise?

628
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,221
Yoon-ah's pastry teacher Hyun-joon.

629
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,056
He brought guests over.

630
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,349
He's saying here too.

631
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,143
That fool Song Hyun-joon's staying here?

632
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,061
How dare he?

633
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,771
What's wrong with him?

634
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,399
Are you okay, Seo-jin?

635
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,609
Are you hurt?

636
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,444
I'm fine.

637
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,199
The guesthouse is so charmingly sweet.

638
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,951
I'm glad you like it.

639
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,790
My goodness, look who's here.

640
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,875
Dong-goo, when did you get back?

641
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,085
Just now.

642
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,378
We meet again.

643
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,798
I heard that you're going to stay
for a few days.

644
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,509
Yes, I will for a while.

645
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,095
Why of all the possible guesthouses

646
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,264
did you come to this shabby place?

647
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,975
It's nicer if I know someone.

648
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,810
Yoon-ah stays here.

649
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,689
Oh. I see.

650
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,732
Dong-goo. What's that?

651
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,526
Oh, these?

652
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,654
Half-dried squid from Sokcho.

653
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,657
They're the same species as Hyun-joon.

654
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,535
What do you say?

655
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,495
Do you want a bite?

656
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,039
To welcome you to our guesthouse,

657
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,500
I'll give you a piece of squid.

658
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,585
Thanks.

659
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,225
BLOODY TIE

660
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,236
Honey, I just got off work.

661
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,905
Get ready and I'll see you soon.
I miss you.

662
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,241
I just can't get used to this.

663
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,076
My gosh.

664
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,288
Who'd have thought I'd date her?

665
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,213
Yes, that's right.

666
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,885
She was a bearded kid with a runny nose.

667
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,429
I'm dating the furry kid now.

668
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,349
This is just unbelievable.

669
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,352
No, no. No.

670
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,604
I said I'd give it a go.

671
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,314
Let's do this.

672
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,484
I'll do it. Let's do this.

673
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,027
I love you, Furry.

674
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,115
We were like brothers
when I studied in New York.

675
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,203
We used to drive to other cities
during the holidays.

676
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,830
I see. That must've been a lot of fun.

677
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,002
Why won't this open?

678
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,880
Dong-goo, can you do it for me?

679
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,215
Sure thing.

680
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,305
Hang on.

681
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,978
It won't open. It's defective.

682
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,773
-I'll give it a go.
-It's defective.

683
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,191
The lid's stuck fast...

684
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,364
-That's awesome.
-You're so strong, Hyun-joon.

685
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,199
It was easy to open.

686
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,914
Yoon-ah, do you want
to join us for drinks?

687
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:20,042
You should watch what you say
to a breastfeeding mother.

688
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,255
Dong-goo, Sol started on formula
and baby food.

689
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,256
Did she?

690
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,134
Still, it's a bit too late to go drinking.

691
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,677
It's only nine p.m.

692
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,138
Yoon-ah, Sol's asleep. Go and have fun.

693
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,348
-I'll clean up.
-Jerk.

694
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,142
Can I do that?

695
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,769
Do you mind, just for tonight?

696
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,272
Let me tag along too.

697
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,233
I suddenly feel like having a drink.

698
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,152
Can you drink a lot?

699
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,321
Enough to hold my own.
What about you?

700
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,576
I drink as much as anyone.
Will you come with us?

701
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,869
Sure.

702
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,627
NEWS ANCHOR PARK CHANG-HO

703
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,754
Why is he calling me again?

704
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,010
Hello, Mr. Park, how are you?

705
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,720
Are you doing well?

706
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,432
I still have so much to tell you.
Why haven't you come back?

707
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,475
Pardon?

708
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,021
-I'm so busy currently...
-I see.

709
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,982
Why does it sound like
your voice is echoing?

710
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,613
-My phone's a bit old.
-Oh, I see.

711
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,365
Cell phones are so convenient.

712
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,658
Joon-ki.

713
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,912
-Do you know how they were made?
-Pardon?

714
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,457
To know the history of cell phones
you must know of telephones.

715
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,960
The first phone was made
in 1949 in Havana, Cuba

716
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,505
by Italian Antonio Meucci.

717
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,839
The telephone we know...

718
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,760
To understand that,
we must know that in 1874...

719
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,637
Alexander Graham Bell...

720
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,641
So from Scotland...
Alexander Bell first...

721
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,434
He changed the system...

722
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,103
Even the hard of hearing can use...

723
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,942
How did we end up with smartphones?

724
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,444
In 1992, the first smartphone

725
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,239
-was IBM's Simon...
-Joon-ki, I'm...

726
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,533
-Now Simon...
-What are you doing?

727
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,952
-You must know IBM's history.
-Just a moment.

728
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,663
-IBM was...
-Yes, sir.

729
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,999
Thanks a lot for the explanation,

730
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:28,254
but I have to get ready for a shoot now.

731
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,422
I'll call you soon.

732
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,508
Sure. Bye.

733
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,303
My ear's burning.

734
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,555
Who was that?

735
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,308
Park Chang-ho, the anchor.

736
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,811
The man who talks too much?

737
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,731
I stopped visiting so he calls instead.

738
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,900
Should I block his number?

739
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,532
Sorry. Let's go. The movie might start.

740
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,743
Joon-ki, let's get some popcorn.

741
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,498
-What's wrong?
-It's nothing.

742
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,834
Let's get popcorn.

743
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,841
Did you wait for long?

744
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,302
You're the one...

745
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,345
who waited.

746
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,686
What kind of a movie has so much kissing?

747
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,480
This is awkward as it is.

748
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,031
What? Don't you like it?

749
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,075
No, it's not that.

750
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,038
This is way too awkward.

751
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,956
It's driving me crazy.

752
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,625
No.

753
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,169
Stop thinking like this.

754
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,296
She's not the furry kid she was.

755
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,923
She's an adult now.

756
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,095
Wait. Why is her hand so small?

757
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,514
Was it always this small?

758
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,770
Yikes.

759
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,731
What's wrong?

760
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,276
What are you staring at?

761
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,028
What?

762
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,905
Is my beard growing?

763
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,282
No, it's not that.

764
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,285
Oh, is it because I'm so pretty?

765
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,913
You keep wanting to look at me?

766
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,626
You're just helpless.

767
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,845
Too bad it's over.

768
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,848
I had a great time today.

769
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,725
Yes. Right.

770
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,435
Sleep well.

771
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,397
Dream of me.

772
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,073
I just can't get used to this.
What should I do?

773
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,327
What's this noise?

774
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,371
Okay, got it.

775
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,041
Get it together.

776
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,334
Why'd you drink so much?

777
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,128
Let go of me.

778
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:18,257
I'm going to drink some more.

779
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,677
What's wrong? What happened to him?

780
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,847
He and Hyun-joon
had bet on who could drink more.

781
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,141
I'm really sorry.
He kept saying he was fine.

782
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,934
Mr. Kang, get a hold of yourself.

783
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,144
Hyun-joon.

784
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,313
What are you doing?

785
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,651
You promised to call me by my name.

786
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:41,071
Call me Dong-goo. Go on, Dong-goo.

787
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,282
Okay, Dong-goo.

788
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,741
Sober up, okay?

789
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,618
Okay, bro.

790
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,579
Let go!

791
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:54,877
Don't forget to make us sausage bread.

792
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,672
Dong-goo just loves sausage bread.

793
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,341
Okay, I'll put two sausages in yours.

794
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,427
Two? Two sausages?

795
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,970
How much did he drink?

796
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,930
Sorry. I'll take him.

797
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,099
-I want...
-Wake up. Let's go.

798
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,019
Joon-ki. Doo-sik.

799
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,154
I smell vitamins.

800
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,156
How many did he swallow?

801
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,742
It smells like red ginseng too.

802
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,410
What did that idiot eat?

803
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:32,414
Be quiet. My head hurts. I'm dying.

804
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:37,711
-You're finally awake? You nutcase.
-I feel sick.

805
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,048
Why are you wiping the floor?

806
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,051
What happened to me?

807
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,804
Where are all my clothes?
Who stripped me?

808
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,348
We did, okay?

809
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,391
-Why?
-Last night, you...

810
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,560
you peed on yourself.

811
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,729
What? I did?

812
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,272
That wasn't all.

813
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,982
You and Hyun-joon became buddies.

814
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,110
You hugged him, kissed his cheek
and acted like the worst nuisance.

815
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,362
What? Buddies?

816
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,614
I said that? To him?

817
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,866
-Buddy.
-Hey, hey.

818
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,909
I kissed you.

819
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,579
I had a bad feeling
when you kept drinking trying to beat him.

820
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,250
-Why does he bother you so much?
-Why do you think?

821
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,670
Are you jealous because he and Yoon-ah
are becoming close friends?

822
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,131
He's not over Yoon-ah yet.

823
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,802
It's not that.
I don't care at all about Yoon-ah.

824
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,095
Oh, you don't?

825
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,889
Then you won't mind
if I tell her you peed your pants?

826
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,933
Okay, perfect. Yoon-ah!

827
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,477
Hey! Don't.

828
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,979
Don't tell her.

829
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,231
You really can't tell her.

830
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,359
Why not? You said
you don't care about her.

831
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,320
Yes, I still like her, so what?

832
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,449
I want to forget her but I keep
thinking of her and missing her.

833
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,202
That's why Hyun-joon
bothers you that much?

834
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:56,582
That Hyun-joon guy keeps hanging
around Yoon-ah and bothering me.

835
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,043
Why are you bothered?
I don't think they have anything going on.

836
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:04,339
You think? But something irks me.

837
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,508
I smell something strange.

838
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,136
That strange smell's
coming from your covers.

839
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,513
Wash them already. They stink.

840
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,391
Okay. What's this smell?

841
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,607
Hey, Doo-sik.

842
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,110
You really, really can't tell
Yoon-ah I peed.

843
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,320
I won't.

844
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,238
Hey, last night.

845
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:33,201
Did I really call Hyun-joon
my buddy and stuff?

846
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,955
You did. I thought you were
long-lost brothers being reunited.

847
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,500
-Quit drinking.
-I lost my mind.

848
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,877
You're up.

849
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,754
Do you feel okay?

850
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,464
Yes, I'm fine.

851
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,799
How will you face Yoon-ah now?

852
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,761
What? Why?
Did I do something else?

853
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,055
Do you not remember
playing planes with her?

854
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,557
We played planes?

855
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,643
Let's go to Hawaii.

856
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,896
Dong-goo, you can stop...

857
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,982
No, let's go.

858
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,361
We have turbulence.

859
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,740
But Dong-goo is really strong.

860
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,950
Now scream.

861
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,620
Yoon-ah said she'd never been abroad,

862
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,706
so you put her on your feet
and bounced her around.

863
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,375
What? I did?

864
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,794
She doesn't need to fly anymore.

865
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,338
You're such an idiot.

866
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:31,968
Dong-goo.

867
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,765
-You're up.
-Yes.

868
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,226
Hey, Dong-goo. Feel all right?

869
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,519
Yes, I'm fine.

870
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,853
Mr. Song Hyun-joon.

871
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,897
Come on, don't be like that.

872
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,607
We decided to be buddies.

873
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,193
We did?

874
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,529
I have no recollection at all.

875
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,740
Sorry, Mr. Song Hyun-joon.

876
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,369
That's fine, Mr. Kang.

877
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,295
We'll go upstairs then, Yoon-ah.

878
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,213
Okay.

879
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,051
See you around, Mr. Song.

880
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,514
I'm really sorry.

881
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,932
I drank too much.

882
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:22,185
It's okay. I got to ride in a plane.

883
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,525
You stupid idiot.

884
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,832
You're really good at this.

885
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,128
That's not how you play.

886
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,089
What? What do you mean?

887
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:55,177
When you play gonggi,
the grip is most important.

888
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,304
You must grab the stones lightly.

889
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,682
If you grab them like that,
you'll mess up easily.

890
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,142
Are you good at this too?

891
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,435
You bet I am.

892
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,604
I'm Huam-dong's Gonggi King.

893
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,315
Shall I show you?

894
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,152
Give me the stones.

895
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:18,617
Watch. Nice and light.

896
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,996
Catch, catch.

897
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,207
You're really good at this.

898
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,334
This is nothing.

899
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,171
Hyun-joon, you seem to be
pretty good at this.

900
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,549
How about a game of gonggi for fun?

901
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,929
I guess we could.

902
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,931
It's not fun to just play.

903
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,308
The loser gets 10 forehead flicks.

904
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,559
How about that?

905
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,980
Sounds good. How many points to win?

906
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,525
-50?
-That's weak.

907
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,778
Let's go with 100.

908
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,947
Be a man.

909
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,115
Let's decide who goes first.

910
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,575
Rock-paper-scissors.

911
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,662
Oh, dear. I played paper and you lost.

912
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,456
I should go first.

913
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,802
100 points.

914
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,178
I won.

915
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,349
You're really good at this.

916
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,020
I'd have won
if it weren't for the hangover.

917
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,064
You're very lucky.

918
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,942
Am I? Let's say I am.

919
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,777
"Let's say I am"?

920
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,655
Are you saying I can't win
even when I'm sober?

921
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,157
That's not what I meant.

922
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,660
Then let's play again.
For 100 points.

923
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,538
10 flicks-- no, 20 flicks on the forehead.

924
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:48,039
It's on.

925
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,588
Give me a moment. Darn it.

926
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,673
Hello, Director.

927
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:01,761
Right now? Okay, I'll be there.

928
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,057
I have to go out for work.

929
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,019
I'll take you on when I get back.

930
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,314
Wait. Dong-goo.

931
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,608
I think you forgot something.

932
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,110
What? What did I forget?

933
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,954
I didn't think Shin Hyun-joon

934
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,039
would play the Saudi Arabian spy.

935
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,582
Me neither.

936
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,250
He was really eager.

937
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,085
He found it refreshing.

938
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,088
Would he have imagined
anyone casting him as an Arab?

939
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,590
We owe it to Dong-goo.

940
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,801
Shin Hyun-joon's on the team

941
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,470
and all the locations are lined up.

942
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,221
Now the props.

943
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,932
What gun should the lead use?

944
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,350
How about a Beretta or Smith-Wesson?

945
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,060
Isn't that too boring?

946
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,270
Isn't there something different?

947
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,774
Kang Dong-goo.

948
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,233
Do you have any ideas?

949
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,737
Gonggi!

950
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,072
You startled me. Gonggi?

951
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,699
-What about gonggi?
-Pardon?

952
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,201
An air rifle.

953
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:07,953
That's different.

954
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,038
-Kang Dong-goo.
-Yes, sir?

955
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,248
You're full of ideas.

956
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,334
You've pulled your weight today. Go home.

957
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,337
Pardon? Okay.

958
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,036
-Who are you?
-Hello.

959
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,538
I'm Kang Dong-goo.

960
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,832
Hankuk University, class of 2013.

961
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,086
You and I were both in "Let It Go,"

962
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,170
the movie club.

963
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,464
Oh, Kang Dong-goo.

964
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,717
Why are you here?

965
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,346
It's been so long.

966
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:13,727
We haven't seen one another
since I graduated. Why are you here?

967
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,148
I need to ask for a favor.

968
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,442
A favor? What is it?

969
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:25,196
Do you remember our university festival?

970
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:30,535
The festival? We showed movies.
Jean-Luc Godard's, I think.

971
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,870
No, not that.

972
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,663
Then... the bar?

973
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,748
Not that either.

974
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,957
Then what?

975
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,001
The gonggi competition.

976
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,712
-What?
-You represented our club

977
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,713
and became champion.

978
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,174
The quickest-ever to 100 points.
You broke the record.

979
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,844
I did. I remember that.

980
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,012
What about it?

981
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,891
-Teach me how to play.
-What?

982
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,644
You came to see me after eight years
to learn to play gonggi?

983
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,773
Yes. I'm in this bind, you see.

984
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,567
I must learn. I want to be good at it.

985
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,779
Please. I beg of you.

986
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,030
Please.

987
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,657
What's wrong with you?

988
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,085
Did you bring the stones?

989
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:33,139
We must adjust the weight.

990
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,225
There's too much filling inside.

991
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:39,437
3.2g of filling is about right
for each stone for me,

992
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,564
but each person
prefers a different weight.

993
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,483
You must find the weight that suits you.

994
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,777
Oh. Okay.

995
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,114
Toss the stones to eye level.

996
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,116
If they go above your head,

997
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,785
that's called Baekdusan and is a foul.

998
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,372
Baekdusan.

999
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,957
Shall we start at level one?

1000
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,546
At level one, you must scatter the stones

1001
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,005
very wide apart.

1002
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,883
-Scatter them.
-Far apart, like this.

1003
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:09,884
-Okay?
-Okay.

1004
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,928
Level two, the tummy split.

1005
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,558
You raise your middle finger slightly
without your opponent noticing.

1006
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,019
In a split second. This is not a foul.

1007
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,312
It's a skill.

1008
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,314
Then level three.

1009
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,859
Tuck one stone beneath your thumb.

1010
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,068
Drop that a split second later.

1011
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,736
It must be close.

1012
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,281
Pick up the three stones first,
to err on the safe side.

1013
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,159
-Okay?
-Three stones first, to be safe.

1014
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,913
It's freezing.

1015
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,709
What's taking her so long?

1016
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,296
What's this?

1017
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,550
It's me, Park Chang-ho.

1018
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,010
My goodness.

1019
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,305
I blocked his number
so now he's texting me?

1020
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,641
Even his messages are lengthy.

1021
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,394
Is this a thesis or what?

1022
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,354
My gosh.

1023
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,440
I should block these too.

1024
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,109
Sorry I'm late, Joon-ki.

1025
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,027
It's fine.

1026
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,905
What shall we do tonight?

1027
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,531
Whatever you want.

1028
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,075
Then let's go to a karaoke and sing.

1029
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,457
-Karaoke?
-What? Don't you want to?

1030
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,503
No, no. Let's go.

1031
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,297
Karaoke time.

1032
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,550
This is exciting.

1033
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,387
I always wanted to sing this
when I got a boyfriend.

1034
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,764
Can I go first?

1035
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,391
Of course you can. Go ahead.

1036
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,935
Okay.

1037
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,858
I just can't get used to this.

1038
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,961
What's wrong? I was just getting started.

1039
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,423
How dare you sing such a sexy song?

1040
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,759
-What are you talking about?
-Quiet!

1041
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:26,479
We're here already. What a pity.

1042
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,983
If we get married, we won't have to part.

1043
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,819
What? Get married?

1044
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,198
Joon-ki. When we get married,
where shall we go for our honeymoon?

1045
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,076
What? Honeymoon?

1046
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,828
I want to go to the Maldives.

1047
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,789
-And--
-Stop, stop.

1048
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,001
Don't say things like that, kiddo.

1049
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:52,046
No, no, this is wrong. It's just wrong.

1050
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,549
Seo-jin.

1051
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,010
I have something to say.

1052
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,681
Seo-jin.

1053
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,350
I gave it a go,

1054
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,062
but I can't help it
that you just look like a kid.

1055
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:13,443
However hard I try,
you're just not a woman to me.

1056
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,903
So...

1057
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,158
let's end this, shall we?

1058
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,245
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

1059
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:32,837
Wait.

1060
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,551
Don't do this, Seo-jin.

1061
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,303
Will you try to under--

1062
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,286
Do I still not look like a woman to you?

1063
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:11,417
You do. You are a woman.

1064
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:16,089
No, not yet. You aren't convinced.
I'm not woman enough yet.

1065
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,257
What?

1066
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:25,056
Move!

1067
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,605
What was that?

1068
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,982
Did Dong-goo not see us?

1069
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,111
I guess not. What's gotten into him?

1070
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,531
I don't know. All I saw
were the whites of his eyes.

1071
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,492
It's a good thing he didn't see us.

1072
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,455
Come at me!

1073
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,875
You're home, Dong-goo.
Did you have dinner?

1074
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,335
I'm not hungry.

1075
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,672
I'd rather play that game now.

1076
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:00,967
Gonggi.

1077
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,053
What?

1078
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,827
The first to 100 points wins.

1079
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,915
The penalty is 20 forehead flicks.
Are you game?

1080
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,293
Yes, I am.

1081
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,044
Here are the rules.

1082
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,340
Baekdusan. That's a foul.

1083
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,759
DEPENDS ON THE REGION

1084
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,511
If the stones go above your head,
that's out. Understood?

1085
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,054
Very well.

1086
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,682
Then let's ban Sokuri too.

1087
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,476
When catching stones,

1088
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,810
THE PALM MUST FACE DOWNWARD

1089
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,145
You're out if you do this.

1090
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,313
You bet.

1091
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:58,232
Also...

1092
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,320
The Arirang is allowed.

1093
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,491
Of course. The Arirang must be allowed.

1094
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,284
CATCHING IN TWO SWIPES

1095
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,660
Let's begin.

1096
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,330
Let's decide who goes first.

1097
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,664
Rock-paper-scissors.

1098
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:27,470
I won. I shall begin then.

1099
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:40,942
BAEKDUSAN VIOLATION

1100
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,026
Foul.

1101
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,197
Baekdusan.

1102
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,370
Kong.

1103
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,544
Miracle.

1104
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,420
DONG-GOO 41, HYUN-JOON 49

1105
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,804
Yes. Perfect.

1106
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:35,788
The current score is

1107
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,001
96 points to Hyun-joon, 83 to me.

1108
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,926
If I mess up now,

1109
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,721
Hyun-joon will win.

1110
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,849
I'm in danger.

1111
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:56,726
What should I do?

1112
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,853
What must I do?

1113
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,569
Finally,

1114
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:10,948
I'll teach you a lethal move
you must use only when in danger.

1115
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,783
A lethal move?

1116
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,785
If you risk losing the game

1117
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,746
if you lose the current hand,

1118
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,831
but you're still in play.

1119
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,167
You flicked the stones

1120
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,670
four landed on the back
of your hand.

1121
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,755
At that moment,

1122
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:27,965
what will you do?

1123
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,218
I guess... I'd catch the four stones

1124
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,970
and play from level one...

1125
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,263
No, no, no.

1126
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,515
The second you choose that,

1127
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,893
the game is as good as over.

1128
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,771
Who can guarantee that

1129
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,190
you won't mess up on the next four levels?

1130
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,359
Then what must I do?

1131
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,486
Make a bid for victory.

1132
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,112
With the Arirang.

1133
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,906
The Arirang?

1134
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,325
The Arirang is when

1135
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,578
you catch the stones in mid-air

1136
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:01,499
downward and then upward
and it's a very difficult move.

1137
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,627
That accounts for five times
the points of the usual catch.

1138
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,795
That's why it's lethal.

1139
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,340
-Five times the points?
-When you're cornered,

1140
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:14,136
do not forget the Arirang.

1141
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:18,432
Yes. I have nowhere to go from here.

1142
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,102
I must make the move.

1143
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:24,105
The air is frigid.

1144
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,274
I feel a blade aimed at my heart.

1145
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,069
But do not worry.

1146
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,697
I have

1147
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,825
the Arirang.

1148
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,499
Wow.

1149
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,837
I did it. I did the Arirang.

1150
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,921
Did you see that?

1151
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,339
That's the score times five.

1152
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,050
I won 20 points.

1153
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,551
I won, didn't I?

1154
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,771
Dong-goo. I've lost.

1155
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,233
I played for so long that my back hurts.

1156
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,486
I need to go to the bathroom.

1157
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,072
Hyun-joon.

1158
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,367
I think you forgot something.

1159
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,052
Kang Dong-goo...

1160
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,267
I wish they'd help out.

1161
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,693
Thanks for letting us stay.

1162
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,362
It's time we left.

1163
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,781
Take care.

1164
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,826
Wait.

1165
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,038
-Let's me ask you something.
-Go ahead.

1166
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,749
I heard that you let Yoon-ah

1167
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,168
use your kitchen to practice baking.

1168
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,045
Why is that?

1169
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,131
What? What do you mean?

1170
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,759
It's a bit odd.
You must teach other students.

1171
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,512
Why are you so generous only to Yoon-ah?

1172
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:05,099
That's because I feel for her
as a single mom.

1173
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,269
I see.

1174
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,063
-I thought...
-However,

1175
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,732
now I'm a bit more interested.

1176
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,235
What?

1177
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,529
I'm interested in her.

1178
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,738
No.

1179
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,074
I like her.

1180
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,102
I have to keep her away from him.

1181
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,896
Why are you in a wheelchair?

1182
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,772
This is terrible. He can't move.

1183
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,983
Don't worry, I'll stay with him.

1184
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,109
Yoon-ah, are you in?

1185
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,069
Why are you here, Hyun-joon?

1186
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,321
I'll open an online mall.

1187
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,655
Business isn't for everyone.

1188
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,449
Is there a way to promote it?

1189
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,618
Why am I useless at everything?

1190
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,660
I tried really hard.

1191
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,579
I'm Bong Doo-sik.

1192
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,005
-What stupidity is this?
-It was Joon-ki's idea.

1193
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,840
How could you tell on him?

1194
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:23,385
If something happens
between you and my sister,

1195
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,012
I'll see to it that you smell incense

1196
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,639
from your coffin.

1197
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,265
Must we go this far?

1198
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,850
Can't we say we're dating?

1199
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:30,976
I have a boyfriend.

1200
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,519
What? A boyfriend?
