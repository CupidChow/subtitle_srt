1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,470
First of all, I'd like to welcome

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,597
everyone staying at Waikiki Guesthouse.

3
00:00:55,847 --> 00:01:00,018
I sincerely hope that your stay at Waikiki
is a pleasant one.

4
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:00,935
Next.

5
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,860
Is that it?

6
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,903
I said a lot.

7
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,405
I condensed it.
As long as it got across.

8
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,866
Forget it.
What should I expect from you?

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,078
Let's forget everything and have some fun.

10
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,671
What's wrong with him?

11
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,132
He got dumped a little while ago.

12
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,847
Don't mind him. Another toast?

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,938
What's wrong with her?

14
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,148
She had her heart broken
a while ago as well.

15
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,527
In a way that couldn't be more miserable.

16
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,696
Don't mind them. Another toast?

17
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,826
Forget it. I'm going to bed.

18
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,452
Why? We were having fun.

19
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,454
Where are you all going? Hey. Come back.

20
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,664
-Just a moment.
-Wait.

21
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,044
Do you hear me?

22
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,421
Damn it.

23
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,677
-Hey!
-Stop blowing your noses.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,595
You'll blow out your bone marrow.

25
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,598
How long will you keep this up?

26
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,308
You're upsetting our guests.

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,185
I'm sorry, Joon-ki.

28
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,021
I keep thinking of Tae-hyun.

29
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,982
I can't stop crying.

30
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,692
-What?
-What's she saying?

31
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,944
Don't cry, Seo-jin.

32
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,238
Seo-jin.

33
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,498
-My gosh.
-Is he Jean Valjean or what?

34
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,841
Tae-hyun, what are you doing here?

35
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,635
I missed you. I missed you so much.

36
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,388
Weren't you disappointed in me?

37
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,433
Why would I be disappointed?
Because of your facial hair?

38
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,519
What's wrong with that, silly?

39
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,939
Are you an idiot?

40
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,026
Even if bananas grew from your head, no.

41
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,113
Even if your armpits spewed out
seaweed and kelp...

42
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,281
He's crazy.

43
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,699
I wouldn't care, Seo-jin.

44
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,909
Tae-hyun...

45
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,203
How about we officially date?

46
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,081
Tae-hyun.

47
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,209
Whether you grow seaweed or kelp,

48
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,337
I don't care.

49
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,050
They might as well shoot a film.

50
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,553
It's so gross and unnerving.
It's like a third-rate cult film.

51
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,972
Don't you think, Dong-goo?

52
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,683
I'm so envious.

53
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,268
Gosh...

54
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,235
A BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,862
-Let's play.
-This one.

56
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,199
That's it! I did it!

57
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,700
We got it!

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,301
-Tae-hyun, here's your coffee.
-Thanks.

59
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,221
Tae-hyun, your nose is bleeding.

60
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,350
It's fine. I get nosebleeds often.

61
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,699
I like the drawings.

62
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,121
We're here already. It's late. Go on home.

63
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,372
Okay.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,968
Oh, right.

65
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,723
-Here.
-What is it?

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,974
Open it at home.

67
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,101
I'll really go now.

68
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,022
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

69
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,334
I'm home.

70
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,377
Hi. How was the date?

71
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,256
Hey, Chewbacca, why's your face so red?

72
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,799
Like you kissed him.

73
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,384
We did not kiss.

74
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,053
Yes, you did!

75
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,679
-What's that?
-This?

76
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,222
A present from Tae-hyun.

77
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,140
A present?

78
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,477
-Let's have a look. Go on.
-No, why would you look at my present?

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,519
Because I'm your friend.

80
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,022
Why else would I look?

81
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,275
It's nicely wrapped.

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,031
What's this? What is this?

83
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,701
The present's a razor?

84
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,288
Why did he...? He's so silly.

85
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,874
I can't believe this.

86
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,001
A girl who gets a razor
from her boyfriend?

87
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,920
I bet you're the only one in the world.

88
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,340
-Keep your mouth shut.
-Right, Dong-goo?

89
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,425
What is it now?

90
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,677
Now that I think about it...

91
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,015
I never gave Soo-ah a decent present.

92
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,359
What's that smell?

93
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,902
It's gimbap!

94
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,696
Hands off. It's for Tae-hyun.

95
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,657
You're so stingy. I won't eat!

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,450
Don't.

97
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,495
You never even cooked ramyun for us,

98
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,289
and you're cooking all kinds of things
for Tae-hyun.

99
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,375
That's so not fair.

100
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:58,960
Right, Dong-goo?

101
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,088
What is it this time?

102
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,342
I never made gimbap for Soo-ah.

103
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:10,179
How many guys make gimbap
for their girlfriends?

104
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,514
Right, Doo-sik?

105
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,770
Shouldn't you ask first
if I ever had a girlfriend?

106
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,399
-Sorry.
-You're so mean.

107
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,474
Seo-jin, what are you doing
standing there?

108
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,561
Nothing. Your nose is bleeding.

109
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,732
Maybe it's from stress at work.
I've been getting a lot of nosebleeds.

110
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,275
I see.

111
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,572
I'm almost done. Wait just a bit.

112
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,159
Okay. Take your time. I have to study.

113
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,757
And so...

114
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,510
Period.

115
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,346
I'm done.

116
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,972
What's that?

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,642
This? It's gimbap.

118
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,227
You made it for me?

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,938
Yes. You should try some.

120
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,314
I bet it's good.

121
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,404
Seo-jin, gimbap tastes best
when eaten by hand.

122
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,157
It looks tasty.

123
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,121
It's so delicious.

124
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,040
Try one. Open up.

125
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,212
No. I can feed myself.

126
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,756
Seo-jin, I want to feed you.

127
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,883
Come on, open up.

128
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,886
There you go. Good girl.

129
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,054
Good for you.

130
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,305
You're so cute.

131
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,766
What's that?

132
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,354
I didn't see anything.
Was there something there?

133
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,565
I guess I was mistaken.

134
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,692
You're so cute.

135
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,487
You cute little trickster.

136
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,574
Seo-jin, just one means
I don't care enough.

137
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,368
Have another one. Open wide.

138
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,704
-No, it's really okay.
-Come on.

139
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,088
Can't we watch something else?

140
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,883
Leave me alone.
It feels new each time I watch.

141
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,930
I'm out of tissue.

142
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,895
Don't you touch the remote.

143
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,106
Damn you.

144
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,318
-I'm home.
-Hey, welcome home, Chewbacca.

145
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,694
How did the date go?

146
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,321
So-so.

147
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,573
Why the long face after a date?
Did you fight?

148
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,199
It's not that.

149
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,328
I think Tae-hyun has a weird habit.

150
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,538
-What is it?
-He picks his nose too much.

151
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,750
We all pick our noses once in a while.
That's no big deal.

152
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,668
It's not not a big deal.

153
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,421
He picked his nose,
ate gimbap without washing his hand,

154
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,298
fed me and pinched my cheek--

155
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,593
Chewbacca... you're really selfish.

156
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,844
I am not.

157
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,598
Tae-hyun accepts your facial hair.
Are you upset he picks his nose?

158
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,060
It's not the same.
Mine's a condition and his is a habit.

159
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,520
Whatever.
If it bothers you that much, tell him.

160
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,981
Can I? What if he gets angry?

161
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,192
He accepts your facial hair.
He'll accept this.

162
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,069
That's my seat.

163
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,948
What now? What is it this time, huh?

164
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,867
We're out of toilet tissue.

165
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,702
Oh, my gosh.

166
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,038
-I really have a headache.
-Dong-goo.

167
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,666
I cooked porridge. Have some.

168
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,917
I'm not hungry.

169
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,044
How long can you keep this up?

170
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,338
You haven't eaten or slept in days.
You'll die.

171
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,592
Just leave me alone. I don't want to live.

172
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,303
You're a nutcase. You're crazy.

173
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,264
You're risking your life
for someone like Soo-ah?

174
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,517
What?

175
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,228
"Someone like Soo-ah"?

176
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,271
Are you done talking?

177
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,898
What did I say?

178
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,444
She might not have meant much to you,
but, to me, it was real love.

179
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,615
To me, Soo-ah is a memory
I'll never forget until I die!

180
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,409
A wound that'll never heal, okay?

181
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,791
How dare you yell at me? Hey!

182
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,280
What are you doing here alone?

183
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,407
Nothing much.

184
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,915
It's tough, isn't it?

185
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:36,714
A sudden breakup is really painful.
I know what it's like.

186
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,467
But, Dong-goo...

187
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,180
right now it might hurt like crazy,
but you forget about it in time.

188
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,514
-So--
-No.

189
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,016
Not for me.

190
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,562
I'll never forget Soo-ah
after ten, even 100 years.

191
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:52,897
Why not?

192
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,566
I didn't do anything for her.

193
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,902
I regret that so much.

194
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,239
Do you know what I regret the most?

195
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,496
Even our breakup wasn't beautiful.

196
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,333
If I could meet her again just once,

197
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,046
I'd like to make our breakup
beautiful for her.

198
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,133
That's what I'd like to do.

199
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,697
What are you doing here?

200
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,242
I came to ask for a favor.

201
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,535
What favor?

202
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,121
-Could you meet up with Dong-goo?
-Why should I?

203
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,207
He's struggling so much right now.

204
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,210
He can't eat or sleep and just cries.

205
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,714
-What does that have to do with me?
-You two dated for four years.

206
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,801
You can't just break up like this.

207
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,387
-So for one last time--
-Forget it.

208
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,848
I'm not interested.
Bye. I have to work.

209
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,771
Don't be like this.
Do this and save a life, please?

210
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,648
Soo-ah.

211
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,569
Come on.

212
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,404
Soo-ah. Soo-ah.

213
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,699
Come on, Soo-ah. Just this once.

214
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,326
Forget about it and just go home.

215
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,161
Soo-ah.

216
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,248
Please, don't do this.
Meet up with him just once.

217
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,709
Soo-ah! Soo-ah!

218
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,806
You're staring.
Is something on my face?

219
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,392
No, it's nothing.

220
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,060
Almost done. Wait just a bit.

221
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,062
Okay.

222
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,900
NOSE

223
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,700
NOSE

224
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,121
NOSE

225
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,046
-Tae-hyun.
-You scared me. What is it?

226
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,091
I'm really sorry.
Can you not pick your nose?

227
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,554
Sorry, I didn't even realize.

228
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,556
Please, please...

229
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,059
No...

230
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,854
Can you not roll and flick it either?

231
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,107
Okay, sorry.

232
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,237
I thought hard about saying this.

233
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,741
-I must say it today.
-Okay.

234
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,161
-Do you know you're a serious nose-picker?
-Really?

235
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,373
You are.
You said you get nosebleeds often.

236
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,999
It's not without reason.

237
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,752
Your nose bleeds
because you're always picking it.

238
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,421
It must be a subconscious thing.
I'm really sorry.

239
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,510
It's okay. You can change habits.

240
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,931
You aren't mad, are you?

241
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,935
I'm not. How could I be
when you're being caring?

242
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,103
I'm so relieved.

243
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,480
Shall we get a beer somewhere?

244
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,316
-Let's go.
-Okay.

245
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,616
Dong-goo, over here.

246
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,828
Why did you want to see me?

247
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,164
There's this girl I worked with
at a convenience store.

248
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,125
She kept asking me to get her a date.

249
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,836
-So?
-"So"? I'm setting you up.

250
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,213
You forget a woman with another woman.

251
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,506
-So--
-Are you crazy?

252
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,926
-What's wrong?
-Do you think I'm that shallow?

253
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,054
My chest still hurts
whenever I think of Soo-ah.

254
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm not ready to let her go,
and I don't want to, okay?

255
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,852
-You little--
-You can't just leave.

256
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,353
-Just say hi.
-You're crazy.

257
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,939
-There she is. Min-ah, over here.
-What?

258
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,700
Min-ah, this is the friend
I mentioned, Kang Dong-goo.

259
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,326
Hello.

260
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,828
I'm Lee Min-ah.

261
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,829
Hello.

262
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,208
I'm just staying to say hi.
Don't do this again.

263
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,918
What? Okay.

264
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,589
Doo-sik told me a lot about you.

265
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,757
Did he, now?

266
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,301
-Hey.
-What?

267
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,678
Shall we get coffee?

268
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,097
Why don't we go and get a drink?

269
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,390
-Shall we?
-Min-ah.

270
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,852
I think Dong-goo should go home.

271
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,981
He only just broke up with his girlfriend
and doesn't want to meet anyone.

272
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,068
Oh, I see.

273
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,653
That's okay. It can't be helped.

274
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,157
Dong-goo, I'm sorry
I didn't consider your feelings.

275
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,368
Go home. Get some rest.

276
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,162
Rest up, okay?

277
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,246
Okay.

278
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,957
It was nice meeting you.
See you around.

279
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,795
You buy grilled shellfish. Deal?

280
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,796
Deal.

281
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,256
How have you been? You never called.

282
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,095
Hey, Kang Dong-goo,

283
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,846
why did you turn around?

284
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,348
You think you lost out?

285
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,517
You just broke up with Soo-ah.

286
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,143
Wake up.

287
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,816
It sounds delicious.

288
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,609
What shall we eat?

289
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,861
Perilla leaves? Perilla-leaf pasta?

290
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,406
Tae-hyun. Not again.

291
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,911
-Sorry.
-You're helpless.

292
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,248
You need an extreme solution.

293
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,458
An extreme solution?

294
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,924
Seo-jin, do I really have to do this?

295
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,051
There's no other way to break your habit.

296
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,469
What? Do you mind?

297
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,429
No. I'll do it.

298
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,806
A toast?

299
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,058
Just a moment.

300
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,769
-Here.
-Cheers!

301
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,192
Cheers.

302
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,905
Eat up.

303
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,202
-Sorry.
-Hey.

304
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,453
Dong-goo.

305
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,830
You came here?

306
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,291
Yes. Min-ah wanted grilled shellfish.

307
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,500
Why are you here?

308
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,254
I wanted to gather my thoughts
over some soju.

309
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,547
-You alone?
-Yes.

310
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,048
-At a shellfish place?
-Yes. Why?

311
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,051
I come here alone two or three times
a week. Is that weird?

312
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,387
Do you want to join us?

313
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,514
-May I?
-No, Min-ah.

314
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,933
Dong-goo wants to think on his own.

315
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,436
He's been going through a lot lately.

316
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,149
Dong-goo, don't you mind us.
Drink all you want.

317
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,692
Go ahead.

318
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,110
Okay, thanks.

319
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,863
Bye.

320
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,157
Cheers.

321
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,164
-What would you like?
-A soju and some shellfish.

322
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,916
That's a lot for one person.

323
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,335
I eat that much
two or three times a week.

324
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,628
Get it for me.

325
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,925
Damn it. Why is there so much?

326
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,344
I'm not getting anywhere.

327
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,929
I'll open it for you.

328
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,807
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

329
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,103
Wasn't that guy just so unlucky?

330
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,565
How can someone be that dimwitted?

331
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,360
-Who is he?
-Lee Joon-ki, my housemate.

332
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,906
I bet he was born without a clue.

333
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,157
He's so slow.

334
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,909
-Here's some soju.
-Thanks.

335
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,499
-That was so good. Shall we go now?
-Shall we?

336
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,171
-You're leaving, too?
-Yes. I was just about to leave.

337
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,257
You have a lot of leftovers.

338
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,884
That? I'll have it wrapped up for Sol.

339
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,386
You feed Sol shellfish?

340
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,221
A four-month-old infant?

341
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,557
I can grind it up for her.

342
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,726
Ma'am, can you pack this for me?

343
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,575
Not again, Tae-hyun!

344
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,119
You pick whenever I'm away.

345
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,582
Isn't this too much, though?

346
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,209
Why is it too much?

347
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,545
I'll smack you
whenever you pick your nose.

348
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,380
I got it. You can stop now.

349
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,132
Why should I stop?

350
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,802
You think so little of me
that you pick right away.

351
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,554
You never listen to what I say.

352
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,972
Will you please stop?

353
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,473
Why are you upset?

354
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,434
Is it a crime to pick my nose?

355
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,811
I'm doing this for your sake.

356
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,522
Your nose is always bleeding
and it's poor hygiene.

357
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,440
To be honest...

358
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,484
it's unpleasant to look at.

359
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,486
Unpleasant?

360
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,326
You grow a beard.

361
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,995
Why would you bring that up now?

362
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,621
I accepted your facial hair.

363
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,914
Why can't you accept me?

364
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,166
This isn't the same.

365
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,002
I have a condition and you have a habit.

366
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,463
I have a condition
where I get lots of boogers.

367
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,380
What?

368
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,548
To be frank,

369
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,301
what's weirder,
your beard or my nose-picking?

370
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,137
Want to find out? Shall I ask around?

371
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:32,267
Excuse me.
This woman grows a beard.

372
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,936
Which is weirder, nose-picking
or a woman's beard?

373
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,397
Stop it! You're being embarrassing.

374
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,816
I'm what? Do I embarrass you?

375
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,445
You embarrass me, too.
Do you know why?

376
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,031
If we're out on a date,
as the day goes on,

377
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,701
your stubble grows like this
and I can see the new growth.

378
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,288
It is so painful...

379
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,124
to kiss you.

380
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,753
When I get home after we kiss,
I have to put on cream.

381
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,505
That sight...

382
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,006
I put up with that.

383
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,344
Why do you make me feel so miserable
just because I pick my nose?

384
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,262
If it bothered you so much,

385
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,139
how did you manage to keep quiet?

386
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,432
You're small-minded.

387
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,600
I'm small-minded?

388
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,561
Are you done talking?

389
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,315
Yes, I called you small-minded.
You're way too small-minded for a guy.

390
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,068
Yes, I'm small-minded.
So what? You're hairy.

391
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,487
Hairy?

392
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,571
Booger Boy!

393
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,657
-"Booger Boy"?
-Yes, Booger Boy!

394
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,866
Don't call me that.

395
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,118
You're Huam-dong Hairy.

396
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,285
"Huam-dong Hairy"?

397
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,247
-Wangsimni's Booger Boy!
-Wangsim--!

398
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,415
Don't mock my neighborhood.

399
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,209
I can't stand that. Let's break up.

400
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,544
Fine, let's break up.

401
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,045
Don't call me again, Booger Boy.

402
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,214
Don't you call me, Huam-dong Hairy.

403
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,590
I can't hear you, Booger.

404
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,092
-Booger, Booger.
-Hairy, Hairy.

405
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,677
-Hairy, Hairy...
-I can't hear you.

406
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,512
Will you please keep quiet?

407
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,391
My goodness!

408
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,434
You're still here?

409
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,313
Will you meet up with Dong-goo
one last time?

410
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,858
Why are you doing this?
Did he send you?

411
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,819
-No.
-Why are you doing this?

412
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:10,407
I know what it's like
to not say goodbye properly

413
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,367
to someone you love.

414
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,121
Meet him just one last time.

415
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,206
I beg of you.

416
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:20,917
No, thanks.

417
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:25,672
I don't want to see him again,
so don't waste your time.

418
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,467
You're really mean.

419
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,470
Soo-ah...

420
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,724
if you keep doing this,
I really won't accept it.

421
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,643
Then...

422
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,314
what will you do?

423
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,776
-Damn it.
-Hey!

424
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,320
My bag!

425
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,741
What is wrong with her? Hey!

426
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,453
I really enjoyed that.

427
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,537
You're welcome.

428
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,539
Don't forget the blind date on Friday.

429
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,791
-Okay.
-What? A blind date?

430
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,460
He's setting her up already?

431
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,379
How could he
when I didn't get her number?

432
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,841
Wait a minute.
Why do I want her number?

433
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,927
Am I really interested in her?

434
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,263
Wake up. Get a grip, Kang Dong-goo.

435
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,230
Hey, are you still here?

436
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,148
What's the matter?

437
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,359
I think something got stuck
between my teeth.

438
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,485
Do you have a business card?

439
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,903
Why do you need one?

440
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,739
They're ideal for removing food
stuck between teeth.

441
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,115
When I have stuck food,

442
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,076
I get so bothered, I have a fit.

443
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,494
-I didn't know.
-Okay.

444
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,079
Min-ah, got a business card?

445
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,997
I have one right here.

446
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:41,915
Here you go.

447
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,166
PIG'S MOM

448
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,544
This is a precious card
that Pig's Mom gave you.

449
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,837
I can't use it.

450
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,673
No? Wait, I have another one.

451
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:50,966
Don't you have one?

452
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,884
A business card? Hang on.

453
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,927
My business cards...

454
00:25:56,096 --> 00:26:00,058
Here's one. It's from my old job.
If you don't mind--

455
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,854
This is perfect! This corner.
It's my favorite kind of corner.

456
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,482
This is the best angle for tooth-picking.

457
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,317
These are hard to come by.

458
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,320
-I'm glad you like it.
-Carry on, then.

459
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,199
I found one.

460
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,242
What's up with him?

461
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:25,292
That was so natural.
It was brilliant. Perfect.

462
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,923
Yoon-ah, please, stop!

463
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,759
Only if you say you'll meet with Dong-goo.

464
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,177
Damn you!

465
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,934
Give me my bag before I get nasty.

466
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,937
I can't until you say
you'll meet with Dong-goo.

467
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,647
Why are you doing this?

468
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,026
You can't do this to someone
you really loved.

469
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,361
Will you just meet with him?

470
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,405
Okay, I will.

471
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,282
You will?

472
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,576
-Where is he?
-He'll be at the guesthouse.

473
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,162
Let's go.

474
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,460
It's me, Kang Dong-goo,
your blind date.

475
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,505
Just to ask if you got home safely.

476
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,008
It was good to meet you today.

477
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,178
Soo-ah.

478
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,348
You went on a blind date?

479
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,267
No, I-- What's she doing here?

480
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,395
You said you wanted nothing more
than to see her again.

481
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,231
But that was--
Soo-ah, what happened was--

482
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,525
Dong-goo, can we talk?

483
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,818
What?

484
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,446
Yes. Okay.

485
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,917
You're mistaken, I swear.

486
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:54,631
I didn't want to meet anyone,
but Doo-sik called me over.

487
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,132
I'd lost my mind for a bit.

488
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,719
I'm sorry, Soo-ah.

489
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,930
Dong-goo...

490
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,725
you don't need to feel bad.

491
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,478
I don't deserve an apology.

492
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,609
For the past four years,
I'm grateful that you liked me.

493
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,610
I was happy.

494
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,946
-But--
-Stop.

495
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,867
What-- what are you about to say?
Get angry.

496
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:28,665
If you do, I can't hold on to you.
It'll feel like it's really over.

497
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,296
Soo-ah, I'll be good to you.

498
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,382
I'll treat you a hundred times better
than he does.

499
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,467
-Soo-ah, don't--
-Dong-goo.

500
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,761
You treated me well enough already.

501
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,806
It's not your fault we ended up like this.

502
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,808
It's all my fault.

503
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,185
I changed.

504
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,480
But you know,

505
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,858
I'm so happy these days with Yoon-seok.

506
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,279
You should forget about me.

507
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,781
I want you to be happy.

508
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,998
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dong-goo.

509
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,376
I'm really sorry.

510
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,093
Thank you so much

511
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,262
for liking me.

512
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,395
I have to go.

513
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,901
You live for tomorrow.

514
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,322
Those who live for tomorrow
fall to those who have no tomorrow.

515
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,491
I live only for today.

516
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,411
Do you know how much that sucks?

517
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,040
I'll show you.

518
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,879
Leave your resume there.

519
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,214
Okay.

520
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,555
I'm Lee Joon-ki, an aspiring actor.

521
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,764
Please remember me.

522
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,481
I hope your film sells
10 million tickets.

523
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,033
ARE YOU STILL DREAMING?

524
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,164
I'm home.

525
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,666
Where'd you go all dressed up?

526
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,836
I got some exercise
and handed out my resume.

527
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,838
So what if you hand out your resume?

528
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,965
You're in the background
with no dialogue.

529
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,508
It's a waste of paper.

530
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,343
-A waste.
-What, you brat?

531
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,971
How can you say that to a friend
who worked all morning?

532
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:35,268
That's why your first love
called you "Huam-dong Hairy."

533
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,270
I told you not to say that.

534
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,564
-Don't say it, okay?
-Not again.

535
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,483
Can you not fight around our guests?

536
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,527
-Kang Seo-jin.
-Let go of me.

537
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,113
What's the camera for?
What's the occasion?

538
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,532
-I have a shoot tomorrow.
-A shoot?

539
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,660
-What shoot?
-I'm helping Tae-sik.

540
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,995
Why are you working?

541
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,496
To make money.

542
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,165
Money? Is something wrong?

543
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,959
What? Nothing's wrong.

544
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,713
I broke up with Soo-ah.

545
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,179
She met someone nice.
I should let her go.

546
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,351
What does breaking up
have to do with making money?

547
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:20,355
Now that Soo-ah's gone,
movies are all I have left.

548
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,857
I should grow up and concentrate on that.

549
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,612
Hey, I'm going to save up enough
in a year to make a film about us.

550
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,948
Joon-ki, brush up on your acting.

551
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,825
You, put a scenario together, okay?

552
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,205
Kang Dong-goo the bulldozer is back.

553
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,832
Are you going to use the plot
you talked about?

554
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,043
Reincarnation
as the son of America's president?

555
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,973
I wonder how many days
it'll last this time.

556
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,019
Why are you sighing?

557
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,355
What is it? Is something wrong?

558
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,317
Seo-jin, do you have a dream?

559
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,319
A dream? I do.

560
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,365
To be a journalist.
That's been my dream since I was a kid.

561
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,411
I've failed so many times,
I can't even remember how many.

562
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,870
Why did you ask?

563
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,664
I'm envious.

564
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,874
Everyone has a dream.

565
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,670
Dong-goo and Joon-ki. Doo-sik and you.

566
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,339
What's to envy? Don't you have a dream?

567
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,384
I had one,
but it's pointless in my situation.

568
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,177
What does your situation
have to do with it?

569
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,846
You know the mess I'm in.

570
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,806
I have Sol.

571
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,810
Yoon-ah, have you ever heard
of Joanne Rowling?

572
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,312
She was divorced with a child.

573
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,315
Her only income
was a weekly stipend of 15,000 won

574
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,943
and she watered down her kid's formula,
she was so poor.

575
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,612
Do you know what she wrote
in those dire circumstances?

576
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,117
The Harry Potter series.

577
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,494
"I'm in a bad spot. I have no time."

578
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,538
"I can't because my parents aren't rich."

579
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,790
Those are all excuses.

580
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,668
Now talk to me. What's your dream?

581
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,714
I'll help you out if it's hard.
What do you want to be?

582
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,091
A rapper.

583
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,968
A rapper?

584
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,638
You mean a rapper, like Dok2 or BewhY?

585
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,599
Why? Is that weird?

586
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,895
It's not weird, just unexpected.
Can you rap?

587
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,480
A bit.

588
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,441
-Shall I give it a try?
-Sure.

589
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,243
The world in front of me is an illusion

590
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,578
A tasty meal

591
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,205
The best is the Prime Minister's Award

592
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,749
Or the Presidential Award?
Is that true?

593
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,959
Then you're a loser
Lingerie, odd one out

594
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,503
Misery

595
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,510
How was that?

596
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,804
Quite unique.

597
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,264
You could get better with practice.

598
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,518
Really? Should I go for it, then?

599
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,730
Of course. Why not? It's your dream.

600
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,984
Thanks, Seo-jin. If not for you,
I'd have kept it to myself forever.

601
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,029
-Thanks so much, Seo-jin.
-You're welcome.

602
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,489
Stay strong.

603
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,994
Wake up, Private Kim. You can't die.

604
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,288
Stay with me.

605
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,544
How are... Damn it.

606
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,422
You can't die, Private Kim.
We're almost at the fortress.

607
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,969
No! Private Kim!

608
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,512
You scumbags.

609
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,727
See you again in the afterlife.

610
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,987
-That's it, sir.
-About your audition.

611
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,574
You do know what
our film's about, don't you?

612
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,783
Yes, Director.

613
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,955
-Isn't it about the armed forces?
-No. It's about swimmers.

614
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:06,956
And Park Tae-hwan.

615
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,875
Swimming, the Olympics, youth.

616
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,126
I apologize.

617
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,919
I've attended so many auditions.

618
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,047
-I'll give it another go.
-No, you needn't bother.

619
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,799
-You can go.
-Pardon?

620
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,969
Director, give me another shot.

621
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,304
I'm a great swimmer.

622
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,764
I'll take any role and even no pay.

623
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,225
Please, I'll do anything.

624
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,268
Please!

625
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,437
Can you take off your clothes, then?

626
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,649
Pardon? Why should I do that?

627
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,193
The film's about swimmers.

628
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,237
You need to be in good shape
if I'm to cast you at all.

629
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,239
Yes, right, I'll strip.

630
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,118
Wait, wait.

631
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,244
Is that all hair?

632
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,413
Yes, it is.

633
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,248
-Are your legs hairy, too?
-Yes.

634
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,168
-I have a lot of testosterone.
-You're out.

635
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,920
-What?
-Zip your zipper and go.

636
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,004
Why?

637
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,089
Have you ever seen a hairy swimmer?

638
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,635
To reduce resistance,
swimmers shave their armpits,

639
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,596
even their heads,
even their nether regions.

640
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,227
I'll shave.

641
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,605
Apart from my head,
I'll shave every other part.

642
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,606
Don't worry, Director.

643
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
So, this is where they get waxed.

644
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,140
Do I have to go this far? This is insane.

645
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,017
What's this?

646
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,602
Why is this torn apart?

647
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,563
-My goodness.
-Hello.

648
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,315
Hi. Who are you?

649
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,984
I'm your waxer.

650
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,986
You're going to do me?

651
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,321
You needn't be embarrassed.

652
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,657
A lot of men get waxed.

653
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,825
Really?

654
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,619
I don't have much time. Let's do it.

655
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,329
I'll begin. Lie down.

656
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,540
Shall I put this away?

657
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,792
Hold on to it. You'll need it.

658
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,044
You can take off your robe.

659
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,638
I'll get started.

660
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,684
Try to withstand the pain.

661
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,649
I'm taking it off.

662
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,610
What was that?

663
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,540
That's why this was on the bed.

664
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,630
BRUCE LEE IS PRESIDENT

665
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,051
REFRESH

666
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,886
Are you manipulating the number of views?

667
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,304
Must you go that far?

668
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,056
Everyone else does.

669
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,517
Why are the numbers so low?

670
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,394
-Hey.
-What?

671
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,146
-Lend me your ID.
-What for?

672
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,064
To post a comment.

673
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,732
No, thanks.

674
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,320
Seo-jin, I wrote a new song.

675
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,322
-Will you listen?
-What?

676
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,699
You wrote a song?

677
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,786
A song? What song?

678
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,413
See, Yoon-ah's dream
is to become a rapper.

679
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,664
A rapper?

680
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,541
Can you rap?

681
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,876
Yes.

682
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,670
I wrote a song with Seo-jin in mind.

683
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:42,797
Will you listen to it?

684
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,590
Sure. Why not?

685
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,467
I didn't know you had this talent.

686
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,304
-Drop the beat.
-Okay.

687
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,064
Your eyes are that of a hawk

688
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,566
A hawk searching for a scoop

689
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,485
If you're hungry, it's afternoon

690
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,696
Deceive my eyes, show how you feel

691
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,864
You can't hide

692
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,992
I'll find you if I see you
Beat you if I catch you

693
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,078
If you're afraid, don't move

694
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,753
-How was it?
-What?

695
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,214
That was nice.

696
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,343
It's unique
and there's a grotesque charm to it.

697
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:30,970
Really?

698
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,472
-Do you want to hear one more?
-No.

699
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,684
The thing is, I have to shower.

700
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,186
I'll listen to it later. Later.

701
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,240
Seo-jin, I'll begin.

702
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,328
My name is Han Yoon-ah

703
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,748
That's Yoon-ah Han in English

704
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,210
Your name is Kang Seo-jin

705
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,255
The other way round, it's Jin Seo Kang

706
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,507
Gosh.

707
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,593
What a scare.

708
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,971
Isn't rapping a stretch at that level?

709
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,311
What are you doing? Get out!

710
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,438
Sorry. You should've made a noise.

711
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,689
How can I when I'm showering?

712
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,193
Hang on.

713
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,489
Joon-ki! What's this? What happened?

714
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,907
It's nothing.

715
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,617
How is this nothing?

716
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,577
-It's really nothing.
-Let me see.

717
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,995
Where did it all go?

718
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,456
-It's just how you feel.
-Let's see. Where'd it go?

719
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,416
-Stop turning me around.
-Why are you so bare?

720
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,671
What? A Brazilian wax?

721
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,340
Why'd you get one?

722
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,050
The director told me to.

723
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,885
Or he won't give me a role.

724
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,971
You've gone all sorts of crazy.
What's your role?

725
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,973
-A swimmer's arm.
-Damn you.

726
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,976
You don't even have a name,
which means you have no lines.

727
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,978
A swimmer's arm is a big deal.

728
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,189
There's even "Swimmer 28," okay?

729
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,232
Really?

730
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,651
That's impressive. There are 28 swimmers?

731
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,027
Be quiet!

732
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,113
Ji-soo! It's Ji-soo.

733
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,157
Hello? Hi, Ji-soo.

734
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,492
Yes, it's Joon-ki.

735
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,744
Tomorrow? I'm free. Why?

736
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,579
With your mother?

737
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,998
Yes, of course I can, sure.

738
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,209
Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye.

739
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,294
You met someone already?

740
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,921
How many days will she last?

741
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,257
We're really serious, okay?

742
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,300
I'm meeting her mother for dinner.

743
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,595
Really? It must be serious this time.

744
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,264
It is.

745
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,767
It's completely different
from my other relationships.

746
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,395
Dong-goo, when you were dating Soo-ah,

747
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,105
is this how your heart was like?

748
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,527
Yes. I guess.

749
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,239
-Joon-ki.
-What?

750
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,911
I just made a passing question. Sorry.

751
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,955
It's fine. Why apologize?

752
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,418
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

753
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,586
You're a moron.

754
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,505
You're so clueless.

755
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,632
Why did you mention Soo-ah?

756
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,011
It wasn't on purpose.
Why are you making a fuss when he's fine?

757
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,388
He doesn't look fine.

758
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,725
-He's fine. Worry about yourself.
-Thanks a lot.

759
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,858
DELETE PHOTO?

760
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,000
What are you doing up here?

761
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,629
Sitting still.

762
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,006
Were you thinking about Soo-ah?

763
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,511
Isn't it hard?

764
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,972
You don't have to tell me what it's like.

765
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,977
I also know nothing I can say
will offer comfort.

766
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,273
I prepared something.

767
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,903
What? What is it?

768
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,537
The pain of parting in your heart?
Tears flow

769
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,624
Even if she's lonely or sad
Candy never cries

770
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,042
Neither does Dong-goo

771
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,920
What are you doing? Why are you rapping?

772
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,631
Look into my eyes, red sun

773
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:39,051
Soo-ah, forget about her
Soo-ah, delete her

774
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,554
Will you stop it? Why are you rapping?
Are you crazy?

775
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,514
Just run

776
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,307
Run towards your dream

777
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,142
Just keep going, but where to?

778
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,436
Will you stop it? Why are you rapping?

779
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,189
You're really weird.
Why are you rapping?

780
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,691
-It's not that. Come here.
-Stop.

781
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,610
-Leave me alone.
-Wait.

782
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,870
Where's Joon-ki?

783
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,082
He left all dressed up
to meet his girlfriend's mom.

784
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,500
Oh, right.

785
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,960
You have work today?

786
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,004
I'm filming a first birthday party.
You going to the library?

787
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,798
Yes, for a study group.

788
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,633
What's up with that woman?

789
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,761
She dreams of being a rapper.

790
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,763
A rapper? With those skills?

791
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,766
I told her to try it.
She's driving me mad.

792
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,726
You gave her the idea?

793
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,313
Hey, even if it is just a dream,
isn't that too much?

794
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,857
Stop her before it's too late.

795
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,775
Who knows what she'll do next?

796
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,986
She's so sincere. I can't tell her.

797
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,155
That's your problem. I have to go.

798
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,824
-Take one more.
-No, thanks.

799
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,211
Ji-soo bragged about
her boyfriend so much,

800
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,880
I wondered what you were like.

801
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,592
You're as handsome and well-mannered
as she said you were.

802
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,801
You're flattering me.

803
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,095
Gosh, you're humble, too?

804
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,055
Thank you, ma'am.

805
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,850
-Just a moment.
-Take your time.

806
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:10,851
Hello?

807
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,687
Really? Okay, I'll be right there.

808
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,481
I'm so sorry.

809
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,901
Something urgent came up
and I have to go.

810
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,818
I'm sorry.

811
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,612
-That's fine.
-Bye.

812
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,447
-Take care, ma'am.
-Bye.

813
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,823
-I won't go far.
-Okay.

814
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,992
-I'm Lee Joon-ki.
-Gosh.

815
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,208
I guess I was really nervous.

816
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,335
My legs almost gave way.

817
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,004
How did I do?

818
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,840
I think my mom adores you.

819
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,091
Really?

820
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,512
That's such a relief. Well done, Joon-ki.

821
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,140
-What's taking her so long?
-Is someone joining us?

822
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,352
My sister got off work early
and wants to meet you.

823
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,979
Do I have to get all tense again?

824
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,358
-I'm sorry, sis.
-It's fine.

825
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,776
Joon-ki, say hi.

826
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,486
This is my sister Ji-min.

827
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,572
-I'm Lee Joon-ki.
-Hello.

828
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,372
I'm your waxer.

829
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,624
Wha...

830
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,752
What's wrong? Have you two met?

831
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,338
Well...

832
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,216
What is it? Why won't you say?

833
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,053
Did you two date or something?

834
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,722
-No, no.
-Gosh, no.

835
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,349
It's not that, no.

836
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,517
Then what is it?

837
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,352
What is it, Ji-min? You tell me.

838
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,773
The thing is, your boyfriend

839
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,650
came in to get waxed.

840
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,360
Joon-ki?

841
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,654
You got waxed?

842
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,785
Well... yes, for a film role. For work.

843
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,662
That's nothing at all.

844
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,914
As long as you didn't do it.

845
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,170
What?

846
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,672
No way.

847
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,175
Did you do it? You did him?

848
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,719
Say no.

849
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,263
The male waxer was out.

850
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,682
Ji-soo, it's not weird at all.

851
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,350
It's just work. It was work.

852
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,602
-Work.
-Work.

853
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,395
Work, work. Work.

854
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,064
Ji-soo.

855
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,692
Wait, Ji-soo. Ji-soo.

856
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,944
Just a moment. Wait.

857
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,904
I'm sorry.

858
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,700
I really had no idea she was your sister.

859
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,244
I had no choice. I wanted to get the role.

860
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,538
We haven't even held hands,

861
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,457
and my sister, she...

862
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,666
she saw all your parts.

863
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,709
My parts...

864
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,922
Come on.

865
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,927
-It was just work, okay?
-Okay.

866
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,138
But I'm not comfortable with it.

867
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,390
I want to go home.

868
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,893
But... Ji-soo.

869
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,186
Ji-soo! Wait!

870
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,355
This is insane.

871
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,274
Why did that woman have to be her sister?

872
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,609
Why me?

873
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,278
Damn it all.

874
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,533
-Are you all ready?
-Kind of.

875
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,952
You took a long break.
Could you have lost your touch?

876
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,164
I'm Kang Dong-goo.
You know how good I am.

877
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,918
Why not work in the film industry?
Why do this instead?

878
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,462
Did you give up on film?

879
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,172
No, I'll go back soon.

880
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,675
But I need money.

881
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,968
Right. Don't give up like me.

882
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,887
Take it all the way, okay?

883
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,972
Okay. Thanks.

884
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,309
Min-seo, stop crying.

885
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,686
It's almost time for the party.

886
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,605
Hey, are you just going to stand there
and take photos?

887
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,607
-The baby's crying.
-Pardon?

888
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,817
So what if it's crying?

889
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,486
Other photographers
try to make the baby laugh.

890
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,862
Do something.

891
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,073
I have to make the baby laugh?

892
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,075
-I'm no comedian.
-Oh, dear.

893
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,868
I'm so, so sorry, ma'am.

894
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,371
This is his first time on the job.
I apologize.

895
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,872
Just a moment.

896
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,710
What do you think you're doing?

897
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,962
What do I do about a crying baby?

898
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,215
Making the baby laugh
is more important than taking good photos.

899
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,133
Watch carefully.

900
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,220
Hi, Min-seo.

901
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,014
Look at me!

902
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,693
Peek-a-boo.

903
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,654
The baby's just adorable.

904
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,075
Did you see that?

905
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,785
That's what you do.

906
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,162
Now you try.

907
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,455
You want me to do that?

908
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:46,001
Do you think it's easy to make money?
If you won't do it, get packing.

909
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,962
No, no. I'll do it.

910
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,464
Don't mess up.

911
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,924
Nail it.

912
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,197
Seo-jin, can I borrow your laptop?

913
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,615
What for?

914
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,075
I want to apply for something online.

915
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,202
Apply for what?

916
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,205
I want to enter Show Me the Money.

917
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,290
What? Show Me the Money?

918
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,542
I want to ask the professionals
how good I am.

919
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,547
Yoon-ah, don't you think
you're being a bit too hasty?

920
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,507
I know that.

921
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,343
I'm not good enough
to be a professional,

922
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,054
but I don't think it's impossible.

923
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,641
Hey, Yoon-ah...

924
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,727
I didn't tell you
for fear of hurting your feelings.

925
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:46,770
You're useless.

926
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,522
What do you mean?

927
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,106
You're a disaster.

928
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,318
My rapping is that bad?

929
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,321
To be honest,
most people can do what you do.

930
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,239
Even I can.

931
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,324
I see.

932
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,368
That was it.

933
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,204
Why didn't you say so?

934
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,331
I'm sorry.

935
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:10,460
-I was afraid you'd get hurt.
-No. It's fine.

936
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,129
Don't mind me.

937
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,513
Was I too harsh?

938
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,976
I shouldn't have gotten her hopes up.
Oh, forget it.

939
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,397
It's all soggy.

940
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,524
-I'm starving.
-You're back.

941
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,818
What's wrong with you?

942
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,403
Don't ask.

943
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,864
Did you just cook that?

944
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,323
Can I have a bite?

945
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,370
Leave it.

946
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,873
Cook your own.

947
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,208
Didn't you eat with your girlfriend's mom?

948
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,670
Something came up and I didn't eat.
Let me have one bite.

949
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,048
I said no. Cook your own.

950
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,842
So unfair.

951
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,343
I just want a mouthful.

952
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,303
You grabbed that?

953
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,807
Hey. You're so strong.
Are you lifting weights?

954
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,935
-Hey.
-It's mine, I cooked it.

955
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,812
That's gross.

956
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,524
You wasted food.

957
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,984
What's that?

958
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,527
It's soaking in. Ouch!

959
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,499
-I'll kill you!
-I'm sorry.

960
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,001
-Hey!
-Sorry.

961
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,545
Is my life as a man over?

962
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,839
Doctor, save me. What should I do?

963
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,507
My life is over.

964
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,217
Kang Seo-jin!

965
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,096
Kang Seo-jin, you...

966
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,059
Don't just stand there. Do something.

967
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,185
Sorry.

968
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,604
Page the doctor again, will you?

969
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,314
She's on the way.

970
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,401
What is it that you paged me
right out of surgery?

971
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:02,739
The intern's too embarrassed
to treat the patient.

972
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,492
-Do you call yourself a doctor?
-Doctor.

973
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,661
I'll deal with you later.

974
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,413
What's the problem you can't deal with?

975
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,334
-Joon-ki?
-Who are you?

976
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,213
It's me. Ji-soo's mom.

977
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,506
Mom, do something.

978
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,882
My goodness!

979
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,011
Ma'am.

980
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,347
What are you doing here?

981
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,640
I'm a doctor here.

982
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,434
What happened to you?

983
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,269
He spilled hot ramyun.

984
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,314
Oh, dear me.

985
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,774
Let's see the state of you.

986
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,025
No, ma'am.

987
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,487
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

988
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,863
I'm really okay.

989
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,991
I'd like to get going.

990
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,704
You're not okay at all.
You're in no state to leave.

991
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,038
Ma'am, no.

992
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,957
I'm really okay, ma'am.

993
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:58,545
I'm a doctor before I'm Ji-soo's mom.

994
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,380
-Nurse, hold him down.
-Okay.

995
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,382
Hold me down? Where? Why?

996
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,675
Why?

997
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,093
Hold still.

998
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,012
No, no!

999
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,556
No, ma'am, please, no.

1000
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,682
-Ma'am.
-Stay still.

1001
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,642
-Ma'am, no!
-I have to look.

1002
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,853
No, don't look!

1003
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,146
Don't!

1004
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,583
What is this?

1005
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,004
I'm sorry.

1006
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,809
I wondered why. It's rare for ramyun
to cause that bad a burn.

1007
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,020
-So that was the reason.
-Yes.

1008
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,063
Oh, dear.

1009
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,106
The treatment's done.

1010
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,234
-You can go home.
-Thank you... ma'am.

1011
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,240
Joon-ki.

1012
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,660
Ji-soo.

1013
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,621
Hello.

1014
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:17,957
I have to do my rounds. See you.

1015
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,668
I'll wait outside, then.

1016
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,799
Ji-soo.

1017
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,510
Joon-ki, why are you doing this to me?

1018
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,262
My sister waxed you

1019
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,680
and now my mom...

1020
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,266
Are you going to show it
to my whole family?

1021
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,228
How am I to face my mom and sister now?

1022
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,897
-It's not like that.
-Forget it.

1023
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,399
I don't want to hear it. Let's break up.

1024
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,902
What? You want to break up?

1025
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,029
-What do you mean?
-I'm sorry.

1026
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,531
I can't stand it.

1027
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,283
Goodbye.

1028
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,161
Don't say goodbye. Ji-soo.

1029
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,121
Ji-soo.

1030
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,959
Ji-soo. Ji-soo.

1031
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,672
Wait, Ji-soo. Ji-soo.

1032
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,508
Ji-soo! Hear me out.

1033
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,968
Ji-soo!

1034
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,719
Ji-soo!

1035
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,940
Three little bears live in a house

1036
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,318
Daddy bear, Mommy bear, Baby bear

1037
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,240
What are you doing?

1038
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,658
He's crying even more.

1039
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,327
-Do something else.
-Something else? I'll try again.

1040
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:08,735
Min-seo, thank you
for coming to Mom and Dad.

1041
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,988
Happy birthday
and I love you forever.

1042
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:35,011
So, you hit your head until it bled?

1043
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,976
It was the only thing
the kid would laugh at.

1044
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,479
It's hard to make a living.

1045
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:45,980
It's so hard.

1046
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:50,568
Ji-soo, listen to me. Just listen.

1047
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,779
Don't hang up, no, Ji-soo.

1048
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,280
I didn't do it on purpose.

1049
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,866
Will you please hear me out? Ji-soo.

1050
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,995
She broke up with you?

1051
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,497
Yes.

1052
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,041
Why did you get waxed?

1053
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,586
An extra like me has to do as he's told.

1054
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,880
You'll find someone better.

1055
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,882
Cheer up.

1056
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,885
Breaking up with Ji-soo's one thing.

1057
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:20,974
Will I play minor roles my whole life?
It's so discouraging.

1058
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,476
Why would you say such a thing?

1059
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,730
Joon-ki, actor Hwang Jung-min
went unnoticed for 10 years.

1060
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,066
Kwak Do-won was unknown for almost 20.

1061
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,069
So what?
I should go unnoticed for 20 years?

1062
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:37,407
If you try hard, one day
you could become like them.

1063
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,951
You slack off, but you're not a bad actor.

1064
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:44,247
I'm not that bad, am I?

1065
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,873
Those who know know.

1066
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,627
Yes. Let's all cheer up.

1067
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,755
The sun will shine on us, too, one day.

1068
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,924
Yes, it will.

1069
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,136
But to cheer up, we need to eat.

1070
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,054
Let's eat. I'm starving.

1071
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,432
-Is there a beggar inside of you?
-When are you not hungry?

1072
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,600
Tell me.

1073
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,019
Muffins?

1074
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,023
This is dinner.

1075
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:13,318
I didn't feel like getting groceries,
so I baked these instead.

1076
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,694
Yoon-ah...

1077
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,821
are you still angry?

1078
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,615
No, I'm not angry.

1079
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,784
I'm in a great mood. I could fly.

1080
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:25,246
I see. Great. You're not angry.

1081
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,297
-Did you bake these?
-Why?

1082
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,049
Can you bake as well as I do?

1083
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,052
Does everyone bake this well?

1084
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,137
No. It's really delicious.

1085
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,931
Taste it, everyone. Go on.

1086
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,725
-Shall we?
-Okay.

1087
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,399
It's good.

1088
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,360
Did you bake these?

1089
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,237
It's much better than
what we get at the bakery.

1090
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,198
-Yes.
-Is it, really?

1091
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,824
It is.

1092
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:06,162
Yoon-ah, instead of rapping,
why don't you be a pastry chef?

1093
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,664
-A pastry chef?
-Yes.

1094
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,458
Becoming a pastry chef
was my second dream.

1095
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,086
Really? Then try that instead.

1096
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,714
Shall I? But I'm still
more interested in rapping...

1097
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,342
-Yoon-ah.
-Okay. I was kidding.

1098
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,679
-Is it really good?
-Yes.

1099
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,472
-Be a pastry chef.
-It's really tasty.

1100
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,808
-Really?
-You found your talent.

1101
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:27,934
Is it good?

1102
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,235
Okay, good.

1103
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,237
You look like the real deal.

1104
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,742
I like it. Very nice.

1105
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,913
See, you're all clean-shaven now
and you look the part.

1106
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,833
Thank you. I'll do my best.

1107
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,003
Wait, did you shave your armpits, too?

1108
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,048
Well done. Next!

1109
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:00,967
I did it!

1110
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,677
My goodness.

1111
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,764
Hey. Did you really shave your head, too?

1112
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:07,890
Yes, Director.

1113
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,437
I can go without hair
if it's to make the film look real.

1114
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,481
Good. I like that.

1115
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,358
This is the attitude I want.

1116
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,277
Director, Soo-hyun's here.

1117
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:20,987
-Is he?
-Yes.

1118
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,866
It's freezing. I'm cold.
Let's get this over with.

1119
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,326
Soo-hyun, didn't you get waxed?

1120
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,787
No. I hate the cold.

1121
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,831
I'll catch a cold without my hair.

1122
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,624
This is about swimmers.

1123
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,918
This won't look real.

1124
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:41,174
Come on. I'm playing a swimmer,
but I'm not a swimmer.

1125
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,885
If you want someone hairless,
cast someone else.

1126
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:45,845
No, no.

1127
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,347
Reality doesn't matter.

1128
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,766
Let's just go ahead.

1129
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,477
Why are these people so sleek?

1130
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,604
I stand out.

1131
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,022
I'll look bad later on.

1132
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,273
I can't let that happen.

1133
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,610
You're right. What should we do?

1134
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,988
We'll shoot you cheering now.

1135
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,992
You need to get emotional
and cheer for real, okay?

1136
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,243
-Okay.
-Okay.

1137
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,375
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

1138
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,797
Good luck!

1139
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,674
Good luck!

1140
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,972
-Yes!
-Yay!

1141
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,936
Good luck!

1142
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,927
This is awesome.

1143
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,096
Lee Joon-ki got a role!

1144
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,474
Guess who I'll work with?
Kim Hee-ja, okay? Kim Hee-ja.

1145
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,769
I can't stand jerks who think
someone has their back.

1146
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,522
-This is a rehearsal.
-What, a rehearsal?

1147
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,066
Don't go too far.

1148
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,901
He was admitted for four weeks.

1149
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,862
You can't do that
at someone else's birthday party.

1150
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,989
What if the other guests see?

1151
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,323
Jang-goon!

1152
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,242
This is really crazy.

1153
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,411
I passed! I got in!

1154
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,829
Our interview's unique.

1155
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,080
Do you have boyfriends?

1156
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,707
I like glamorous ladies.

1157
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,292
DAEMYUNG DAILY INTERVIEW

1158
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,837
If you want to drink that badly,
drink with your own sister.

1159
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,213
Hey, are you crazy?

1160
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,507
Let go while we're still just talking.

1161
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,970
Yoon-ah, as soon as you joined.

1162
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,431
What happened between you and Sol's dad?

1163
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,558
What a dramatic kind of life.

1164
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,184
Shall we track down Sol's dad?

1165
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,728
I'm here to see Han Yoon-ah.

1166
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,771
Hey. What are you doing here?
