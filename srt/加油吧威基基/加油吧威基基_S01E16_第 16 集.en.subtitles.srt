1
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,777
How long has it been?

2
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,821
So, you tricked me all this time?

3
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,157
We didn't do it on purpose...

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,493
We just knew you would be like this.

5
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,787
If you knew I'd be like this,
you shouldn't have even started!

6
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,624
Hey, Joon-ki and I really like each other.

7
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,126
-We do, for real. So why don't you--
-Shut up!

8
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,466
Just know
that I don't approve of this at all.

9
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,134
I mean, why not?

10
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,844
What's the reason?

11
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,972
You just can't, okay?
So stop this nonsense right now!

12
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,432
No.

13
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,851
Who are you to tell me what to do?

14
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,394
I'm an adult.

15
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,730
I'm not a child who needs
your approval to date.

16
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,817
Yeah, Dong-goo.
I can't give her up either.

17
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,361
So you're saying you guys
won't end this?

18
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,530
Okay.

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,741
Seo-jin, you are not my sister anymore.

20
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,870
You too, bro.
This is the end of our friendship.

21
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,122
Got it?

22
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,665
That's too much, man.

23
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,917
-They like each other.
-Are you taking sides?

24
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,669
You don't exist to me either.

25
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,587
Why are you being so childish?

26
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,172
Yes, I'm being childish. So what?

27
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,341
How about you, Soo-ah?
Are you on their side, too?

28
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,176
Yoon-ah, are you on their side as well?

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,762
Well, I...

30
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,014
By the way you're hesitating
I guess you are, too.

31
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,393
Okay, then. As far as I'm concerned,
you all no longer exist.

32
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,186
So don't talk to me
or act like you know me.

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,104
You got that?

34
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,913
THEIR WRETCHED LOVE

35
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,467
It's been a while
since I watched this movie.

36
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,637
That scene never gets old.
It's so romantic.

37
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,391
You're right.
When will I ever fall in love like that?

38
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,937
By the way, what are you wiping so much?

39
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,232
Shoes that Malgeum sent me.

40
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,110
You are just so excited about that.

41
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,237
-Are you that happy?
-Yeah.

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,406
I like it so much
that I can't even wear them.

43
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,908
My goodness...

44
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,246
You guys can't keep your mouth shut.

45
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,082
So how long have you guys been going out?

46
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,628
It's been a little while.

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,296
Sorry we didn't tell you.

48
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,882
We understand.
We know what Dong-goo is like.

49
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,260
I would have done the same thing.
I understand you, Joon-ki.

50
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,846
Thanks, Doo-sik.
What would I do without you?

51
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,812
Yes, Mullae's Crazy Horse.

52
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,482
I can't play today.

53
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,109
Please let me take a day off.

54
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,362
Yeah, sorry about that.

55
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,448
Mullae's Crazy Horse?

56
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,742
He's a member of my guild.

57
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,036
We were supposed to get together
to play the game.

58
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,872
They've been bugging me since the morning
saying they need me to play.

59
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,458
What? Why can't they just
play without you?

60
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,918
Are you that special?

61
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,254
You must not know this...

62
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,757
The name Joon-ki
may not mean much at all in reality,

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,801
but he is like a god in the game world.

64
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,303
Some people come with a lot of money
to buy Joon-ki's character.

65
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,681
Really? Why don't you just sell it, then?

66
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,224
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,934
They can offer a million.
I still won't sell it.

68
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,811
-What?
-When I'm dead,

69
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,814
I want my character saved on a USB
and buried with me.

70
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,565
-Of course.
-Oh my...

71
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,193
I don't understand you at all.

72
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,488
Yoon-ah, how is Dong-goo?

73
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,614
He doesn't want to eat.

74
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,492
He's under a blanket and won't come out.

75
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,036
Dong-goo is being stubborn again,
that son of a gun.

76
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,205
I've had enough.

77
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,667
Hey, where are you going?
What are you going to do?

78
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,922
Hey, we need to talk.

79
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,882
How does my blanket move by itself?

80
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,800
Is it a ghost?

81
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,265
Are you being serious?

82
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,600
My blanket is moving by itself again.

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,893
This is unbelievable.

84
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,691
Are you going to keep this up?

85
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,443
Well, then. I have a solution.

86
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,445
What are you going to do?

87
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,989
Listen to me good.

88
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,491
Until you approve

89
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,285
of Joon-ki and I,

90
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,787
I won't shave. Got it?

91
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,205
What?

92
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,630
You can't stand it, huh?
It will make you go nuts.

93
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,134
Let's see who will win this battle.

94
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,637
Hey, Seo-jin!

95
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,306
Hey, come on!

96
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,936
Doesn't she have anything else
she can threaten me with?

97
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,980
Seo-jin, come on.

98
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,816
What are you talking about?
Why won't you shave?

99
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,944
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

100
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,113
I'm going to fight for this.

101
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,867
It's good to fight and all,
but why in the world won't you shave?

102
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,453
He hates it when I don't shave.

103
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,872
There's nothing better than

104
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,540
to visually irritate him.

105
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,127
How about your work?

106
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,587
I will just take days off.

107
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,091
I'm going to make him surrender.

108
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,842
You just need to trust me.

109
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,762
Seo-jin, but...

110
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,848
Why the heck would she take days off

111
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,975
from work to grow her beard out?

112
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,311
Am I the only person
who can't understand her?

113
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,273
Joon-ki, she's Kang Seo-jin,
sister of Kang Dong-goo.

114
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,484
It runs in the blood, you know?

115
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,319
Why don't you two break up, then?

116
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,487
Shut up!

117
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,323
Why, why?

118
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,576
What kind of siblings are they?

119
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,871
This is going to make me crazy.

120
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,376
Philip? His name is Philip?

121
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,004
You said his model fee is expensive.

122
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,590
We don't have much money.
Do we have to use him?

123
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,259
Hey, this guy

124
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,512
is the Park Bo-gum
of the shopping mall modeling industry.

125
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,348
Whatever Philip wears
will sell out in no time.

126
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,766
Park Bo-gum?

127
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,519
He couldn't be that good looking.

128
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,357
Philip, here.

129
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,779
I'm a little late.

130
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,158
I had another shoot
since early morning. Sorry.

131
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,703
That's okay.
It's our fault to come so early.

132
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,955
Hello.

133
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,459
I'm the CEO of Soorgio Armhany Mall,
Min Soo-ah.

134
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,005
Please have this coffee. It smells great.

135
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,048
Oh, really?

136
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,135
I have pretty bad rhinitis.

137
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,720
So I can't really smell things well.

138
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,182
Oh, I see.

139
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,641
Bad rhinitis!

140
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,145
You are really funny.

141
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, actually...

142
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,943
You have something stuck in your teeth.

143
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,572
Huh?

144
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,040
Excuse me.

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,251
Did you have to say that so directly?

146
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,297
Are you happy now
after embarrassing someone like that?

147
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,216
-Well, I...
-Pardon me?

148
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,885
-Well, it's--
-That's it.

149
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,220
Listen to me.

150
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,223
You put me in a bad mood,
so I won't be able to shoot today.

151
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,557
Wait a minute!

152
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,394
I'm sorry if we embarrassed you.
She doesn't have any common sense.

153
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,356
Hurry up and say you're sorry.

154
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,944
I'm so sorry.

155
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,030
I hope you understand.
I won't ever let this happen again.

156
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,657
Well, I...

157
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,409
will let it slide this time

158
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,994
because of you, Mr. Bong.

159
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,956
Thank you!

160
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,091
Please come in.
This is a guesthouse that we're running.

161
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,717
We will do the photoshoot here.

162
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,094
Oh, I see.

163
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,430
It's nice and cute.

164
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,682
I'm glad you like it.

165
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,476
-Please go ahead to the second floor.
-Sure.

166
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,984
What kind of smell is this?
Did you fart?

167
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,112
What the heck?
Did something spoil in the house?

168
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,031
Seriously.
Where's this smell coming from?

169
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,669
Why, why?

170
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,213
-It's coming from there.
-Huh?

171
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,344
What? Hold on. Aren't those his shoes?

172
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,471
That rotten smell
is coming from Philip's feet?

173
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,389
I think so!

174
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,433
He seems like a normal guy.

175
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,476
How can his feet smell so bad?

176
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,813
Does he not know
how bad his feet smell?

177
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,232
He said he has a bad case of rhinitis.

178
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,528
This is not a bad case of rhinitis.
It's more like he doesn't have a nose.

179
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,741
Doo-sik, do we really have to go
with this guy?

180
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,908
Of course!

181
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,620
Don't you know we have to upload
all the new products photos by today?

182
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,290
Anyway, don't make a big deal
in front of Philip. Got it?

183
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,709
But the smell is so bad.

184
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,711
-How can I do that?
-Didn't you see him earlier?

185
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,546
He freaked when you said
he had stuff in his teeth.

186
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,840
If you say something about his feet,
we are over.

187
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,301
So don't say anything. Got it?

188
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,302
Fine.

189
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,720
Two, three!

190
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,482
Why in the world won't she shave?

191
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,026
How can she be so stubborn like that?

192
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,947
Are we having cheonggukjang tonight?

193
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,741
That sounds so good!

194
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,037
Hey, Dong-goo.
Are we having cheonggukjang?

195
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,246
I don't--

196
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,210
Hey, let's talk for a minute.

197
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,923
Dong-goo, hey! That son of a gun...

198
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,259
Oh, wait! This isn't cheonggukjang!

199
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,345
What the heck? This is...

200
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,646
How dare you try to start
a conversation with me like that.

201
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:34,402
I won't talk until they break up.

202
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,448
I will show them...

203
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,036
a man's will.

204
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,126
Where's the toilet paper?

205
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,878
Hey, Joon-ki--

206
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,801
Oh, I said I wouldn't talk to him.

207
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,387
My mistake.

208
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,848
I almost talked to him.

209
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,518
What should I do?

210
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,771
I don't have my socks or towels.

211
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,276
Dong-goo, let's talk.

212
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,528
Where's your shirt?

213
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,654
You had a shirt on earlier.

214
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,240
What the...

215
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,868
Hey, Dong-goo!

216
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,997
That's weird.

217
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,708
I'm sure he had a shirt on.

218
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,254
Oh my gosh.

219
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,298
The whole house smells like it.

220
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,259
Be quiet! What if he notices?

221
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,721
He's coming! Go ahead and smile.

222
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,893
Sorry about that. Did you wait long?

223
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,729
Shall we get on with the shoot?

224
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,272
Where should I stand?

225
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,399
Where would be good?

226
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,067
Yes, over there.

227
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,778
Right there? Sure.

228
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,949
How should I stand here...

229
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,160
How about this?

230
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,165
Sure! Much better.

231
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,375
You didn't roll up your pants though.

232
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,128
Do I have to roll it up? How much?

233
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,588
We will do it for you.

234
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,215
Come on, roll them up for him.

235
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,551
-Me?
-Of course, you are the stylist!

236
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,095
Do we have to?

237
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,388
Can't we just do it?

238
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,057
That's the best looking part though.

239
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,600
Come on and do it. We don't have time.

240
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,727
Fine.

241
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,775
Here we go.

242
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,488
A little bit more. Okay, the other side.

243
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,372
Thank you.

244
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,083
Okay, looks good.

245
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,044
Nice posture! Here we go.

246
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,587
Looks good!

247
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,297
Don't move your feet. Stay still.

248
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,132
Shouldn't I move my feet around?

249
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,509
No, they look good where they are.

250
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,635
You said this is the best part.

251
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,178
Please don't move!

252
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,097
Yes, great!

253
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,057
Don't move. We can't see your feet.

254
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,234
What are they doing upstairs?
It smells awful.

255
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,237
I have my nose plugged up
and it still isn't helping.

256
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,784
Sol, does it even make sense
that Joon-ki and Seo-jin are going out?

257
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,538
This is not right. Isn't it?

258
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,957
What do you think? Huh?

259
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,042
You don't think that's right either.

260
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,337
That's why I'm so angry, you know?

261
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,216
I'm so frustrated. Those little dimwits.
Why, I ought to--

262
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,552
What the heck?

263
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,264
Darn it.

264
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,682
Wait a minute.

265
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,434
Here...

266
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,937
Ah, those balls...

267
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,606
went all the way...

268
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,941
What? Wait. What's going on?

269
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,362
Ah, come on.

270
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,824
What kind of smell is this?

271
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,661
Huh? What are you doing here?

272
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,038
Are you stuck by any chance?

273
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,833
Do you need some help?

274
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,130
You're so stubborn.

275
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,507
Just stay like that, then!

276
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,675
What in the world?

277
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,804
Seo-jin!

278
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,640
Hey.

279
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,185
You still won't approve of us?

280
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,313
Oh, I see.

281
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,482
You still won't approve of us, huh?

282
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,735
Okay, fine.
Let's see who will win this battle

283
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,987
because I won't give up.

284
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,908
Seo-jin, hey!

285
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,118
What is she doing?

286
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,289
Dong-goo?
How long are you going to do this?

287
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,083
You don't like us dating that much?

288
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,836
Okay! Do whatever you want.

289
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,547
You are not my friend anymore either!

290
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,342
Geez!

291
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,344
Whatever.

292
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,263
Do you think I will ever approve of it?

293
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,058
Why can't I get out?

294
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,979
I have to go to work. What should I do?

295
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,196
I'm so embarrassed.

296
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,284
Yes, sir.

297
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,289
I will go see the agency
and have a meeting now.

298
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:45,421
How can I go to a meeting
like this anyways?

299
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,387
Excuse me.

300
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,097
Yes? Whoa!

301
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,975
Who are you?

302
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,894
This isn't the best way
to introduce myself,

303
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,440
but could you cut this off for me?

304
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,485
I had you in mind
when we wrote this scenario.

305
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,112
I see.

306
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,325
I guess I have to be in the movie, then.

307
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,081
Oh, that's okay.

308
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,293
Sir, I guess we have no option
but go with Seo Jin-woo.

309
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,670
Gong-yoo, Hyun-bin, and Won Bin

310
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,005
along with other actors don't want to.

311
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,466
What are you talking about?

312
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,843
He's not even that good at acting

313
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,387
and he's not that good-looking
and has a bad temper.

314
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,599
What do you mean no?

315
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,393
That fool apparently picks on
a lot of people.

316
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,354
Well...

317
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,857
Mr. Seo?

318
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,485
Well, actually...

319
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,987
No words needed.

320
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,824
The fool that picks on people
will go ahead and leave.

321
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,077
-Cheers.
-Wait...

322
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,245
-That's just the rumor...
-Mr. Seo, wait...

323
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,955
-The rumor...
-Mr. Seo...

324
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,751
Hey, are you crazy?

325
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,170
-I'm sorry. I didn't know he was here.
-Shut up.

326
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,214
Go and get him back here.

327
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,840
Don't come back here without him.

328
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,094
No, actually-- why don't you just quit?

329
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,012
Oh, very good!

330
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,555
Great!

331
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,390
Whoa, looking good!

332
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,684
Great! Shall we take a quick break?

333
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,770
Already? Sure.

334
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,940
-I will be back then.
-Sure thing. Go ahead.

335
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,567
Downstairs is a great place for resting.

336
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,281
I can't take this anymore.
I think I'm going to die.

337
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,951
Are you the only one suffering?
My nose is about to bleed.

338
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,121
-Hold it for a bit longer.
-I can't hold it anymore!

339
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,872
Shall we open the window?

340
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,500
What if he notices it?

341
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,378
Just don't do anything and be quiet!

342
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,464
How about if we make him wash his feet?

343
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,508
Wash his feet?

344
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,926
How?

345
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,808
Philip, would you like something to drink?

346
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,976
Oh, sure. Thank you.

347
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,772
-Oh my gosh!
-Oh, I'm sorry!

348
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,275
What should I do?

349
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,736
It's all wet! I bet it's all sticky...

350
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,156
I guess you have to wash them.

351
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,741
I don't have much time
until my next appointment.

352
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,995
Let's just go on real quick.

353
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,247
Wait! But...

354
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,374
I bet they will be sticky.

355
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,751
I bet it's uncomfortable.

356
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,128
I guess so.

357
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,796
Sure, then.

358
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,048
I will just take my socks off.

359
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,142
Here. We don't have much time,

360
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,728
so let's finish it strong. Right?

361
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,230
Let's pump up our energy!

362
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,233
Whoa! Let's do this!

363
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,986
Let's do it! Of course.

364
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,821
Let's go!

365
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,619
Why did you do that?

366
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,872
-It smells even worse.
-I didn't know it would turn out this way.

367
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,582
I'm about to go...

368
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,795
Why was Jin-woo there?

369
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,797
This is driving me nuts.

370
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,633
Why was he...

371
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,058
All right.

372
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,646
-Joon-ki?
-Can we play just one round?

373
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,064
I can't.

374
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,815
I have to go to work tomorrow,
so I need to go.

375
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:38,362
How can a guild manager
treat his members like this?

376
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:39,905
Excuse me...

377
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,324
Dong-goo?

378
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,992
What are you doing here?

379
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,787
Huh? Do you know this guy?

380
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,871
Huh?

381
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,958
Well, I used to...

382
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,000
But not anymore!

383
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,336
What do you mean?

384
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,048
Anyway, I have nothing else
to say to you.

385
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,300
Don't waste your time here
and leave.

386
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,428
Could you please make some time
for me?

387
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,930
Ten minutes. No, I mean just one!

388
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,932
No, I'm not interested.

389
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,725
-Come on...
-Okay.

390
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,477
Mr. Seo!

391
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,688
Come on in, Joon-ki!

392
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,232
Mr. Seo!

393
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,402
Could you just take a quick look
at the script?

394
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,319
Mr. Seo!

395
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,283
This sucks.

396
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,703
How does Joon-ki know Jin-woo?

397
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,127
-You're still here, Yoon-ah.
-Hello, Hyun-joon.

398
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,629
Oh, how was the orientation?

399
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,797
Yes.

400
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,883
Did something happen?
Why did you leave so quickly?

401
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,802
I had something going on.

402
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,972
Well, I'm heading out now.

403
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,224
-Already?
-Yeah.

404
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,893
Dong-goo hasn't been eating
anything since then,

405
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,188
so I should go back
and cook something he likes.

406
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,524
Are you so concerned about him?

407
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,610
-He's not a child.
-He's like a child sometimes.

408
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,990
Oh, Yoon-ah. Can I ask you something?

409
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,491
Yes, sure.

410
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,368
You told me before

411
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,579
that you don't want to trust
anyone anymore.

412
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,789
You said you don't want to be hurt again.

413
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,919
-Right.
-But what if someone shows up

414
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,214
who won't ever hurt you?

415
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,466
What would you do then?

416
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,218
Well, that would be nice.

417
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,054
But would someone like that ever show up?

418
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,347
Why do you ask that?

419
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,474
Never mind.

420
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,143
I'll get going, then.

421
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,789
I can still smell it.

422
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,999
It's like a chemical weapon, you know?

423
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,418
Keep your mouth closed.
What if he hears you?

424
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,337
I can't stand it any longer.

425
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,173
Doo-sik, let's just end it quickly.

426
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,674
Quickly?

427
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,843
Min Soo-ah. Why are you being like this?

428
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,013
What do you mean? What did I do wrong?

429
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,973
You wanted to do this one right.

430
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,517
You said this was your last hope!

431
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,145
Yeah, but the smell is unbearable!

432
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,355
Min Soo-ah!

433
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,233
Is this all you amount to?

434
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,194
Don't you know how much trouble
you will go through running a business?

435
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,989
If you can't withstand the smelly feet,
then you should just quit right now!

436
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,244
Min Soo-ah, I'm so disappointed in you.

437
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,203
I'm disappointed.

438
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,831
Doo-sik, I'm sorry.

439
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,792
I was wrong.

440
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,712
-So don't be so angry, please?
-Whatever. You just stay here.

441
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,922
I will finish this up.

442
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,647
Sorry for the wait.

443
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,232
What are you doing?

444
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,067
I saw a basketball over there.

445
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,945
I used to play basketball
when I was little.

446
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,405
Oh, I see.

447
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,948
I was a shooting guard...

448
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,951
I made all my shots, you know?

449
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,121
When you are taking a shot,
form is most important.

450
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,748
-Do you want to see it?
-Sure.

451
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,430
Did you see me?

452
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,265
What did you think?
Do you want to see it again?

453
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,809
Wait... a minute.

454
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,436
But...

455
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,230
Where did you get those basketball shoes?

456
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,274
Oh, these?

457
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,401
I saw them over there, so I tried them on.

458
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,944
By the way...

459
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,447
they are really well padded.

460
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,616
Vertical jump!

461
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,871
Why are you looking at me like that?

462
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,301
You crazy son of a bitch!

463
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,513
How dare you wear those
with your rotten feet?

464
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,390
You smelly feet monster!

465
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,853
What do you mean by smelly feet monster?

466
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,690
-Are you talking about me?
-Yes, you idiot!

467
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,317
Don't you understand anything?

468
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,401
You!

469
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,320
Do you know how bad your feet smell?

470
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,281
Your feet are rotting,
don't you know that?

471
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,242
Your feet smell worse than sewage.

472
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,327
Better yet, worse than stinky tofu!

473
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,413
But you're wearing my shoes,
my first love,

474
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,749
with your rotten feet, you bastard!

475
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,251
I will cut off all your toes!

476
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,919
Take them off, you son of a bitch!

477
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,338
I will poke your eyes out,
you fucking bastard

478
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,924
You crazy jerk!

479
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,968
My nose is about to bleed because of you.

480
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,803
You still haven't met Seo Jin-woo yet?

481
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,054
Why are you sitting around?

482
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,556
I will figure something--

483
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,642
Sir? Sir?

484
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,396
This is driving me crazy.

485
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,315
Okay, I got you.

486
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,484
I'm leaving now. Okay.

487
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,153
My goodness.

488
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,364
Why does a celebrity
have so much free time?

489
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,783
Should I ask him to help?

490
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,327
But I told him I wouldn't talk to him.

491
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,954
What should I do then?

492
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,129
What? Do you have something to tell me?

493
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,008
What are you doing?

494
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,348
Set up a meeting for me with Seo Jin-woo.

495
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,018
What is this?

496
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,228
You said you won't talk to me.

497
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,897
You said I no longer exist.

498
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,402
I said I wouldn't talk,
I said nothing about texting.

499
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,946
Will you set it up or not?

500
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,076
You are so stubborn.

501
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,958
Okay, fine. I will let you see him.

502
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,835
But!

503
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,587
You need to approve of Seo-jin's

504
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,047
and my relationship.

505
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,600
What the heck?

506
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,645
I don't need you! Die...

507
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,648
What an idiot!

508
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,444
Hey, what are you going to do now?

509
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,572
Philip is so upset that he won't be
shooting with us anymore.

510
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,115
I'm sorry.

511
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,910
He was wearing
the shoes that Mal-geum gave me...

512
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,495
with his bare feet.

513
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,246
-He was even jumping around!
-Be quiet!

514
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,124
You were giving me such a hard time.

515
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,126
Then you turn around and curse at the guy.

516
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,921
Huh? His feet are stinky tofu?

517
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,340
He is a brother of sewage?

518
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,008
-I'm sorry.
-Whatever!

519
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,301
My gosh!

520
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,554
We have to put up the new pictures
by today. What should we do?

521
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,807
Where can we find a model today?

522
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,517
Why can't Doo-sik do it?

523
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,935
-Huh?
-What?

524
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,019
Doo-sik?

525
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,148
Do you want me to end
my business now? Not him.

526
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,818
Why? I think Doo-sik is handsome.

527
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,278
Yoon-ah.

528
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,948
You have really low standards.

529
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,326
How can you call this handsome?

530
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,204
But you said you have to upload
the pictures by today.

531
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,748
This totally sucks!

532
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,089
I can still smell it.

533
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,216
Should I just spray it all?

534
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,471
-Soo-ah!
-Yeah?

535
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,025
How do I look? I tried this on.

536
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,157
Should we start now?
Where should I stand?

537
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,826
Over there, please.

538
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,997
-Huh? Why are you saying please?
-Huh?

539
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,375
Never mind. Go stand there already.

540
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,960
Okay.

541
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,093
Should I stand like this?

542
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,095
Sure. Here I go.

543
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,066
Sir, I'm here.

544
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,154
Why are you here, Mr. Seo?

545
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,949
He made a final decision
to be in our movie.

546
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,701
Oh, really?

547
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,995
Thank you. Thank you very much.

548
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,372
You should thank Joon-ki.

549
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,459
He followed me around all day asking me

550
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,460
to read the script.

551
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,254
-Joon-ki did?
-By the way,

552
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,298
Joon-ki must care a lot about you.

553
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,635
He even sold his character
that he didn't want to sell

554
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,886
to ask me to read it.

555
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:09,224
So I became a guild manager now.

556
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:24,906
You're home.

557
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,715
I heard that you asked Seo Jin-woo
to be in the movie.

558
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,633
Why did you do that?

559
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,178
I still won't approve of you
and Seo-jin's relationship.

560
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,851
I didn't do that
so that you would approve.

561
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,396
It seemed like you were struggling
with your new job,

562
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,856
so don't worry about it.

563
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,112
This is so annoying.

564
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,613
Talk to me.

565
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,365
Why?

566
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,451
-I thought you weren't going to talk.
-Stop that already.

567
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,911
Hey.

568
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,747
Do you really have to be with Seo-jin?

569
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,882
I'm sorry Dong-goo, but...

570
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,593
Even if you tell me
that you won't ever see me again

571
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,053
I cannot give Seo-jin up.

572
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,472
Is this what you really want?

573
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,474
I really like Seo-jin.

574
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,475
I'm serious.

575
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,563
Why do you dislike me so much?

576
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,524
-That's not it...
-Then what?

577
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,989
Think about it. If my best friend
and my only sister are going out,

578
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,325
why would I be against that?
But what if...

579
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,452
What if you break up?

580
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,995
What will you do?

581
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,625
I won't be able to see you again.

582
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,501
You know that.

583
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,046
-Is that the only reason?
-Of course.

584
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,548
You can't guarantee the future.
Aren't you worried?

585
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,675
Don't worry!

586
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,094
Seo-jin and I won't ever break up!

587
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,555
I won't ever make Seo-jin cry!

588
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,432
If anything, I'll be the one crying.

589
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,018
So just trust me, fool.

590
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,395
What did you just call me?

591
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:20,980
Huh?

592
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,775
Why? What do you mean?

593
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,860
Did you call me a fool?

594
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,196
I will be your brother-in-law.

595
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,699
What do you mean by that?

596
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,243
Huh?

597
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,081
So you're...

598
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,791
approving of us?

599
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,127
I was going to,

600
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,506
but you are so rude
so I'm not so sure anymore.

601
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,966
Bro!

602
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,718
Thank you so much, bro! Thank you!

603
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,971
What the...

604
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,140
Stop being so touchy. Get away!

605
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,395
-Come on!
-Stop it!

606
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,856
Seo-jin, wake up!

607
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,985
What's up?

608
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,114
What kind of a girl
can grow out a beard like that?

609
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,200
Did it grow out a lot? That's great!

610
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,910
Wait a second. I will show it to him.

611
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,370
Seo-jin.

612
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,789
You don't have to anymore.

613
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,332
Dong-goo said yes!

614
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,210
Really? He did? For real?

615
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,839
Oh, that's great!

616
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,216
Why is it so hard to be in love?

617
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,386
So we can go on dates

618
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,264
and I can tell everyone
that you're my boyfriend?

619
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,266
Of course! You can even tell the news!

620
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,854
-This is great!
-Ow!

621
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,647
I'm sorry.

622
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,816
I guess I have to go shave now.

623
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,652
-Seo-jin.
-Yeah? What?

624
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:54,157
I have something
that I've always wanted to do.

625
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,117
What is it?

626
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,436
I love you.

627
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,487
What are those two fools doing in the room

628
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,613
for such a long time?

629
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,864
Let them be.

630
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,367
They like each other so much.
You should have let them date earlier.

631
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,369
I guess so.

632
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,039
I was just worried at first.

633
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,459
But I saw Joon-ki's eyes
and I could trust him.

634
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,795
At least he won't...

635
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,173
make my little sister cry.

636
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,841
You know what I mean?

637
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,384
I can't trust you.

638
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,637
I said I'm sorry! I am!

639
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,763
You're sorry?

640
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,848
I said I was going to shave.
Why did you want to?

641
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,935
-What if this leaves a scar?
-I didn't do it on purpose.

642
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,146
How can a girl's beard by so firm?
It's like the tendon of a whale?

643
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,232
What? A whale's tendon?

644
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,776
-Are you finished talking, you jerk?
-"You jerk"?

645
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,111
Did you call me a jerk?

646
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,196
You are so rude, you know that?

647
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,073
Yeah, I'm so rude.

648
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,950
Do you regret going out with a rude girl?

649
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,327
Yes, I regret it.
What do you want me to do?

650
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,704
Really? Why don't you break up, then?

651
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,498
Fine! Let's break up, then!

652
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,167
Dong-goo, I can't take it anymore.
We're breaking up.

653
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,295
Oh, really?

654
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,840
Let's see...

655
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,721
Hey, calm down... I'm just joking.

656
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,516
-A joke?
-Yes!

657
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,810
We were just bickering.

658
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,397
Bickering? Yeah right!

659
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,065
Come here! Both of you!

660
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,608
Come here!

661
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,694
Come on!

662
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,077
Yes, sir.

663
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,748
Yes, okay...

664
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,878
I'll get an exclusive. Sure.

665
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,548
Ah, this sucks.

666
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,967
Why? What's wrong?

667
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,343
It's my boss.

668
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,387
He said I should resign
if I can't get an exclusive.

669
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,431
Darn it.

670
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:29,145
Have you heard anything at work?
Like romance rumors?

671
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,651
It's not a romance rumor,
but I have heard something.

672
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,569
What is it?

673
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,368
-You know Han Min-joo, right?
-Yeah.

674
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,455
Well, Min-joo had a baby
with Park Jin-cheol from Songjin Group

675
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,040
and are raising him in secret!

676
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,834
Are you saying they're having an affair?

677
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,129
She's having an affair with a grandpa?

678
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,631
That's right!

679
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,841
I heard it from a very reliable source.

680
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,426
Who did you hear it from?

681
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,220
You know where I work.

682
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,472
There's a secret route, just for the VIPs.

683
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,390
Only top celebrities
like Gong-yoo or Won-bin

684
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,517
or executive managers can go through.

685
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,270
So you heard it
from the executive managers?

686
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,148
No, I heard it from the security guard.
He's my coffee buddy.

687
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,316
Oh, yeah!

688
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,817
A security guard?

689
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,069
Are you kidding?

690
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,154
You don't know anything.

691
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,074
That kind of exclusive information
come from those guys.

692
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,450
Really?

693
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,161
Where can I meet this guy?

694
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,166
You guys were together.

695
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,293
Dong-goo, what are you doing here?

696
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,462
I have something to say to Hyun-joon.

697
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:37,922
With me?

698
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,466
Do you know that big-sized bread
that you made me?

699
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,218
Could you make like 30 more of those?

700
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,470
-But please make them bigger.
-Sure thing.

701
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,888
Are you guys going somewhere?

702
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,393
Yes, she received great news today,
so we're going for a drink.

703
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,727
A drink?

704
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,689
I had a buyer call me today
wanting to order my muffins.

705
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,233
Oh, really?

706
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,610
I should come with to congratulate you.

707
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,655
Shared joy is a double joy, as they say!

708
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,699
-Isn't that true?
-Not today.

709
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,451
I have something to tell Yoon-ah.

710
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,288
You can tell her when I'm there.

711
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,499
Why? Is it something I shouldn't hear?

712
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,879
A SIMPLE CONFESSION 2

713
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,589
Congratulations, Yoon-ah.

714
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,592
Why, thanks.

715
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,013
Isn't this place really expensive?

716
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,473
It's a great day.
We should enjoy ourselves.

717
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,517
Don't worry about it and just enjoy.

718
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,436
Thank you.

719
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,607
Let me answer this call quickly.

720
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,153
Here, have a drink.

721
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,280
No, thank you.

722
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,948
I will order my own.

723
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,993
That wine is not really my type.

724
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,328
Not only that,

725
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,705
I don't want to drink
anything that you buy.

726
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,373
Okay, do as you wish.

727
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,960
Waitress! Menu please.

728
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,421
Well, let's see.

729
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,549
I wonder if they have the wine
that I usually get.

730
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:04,800
What the heck?

731
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:09,138
The cheapest one is 12,000 won per glass?

732
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,108
-Can I take your order?
-Huh?

733
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,029
Please give me a glass of this.

734
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,785
But please take out about 200 won
worth of it.

735
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,705
-Pardon me?
-I have a lot to do tonight.

736
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,250
If I drink it all,
I'm afraid that I can't focus.

737
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,629
Please take out about 200 won worth of it.

738
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,643
-So good!
-By the way,

739
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,604
you wanted to tell me something?

740
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,398
Oh, yes.

741
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,859
I will tell you later.

742
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,694
It's a little late. Shall we leave?

743
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,655
Okay.

744
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,543
You shouldn't leave food on the plate.

745
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,254
You may have to eat it
in your afterlife. Don't you know?

746
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,922
How much is it here?

747
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,382
I paid for the meal earlier.

748
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,050
We can just go.

749
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,553
Thanks a lot, Hyun-joon.

750
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,013
Wait, we need to talk.

751
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,891
I will get some fresh air, then.

752
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,309
Okay.

753
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,563
Look. I told you earlier.

754
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,232
I don't want you inconvenience you.

755
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,360
This is for my drink.
Eleven thousand eight hundred won.

756
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,034
Please wait just a moment.

757
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,371
Thanks for the meal, Hyun-joon.

758
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,622
Please be careful.

759
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,292
See you in class..

760
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,794
Take care, Dong-goo.

761
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,962
Wait.

762
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,714
Please stay for a moment.

763
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,048
Why?

764
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,551
It's just for a moment.

765
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,304
Yoon-ah, let's go.

766
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,397
-Here.
-What is this?

767
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,900
This is the taxi-fare for me and Yoon-ah.

768
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,526
I divided it by three

769
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,653
exactly for Yoon-ah and me.

770
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,988
Go ahead and check it.

771
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,990
Do we really have to do this?

772
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:33,991
I told you

773
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,912
I don't want you to inconvenience
you whatsoever.

774
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,791
Come on. The cab fee went up
100 won while we were talking.

775
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,793
Here is 100 won.

776
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,339
Please give me back 33 won.

777
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,382
That's all right. Keep the change.

778
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:55,137
By the way, you keep asking
our guesthouse employee

779
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,140
to go out for a drink and food.

780
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,476
Please tone it down a little.

781
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,311
It's interfering with our business.

782
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,980
I believe you were the one
interfering tonight.

783
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,565
What?

784
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,108
What are you saying?

785
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,445
Nothing. I'll get going.

786
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,578
What is he saying?

787
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,665
I just don't like that guy.

788
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,591
Excuse me...

789
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,928
You're Kim Yong-sik, right?

790
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,472
Yes, and who are you?

791
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,932
I am...

792
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,185
a reporter from Choyoung Daily,
Kang Seo-jin.

793
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,937
What are you here for?

794
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:50,150
I heard that you said Han Min-joo had
a baby with Park Jin-cheol from Songjin.

795
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,068
Is that true?

796
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,571
Who said that?

797
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,281
I've never said such a thing.

798
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,742
I heard it from Joon-ki Lee
who's from JBC drama Newsroom.

799
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,369
I can't believe that guy.

800
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,538
I told him not to tell anyone.

801
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,958
I won't reveal your identity,
so please go ahead.

802
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,918
Did you see them in person?

803
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,630
To be honest, I didn't see them in person.

804
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,216
I heard it from a very reliable source.

805
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,427
Who is that reliable source?

806
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,887
I'm sure you know Elegance Shop
from Cheongdam.

807
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,724
-Yes.
-That's where Han Min-joo goes.

808
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,018
The owner's name is Won Kyeong-hee.

809
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,935
Won Kyeong-hee.

810
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,729
So you heard it from him?

811
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,274
No. There's a designer named Lee Jung-min

812
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,984
that Kyeong-hee Won likes the best.

813
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,320
Oh, so you heard it from Lee Jung-min--

814
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,487
No.

815
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,906
There's an assistant
who works for Lee Jung-min.

816
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,826
Her name is Kim In-na and she washes hair.

817
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,203
I told him

818
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,039
not to tell anyone.

819
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,041
I won't reveal your identity.

820
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,126
Don't worry and tell me more.

821
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,336
Okay.

822
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,421
You can't say that this is from me.

823
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,340
No worries.

824
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,426
Did you see them in person?

825
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,637
I didn't see them in person.

826
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,473
I heard it from a very reliable source.

827
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,766
Oh, okay.

828
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,851
Do you know the agency that Min-joo is in?

829
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,769
YS Enter.

830
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,273
You heard it from someone
who works at YS Enter?

831
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,817
No, there's a chef named

832
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,778
Lee Chun-bok in the cafeteria there.

833
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,821
You heard it from Chef Lee Chun-bok--

834
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:22,409
No. He loves Spicy Seafood Noodles,
so he gets it delivered everyday

835
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,786
from a place named Yong-ho Gak.

836
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,496
They have really good soup.

837
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,872
Excuse me...

838
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,791
Could you continue?

839
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,793
One of the delivery guys from Yong-ho Gak

840
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,920
is named Um Ji-yong.

841
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,840
He is called Um-G Dragon.

842
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,467
I heard it directly from that guy.

843
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,386
Where is Yong-ho Gak?

844
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,227
I'm glad the muffins are selling well.

845
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,692
I think it was somewhere around here.

846
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,290
UM-G DRAGON

847
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,212
I told her not to tell anybody.

848
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,881
She can't keep a secret.

849
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,883
I won't reveal your identity,

850
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,718
so please go ahead and tell me.

851
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,886
Did you see them in person?

852
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,513
I didn't see them in person.

853
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,683
But I heard it from
a very reliable source.

854
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,767
What?

855
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,520
You know the famous designer
Andy Kim, right?

856
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,230
Yes, of course.

857
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,065
You heard it from Andy Kim?

858
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,567
No.

859
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,278
There's a model named Han Hye-jin

860
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,364
who shows up on the runway at his shows.

861
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,783
Oh, you heard it from the model
Han Hye-jin?

862
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,201
No!

863
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,203
Can you stop cutting me off?

864
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,038
I'm sorry.

865
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,249
Han Hye-jin is teaching

866
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,586
a modeling class nowadays
at a modeling academy.

867
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:59,298
I heard it from a student
who takes one of the classes.

868
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,509
She's a member of G-Dragon fan club

869
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,136
in the Kangseo district.

870
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,888
I'm the president.

871
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,890
Would she tell a lie
to the president of the fan club?

872
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,309
Where can I find her?

873
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,353
I heard she was trying to go abroad

874
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,106
after being scammed by her boyfriend.

875
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,109
I heard she's living
with her ex-boyfriend now.

876
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,360
What?

877
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,491
Do you know her name by any chance?

878
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,952
What? It was you?

879
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,413
That said Han Min-joo
had a baby with the CEO of Songjin?

880
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,414
Huh?

881
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,501
I've never said such a thing.
Who said that?

882
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,086
I heard it from Ji-yong Um
who goes by Um-G Dragon

883
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,755
and he's a delivery guy

884
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,423
from Yong-ho Gak that serves great soup!

885
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,052
I can't believe he said that.

886
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,554
We had so many fan meetings together.

887
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,056
How could he betray me like this?

888
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,518
Come on, and just tell me.

889
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,686
Did you see in person
that Han Min-joo had a baby

890
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,063
with the CEO of Songjin Group?

891
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,440
I didn't see them in person.

892
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,318
But I directly heard it
from a very reliable source.

893
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,195
So you merely heard it?

894
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,156
No one's seen anything. It's all hearsay.

895
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,157
Is this for real?

896
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,785
I'm for sure, 100 percent!

897
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,662
I heard it from the nurse

898
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,997
who works at the hospital
that delivered her baby!

899
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,500
She delivered the baby herself.

900
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,626
Really?

901
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,212
She delivered Han Min-joo's baby herself?

902
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,380
That's what she said!

903
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,799
Awesome! This really is an exclusive!

904
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,551
Soo-ah, thank you so much!

905
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,470
Oh, my leg! Ouch!

906
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,223
You should drive more carefully.
What is this?

907
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,350
I'm so sorry. I am really sorry.

908
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,811
Doctor, is he badly hurt?

909
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,771
He broke his legs severely.

910
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,523
-What?
-It's a compound fracture,

911
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,693
so he needs surgery
and may have after effects.

912
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,777
Say what?

913
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,445
This is ridiculous.

914
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,989
What are you going to do?

915
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,282
What are you going about this?

916
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,367
I have to go to work tomorrow!

917
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,618
I'm so sorry.

918
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,328
I will take full responsibility.

919
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,205
I'm so sorry.

920
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,382
It fits!

921
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,304
Wow, it went in!

922
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,640
Whoa, look. It works!

923
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:14,891
Awesome...

924
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,186
Hi, Yoon-ah.

925
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,859
What's wrong? Did something happen?

926
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,485
Huh?

927
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,988
No, it's nothing.

928
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,741
I'm really tired,
so I will go up to my room.

929
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,244
I wonder what's wrong.

930
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,552
Are you Nurse Yoon Ji-woo?

931
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,179
Yes, who are you?

932
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,099
I called you earlier.
I'm the reporter from Choyoung Daily.

933
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,267
You know Min Soo-ah?

934
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,605
She's a girl that I met
when I went shopping for clothes recently.

935
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,857
-Huh?
-She was so funny,

936
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,777
so we went out for dinner and a drink.

937
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,819
Why?

938
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,823
Did you tell Soo-ah

939
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,619
that you delivered
Han Min-joo's baby yourself?

940
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,621
-Is that true?
-Huh?

941
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,582
I did!

942
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,794
You did? This is awesome.

943
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,505
I delivered Han Min-joo's baby

944
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,965
in my dream!

945
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,218
-In your dream?
-Yes.

946
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,346
We have someone in our hospital
who looks just like Han Min-joo.

947
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:38,016
She's so pretty, but her husband
looks really old.

948
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,727
He looks like he's in his 60s.

949
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,355
And I totally dreamed about them!

950
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,695
Soo-ah...

951
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,572
Oh, it was about her dream...

952
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,533
I was a little tipsy that night.

953
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,368
I guess I misheard her.

954
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,494
Sorry.

955
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,330
Sorry? You're sorry?

956
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,332
Do you know what I went through
because of you?

957
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,501
Anyone can make a mistake
after a drink.

958
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,378
That's a mistake?

959
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,213
Because of your rumor,

960
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,882
people think Han Min-joo's having
an affair with some man in his 60s,

961
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,926
not to mention the baby!

962
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,428
-Really?
-Yes.

963
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,556
I didn't know I'm had such influence.

964
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,224
I had no idea.

965
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,727
So what? Are you happy now?

966
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,395
No.

967
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,523
This is how a rumor gets started.

968
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,234
I had no idea I'm living with someone

969
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,319
who spreads rumors like that.

970
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:35,031
What am I going to tell my boss now?

971
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,616
It's all your fault!

972
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,618
What am I going to do?

973
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,374
Should I tell you about
something really exclusive?

974
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,127
This is 100 percent fact.

975
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,589
Exclusive?

976
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,090
What is it?

977
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,303
Lend me your ears.

978
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,439
What? Kang Dong-won is an alien?

979
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,399
That's right!

980
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,194
He doesn't look like someone
from this planet.

981
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,905
When he sends a telepathic
message with his ears like this,

982
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,323
a UFO comes down on him.

983
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,240
Shut up!

984
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,243
You make me crazy.

985
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,788
I have something else, then.

986
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,623
I heard Park Bo-gum has wings on his back.

987
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,166
He's an angel!

988
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,879
Well...

989
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,052
This is Yoon-ah's phone.

990
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,307
Yes, this is Yoon-ah's phone.

991
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,644
Yes, she left her cell phone.

992
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,062
Who is this?

993
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,025
Huh? Say what?

994
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,031
Thirty million won?

995
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:01,076
I didn't go to the police
because I understand her situation,

996
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,829
so I just agreed on the settlement money.

997
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,914
I can't go to work like this,

998
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,457
so I don't have any income!

999
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,001
But 30 million won is a bit...

1000
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,003
Where can she find money
like that this quickly?

1001
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,755
Let's go to the police station, then!

1002
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,673
I will just sue her!

1003
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,716
No. I will get you the money.

1004
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,638
I will get you the money somehow.

1005
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,890
Please wait for a while.

1006
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,397
Yoon-ah! Hey!

1007
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,775
Yoon-ah, we need to talk.

1008
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,069
Yes, what's wrong?

1009
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,864
I heard you caused a car accident.

1010
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,616
You have to tell me
if something like that happens.

1011
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,078
I'm sorry, I thought
it would just make you worry.

1012
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,581
Hey, what's the problem?

1013
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,673
What? Thirty million won?

1014
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,592
I'm sorry.

1015
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,386
I just couldn't tell you.

1016
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,930
That's all right.
We can talk about that later.

1017
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,473
Let's all ask around for some money.

1018
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,725
I will ask around as well.

1019
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,476
-Okay.
-Trust me.

1020
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,394
Okay.

1021
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,354
We can do it!

1022
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,149
Don't worry about it.

1023
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,651
We will work it out somehow. Got it?

1024
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,787
Yes, Sung-ryong!

1025
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,789
Long time no talk.

1026
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,166
Can you lend me some money?

1027
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,335
Oh, you're getting married.

1028
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,670
Oh, Hye-won! It's me, Dong-goo.

1029
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,172
Hey, Dong-ho. How have you been?

1030
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,674
Can you lend me some money?

1031
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,010
Sir, could you help me in anyway?

1032
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:43,720
Sorry, Dong-goo.

1033
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,014
I just can't help you right now.

1034
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,033
Oh, hey.

1035
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:10,997
The bank said I can't take out
another loan because of my current one.

1036
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,000
How about you?

1037
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,337
I see...

1038
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,590
Okay.

1039
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,699
What are you doing here?

1040
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,159
Well, actually...

1041
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,121
I have a favor to ask.

1042
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,331
A favor?

1043
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,582
You are asking me for a favor?

1044
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,376
Hyun-joon...

1045
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,174
Could you lend me some money?
Thirty-million won.

1046
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,135
Thirty-million won?

1047
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,554
What happened?

1048
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,351
I will have to know the reason
to decide to lend you that money or not.

1049
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,065
If you can't tell me, I can't help you.

1050
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,611
Yoon-ah was in an accident.

1051
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,615
Yoon-ah? What happened?

1052
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,034
What happened to her?

1053
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,579
Yoon-ah caused a car accident
and she needs the settlement money.

1054
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,581
I asked around for some...

1055
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,208
Let's go.
I'll get you the money right away.

1056
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,798
What are you doing? Come on.

1057
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,056
I'm sorry.

1058
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,852
I just don't have any money right now.

1059
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,646
Can I give it to you a bit later?

1060
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,565
I will get the money somehow.

1061
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:03,026
Whatever.
Why don't you just call the police?

1062
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,904
I have nothing else to tell you.
Just call the police!

1063
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:10,033
Bring the police here!

1064
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,910
Whoa, they really came.

1065
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,495
Korean cops are faster than I thought.

1066
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,664
-Are you Seo Tae-ho?
-That's me.

1067
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,750
You're under arrest for threats
of self-inflicted accidents

1068
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,959
and insurance fraud.

1069
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,669
-Huh?
-Arrest him.

1070
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,297
What did I do wrong? I'm a patient!

1071
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,678
You're lucky.

1072
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,514
You almost fell for it as well.

1073
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:36,518
He is one of the worst cases
of self-inflicting accidents.

1074
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,311
Even the doctor played along with him,

1075
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,396
so a lot of people fell for it.

1076
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,316
Thank you.

1077
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:47,153
So I don't have to pay
the settlement money?

1078
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,863
Of course not. Don't worry about it.

1079
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,116
Take him away.

1080
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,993
Walk straight!

1081
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,164
Thank you so much!

1082
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,209
Yoon-ah!

1083
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,920
Dong-goo, Hyun-joon?

1084
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,005
I heard you were in an accident.
What happened?

1085
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,258
Well, actually...

1086
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,884
it all worked out.

1087
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,553
I don't have to pay the settlement money.

1088
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,973
He's apparently a self-hurting criminal.

1089
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,976
My heart was about to sink.
He's such a bad guy!

1090
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,686
Really?

1091
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,604
That's great news. I was really worried.

1092
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,481
I'm sorry.

1093
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,693
But you do have to come
to the police station.

1094
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,903
Me? Why?

1095
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,030
You're a witness,
so we have some questions to ask.

1096
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,617
Don't worry about that.

1097
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,704
I will call one of my friends
who's a lawyer to go with you

1098
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,122
so you don't have to be scared.

1099
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,166
Thanks, Hyun-joon.

1100
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,625
Thank you so much.

1101
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,677
What happened? Did it work out?

1102
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,680
Yeah, Hyun-joon introduced me
to a lawyer he knows,

1103
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,557
so it all worked out.

1104
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,768
Sorry for making you worry.

1105
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,897
That's okay. We're glad it all worked out.

1106
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,150
I'm a little tired,

1107
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,109
so I'm going upstairs.

1108
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,589
What are you doing?

1109
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,633
Nothing.

1110
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,010
It all worked out, no?

1111
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:34,928
Did something happen?

1112
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,806
Sorry. I was a bit foolish.

1113
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,684
Foolish? About what?

1114
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,439
I ran around all day
trying to get the settlement money.

1115
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:51,152
It took Hyun-joon less than a second
to solve the problem.

1116
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,655
He even knows a lawyer.

1117
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,325
Well, he's older

1118
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,619
and he's a famous pastry chef.
That's natural.

1119
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,496
Right?

1120
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,498
That's natural.

1121
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,168
But I just don't feel like

1122
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,880
that's the way it should be.

1123
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,976
I'm glad it all worked out.

1124
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,687
It was all because of you. Thank you.

1125
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,814
No, I didn't do anything.

1126
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,568
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

1127
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,738
Let's eat first.

1128
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,741
-Do you want more wine?
-Sure.

1129
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,375
Oh my!

1130
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,962
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

1131
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,090
I'll be right back.

1132
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,049
Sure.

1133
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,105
How was the food?

1134
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,733
Yes, it was really good.

1135
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,736
But what is it that you want to tell me?

1136
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,324
Yoon-ah, actually...

1137
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,533
Oh, wait!

1138
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,536
Where is it?

1139
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,956
Why? What's missing?

1140
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,083
Yes, my hairpin is missing.

1141
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,170
I know I had it on just before.

1142
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,089
Where did it go? What should I do?

1143
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,592
What should I do? Where is it?

1144
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,386
Where is it? Where did it go?

1145
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,056
You can just buy a new hairpin.

1146
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,724
I will get you a pretty one.

1147
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:49,145
No. Dong-goo bought me that hairpin.

1148
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,522
That's the first gift I got from him.

1149
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,571
I must have left it in the bathroom.

1150
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,157
Hyun-joon, I will be right back.

1151
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,297
Cheer up, Yoon-ah.

1152
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,549
Sorry.

1153
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,678
I ruined your mood as well.

1154
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,971
No. That's okay.

1155
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,186
-Oh, wait.
-Why?

1156
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:37,777
Isn't this the hairpin
that you lost earlier?

1157
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,947
It is! This is it!

1158
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,657
What a relief!

1159
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,411
Now you're smiling.

1160
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,870
Are you that happy?

1161
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,456
I am. I thought I lost it.

1162
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,167
I was really worried about it.

1163
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,878
Shall we go?

1164
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,047
Yoon-ah.

1165
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,591
I have something to say.

1166
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,510
Oh, that's right.

1167
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,387
What's is it? Tell me.

1168
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,723
You told me.

1169
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,641
You didn't want to trust anyone
anymore.

1170
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,893
You don't want to be hurt again.

1171
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,646
Yes, right.

1172
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:19,986
But I wish you wouldn't be afraid
of loving someone

1173
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,821
because you're afraid
of getting hurt again.

1174
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,450
-Huh?
-What I'm saying is

1175
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:29,203
that you shouldn't miss out
on the guy you like.

1176
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,789
What do you mean?

1177
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,416
I'm talking about Dong-goo.

1178
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,501
Yoon-ah.

1179
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,337
You like Dong-goo, right?

1180
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,508
-What?
-But...

1181
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,344
You're pushing him away
because you don't want

1182
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,180
to get hurt again.

1183
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,097
Isn't that true?

1184
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,643
If you keep pushing him away,

1185
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,062
if you miss someone
who likes you a lot,

1186
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,273
won't that hurt, too?

1187
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,109
Won't that hurt you even more?

1188
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,492
Let's go ahead and say good bye.

1189
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,287
Sure, see you later.

1190
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,339
About Dong-goo...

1191
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:25,134
He doesn't even want to owe me 100 won.

1192
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,931
But he came to me
when you got into the accident.

1193
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,432
He asked me to help you.

1194
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,602
He probably hated that so much.

1195
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,439
That means he likes you that much.

1196
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:40,942
Maybe I'm stretching it too much.

1197
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:46,197
I'm really leaving now.

1198
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,311
I will sell all this for you.

1199
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,604
I will help you.

1200
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,940
Please buy one!

1201
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:21,899
It's tasty!

1202
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,610
Do you even know
what kind of life she's living?

1203
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,656
Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah!

1204
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,075
You're not hurt, right?

1205
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,077
You're okay, right?

1206
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,456
Do you think he came to Seoul
for sundae?

1207
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,083
Yoon-ah, I like you.

1208
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,210
I really like you.

1209
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:41,354
What are you doing here?

1210
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,065
Just sitting around.

1211
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,901
Where were you?

1212
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,402
I met Hyun-joon.

1213
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,448
I see.

1214
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,703
He's actually a decent guy.

1215
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,082
He's rich and has a good personality.

1216
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,917
He's handsome as well.

1217
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,545
He's also good to you.

1218
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,339
Wait.

1219
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,925
Why are you telling me this?

1220
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,344
I'm just saying.

1221
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,805
You're so stupid. You know that?

1222
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,182
You are so slow.

1223
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:20,101
What do you mean...

1224
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,477
Forget it.

1225
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,772
I'm going down to take a break.

1226
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,569
Why is she angry?

1227
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,991
What is this?

1228
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:37,827
Do you like him that much?

1229
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,998
Say, I like you, then.

1230
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,959
Dong-goo, I like you.

1231
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,420
-Make it cute.
-I like you.

1232
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,462
Lovely!

1233
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,922
I like you!

1234
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,090
Make it cute!

1235
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,175
I really like you!

1236
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,385
Like a man!

1237
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,679
I really like you!

1238
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,274
What is this?

1239
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:24,373
I like you. I really do.

1240
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:29,795
Do you want to

1241
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,590
date seriously?

1242
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:35,843
Yoon-ah...
