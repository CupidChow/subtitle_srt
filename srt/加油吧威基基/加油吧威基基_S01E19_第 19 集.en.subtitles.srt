1
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,005
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

2
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,841
This is a huge opportunity for me.

3
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,178
So can you please understand?

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,055
Fine.

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,474
Really? Are you sure?

6
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,142
You're not mad, are you?

7
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,436
No, I'm not.

8
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,855
Are you sure? You're really okay?

9
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,066
Yes, I'm really okay.

10
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,526
Thank you, Seo-jin! Thanks so much!

11
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,820
I'll see you at home, okay?

12
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,369
I'm okay.

13
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,748
Really...

14
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,126
I am.

15
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,215
What? You're signing with
YS Entertainment?

16
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,758
That's what I'm saying!

17
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,845
That's great! It's a huge company
with lots of famous celebrities!

18
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,766
People have finally started to take
notice of Lee Joon-ki, that's what!

19
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,559
Seriously.

20
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,354
Right, Seo-jin.

21
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,065
I'm really sorry
about blowing you off today.

22
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,192
No worries. It's okay.

23
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,902
It was work-related.

24
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,154
You've had a tough time
managing everything by yourself.

25
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,072
Congratulations.

26
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,907
Thanks.

27
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,702
Joon-ki, are you going to become
really famous now?

28
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,330
I should probably get your autograph now.

29
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,042
I actually made a new autograph today.
Do you want one?

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,210
Yes, please.

31
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,130
Okay. Then...

32
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,758
Lee Joon-ki's first autograph.
Coming right up!

33
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,431
Lee...

34
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,880
Gosh, I fell asleep.

35
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,134
Joon-ki, are you still at it?

36
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,677
Wait just a bit longer.

37
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,178
Excuse me, then.

38
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,849
I have to go study
for my certification exam.

39
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,559
I see.

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,228
I'll bring this to your room
once I'm done.

41
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,897
Okay.

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,275
Now that I'm done with "Lee,"

43
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:17,906
Joon...

44
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,253
DANCER IN THE DARK

45
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,132
Yes, Dad.

46
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,052
I'm off to sign the contract.

47
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,932
Don't worry. I read through
the entire contract carefully.

48
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,352
Okay. I'll call you when I get back. Bye.

49
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,355
What did he say? He's happy, right?

50
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,523
Yeah, he won't say,

51
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,776
but I can tell he's really pleased.

52
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,445
Who knew this day would come?

53
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,947
What a turn of events, Joon-ki.

54
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,865
I know.

55
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,243
To think of all I went through
over the past 10 years...

56
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,995
Yeah, you did have it tough.

57
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,626
-Is that the best you can do?
-Tell me, you son of a bitch.

58
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,627
I got fired.

59
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,129
Go! Go! Go!

60
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,799
Just thinking about it frightens me.

61
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,134
-I'm off.
-See you later.

62
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,348
Where the hell did Soo-ah go?

63
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,392
She left me to do all the work.

64
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,936
Doo-sik!

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,856
-Take a look at this.
-What's the fuss about?

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,401
-What is it?
-I designed it myself.

67
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,196
I think Soorgio Armhany will face
limitations if we only sell what we buy.

68
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,366
Oh, so you want to sell clothes
you designed yourself?

69
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,410
Exactly. Do you want to see?

70
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,870
Ta-da!

71
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,332
Soorgio Armhany's
2018 S/S Vintage Collection.

72
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,419
Ultra V-neck Sweater.
What do you think?

73
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,047
Wow. How come it's so low cut?

74
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,218
Existing V-necks are too ordinary
and are not sexy at all.

75
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,180
This neckline comes all the way down
to just above the belly button

76
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,017
emphasizing sex appeal.

77
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,810
What do you think? Isn't it awesome?

78
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,647
It's all right,
but it seems a bit too low.

79
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,774
It's fine.

80
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,610
This is what's hot these days.

81
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,989
What are you doing?
Aren't you trying it on?

82
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,198
What?

83
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,534
You want me to try it on? Why?

84
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,162
You're our model.
We need pictures to post online.

85
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,663
What? Me?

86
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,373
Who, what, when, where, why, and how?

87
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,334
Just do as your boss says. No questions!

88
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,294
-Shut it and come with me!
-Why do I have to do it?

89
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,046
I'm busy, you evil boss!

90
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,215
-Just come with me!
-No, Soo-ah. My belly button!

91
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,600
So how do you like the terms?

92
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,226
They're great.

93
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,187
Then you should sign it.

94
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,065
-Shall I?
-Yes.

95
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,573
Lee...

96
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:13,873
Joo....

97
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,420
-Are you still not finished?
-...oon.

98
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:25,635
Ki...

99
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,679
I'm done.

100
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,056
Really?

101
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,600
Good luck here.

102
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,103
Thank you, sir.

103
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,857
So that's why...

104
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,277
the baby tiger and daddy tiger

105
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,906
lived happily ever after.

106
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,533
The end!

107
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,787
Sol, what do you think
the point of this story was?

108
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,542
The key point of this story is "daddy."

109
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,002
So try saying "daddy."

110
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:04,048
You really like to play hard to get,
don't you?

111
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,885
Sol, say "daddy." Come on.

112
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,179
Come on. Just once.

113
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,015
-"Daddy." Say it.
-What are you doing?

114
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,519
I was just reading Sol a--

115
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,025
What the hell?
You look like a cold beggar.

116
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,361
What? A cold beggar?

117
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,448
You look cold in your freak sweater.

118
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,116
Where did you buy that?

119
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,033
I didn't buy it.

120
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,703
Soo-ah designed this herself.

121
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,080
What? She's making clothes now?

122
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,290
That's what I'm saying.

123
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,334
And that's not all. She wants me
to keep wearing it for publicity's sake.

124
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,379
Gosh. She's a tool, that one.

125
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,382
-I'm home.
-Hey.

126
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,092
Hey Joon-ki. How'd the signing go?

127
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,635
Yeah, it was--

128
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,806
What the hell is up
with this cold beggar look?

129
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,808
Soo-ah designed it herself.

130
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,685
Isn't it hilarious?

131
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,688
Totally. Hey, I can see your belly button.

132
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,315
Is it the open-minded look?

133
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,692
Stop it.

134
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,573
What is it?
Why'd you stop when I showed up?

135
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,283
You were talking behind my back,
weren't you?

136
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,951
No, we weren't.

137
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,746
I was complimenting him on his sweater.

138
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,748
Exactly.

139
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,792
Doo-sik looks like he's better looking,
thanks to the sweater.

140
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,129
Really? Do you love it that much?

141
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,756
-Huh?
-What?

142
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,426
Serves you right for making fun of me.

143
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,720
Shut up.

144
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,764
What the hell is this?

145
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,476
Why? You look good.
Like the three cold beggars.

146
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,853
-Right, Yoon-ah?
-Totally.

147
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,023
You look very cool and sexy, Dong-goo.

148
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,984
You too? It's humiliating.

149
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,694
What the hell?

150
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,364
But why does Soo-ah want to design
clothes, all of a sudden?

151
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,325
I don't know. She's so passionate about it

152
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,245
that I can't tell her
how I feel about this. It's killing me.

153
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,705
Seriously. What is she thinking?

154
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,333
-Right, Yoon-ah?
-Totally.

155
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,126
It's too much.

156
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,670
-But you know--
-Stop.

157
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,296
What are you all doing here--

158
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,551
What? Why are you all quiet?

159
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,011
You were talking behind my back again,
weren't you?

160
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,137
No, we weren't.

161
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,098
The sweater you designed is so nice

162
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,849
that we were praising it.

163
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,602
She's right.
Soo-ah, your sweater is so sophisticated.

164
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,520
I love it.

165
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,231
Really? Do you love it that much?

166
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,778
What is this?

167
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,363
Why are so sleeves

168
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,907
so long?

169
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,034
Well, this...

170
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,621
is Soorgio Armhany's 2018 S/S
Cutie Collection

171
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,914
Bongsan No. 5.

172
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,751
It's a hooded sweatshirt inspired by
the Bongsan Talchum.

173
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,962
I see.

174
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,757
Don't you think the sleeves
are a bit too long?

175
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,428
That's exactly the point.

176
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,347
Existing hooded sweatshirts
are too ordinary and boring.

177
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,684
So I emphasized the cuteness factor

178
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,769
by unconventionally extending the sleeves.

179
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,855
What do you think?
It's totally cute, isn't it?

180
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,066
Yeah, it sure is. Thanks Soo-ah.

181
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,151
You're welcome.

182
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,320
You have to promise to wear it every day

183
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,280
like walking advertisements, okay?

184
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,490
-Yes.
-Okay.

185
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,242
-Sure.
-Of course.

186
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,411
Hello?

187
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,079
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,665
Pardon? You want me to do what?

189
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,669
Okay, sir. Thank you.

190
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,172
What's going on?

191
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,174
It's my CEO at the agency.

192
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,593
Actor Choi Min-sik was supposed to
throw the ceremonial first pitch,

193
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,803
but he can't do it because of the flu.

194
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,723
He wants me to do it instead.

195
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,561
You'll throw the first pitch?
At a professional baseball game?

196
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,022
-Yeah.
-Congrats, Joon-ki!

197
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,774
Only celebrities are asked to do that.

198
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,359
I know.

199
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,236
Perks of having
a management company, I guess.

200
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,239
-First pitch.
-That's awesome.

201
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,699
Congrats!

202
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,036
Cheng Xiao's tumbling first pitch

203
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,497
and Shin Soo-ji's acrobatic first pitch
became legendary stories.

204
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,415
These unconventional first pitches

205
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,085
raised their likeability factor
by an average of 13 times

206
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,463
and awareness increased
by a whopping 20 times.

207
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,756
Is that so?

208
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,927
They're holding a meeting
just for one ceremonial first pitch?

209
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,222
I guess a huge management company
is different after all.

210
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,808
An unconventional and novel first pitch...

211
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,476
Any ideas?

212
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,938
Since Joon-ki plays an anchor in a drama,

213
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,066
how about he dresses up as Sohn Suk-hee

214
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,819
and throws a mic-shaped ball?

215
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,153
It's uneventful.

216
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,822
Any other ideas?

217
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,490
Nobody?

218
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,661
Look at all these people here.
You've got nothing?

219
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,542
Hi, honey.

220
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,293
Pardon?

221
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,422
You want to learn how to pole dance?

222
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,550
Of course.
You should learn it if you want to.

223
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,802
Okay. Bye.

224
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,471
Wait.

225
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,557
Pole dancing?

226
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,815
So

227
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,777
you want me to practice pole dancing?
Right here?

228
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,239
The CEO doesn't want it to leak
to the press.

229
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,615
Confidentiality is key.

230
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,118
A pole dancing first pitch isn't right.

231
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,495
How can I throw a first pitch
while pole dancing?

232
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,621
This doesn't make sense!

233
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,748
Then what do we do? It's the CEO's idea.

234
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,543
Damn it.

235
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,670
Then shall we begin?

236
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,506
I'll show you a demo, so pay close
attention and follow me, okay?

237
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,091
Okay.

238
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,721
Gosh.

239
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,935
What do you think? Looks easy, right?

240
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,062
No, it looks impossible.

241
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,355
Excuse me.

242
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,942
With practice,
you'll be able to do it in no time.

243
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,819
First, let's try hanging.

244
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,529
Hanging?

245
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,952
No fooling around.

246
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,913
Work your arms and try again.

247
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,834
Ow, that burns. Hey.

248
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,960
Again.

249
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,588
Again.

250
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,633
Ma'am!

251
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,802
Save me! Ma'am!

252
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,722
Goodness, I'm dying.

253
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,224
Gosh.

254
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,852
I'm aching all over after
hanging from a pole all day long.

255
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,729
Do you have to do this?

256
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,649
What choice do I have?
It was the CEO's idea.

257
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,567
I'm worried you'll get hurt.

258
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,279
I'm fine.
At least it's a great opportunity.

259
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,990
I... Ouch.

260
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,159
I'm going to work hard and make it big.

261
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,079
Then I'll be able to give you

262
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,956
everything you want.

263
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,750
Goodness. I'm so grateful I may cry.

264
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,753
Hey, Bacca.

265
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,714
I don't think these patches are enough.

266
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,132
I need more.

267
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,551
What do you need?

268
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,429
For goodness' sake!

269
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,807
Why did you hit me?

270
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,685
Hit me with your lips instead!

271
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,811
Forget it.

272
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,647
-Forget what? Please?
-Forget it.

273
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,069
We aren't getting any orders lately.

274
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,571
Look at this.

275
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,865
I knew we wouldn't get a single order.

276
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,284
I'm afraid someone I know may see it.

277
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,203
I should ask Soo-ah
to take the pictures down.

278
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,500
Hey Soo-ah. Can you...

279
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,131
I guess she's pretty serious about this.

280
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,925
She shouldn't be sleeping like this.

281
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,724
That stinks!

282
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,850
Damn, what did you eat?

283
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,811
What...

284
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,524
What are you doing here, Doo-sik?

285
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,567
No reason. Why?

286
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,572
Why are you laughing?

287
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,532
Well...

288
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,868
I dreamed about farting just now.

289
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,248
It was so vivid as if I'd actually farted.

290
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,043
I'm sure it was.

291
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,294
How could it not be?

292
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,338
Hey, Director Bong.

293
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,965
Are we getting any orders
for the clothes I designed?

294
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,801
No, not yet.

295
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,219
I see.

296
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,222
Why won't anyone buy them?

297
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,891
Are my designs that bad?

298
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,395
It's because people
don't know about it yet.

299
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,313
Cheer up.

300
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,565
-That must be why, right?
-Yeah.

301
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,525
How can we advertise it?

302
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,028
I know!

303
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,497
-Oh, my God.
-Look at him.

304
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,124
Hello.
This is Soorgio Armhany's new product,

305
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,127
the Ultra V-neck Sweater.
Please come take a look.

306
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,045
2018 S/S VINTAGE COLLECTION

307
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,129
Please take a look.

308
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,633
Isn't this great? It's so wonderful.
Sexy, right?

309
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,302
Ladies, come take a look.

310
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,553
Thank you.

311
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,973
Please take a look before you go.

312
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,641
Doo-sik.

313
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,479
Thank you.
We're Soorgio Armhany Mall.

314
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,857
Min Soo-ah, you're unbelievable.

315
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,567
This is too much.

316
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,903
It's so humiliating.

317
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,247
-You're pretty good now.
-Right?

318
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,249
I practiced all night.
I can finally do it!

319
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,628
But I'm not sure how it'll go
when I have to pitch the ball as well.

320
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,423
Do you want me to help you?

321
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,424
It's my day off.

322
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,093
Really? That'd be awesome!

323
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,346
My angel!

324
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,308
Let's have fun at the playground
with mommy, okay?

325
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,659
Tae-rin, let's go to
a different playground.

326
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,212
-Joon-ki.
-Yeah?

327
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,338
Shall we do this?

328
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,218
You sure you'll be all right?
You've never played baseball before.

329
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,387
Don't worry. I'm sure I'll catch on.

330
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,972
Throw the ball to me.

331
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,141
Are you sure? I'll really do it, then.

332
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,523
Seo-jin!

333
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,069
Seo-jin! Are you okay?

334
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,280
No worries, man. I'm fine. Try it again.

335
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,034
-I'll go again, then, okay?
-Okay.

336
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,077
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,418
Wait a sec.

338
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,633
-Sorry.
-You're doing great!

339
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,268
Your turn now.

340
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,956
Designing's no easy task.

341
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,630
How long do we have to wear this for?

342
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,298
It's so embarrassing!

343
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,008
Don't let Soo-ah know how you feel.

344
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,468
She's been working really hard.

345
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
Still, this isn't right.

346
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,431
Who would pay for this shit?
Don't you agree?

347
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,267
It might be better for Soo-ah
if we tell her

348
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,769
so we can get her to give up.

349
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,813
You can't let her order us around.

350
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,107
-I mean--
-Oh, my God.

351
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,316
Soo-ah.

352
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,653
I didn't know that's what you thought.

353
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,407
-Soo-ah, the thing is--
-I'm sorry.

354
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,825
I'm sorry I made you look like shit.

355
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,579
-Soo-ah...
-You've got it all wrong.

356
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,581
-Soo-ah.
-That's not it.

357
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,999
-Soo-ah.
-Soo-ah.

358
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,337
Sorry, Soo-ah.

359
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,340
I didn't mean to say you weren't talented.

360
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,010
It's just your design is so unconventional

361
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,470
that I can't pull it off.

362
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,264
He's right. Your clothes are great.

363
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,391
It's our bodies that are to blame.

364
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,685
Forget it. You guys are right.

365
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,645
What was I thinking?

366
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,941
-Oh! What's that sound?
-It must be an order.

367
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,860
That's great.

368
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,030
-Huh?
-What is it?

369
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,156
Look at this.

370
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,158
Someone bought my V-neck sweater!

371
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,285
-They want five of them!
-Five?

372
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,622
Look! The hooded sweatshirt, too!

373
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,209
So people who buy that stuff do exist.

374
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,214
What did I tell you? Unconventional styles
are all the rage these days!

375
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,549
Who are you kidding?
You don't know a thing about fashion.

376
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,637
Sorry. I didn't know
what I was talking about.

377
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,055
I know.

378
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,183
We didn't even realize what an honor
it was to wear this awesome sweater.

379
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,855
Really?
There's this new product I designed...

380
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,482
-Do you want it?
-What?

381
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,900
What?

382
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,324
-Soo-ah.
-Yeah?

383
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,326
What kind of shorts are these?

384
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,248
They're from the Soorgio Armhany
2018 S/S Sexy Collection.

385
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,707
Ultra Fire Hot Pants.

386
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,543
I shortened
the length of the shorts drastically

387
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,379
to boost sex appeal.

388
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,631
-How do you like it?
-It's great.

389
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,259
Sexy and cool.

390
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,510
And embarrassing.

391
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,970
Hey, Soo-ah.

392
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,348
Don't you think this is too short?

393
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,976
That's exactly the point.

394
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,521
Anyway, it's a special gift from me,

395
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,816
so make sure you wear it every day, okay?

396
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,318
-Okay.
-Of course.

397
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,488
They look really good.

398
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,412
You'll do well today, right?

399
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,957
Of course. My Bacca helped me out so much.

400
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,750
I'll do a good job for sure.

401
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,963
But I think I'd do better if you came
to cheer me on.

402
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,924
Sorry, I have a story to cover today.

403
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,719
It's okay. Work comes first.

404
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,803
Instead...

405
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,141
-Ta-da!
-What's this?

406
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,393
-A mustache?
-It's a lucky charm.

407
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,311
Give me your hand.

408
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,440
Even though I'm not there,

409
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,775
you can look at this
and think of me, okay?

410
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,736
Thank you.

411
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,487
You know I'm your number one fan, right?

412
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,073
Don't forget I'm always cheering you on.

413
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,450
Okay.

414
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,286
And I have another present for you.

415
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,787
What is it?

416
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,501
Good luck today! I'm off to work.

417
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,086
Good luck!

418
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,212
Bye!

419
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,131
Good luck!

420
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,638
Darn it.

421
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,141
I have to go into the office,

422
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,728
but I can't go looking like this.
Seriously.

423
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,732
This won't do.
I'll get changed and go out the window.

424
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,943
Director Bong, can I borrow your lap--

425
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,572
What are you doing?

426
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,408
Don't tell me you're taking that off.

427
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,412
No, I was putting it on.

428
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,165
I love your clothes oh so much.

429
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,584
Really? By the way, where's Doo-sik?

430
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,795
He went out to meet a friend.

431
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,509
Yes, Director--

432
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,720
Yes, I'm coming now. I'm on my way.

433
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,765
I'll be right there! Sorry.

434
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,059
Are you going into the office? See you.

435
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,560
Yeah, sure.

436
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,107
Go on now. Make sure to spread the word.

437
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,441
Okay.

438
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,904
-Why?
-I need to take something out.

439
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,823
See you later!

440
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,951
Where's that laptop?

441
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,177
What's this?

442
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,184
Here. The clothes you asked me to get.

443
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,727
Thanks man.

444
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,856
What the hell is Soorgio Armhany?

445
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,482
Why do you keep asking me
to order clothes?

446
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,570
It's a long story. Anyway,
I'm sorry to keep bothering you.

447
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,740
What the hell are you wearing?
Is that underwear? It's so embarrassing.

448
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,034
People are staring at you.

449
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,370
What's wrong with this? It's great.

450
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,415
Unconventional styles are in these days.

451
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,749
That's right.

452
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,544
Do you want one? Try it.

453
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,629
Try it. If you like it,
recommend it to other people, okay?

454
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,173
Try it on. It's fine.

455
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,550
-Are you embarrassed? Try it.
-Stop it!

456
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,844
-Come on.
-I don't want it!

457
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,523
You can start over.

458
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,734
It's not too late to find

459
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,820
what it is that will make you happy
for the rest of your life.

460
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,823
-You think I can do it?
-I'll help you with the studying.

461
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,950
-Soo-ah, here we go!
-Here we go!

462
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,829
I'm going to start
an online shopping mall.

463
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,788
I'm Armhany!

464
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,043
How can the director leave
when the CEO is here like this?

465
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,530
-Hey Soo-ah. What are you doing here?
-Huh?

466
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,450
-Nothing, why?
-What's with your attitude?

467
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,454
I borrowed this video game from a friend.
How about we play for ramyun?

468
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,290
No, I'm too tired.

469
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,458
You pig!

470
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,876
What?

471
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,755
Did you call me a pig? Out of nowhere?

472
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,298
That nutjob.

473
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,135
Did you practice a lot?

474
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,137
Yes, I gave it my all.

475
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,390
Well done. Mark my words.

476
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,933
After this, you'll become a star.

477
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,310
-So do well, okay?
-Yes, sir!

478
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,353
-His wardrobe?
-Yes, here.

479
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:04,896
Here you go.

480
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,277
What? How... How did this get here?

481
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,571
Wow, looks great.
It's perfect for pole dancing.

482
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,657
May I ask where you got this?

483
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,452
Oh, this. There's this online shopping
site that's hot between us stylists.

484
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,788
-It's called Soorgio Armhany Mall.
-Sorry?

485
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,373
Soorgio Armhany Mall is hot?

486
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,459
Yes! On top of that, the owner recently
launched her own brand.

487
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,295
The designs are amazing.

488
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:32,340
-Unconventional and sexy, don't you think?
-Yeah... I guess.

489
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,012
Good job on the interview.

490
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,014
Since we're done for the day,

491
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,474
do you want to go get dinner?

492
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,685
Pardon? Actually...

493
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,104
If you don't have any more work for me,

494
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,315
do you mind if I went somewhere
real quick?

495
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,318
-I have somewhere I need to be.
-Okay, sure.

496
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,696
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

497
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,490
Bye.

498
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,122
You showed us a shocking pole dancing
first pitch today.

499
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,000
The response is overwhelming.

500
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,210
Where did you get such an idea?

501
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,630
The CEO of my agency gave me the idea

502
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,342
and many others have helped,

503
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,302
allowing me to pull it off perfectly.

504
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,474
Seo-jin.

505
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,435
-Hello, sir.
-What are you doing here?

506
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,730
I, uh... I stopped by because I was
in the area.

507
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,733
I'm sure pole dancing wasn't easy.

508
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,151
Wasn't it difficult to learn?

509
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,905
It was, of course, difficult but so many
people helped me out.

510
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,158
There's one person in particular
who helped catch my balls every day.

511
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,328
I would like to tell that person

512
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,872
that I'm grateful for their help.

513
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,292
Is that person your girlfriend,
by any chance?

514
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,460
She is, right?

515
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,546
Sorry? Girlfriend?

516
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,973
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

517
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,436
Oh, really? Then who is your ideal type?

518
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,729
I'm not sure...

519
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,609
Please support pole dancing!

520
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,492
Joon-ki is still at the top
of the most-searched list!

521
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,619
"Pole dancing first pitch"
is second place.

522
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,371
Third is "Thong Thoon Theok."

523
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,748
You're a real star, Joon-ki.

524
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,292
Pole dancing first pitch
actually worked, huh?

525
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,712
I had no idea the response
would be this great.

526
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,842
What a peculiar world we live in.

527
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,137
One thing is bothering me though.

528
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,473
-What?
-You don't have a girlfriend?

529
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,977
Sounds like you want
that funeral of yours, does it not?

530
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,647
What happened is...

531
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,400
my CEO said I should never reveal
that I have a girlfriend.

532
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,194
He was so adamant about it
that I had no choice.

533
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,114
Seo-jin, I'm really sorry.

534
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,408
I should've told you in advance.

535
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,077
No, it's fine.

536
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,454
What can we do?

537
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,164
Thanks for understanding.

538
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,709
Joon-ki. Why did you wear this outfit?

539
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,794
Isn't this Soo-ah's?

540
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,130
My stylist brought me this.

541
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,216
Apparently Soo-ah Mall is really hot
among stylists.

542
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,094
-Are you serious?
-Really.

543
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,973
She was telling me how Soo-ah
will become Korea's Coco Chanel...

544
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,725
Coco Chanel? Really?

545
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,314
Hey Joon-ki, I really enjoyed
watching your first pitch.

546
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,191
The response is incredible.

547
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,108
Thank you, sir.

548
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,526
I'm the one who's grateful.

549
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,154
You promoted our drama as well.

550
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,906
Oh, right. Did you see the script?

551
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,574
Yes, I did.

552
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,744
How do you feel about
acting opposite Cindy,

553
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,120
the goddess of middle-aged men?

554
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,164
It's an honor, sir.

555
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,333
Who are all those people?

556
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,251
They're Cindy's fans.

557
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,629
So they're the middle-aged fans
I've only heard about.

558
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,881
She must really be popular.

559
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,634
-Cindy!
-Look, it's Cindy!

560
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,552
-Hey, Cindy!
-Hi!

561
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,970
Cindy!

562
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,557
-Cindy, I'm here!
-Cindy!

563
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,939
MY CINDY
I LOVE YOU CINDY

564
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,065
Cindy!

565
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,029
Cindy! Cindy!

566
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,491
-Cindy!
-Cindy forever!

567
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,327
Cindy! Cindy!

568
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,162
In this next scene,

569
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,749
rookie reporter Hye-na will meet
her first love, Song Joon-seok.

570
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,836
Hye-na runs to Joon-seok and hugs him

571
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,712
once she discovers he is there.

572
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,964
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

573
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,258
Okay, we'll start shooting right away.

574
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,969
Let's get rolling.

575
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,349
Okay... Action!

576
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,561
Joon-seok?

577
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,187
Joon-seok!

578
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,441
What... What are you doing?

579
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,737
Hye-na?

580
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,114
It's Hye-na, right?

581
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,157
Joon-seok. It's been a long time.

582
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,494
Cut! Okay, that was great.

583
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,831
-Next we'll go with bust shots.
-Okay.

584
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,917
There's lipstick on your shirt.
I'm sorry.

585
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,836
It happens.

586
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,753
It's fine.

587
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,927
ONLY FLOWER ROAD FOR CINDY

588
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,650
What?
Why are they looking at me like that?

589
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,903
What the hell? It's freaky!

590
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,490
PASTRY AND BAKERY
CERTIFICATION TESTING

591
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,076
God, Buddha...

592
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,872
Please do everything you can to help

593
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,166
Yoon-ah pass her test.

594
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,003
Amen. Amitabha.

595
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,171
Gosh!

596
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,716
Yoon-ah!

597
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,802
Are you done? How did you do?

598
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,933
What's wrong? You didn't do well?

599
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,225
I didn't.

600
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,187
I think I made too many mistakes.

601
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,148
I'm afraid I'll fail.

602
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,068
The results aren't out yet.

603
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,444
You'll be fine.

604
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,740
I worked so hard for this.

605
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:35,286
I wanted to pass for Sol's sake.

606
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,543
Don't cry.

607
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,879
Don't worry. You'll pass.

608
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,089
Stop crying. Come on.

609
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
Dong-goo...

610
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,512
Goodness.

611
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,682
You'll be fine, all right?

612
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,855
It's okay.

613
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,490
MISFORTUNE IS ALWAYS

614
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,367
Joon-seok!

615
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,911
What?

616
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,122
Joon-ki is hugging the great Cindy?

617
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,999
What's going on?

618
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,751
Gosh. It's just acting.

619
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,920
Anyway, Seo-jin must be bothered.

620
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,838
Are you jealous?

621
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,632
Jealous, my ass. It's only acting.

622
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,551
She's right.

623
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,136
My Bacca isn't that narrow-minded.

624
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,971
That's right.

625
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,515
Let's have dinner Sunday at that place
we couldn't go to last time.

626
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,184
It's okay. I know you're busy.

627
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,395
No, it's fine.
It's your birthday of all days.

628
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,313
We have to celebrate.

629
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,025
I'll keep my promise no matter what,

630
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,776
so make time, okay?

631
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,111
Okay.

632
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,446
It's your birthday?

633
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,533
You don't even know
your only sister's birthday?

634
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,411
I shouldn't expect anything from you.

635
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,708
I'm going to go buy groceries.

636
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,339
What's up with Yoon-ah?

637
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,801
She didn't do well on her exam.

638
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,970
She's been like that for days.

639
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,556
You should go on a date
and make her feel better.

640
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,892
I tried, but it didn't work.

641
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,102
Do you have any good ideas?

642
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,271
In this situation,
the most important thing is...

643
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,983
that you figure it out, punk.

644
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,610
I'm off to a shoot. Bye.

645
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,487
That...

646
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,035
Sorry, Joon-ki.

647
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,204
The car broke down on my way
to pick you up.

648
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,539
It's okay. I can take a cab.

649
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,000
Don't worry about it. See you on set.

650
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,421
Taxi!

651
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,590
Oh, my God!

652
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,217
What the hell?

653
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,719
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

654
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,639
I was watering my plant,
and it fell by mistake.

655
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,516
You should've been careful...

656
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,227
I almost got hurt!

657
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,938
I'm really sorry. Sorry!

658
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,147
Forget it.

659
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,818
Goodness, that scared me.

660
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,654
Taxi!

661
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,367
Hello, welcome.

662
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,535
Where shall I take you?

663
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,537
JBC broadcasting station, please.

664
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,123
I've seen your face before.

665
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,333
You recognized me.

666
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,335
Is it because of my pole dancing pitch?

667
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,587
Pole dancing pitch? What's that?

668
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,881
You don't know?

669
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,259
Then you must watch Newsroom.

670
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,552
Newsroom?

671
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,638
Oh, you're Song Joon-seok.

672
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,058
You hugged Cindy...

673
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,853
Wow, you even remember by scenes.

674
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,313
Yes, that's right. It's me.

675
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,191
Would you like an autograph?

676
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,234
Forget it.

677
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,194
Leaving now.

678
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,539
How can you get car sick in a cab?

679
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,584
Don't even start.

680
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,837
The cab driver was speeding so much
that I thought I was going to die.

681
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,755
It's strange.

682
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,135
Earlier I almost died because
a plant pot fell and almost hit my head.

683
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,262
Today must be unlucky for you.

684
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,181
That must be it.

685
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,474
Wait.

686
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,060
That cab driver

687
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,313
looks familiar.

688
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,940
You hugged Cindy...

689
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,943
Cindy! You're so beautiful, Cindy!

690
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,530
I'm right. It's him!
One of Cindy's middle-aged fans!

691
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,241
What? The cab driver was a fan of Cindy's?

692
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,159
Yeah.

693
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,786
He's one of the fans who came
to cheer her on the set.

694
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,788
Wait.

695
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,207
Oh, my God!

696
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,625
Are you all right?

697
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,002
Cindy!

698
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,382
What the hell? The one who dropped the pot
is also Cindy's fan!

699
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,801
No way. You're imagining things.

700
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,053
I'm serious!

701
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,307
Are they retaliating against me
because of the hugging scene with Cindy?

702
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,393
That doesn't make any sense.
They wouldn't harass you like that.

703
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,813
You think?

704
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,784
Why would I? Bong Doo-sik?
Seriously?

705
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:28,412
Is he good looking?
Does he have a good body? Goodness.

706
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,500
Then again...

707
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,211
he is kind of cute.

708
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,339
What am I saying? I'm losing it!

709
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,675
I must be crazy. Seriously!

710
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,261
Come to your senses, Soo-ah.
You were never like this.

711
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,428
What are you doing?

712
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,097
Why are you looking at my picture?

713
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,685
I wasn't. You're so ugly,
I was deleting you from the hard disk.

714
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,228
What? You're seriously...

715
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,772
Be quiet and leave.

716
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,774
I don't want to look at you
because you're ugly, you pig!

717
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,192
What? Pig?

718
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,653
Why do you keep calling me a pig?
Are you insane?

719
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,408
I don't want to talk to you,
so leave, you pig!

720
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,202
Fine. I'm leaving, you punk!

721
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,161
Go nuts farting!

722
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:17,461
Look at that. He's so ugly
and has a temper to boot.

723
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,090
But... he's manly.

724
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,717
Very sexy.

725
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,429
What am I saying? I must be crazy...

726
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,847
No, Soo-ah. No!

727
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,475
So cool.

728
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,477
FIRST PITCH

729
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,604
Well done, Joon-ki.

730
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,070
ACTOR LEE JOON-KI,
"I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND"

731
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,411
Hey, stop slacking off.
What are you doing?

732
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,664
Oh, Lee Joon-ki!

733
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,333
He's really popular these days.

734
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,168
Are you a fan of his as well?

735
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,462
Yes.

736
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,505
See, Joon-ki is my--

737
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,552
No, he's my brother's friend.

738
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,803
Really?

739
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,096
That's great.

740
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,891
Then I'll ask you if ever
we need to interview him.

741
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,602
-Sure.
-Okay.

742
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,276
What will I wear on my date
with Joon-ki this week?

743
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,531
This is the studio of the rapper
who'll work on our soundtrack?

744
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,700
His name is MC Dacopy.

745
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,285
He's the next big thing in the rap world.

746
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,455
His raps are awesome.

747
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,665
Dacopy, I see.

748
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,002
Here he is. Hello.

749
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,802
Who's this?

750
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,222
This is Kang Dong-goo.
He's the assistant director.

751
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,682
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

752
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,853
-Bump it.
-Okay.

753
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,398
Nice to meet you.

754
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,275
How's it going with the music?

755
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,694
Yeah, so-so.

756
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,447
I was told it's a spy movie
based in Dubai,

757
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,242
so I prepared a few samples
that fit the concept.

758
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,202
Would you like to listen?

759
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,370
Yeah, let's.

760
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,466
This time, Hye-na suddenly shows up
at Joon-seok's place.

761
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,052
You look at him with tears in your eyes

762
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,264
and all of a sudden, you kiss him!

763
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,099
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

764
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,350
Let's start shooting, then.

765
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,477
-Make it believable.
-Yes, sir.

766
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,354
Let's get rolling!

767
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,983
Okay... Action!

768
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,651
Who is it?

769
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,196
Hye-na... What's the matter?

770
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,614
Joon-seok...

771
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,159
Come in. Let's talk inside.

772
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,004
Cut!

773
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,088
Are you okay?

774
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,091
-What the hell do you think you're doing?
-Sorry, Director.

775
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,011
-Are you okay, Joon-ki?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

776
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,393
Cindy?

777
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,646
What, Cindy? Don't tell me...

778
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,773
Let's start at the kiss.

779
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,692
Yes, sir.

780
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,862
Okay... Action!

781
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,118
Are you all right?

782
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,786
What is it? What's going on?

783
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,123
-Joon-ki! Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

784
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,209
Focus, everyone!

785
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,294
What's wrong with you today?

786
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,379
I don't know what happened...

787
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,881
Sorry, Joon-ki.

788
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,841
It's okay.

789
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,765
What? Cindy?

790
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,350
Is he also...

791
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,977
Are you all right?

792
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,315
Yes, I'm fine.

793
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,984
Let's take a break
until lighting is set up.

794
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,819
Joon-ki, take a break.

795
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,452
This isn't right. Something's wrong!

796
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,162
Joon-ki, are you okay?

797
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,497
Something's wrong.

798
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,833
I think the audio and lighting staff
are all Cindy's fans!

799
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,293
This again?

800
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,004
I'm serious! Something's going on!

801
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,590
Calm down and drink this.

802
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,592
Thanks.

803
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,560
What's wrong with this? Gosh.

804
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,774
Hey! This is one year past expiration!

805
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,527
Really? I'm sorry.

806
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,861
I bought it from the store.

807
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,863
Forget it.

808
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,950
I'm not scheduled
to work on Sunday, right?

809
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,327
I have important plans.

810
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,245
-Sunday?
-Yeah.

811
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,413
Hold on.

812
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,415
Sunday...

813
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,876
MY LOVE CINDY

814
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:12,047
Cindy? Then my manager... You too?

815
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,051
-What's the matter?
-It's nothing.

816
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,929
Are you okay?
Do you want a cup of coffee to wake up?

817
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,431
No, I won't drink it! Never!

818
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,266
Why are you getting angry?

819
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,690
Joon-ki!

820
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,576
That's right.

821
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,411
Park Seo-joon is my type.

822
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,247
Doo-sik is totally not it.

823
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,165
How dare he?

824
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,586
How handsome. Oh, my.

825
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,893
What's wrong with me?

826
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,228
I'm crazy, I really am.

827
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,147
Min Soo-ah, you're crazy for sure!

828
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,816
What are you doing?

829
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,029
Why the hell do you care
what I do, you pig!

830
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,573
Pig, again? Soo-ah!

831
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,866
Why am I a pig?

832
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,368
You foolish punk!

833
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,453
What a psycho. She's a total nutcase.

834
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,621
Goodness.

835
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,707
Joon-ki, what's wrong?

836
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,126
Doo-sik, I'm so scared.

837
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,170
Scared? What are you scared of?

838
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,132
What? You think Cindy's fans
are terrorizing you?

839
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,135
That's what I'm saying.
When something strange happens,

840
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,303
it's because of Cindy's fans.

841
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,056
I'm afraid her fans
are retaliating against me

842
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,683
because we have a relationship
on the show.

843
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,434
Geez, that doesn't make any sense.

844
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,644
You're being paranoid.

845
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,189
No, I'm not!
Something's definitely going on.

846
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,274
Stop it. Go to bed and sleep.

847
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,652
-You're too tired is all.
-Really?

848
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,445
Is that it?

849
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,323
-I'll feel better once I sleep, right?
-Yeah, go.

850
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,742
Okay, then.

851
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,288
It's so dangerous outside the covers!

852
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,665
So dangerous!

853
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,339
I'LL KILL YOU JOON-KI
GET AWAY FROM CINDY

854
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,217
Joon-ki! What happened?

855
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,388
Look at this! Threatening letters
from one of Cindy's fans!

856
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,390
He must've been in my room!

857
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,726
It's dangerous even inside the covers!

858
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,897
Joon-ki, where are you going?

859
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,941
What's wrong with him?

860
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,740
GET AWAY FROM CINDY
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

861
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,753
MY LOVE CINDY

862
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,595
What are you up to?

863
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,139
I brought a sundae, your favorite.

864
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,057
Thank you.

865
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,357
Are you still down because of the exam?

866
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,443
No, I'm fine.

867
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,403
You're busy with work, right?

868
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:26,200
Yes. I leave for Dubai in a week,
but there's so much to take care of.

869
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,160
You'll be gone for a month, right?

870
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,369
Yeah.

871
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,790
I'm going to miss you and Sol so much.

872
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,083
Shall I stay?

873
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,711
What are you saying?

874
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,755
Take care of yourself while you're gone.

875
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,006
You know,

876
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,884
I'm just worried I may fall
for another woman.

877
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,974
It was a joke. To make you laugh.

878
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,643
Sorry.

879
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,189
I met someone hilarious today.
Do you want to hear the story?

880
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,899
Who'd you meet?

881
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,902
I met the rap artist who'll work on
the soundtrack for our movie.

882
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,781
But all his songs sound very familiar.

883
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,951
Psy, Big Bang and iKon songs
with new lyrics.

884
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,745
They sounded exactly the same.

885
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,163
Really?

886
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,831
What was his name again?

887
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,708
MC Dacopy?

888
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,505
Maybe that's why he copies everything!
Since he copied all the songs?

889
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,006
MC Dacopy?

890
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,008
Why? Do you know him?

891
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,220
Of course! He's the rap artist
I admire most!

892
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,932
I dreamed of becoming a rapper
because of him.

893
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,559
Really?

894
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,562
It's a dream of mine to meet him someday.

895
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,522
Shall I get you to meet him?

896
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,734
Are you serious? I'd love that!

897
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,153
Goodness. Look at you smile.

898
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,071
Are you that happy?

899
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,365
I'm so happy.

900
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,451
Thank you, Dong-goo.
Thank you so much!

901
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,953
Goodness.

902
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,832
Oh, my God!

903
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,127
-Hello.
-Hello.

904
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,212
Hello.

905
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,339
Hi, Joon-ki.

906
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,050
You must be tired.
Would you like some coffee?

907
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,469
Yeah, thanks.

908
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,822
Forget it. I won't drink it!

909
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,585
Why are you eating alone?

910
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,669
Let me join you.

911
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,672
I'm fine.

912
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,342
-You have a grain of rice on your cheek.
-Huh?

913
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,738
Give it!

914
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,199
I left it there on purpose
so I could eat it later!

915
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,867
Don't touch me!

916
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,467
Oh, my God!

917
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,135
Cindy?

918
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,680
You startled me.

919
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,516
Are you upset with me about something?

920
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,769
No, I'm not upset.

921
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,063
Then why do you keep avoiding me?

922
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,108
You won't even talk to me or greet me.

923
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,194
Did I do something wrong?

924
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,113
No, that's not it.

925
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,740
Please tell me
if I've done something wrong.

926
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,702
I'll fix it. Please?

927
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,374
Are you crying?

928
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,796
Actually...

929
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,173
What's wrong?

930
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,134
My eyelash got in my eye.

931
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,345
What? Let me take a look.

932
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:31,570
All done. I just finished updating
the new products.

933
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,779
Goodness.

934
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,865
What's Soo-ah doing?
Why are you always working alone?

935
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,534
I don't know. She's one evil boss.

936
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,162
She always slacks off and calls me a pig
for no reason.

937
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,204
I think she's nuts.

938
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,749
She's never been normal.

939
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,417
I guess that's true.

940
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,461
Now that I'm done,

941
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,046
shall I go increase the number of hits

942
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,466
-for President is Bruce Lee?
-Goodness.

943
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,471
What's this? Joon-ki's at the top of
the searched word list again.

944
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,432
Is he the same Lee Joon-ki I know?

945
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,895
What's this?

946
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,646
"Cindy and Lee Joon-ki in love?"

947
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,440
"Scene of their secret date?"

948
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,902
What? What are you talking about?

949
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,069
Well...

950
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,071
Huh?

951
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,282
What is this?

952
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:21,119
I don't know. What the hell happened?

953
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,247
I'm home.

954
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,208
What are you guys doing?

955
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,794
Something interesting going on?
Let me see.

956
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,962
I want to see as well.

957
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,675
Guys... What is this?

958
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,803
Joon-ki, what happened?

959
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,805
-Did you kiss Cindy?
-Huh?

960
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,724
No, I didn't kiss her.

961
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,226
That's not it. Really.

962
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,061
This is a misunderstanding.

963
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,604
What about the picture?

964
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,817
Well... she got an eyelash in her eye
and I was helping her get it out.

965
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,361
I'm serious.

966
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,530
Seo-jin, you believe me, right?

967
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,032
Oh, is that what happened?

968
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,909
I knew it.

969
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,119
This is driving me crazy.

970
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,372
Who the hell wrote an article like that?

971
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,332
Seo-jin, don't worry.

972
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,960
I'll issue a correction report
and fix this right away.

973
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,044
Okay.

974
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,389
CEO

975
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,356
Hello, sir. Did you see the article?

976
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,483
Yes, it's a misunderstanding.

977
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,777
There's nothing going on with Cindy.

978
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,487
We'll have to issue a correction
right away.

979
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,114
What do you mean?

980
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,241
Why would we do that? Leave it.

981
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,660
Excuse me? Why?

982
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,954
Joon-ki. Who is Cindy?

983
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,373
She's the nation's younger sister.

984
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,001
A scandal with Cindy will raise
awareness about you

985
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,588
and become an issue. There's no downside.

986
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,298
But still...

987
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,676
Just do as I say for now.

988
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,512
I'll issue a statement
at the right time, got it?

989
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,513
Excuse me...

990
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,640
Sir?

991
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,102
This is nuts.

992
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,524
Goodness.

993
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,650
LEE JOON-KI AND CINDY SCANDAL

994
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,277
He's still number one.

995
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,362
The articles are increasing by the second.

996
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,575
What happened?
Is he issuing the correction?

997
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,285
Well...

998
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,079
He told me to just sit still.

999
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,998
-What?
-Well...

1000
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:34,085
A scandal with Cindy will help raise
awareness about me.

1001
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,922
He said to leave it alone.

1002
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,382
This is killing me.

1003
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:41,927
Really?

1004
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,721
You have no choice, then.

1005
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,223
Joon-ki. I'm okay,
so don't worry about it.

1006
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,560
Joon-ki, this is too much.

1007
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,437
What did Seo-jin ever do to you?

1008
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,775
She can't say you're her boyfriend
and she needs to put up with your scandal.

1009
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,485
It's too much, don't you think?

1010
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,112
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

1011
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,697
I really am.

1012
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,907
It's okay.

1013
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,575
It's not like you planned it.

1014
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,995
But Joon-ki. Her fans went crazy

1015
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,372
because you hugged her.

1016
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:14,167
Now that you're in a scandal with her,
they might actually kill you.

1017
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,462
You're right. What'll I do?

1018
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,339
I have to throw Seo-jin
a birthday party tomorrow.

1019
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,633
Come on, we can do that at home.

1020
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,386
No, I made reservations and everything.

1021
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,056
And it's your birthday of all days.
I can't just let it pass.

1022
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,975
I'll do whatever it takes,

1023
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,435
so let's go on that date tomorrow. Okay?

1024
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,729
Okay.

1025
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,235
This is awesome. Amazing.

1026
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,283
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1027
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,494
Thanks for making the time.

1028
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,499
I had no idea the AD's girlfriend

1029
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,459
was a fan of mine.

1030
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,336
I never imagined it either.

1031
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,090
To be honest,
I dreamed of becoming a rapper

1032
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,259
while listening to your music.

1033
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,719
Though I've given up now.

1034
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,055
You wanted to be a rap artist, huh?

1035
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,900
Then how about you record something
since you're here, Yoon-ah?

1036
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,778
Are you serious?

1037
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,947
Give it a shot.

1038
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,949
Making memories.
It's great, don't you think?

1039
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,035
Which song would you like to sing?

1040
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:34,706
I really love "Mapo BRDG,"
your number one hit.

1041
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,041
May I try singing it?

1042
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,334
Get in the recording booth.

1043
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,170
Okay!

1044
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,385
Yoon-ah, we'll begin right now.

1045
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,137
-Yes.
-Don't be nervous.

1046
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,565
What the hell? This is the same
as Zion.T's "Yanghwa BRDG."

1047
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:04,152
Wow. You're really something, aren't you?

1048
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,622
I was always alone in this house

1049
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,208
My mother was a bus driver

1050
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,794
If I ask "Where are you"

1051
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,962
She was always at Mapo Bridge

1052
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,507
Let's be happy

1053
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,759
Let's be happy

1054
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,303
Let's not be sad

1055
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,473
Let's not be sad

1056
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,517
Hold on, Yoon-ah.

1057
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,935
Pardon? Is something wrong?

1058
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,437
The way you're singing right now

1059
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,855
is a bit like Zion.T.

1060
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,818
I think you're getting confused
with Zion.T's "Yanghwa BRDG,"

1061
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,571
but this is my song, "Mapo BRDG,"
it's not "Yanghwa BRDG."

1062
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,741
I'm sorry.

1063
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,702
Don't sing like Zion.T. Understood?

1064
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,580
-Understood.
-Let's go again.

1065
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,637
I was always alone in this house

1066
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,640
My mother was a bus driver

1067
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,393
If I ask "Where are you"

1068
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,602
She was always at Mapo Bridge

1069
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,856
Let's be happy

1070
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,819
Yoon-ah, you sound like Zion.T again.

1071
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,864
Those two songs are completely different.

1072
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,574
Why do you keep confusing the two?

1073
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,909
Yanghwa Bridge and Mapo Bridge

1074
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,454
are at least one kilometer apart
in distance

1075
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,330
and there's even Seogang Bridge
in between.

1076
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,957
How can you confuse the two?

1077
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,004
Be hap-- Wait, that's not it.

1078
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,798
Let's be happy

1079
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,676
Let's be happy

1080
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,303
Is this so hard?

1081
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,430
I'm sorry.

1082
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,101
One last time, okay?

1083
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,019
Okay.

1084
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,987
Hey, Bacca.

1085
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,991
-You look gorgeous.
-Really?

1086
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,243
I got dolled up for our date.
It's been too long.

1087
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,246
-Do you like it?
-Totally. You look so pretty.

1088
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,416
-Then shall we go?
-Okay.

1089
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,043
I almost forgot. Hold on.

1090
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,216
-What are you doing?
-Just in case.

1091
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,511
My CEO said that I should go out like this
so the reporters don't catch on.

1092
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,137
Really?

1093
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,306
Then let's do this!

1094
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,350
Let's do this!

1095
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,356
Welcome.

1096
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,068
Do you have a reservation?

1097
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,488
-Under Chewbacca.
-This way, please.

1098
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,205
Hold on.

1099
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,456
Here.

1100
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,293
Chair coming in.

1101
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:15,969
Thank you.

1102
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,888
Will you keep that on?

1103
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,098
Of course.

1104
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,184
Oh this! I'll take it off.

1105
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,355
Seo-jin, let's order.

1106
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,941
I'll buy you everything you want.

1107
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,569
Really? I'm so excited.

1108
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,445
What shall we eat?

1109
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,407
Yes, sir. I just arrived.

1110
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,702
I just got done with the interview. Yes.

1111
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,245
Which room are you in again?

1112
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,247
The one on the right? Okay.

1113
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,626
Sorry. I got the rooms mixed up.

1114
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,627
It's fine.

1115
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,475
What shall I have?

1116
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,644
Sirloin? Tenderloin?

1117
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,646
Seo-jin, pick something out.

1118
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,024
-I need to use the restroom.
-Okay, go ahead.

1119
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,067
Sirloin?

1120
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,415
Excuse me.

1121
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,001
You're Lee Joon-ki, aren't you?

1122
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,629
No, you're mistaken.

1123
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,505
You are him.

1124
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,132
I saw you in the room earlier.

1125
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:40,178
Joon-ki, can you please comment
on your scandal with Cindy?

1126
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,179
Do you admit it?

1127
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,972
-I'm not Lee Joon-ki.
-Hey there.

1128
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,517
If you're not,
then you can remove the mask.

1129
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,478
I'll let you go if you're not him.
Just a peek.

1130
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,104
-Gosh.
-Just a little peek.

1131
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,690
Lee Joon-ki! Come here!

1132
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,984
Just one comment please!

1133
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,076
Why isn't he coming back?

1134
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,495
JOON-KI

1135
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,581
It's Joon-ki. Why is he calling?

1136
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,502
Hey. Where are you?

1137
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,630
Seo-jin, I'm being chased by a reporter.

1138
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,133
So I can't go back to the restaurant.
What do we do?

1139
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,051
What?

1140
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,761
I'm really sorry.

1141
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,265
Damn it, she's here.

1142
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,142
I'll see you at home.
Please understand, okay?

1143
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,431
Seo-jin, are you just getting in?

1144
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,267
I'm really sorry about earlier.

1145
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,894
The reporter was waiting for me
in the hallway.

1146
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,815
She kept asking about the scandal.
I had no choice but to run away.

1147
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,485
I'm sorry.

1148
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,867
Come on, Seo-jin. I'm really sorry.

1149
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,164
I have something to say to you.

1150
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,791
Something to say? What is it?

1151
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,462
Let's take some time to think.

1152
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,672
What?

1153
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,843
Time to think about what?

1154
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,804
What do you mean?

1155
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,598
It's just...

1156
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,602
We need to think us over.

1157
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,229
What?

1158
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,359
I can't believe that guy.

1159
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,362
The way I see it, "Yanghwa BRDG"
and "Mapo BRDG" are the same.

1160
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,741
He's the one who plagiarized.
Why's he taking it out on you?

1161
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,661
Yoon-ah, cheer up.

1162
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,371
He's the strange one.

1163
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,041
It's okay. I'm fine.

1164
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,877
I gave up on becoming a rapper anyway.

1165
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,757
You know what, Dong-goo?

1166
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:27,178
Why is there nothing I'm good at?

1167
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,848
I can't bake or rap.

1168
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,350
Come on.

1169
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,394
Why are you being so negative?

1170
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,188
I'm sorry.

1171
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:41,150
I know you're trying hard
to make me feel better.

1172
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,069
I just can't help it.

1173
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,824
What are we going to do with you, woman?

1174
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,537
There's something I prepared for you.

1175
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:53,996
What is it?

1176
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,214
Your scar stays with you, then tears flow

1177
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,715
Even if you're lonely or sad

1178
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,259
Don't cry

1179
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,426
Don't cry, Yoon-ah

1180
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,596
What are you doing right now?

1181
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,765
Look into my eyes, red sun!

1182
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,141
Forget about Dacopy

1183
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,727
Forget it all and run

1184
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,729
Run towards your dream, just go

1185
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,856
Where?

1186
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,734
Wait, let me go again!

1187
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,278
Just go

1188
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,824
You just laughed, right?

1189
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,158
So, you feel better?

1190
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:37,123
It's one tough task to make you laugh.

1191
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,583
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

1192
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,252
Why? You were so good.

1193
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,588
I'm nothing next to you, Yoon-ah.

1194
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,883
Goodness. Sol, did you like my rap?

1195
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,222
CONGRATULATIONS
ON PASSING YOUR EXAM

1196
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,349
What? What is it?

1197
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,268
I passed.

1198
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,146
I passed the certification exam!

1199
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,063
Are you serious?

1200
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,736
See? What did I tell you?
I told you that you'll pass.

1201
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,279
Congratulations, Yoon-ah.

1202
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,572
Thank you.

1203
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,073
Oh, wait.

1204
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,742
We have to celebrate.

1205
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,410
Let's have a party.

1206
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,829
Wait right here, okay?
I'll go get a cake.

1207
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:17,747
But--

1208
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,171
Hey, Yoon-ah.

1209
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,283
What? Sol's dad showed up?

1210
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,534
How did you find me?

1211
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,786
Daddy.

1212
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,621
They say blood is thicker than water
for a reason.

1213
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,374
I'd like to take care of Yoon-ah and Sol.

1214
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,541
You say that now?

1215
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,293
I still love Yoon-ah.

1216
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,671
You can't change anything.

1217
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,255
I'm still Sol's dad.

1218
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,383
I want to be forgiven. Is that wrong?

1219
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,927
Why do I keep thinking about Doo-sik?

1220
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,136
I'm crazy.

1221
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,721
I've completely lost it!

1222
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,266
-Ow. my stomach.
-What's wrong? Are you okay?

1223
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,726
Are you Mr. Bong Doo-sik?

1224
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,479
I have something to tell you.

1225
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,065
I'm afraid I...

1226
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,110
I thought I was a strong person,
but I was wrong.

1227
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,822
You want to throw away
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

1228
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:33,906
Move out.

1229
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,492
So you want to break up with Seo-jin?

1230
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,452
Today, I will honestly tell you

1231
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,539
everything about the scandal with Cindy.
