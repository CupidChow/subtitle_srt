1
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,881
Six Japanese bullets

2
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,217
are lodged inside this body.

3
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,470
From the assassination
of Governor Teruachi

4
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,263
in 1922, Gyeongsang.

5
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,473
There are two holes.

6
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,309
Here, from Hwangpo Port in 1922.

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,936
This, 1927 in Khabarovsk.

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,898
This is from the bombing in Ichigo, 1932.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,859
And this from 1933,
right next to my heart.

10
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,986
You're saying I sold out
three of my friends?

11
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,363
You have no idea...

12
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,492
with what kind of heart I sent them off!

13
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,285
That...

14
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,747
is the evidence that I risked my life.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,873
Your Honor!

16
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,751
Okay. You can leave your profile there.

17
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,462
Yes, sir! I am a new actor, Lee Joon-ki!

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,880
Please remember me.

19
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,133
Excuse me, Director Cho?

20
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,929
We have to start shooting soon...
where can we find an actor that quickly?

21
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:36,846
That's right...

22
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:38,890
Hold on.

23
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,601
You there...

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,438
-Come here for a second.
-Me? Yes.

25
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,863
-What are you doing?
-What's your height and weight?

26
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,782
One hundred eighty one centimeters
and 71 kilograms.

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,575
One hundred eighty one and 71?

28
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,120
Would you like to work on our movie?

29
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,830
We have an open role.

30
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,081
Really?

31
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,417
I'll do my best
in whatever role you give me!

32
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,418
Yeah?

33
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,798
The thing is...
it's actually for a bed scene...

34
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:12,882
body-double.

35
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,718
So, it's not just a bed scene...

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,221
but a bed scene... body-double?

37
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,056
Well, that's a bit...

38
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,976
-Right? Maybe not?
-Yes, I'm not sure I can.

39
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,271
You just have such a similar physique
to our male lead actor's.

40
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,690
I asked just in case. But I understand.
Go on, then.

41
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,191
Yes sir! Good luck!

42
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,694
Dammit.

43
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,405
We booked the place and set up everything.

44
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,699
And Soo-jung thinks
we're shooting that day.

45
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,455
Wait a minute... do you mean Soo-jung...

46
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,375
the essence of innocence,
beautiful woman, actress Shin Soo-jung?

47
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,626
Yeah.

48
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,045
Then the bed scene is also with...
Shin Soo-jung?

49
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,255
Yeah.

50
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,048
Our movie's female lead is Shin Soo-jung.

51
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,300
I can do that bed scene!

52
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,010
I can also be fully unclothed!

53
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,011
All right! Good!

54
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,971
Y'all don't even know!

55
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,979
"JEALOUSY IS MY STRENGTH"

56
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,650
Make sure you apply it thoroughly.

57
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,902
All right.

58
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,154
Pay attention to my back, especially.

59
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,530
The back is important.

60
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,448
Okay, okay!

61
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,783
But you have to keep your promise,
okay?

62
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,077
-Shin Soo-jung's autograph!
-Okay, okay.

63
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,830
Make sure you get in there.
Every nook and cranny.

64
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,373
Stay still, will you?

65
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,250
-I'm home!
-Back! My back!

66
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,379
What is this gross sight?

67
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,256
Joon-ki got cast in a movie.

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,507
He's prepping his skin.

69
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,219
What kind of role requires him
to prep his back?

70
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,637
It's for...

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
a bed scene body-double.

72
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,015
What? A bed scene body-double?

73
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,019
You really are just taking anything.

74
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,145
Let me go a sec.

75
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,688
Hey. What do you mean by that?

76
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,857
Do you know
who I'm doing the bed scene with?

77
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,985
It's Shin Soo-jung! Shin Soo-jung!

78
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,112
Even if I just got hired as staff,
I'd say,

79
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,280
"Oh my, thank you so much!"

80
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,573
Just like that, humbly.

81
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,992
Of course! That's a given.
I mean, it's Shin Soo-jung!

82
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,202
Seriously though...

83
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,039
Guys are all the same.

84
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,168
-I'll be back later.
-Okay.

85
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,461
Where are you going?

86
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,047
Today's your first baking class, right?

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,508
-Yes.
-Have fun.

88
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,469
-Don't doze off. Listen to the teacher.
-Yes.

89
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,097
-You didn't forget anything, right?
-Of course not.

90
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,100
I have both my wallet and my cell phone
right here.

91
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,310
-Do you know how to get there?
-Definitely.

92
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,104
To get to the institute...

93
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,940
-Well...
-Here.

94
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,276
The bus number and name of the stop.

95
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,945
I even wrote the location,
so just follow the instructions.

96
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,323
Thank you, Dong-goo!

97
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,574
I'll see you later.

98
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,160
-Have fun and be safe.
-I will.

99
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,746
-Watch out for cars!
-I will!

100
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,499
What was that?

101
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,002
You two were like newlyweds saying

102
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,336
a melancholy morning goodbye.

103
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,963
Seriously.

104
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,798
You even drew her a map.

105
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,217
Something smells very suspicious.

106
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,970
What're you talking about?

107
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,347
Suspicious, what?
I just didn't want the hassle

108
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,682
of her getting lost again!

109
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,601
What are you sniffing at?

110
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,812
We're just playing around,
don't get all mad.

111
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,188
Why's he like that all of a sudden?

112
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,525
Right?
It makes it seem more suspicious.

113
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,403
Suspicious, whatever.

114
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,822
What, do they think I like Yoon-ah
or something?

115
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,408
This is just mere sympathy.

116
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,452
Something like,
helping out a neighbor-in-need.

117
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,287
Of course, that's it.

118
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,874
My flaw is that I'm so kind-hearted.

119
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,584
Ah, so kind.

120
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,754
First of all...
you're all taking notes, right?

121
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,755
How water crust...

122
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,176
Oh no!

123
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,181
Thank you.

124
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,564
This here will make my skin soft
like a baby's.

125
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,815
Awesome.

126
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,859
Dong-goo, later at home...

127
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,444
rub this all over my bottom, will you?

128
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,820
You crazy? Forget it.

129
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,322
Why are you asking me? You're insane.

130
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,033
Seriously, you're going overboard.

131
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,659
Just do it for me.

132
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,495
Isn't that Yoon-ah?

133
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,499
Thank you for giving me a ride.
Drive safely.

134
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,625
I will.

135
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,962
-Yoon-ah.
-Why are you guys outside?

136
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,297
Are you waiting for me?

137
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,215
Waiting? No way.

138
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,675
We're on our way back
from buying diapers.

139
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,593
Who's that?

140
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,346
I met him at my baking class.

141
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,181
He dropped me off on his way home.

142
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,392
Yoon-ah, you're already getting
so popular!

143
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,644
Popular, my ass.

144
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,355
But why are you getting in the car
with a stranger?

145
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,148
She just said they met in class.

146
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,441
And besides...

147
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,820
what's it matter to you if she
gets a ride from someone or not?

148
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,737
Well, that...

149
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,948
'cause she's being an inconvenience!

150
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,827
Didn't I tell you? Inconveniencing others,
asking for favors--

151
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,078
Can become a habit?

152
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,621
All right, I'll be careful.

153
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,248
Fine, as long as you know!

154
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,585
You jerk, why're you getting so pissed?

155
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,553
What is it? Is it not to your liking?

156
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,764
I think if there was a provocative scene,
it would make it better.

157
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,933
I'm not quite sure what you mean.

158
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,144
Here.

159
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,438
Use this film as a reference.

160
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,565
"Madame Freedom 2017"

161
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,608
"I really want to have fun tonight."

162
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,568
That's right.

163
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,113
Yes, well, I will keep it in mind.

164
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,910
Don't work out too much until the shoot,

165
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,370
and maintain your weight well, okay?

166
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,830
Yes, I will.

167
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,958
The lead male actor will come soon,
so let's match the details

168
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,501
of your hair and skin together.

169
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,463
Don't worry too much.
You guys are pretty similar.

170
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,591
You're here.

171
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,342
Hello, Director.

172
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,385
Say hello.

173
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,097
This is your body-double
for the bed scene, actor Lee Joon-ki.

174
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,224
Hello. I'm Lee Joon-ki.

175
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,226
I'm Kim Woo-seong. Thank you.

176
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,227
I'm a fan of yours.

177
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,567
What's this?

178
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,360
You lost so much weight
in just a few days?

179
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,280
I got a little sick
and suddenly lost a lot of weight,

180
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,407
-but I can't seem to gain it back.
-That's awful...

181
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,242
How much did you lose?

182
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,036
I was originally 71 kilograms,

183
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,663
but when I weighed this morning,
I was 60 kilograms.

184
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,790
What?
Joon-ki, how much do you weigh?

185
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,042
I weigh 71 kilograms.

186
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,629
I think we have to find someone thinner.

187
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,966
What? No, that can't happen.

188
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,137
Director. I'll do it.
I will lose that weight.

189
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,847
You're saying you'll lose 10 kilograms?

190
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,684
By whatever means I have to,
I will lose that weight. Without fail.

191
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,895
You promised to lose 10 kilograms
in one week?

192
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,315
What's the point of losing weight
like that just to shoot one bed scene?

193
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,775
You seriously don't know?

194
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,611
Shin. Soo. Jung.

195
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,488
There's nothing more to say.

196
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:55,076
You'd probably even jump into a fire
to shoot a bed scene with her.

197
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,287
Not just a fire...
I'd even jump off a thousand cliffs.

198
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,580
Exactly.

199
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,582
Yoon-ah? Are you home?

200
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,501
I'm not expecting anyone...

201
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,547
Smells so good...

202
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,341
Sang-hyun, what is all this?

203
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,678
Ah, well... I fried some donuts...

204
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,429
but I made more than expected.

205
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,139
Please, try some.

206
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,810
Thank you!

207
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,688
Yoon-ah, your guest is...?

208
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,816
You gave her a ride earlier, right?

209
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,025
Taking the same baking class?

210
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,193
Yes, that's right.

211
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,820
Hello. I'm Lee Sang-hyun.

212
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,280
Hello! Hello!

213
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,825
You're Sol, aren't you?

214
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,495
You're so cute. Peek-a-boo!

215
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,707
Let's see... you give Yoon-ah rides...

216
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,542
drop off donuts for her...

217
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,294
are you by chance interested in her?

218
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,211
Green light?

219
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,132
Yes. I...

220
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,218
am interested in Yoon-ah.

221
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,270
These are just my personal feelings,
so don't worry too much yet, please.

222
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,273
It's hot in here...

223
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,775
Excuse me, could I maybe use
the restroom?

224
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,570
Yes, of course. It's that way.

225
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,572
Thank you. Please excuse me.

226
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,659
He proposed with donuts.

227
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,871
What is this? He must really be into you.

228
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,831
What're you talking about?
It's not like that.

229
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,791
He just confessed it himself.

230
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,877
You should go for it. He seems nice.

231
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,588
Hey! How long have you known him
to say he's a nice guy?

232
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,048
Personally, he seems a bit off.

233
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,300
Yoon-ah. Be careful of that guy.

234
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,885
-What?
-This guy.

235
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,678
Who are you to say that?

236
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,890
I'm just concerned, that's all.

237
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,935
I don't want to see another weird guy
needlessly make her life more difficult.

238
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,146
Enough! Let's stop talking nonsense.

239
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,606
Donuts look good. Here, eat one.

240
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,232
Forget it. I don't...

241
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,654
-I told you I didn't want one!
-Don't yell at me.

242
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,823
What a waste of donut.
You should've just taken it.

243
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,624
BONG DOO-SIK
HAN YOON-AH

244
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,503
HAN YOON-AH

245
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,263
What are you doing?

246
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,974
Why are you using
someone else's toothbrush?

247
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,938
My teeth felt fuzzy.

248
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,440
If that's the case,
you should've asked for a new brush.

249
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,402
-Why are you using Yoon-ah's toothbrush?
-What?

250
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,738
Oh my! This was Yoon-ah's toothbrush?

251
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,657
I really didn't know.

252
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,160
What do you mean?
It clearly says "Han Yoon-ah" right there.

253
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,374
Oh, goodness. So it does.

254
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,376
Oops.

255
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,339
I really didn't know.

256
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,133
Well then.

257
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,058
What the heck? It's written right there!

258
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,978
It has been a pleasure.

259
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,438
I'll be going then.

260
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,981
Yoon-ah, I'll see you in class.

261
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,524
Yes. Travel safely.

262
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,609
-Good night!
-Come again!

263
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,236
Take care.

264
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,614
Oh my goodness, come here.

265
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,074
Sit down, sit down.

266
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,743
He seems great!

267
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,663
Right? He's polite and seems nice.

268
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,582
Nice?

269
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,001
There's something off about him.

270
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,587
Not again.

271
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,089
I'm serious.
I went to the bathroom earlier,

272
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,550
and he had Yoon-ah's toothbrush
in his mouth.

273
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,218
What? My toothbrush?

274
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
His teeth must've felt fuzzy.

275
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,473
Regardless, does it make sense
to use someone else's toothbrush?

276
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,892
Why not? I use yours sometimes.

277
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,186
What? Why?

278
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,562
Your toothbrush is really soft.

279
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,105
Mine's so stiff,

280
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,483
it hurts my teeth and makes me bleed.

281
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,859
Man, that's so gross.

282
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,069
In any case, that guy doesn't seem right.

283
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,613
He's a bit weird.

284
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,989
You're more weird, you know that?

285
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,784
Why? Are you jealous because
he's getting friendly with Yoon-ah?

286
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,536
That's right.

287
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,747
You even drew her a map this morning.

288
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,500
Can it be... Dong-goo, do you like
Yoon-ah?

289
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,671
What? Me?

290
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,298
Like Yoon-ah?

291
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,093
Forget it. Let's just drop it.
I shouldn't have said anything.

292
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:27,264
What, just 'cause I care?
What... now I like her?

293
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,432
I'm just good-hearted is all.

294
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,228
-Stop teasing him, guys.
-But that punk's been-- ack!

295
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,354
What happened? What's wrong?

296
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,731
My stomach said I talked too much today
so it's hungry.

297
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,317
Do you think you can lose 10kg
in one week by starving?

298
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,445
I don't know of any other way
to lose weight.

299
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,030
Ask Seo-jin for help.

300
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,532
She's always on a 365-day diet.

301
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,492
Really?

302
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,911
Seo-jin, how about helping me lose weight?

303
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,204
For free?

304
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,540
You slave to free market capitalism.

305
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,252
Fine. I'll buy you a recently released
all-new advanced-technology razor.

306
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,796
It removes hair by the very root.

307
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,089
Okay!

308
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,009
But you have to follow my orders,
no questions asked.

309
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,012
What's this?

310
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,682
Oh right. He said to watch this.

311
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,686
But if I get caught,
it'll be mayhem in here. Shoot...

312
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,739
Why are you so startled?

313
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,325
I wasn't startled...

314
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,910
You should knock before coming in.

315
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,954
Why should I knock coming into my room?

316
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,708
Why?
Were you watching porn or something?

317
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,334
What? No way, not porn.

318
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,794
That's crazy.

319
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,297
True. You never watch stuff like that.

320
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,215
You're way too innocent, kid.

321
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,259
Hey...

322
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,886
What? What's wrong?

323
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,683
That Sang-hyun what's-his-face...
isn't he a bit weird?

324
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,435
Doesn't he look like a pervert?

325
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,855
Well, I'm not sure...

326
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,024
Really?

327
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,026
But he was a bit weird...

328
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,736
Hey, is this door lock broken?

329
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,322
Yup. It's been broken for a while. Why?

330
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,781
Oh, it's nothing.

331
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,541
You were in here?

332
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,044
Why don't you knock, seriously!

333
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,338
Sorry, I didn't know you were in here.

334
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,882
What are you doing with your laptop
in here?

335
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,177
Oh, I'm... writing a script.

336
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,137
I get good ideas in the bathroom.

337
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,513
Really? Then keep writing,

338
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,932
I'll just quickly wash my hands.

339
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,350
Okay, great.

340
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,226
Hey...

341
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,021
What?

342
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,816
I just realized
there was no toothpaste on the brush!

343
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,818
Does it make sense
to brush without toothpaste?

344
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,780
-Sure, that could happen.
-Really?

345
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,907
It can?

346
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,951
Is this door lock broken, too?

347
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,620
Yup. It's been broken a while. Why?

348
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,497
-What about the upstairs guest room?
-Broken.

349
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,998
All our doors are broken.

350
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,291
Then fix them, you idiot!

351
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,044
Why wouldn't you fix them
if you know they're broken? Why?

352
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,881
I'm not the only one in charge!

353
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,549
You can do it too, punk.

354
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,388
There was no toothpaste...
was I mistaken though?

355
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,349
Wrapping myself in Saran wrap
will help me lose weight?

356
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,686
Here, put them on... All of them.

357
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,020
I must shoot the bed scene.

358
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,897
Where are you going?

359
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,357
Nowhere.

360
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,942
Jumping jacks, start!

361
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,695
Shin Soo-jung!

362
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,614
-Bed scene!
-You'd probably even jump into a fire

363
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,157
to shoot a bed scene with her.

364
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,036
Not just a fire...
I'd even jump off a thousand cliffs.

365
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,162
Up on your feet!

366
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,123
Shin Soo-jung! Bed scene!

367
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:45,713
Shin Soo-jung! Bed scene!
Shin Soo-jung! Bed scene!

368
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,631
Bed scene!

369
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,591
Shin Soo-jung!

370
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,141
Where's Doo-sik?

371
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,892
He left to meet with the director.

372
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,894
He's busy writing a script these days.

373
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,983
Joon-ki... are you all right?

374
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,819
Joon-ki?

375
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,698
What now?

376
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,033
You scared us.

377
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,743
What's wrong? Are you really okay?

378
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,077
I'm okay.

379
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,204
I must've just passed out.

380
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,583
I know you need to lose weight,
but you should eat something.

381
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,669
-At this rate, you could really die.
-No, I'm okay.

382
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,463
I can just drink water, water.

383
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,885
Nope.
From today, water is also off-limits.

384
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,261
The shooting is in just two days!

385
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,432
Isn't this a bit too harsh?

386
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,684
If you don't want a bed scene
with Shin Soo-jung,

387
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,395
then go ahead and drink up!

388
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,115
I must shoot the scene. I will.

389
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,825
Bed scene.

390
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,244
Yoon-ah, I'm here.

391
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,081
That sounds like Sang-hyun.

392
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,045
Why's he here again?

393
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,049
Sang-hyun! What's the occasion?

394
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,718
There's a really good pizza shop
in my neighborhood...

395
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,512
I bought some for you all to eat.

396
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,432
What a shame.
We just finished eating lunch.

397
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,850
That's nonsense.

398
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,269
There's a separate stomach for pizza.

399
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,771
Thank you very much.

400
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,191
What a pig, that one.

401
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,454
Don't even think about it.

402
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,290
You cold-hearted wench!

403
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,877
If I poked you with a needle,
you probably wouldn't bleed.

404
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,880
This pizza is so delicious.

405
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,674
Really?

406
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,551
Sang-hyun, please have some, too.

407
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,302
No, I'm okay. I ate before coming.

408
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,971
Please, you enjoy it.

409
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,972
Okay. Thank you.

410
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,772
Excuse me...

411
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,194
-Yes?
-What are you doing right now?

412
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,364
-What do you mean?
-What's wrong?

413
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,325
He just-- he just smelled Yoon-ah's hair.

414
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,036
Me?

415
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,746
No, I didn't.

416
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,498
I was smelling the pizza.

417
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,959
You're lying, I clearly saw you!

418
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,837
Don't say that.
You must not have seen correctly.

419
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,298
Why would Sang-hyun be smelling my hair?

420
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,507
Exactly!

421
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,219
Who cares if he did smell her hair?

422
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,180
I smell your hair sometimes.

423
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,724
My hair? Why? Why?

424
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,726
Your hair...

425
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,729
always smell delicious.

426
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,606
-What the...
-It looks like jjajangmyun...

427
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,442
Stop it! Don't do that!

428
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,653
I'm telling you,
I definitely saw him smell her hair!

429
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,946
Why are you being so rude?

430
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,531
I definitely saw him! I did!

431
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,325
I definitely saw him! This is crazy!

432
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,367
Just stop it already.

433
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,661
Sang-hyun, I'm sorry.

434
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,871
I apologize on his behalf.

435
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,372
No, it's okay.

436
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,708
It's my fault
for causing a misunderstanding.

437
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,501
While you are eating,

438
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,794
I'll just look around.

439
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,296
Yes, of course.

440
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,965
Yoon-ah, there's something...

441
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,384
pardon me... on your lips.

442
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,180
Oh my gosh.

443
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,598
Oops, it's just a mole.

444
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,558
Do I just go that way?

445
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,602
Yes, take your time and look around.

446
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,481
Why are you taking that?

447
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,734
-Why did he take that?
-What is wrong with you?

448
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,445
He just took the tissue with him and left!

449
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,280
Dong-goo, please calm down!

450
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,949
Oh my gosh! I'm about to lose it!

451
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,076
He took the tissue like this...

452
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,619
You have no right to eat!

453
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,038
You have to shoot the bed scene!

454
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,748
Be quiet!

455
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,797
It's Yoon-ah's smell...

456
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,609
I think Sang-hyun...

457
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,237
really likes you, Yoon-ah.
What do you think of him?

458
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,738
It's not like that.

459
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,198
Why not? You should date him.

460
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,575
He's handsome, gentle,

461
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,828
and he has a nice car.
That means he's successful.

462
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,497
Why are you doing that?

463
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,001
Just that you should eat more pizza...
because you like pizza.

464
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,339
What's he doing that's taking him so long?

465
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,591
Oh my.

466
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,099
Yoon-ah.

467
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,853
Such courage.

468
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,354
Oh, Yoon-ah...

469
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,815
Yoon-ah...

470
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,536
What are you doing in here?

471
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,205
That... oh that... actually...

472
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,459
Why are you wearing Yoon-ah's clothes?

473
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,461
What's happening, what's wrong?

474
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,339
Sang-hyun!

475
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,966
Why are you wearing my clothes?

476
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,802
Yoon-ah, this is all a misunderstanding!

477
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,638
What misunderstanding?
You've been caught in the act.

478
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,682
Sang-hyun, what's going on?

479
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,975
Well, actually...

480
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,686
the truth is...

481
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,566
I wanted to know your size.

482
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,903
I wanted to buy you a coat as a gift.

483
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,238
Your clothes are too old.

484
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,451
Wait, what?

485
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,537
If you wanted to know her size,
you could just ask her.

486
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,497
And also,

487
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,374
you can check the size on the tag,
so why put them on?

488
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,584
I was worried that

489
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,419
if I asked her and she figured it out,

490
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,631
her pride would be hurt.
So I couldn't ask.

491
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,758
Furthermore,
maybe because the clothes are so old,

492
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,843
the sizes faded on the tags.

493
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,929
That's why I put them on.
There, satisfied?

494
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,848
So that's why.

495
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,517
We had no idea.

496
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,352
You actually believe what he's saying?

497
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,938
It's ridiculous for a man
to try on woman's clothes.

498
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,064
Why is it ridiculous?

499
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,817
I wear Seo-jin's clothes, too.

500
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,276
What? But why?

501
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,863
Skirts are roomier and feel nice,
so sometimes...

502
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,115
I wear her clothes.

503
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,283
What? You're out of your mind!

504
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,328
In any case, I'm sorry.

505
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,499
I caused you discomfort again.

506
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,585
I just wanted to do something kind.

507
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,463
I'll be going then.

508
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,596
He smelled it!

509
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,849
Sang-hyun! Wait a minute...

510
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,268
What the heck is wrong with you?

511
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,480
He definitely smelled it!

512
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,574
-Thank you for the ride.
-Just a minute, Mr. Bong...

513
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,534
Did you watch the movie I gave you?

514
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,203
You mean Madame Freedom?

515
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,663
Yes, a little...

516
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,665
She really is quite... free.

517
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,584
It's pretty good, right? Here...

518
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,170
take a look at this, too.

519
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,965
This is a masterpiece of erotica.

520
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,675
Ah, I see.

521
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,218
Well... get home safely.

522
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,469
Okay, bye.

523
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,058
Why give me these
when I have nowhere to watch?

524
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,685
What is it this time?

525
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,353
"Sweet Whip"

526
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,355
"The taste is unforgettable..."

527
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,149
Oh gosh, this one's even more erotic.

528
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,151
I hope no one sees this.

529
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,404
Sang-hyun, please don't leave like this.

530
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,822
I'll apologize on his behalf.

531
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,990
No, it's okay.

532
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,743
I don't think I can stay
while being so misunderstood.

533
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,411
Dong-goo, hurry up and apologize.

534
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,371
Why should I? What'd I do wrong?

535
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,873
He's leaving because of you.

536
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,082
Are you serious?

537
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,345
Wait a minute!

538
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,847
What is this?
Isn't this ladies' underwear?

539
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,059
No. This is...

540
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:20,977
my underwear.

541
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,605
What? This is yours, you say?

542
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,692
This lacy, red-hot underwear?

543
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,447
Yes. I like this design.

544
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,159
It puts me at ease.

545
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,578
You've got no shame! No shame at all!

546
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,998
Does it make sense to carry around
ladies' underwear in your pocket?

547
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,167
Why not?

548
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,002
Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood, I also--

549
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,505
Shut up! Don't come near me!

550
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,340
No, wait!

551
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,800
Tell me the truth...

552
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,261
is this really yours?

553
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,637
I said it is!

554
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,931
I have them in every color at home.

555
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,891
Do you want come and see for yourself?

556
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,685
-Why you--
-Wait a minute.

557
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,479
That looks like my underwear.

558
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,776
-It is! This is mine!
-It's yours?

559
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,777
Seriously?

560
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,905
What? I don't believe this.

561
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,742
That... lacy, hot, sexy, red underwear...

562
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,452
wasn't Yoon-ah's?

563
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,745
Oh my, he's insane.

564
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,539
Dammit!

565
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,915
Why are you disappointed? Why?

566
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,126
You said it was yours.

567
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,669
Move outta my way.

568
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,130
You're such a pervert!

569
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,340
A pervert?

570
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,800
Isn't that too extreme?

571
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,595
It's become too uncomfortable
to stay here any longer.

572
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,472
It wasn't Yoon-ah's...

573
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,725
-You devil.
-Where do you think you're going?

574
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,563
SWEET WHIP

575
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,026
What is this?

576
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,573
"That taste is unforgettable."

577
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,867
"Sweet Whip"...?

578
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,287
This guy really is a pervert!

579
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,081
Don't call me a pervert.
And also... that's not mine.

580
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,958
If it's not yours, then whose is it?

581
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:07,959
Huh? Huh?

582
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,420
It's really not mine, please believe me.

583
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,338
He can't be serious...

584
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,132
Dong-goo, call the police.

585
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,425
Okay, I will.

586
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,552
What, the police? Wait, wait!

587
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,722
Fine. I'll be honest.

588
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,140
I did steal the underwear.

589
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,184
I'll admit that.

590
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,314
However... that DVD really isn't mine.
Please believe me.

591
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,275
If it's not yours, then... whose is it?

592
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,408
Just tell them.

593
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,244
I saw it fall out from your jacket.

594
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,250
What? It's Doo-sik's you say?

595
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,879
Do you know what an innocent kid he is?

596
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:56,049
He has never even held a woman's hand.

597
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,634
He's like a pure white canvas.

598
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,261
Why this is...

599
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,014
-I saw it fall out of his jack--
-Shut up, you jerk!

600
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,643
You think I'd watch dirt like that?
Who do you think I am?

601
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,144
-But I saw it--
-Shut your mouth!

602
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,146
You're so dead!

603
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,190
You perverted jerk! Let's go!

604
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,859
This is so unfair! It's not true!

605
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,069
Wait, Doo-sik, stop!

606
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,154
Let's go!

607
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:22,283
We need you to do this scene though,
to really make it the best.

608
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,285
I already told you.

609
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,998
I promised my parents
I would never shoot a bed scene!

610
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,542
I was just throwing it out there.

611
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,137
I'm here.

612
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,806
You really lost a lot of weight!

613
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,891
How much did you lose?

614
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,852
-Ten kilograms.
-What?

615
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,895
Ten kilograms.

616
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,106
Ten kilograms?

617
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,442
It must've been really hard.
Good job!

618
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,486
Oh, it was nothing.

619
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,702
My anemia...

620
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,162
Be careful!

621
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,290
Joon-ki, you're okay. You're nearly there.

622
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,624
Joon-ki, you can do this.

623
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,472
Hello.

624
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,934
I'm Lee Joon-ki.
We'll be working together on this scene.

625
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,730
It's an honor to meet you.

626
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,064
Really?

627
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,860
-It's nice to meet you.
-Yes, it's a pleasure...

628
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,738
Who are you?

629
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,909
Director?

630
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,911
Who is this girl?

631
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,455
She's Soo-jung's body-double.

632
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,373
Body-double?

633
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,835
Soo-jung isn't shooting this herself?

634
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,173
Surely you didn't think you'd be shooting
with Soo-jung herself?

635
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,178
Shin Soo-jung!

636
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,016
Bed scene!

637
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,061
What's wrong?

638
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,358
-Director?
-Yeah?

639
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,776
Soo-jung just called saying that

640
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,780
using a body-double seemed disrespectful
to the audience.

641
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,574
She'd like
to shoot the bed scene herself.

642
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,870
Really? Well, that's great for me.

643
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,832
Soo-jung said she'll shoot the bed scene!

644
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,876
-Hurry and get ready!
-I'll be quick!

645
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,877
Just a minute!

646
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,212
What?

647
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,798
I'll do the bed scene.

648
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,224
Why the sudden change?

649
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,309
I changed... just because.

650
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,895
Why right now?

651
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,439
Director, can you...
escort him out or something?

652
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,150
Let's go, hurry up!

653
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,695
You just want to shoot the bed scene
with Soo-jung!

654
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,822
I know everything, you rotten scoundrel!

655
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,408
Do you know how much I suffered?

656
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,161
See, I told you that guy was weird.

657
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,830
The underwear was bad enough,

658
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,082
but I was shocked
when he said that DVD was yours.

659
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,959
-Weren't you?
-What?

660
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,211
Oh yeah, totally...

661
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,046
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

662
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,299
We thought you liked Yoon-ah
and were just jealous.

663
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,427
Does it make sense
that I'd like Yoon-ah?

664
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,053
And jealous?

665
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,430
Seriously?

666
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,391
That's absurd.

667
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,102
What the heck?

668
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,645
Wasn't that Joon-ki?

669
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,022
I thought he had a shoot today.

670
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,024
Right? He's gone crazy, finally.

671
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,942
Joon-ki!

672
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,736
What's going on with him?

673
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,154
Excuse me.

674
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,158
I'm in the same baking class
as a student named Yoon-ah...

675
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,243
Is she at home by any chance?

676
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,537
Yes. But why?

677
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,414
I wanted to ask her out on a date.

678
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,252
Oh... a date?

679
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,631
Hey, did you know?

680
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,882
What?

681
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,384
Actually, Yoon-ah...

682
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,431
That jerk!

683
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,852
He stole my role just because
Soo-jung's shooting the scene.

684
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,021
After I worked so hard
to lose that weight!

685
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,443
You're back from class?

686
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,945
Yeah.

687
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,613
Is something wrong though?

688
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,575
There's... a strange rumor
going around in class.

689
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,911
They say I'm addicted to plastic surgery.

690
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,330
What? Addicted to plastic surgery?

691
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,540
Yeah. On top of that...

692
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,960
I have a lot of debt and steal things.

693
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,295
If that wasn't bad enough,
they say I'm a man.

694
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,964
I was a marine...

695
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,091
and I cut barbed wire with my teeth...

696
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,012
What kind of crazy fool
started those rumors?

697
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,098
I have no idea.

698
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,142
People were asking me all day.

699
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,602
Do they believe it?

700
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,440
What? Why you looking at me like that?

701
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,154
Yeah, okay, I did it, so what?

702
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,492
I did it for you mom though.

703
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,579
I'm worried
she'll meet another twisted pervert.

704
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,625
For real.

705
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,168
Don't misunderstand.

706
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,846
This week's been terrible, too.

707
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,181
Why aren't there any guests lately?

708
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,183
Is the weather too cold?

709
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,019
What if we go out of business?

710
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:41,936
Seriously.

711
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,523
The building owner also called me
about rent yesterday.

712
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,692
She even sent certified mail last time.

713
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,527
It's fine, it's fine.

714
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,112
-Hello.
-Yes, hi--

715
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,116
Madame Kim! Why are you here?

716
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,452
What do you think?
I'm here to collect rent.

717
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,828
Rent?

718
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,042
-Lately business has been hard...
-So you're saying you don't have it.

719
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,627
You can begin.

720
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,087
Excuse me?

721
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,256
Can I help you?

722
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,591
Why are you running around?

723
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,843
I've seen this on TV.

724
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,345
What? Repossession?

725
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,847
Repossession? This can't be!

726
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,432
This isn't real.

727
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,434
We're really ruined! What's happening?

728
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,936
Dong-goo, where's Dong-goo?

729
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,730
No, you can't take that!

730
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,817
MARRIAGE IS A CRAZY THING

731
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,029
We're home.

732
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,448
What's with these red stickers?

733
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,951
-Madame Kim!
-Long time no see, Mr. Kang.

734
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,913
-Why do you have a baby?
-Huh?

735
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,042
Well... that...

736
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,044
It's Dong-goo's baby.

737
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,300
He got a girl pregnant.

738
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,219
He got a girl pregnant?

739
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,180
So... this baby is his?

740
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,642
Yes... it's hard because now we have...

741
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,102
another mouth too feed...

742
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,520
diapers, formula...

743
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,939
It costs so much to raise a baby.

744
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:13,361
Actually, we had saved money for rent...

745
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,488
but we had to use it all...

746
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,115
on the baby.

747
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,368
Oh goodness... I see...

748
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,997
What about the mother?

749
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,707
The mother?

750
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,460
Her mother... well...

751
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,463
she ran off.

752
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,341
She couldn't stand living like this.

753
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,266
What kind of mother could do that?

754
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,353
You're right.
We should leave if you insist.

755
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,398
But if we're thrown out on the street,

756
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,402
we'll be okay...
but what about this baby?

757
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,279
This poor baby?

758
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,866
That's not our problem.

759
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,452
We'll evict them according to the law.

760
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,163
Enough, Attorney Kim.

761
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,165
I'll give you exactly one more month.

762
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,251
I'm being lenient because of the baby.

763
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,544
You must pay me back.

764
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,213
Really? Thank you so much!

765
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,798
Really, thank you so much.

766
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,426
-Enough already, just raise the kid well.
-We will!

767
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,927
Let's go, Attorney Kim.

768
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,808
You poor little thing.

769
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,895
Goodness.

770
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,855
Goodbye.

771
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,107
-See you later.
-Take care.

772
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,152
Man, I really thought we'd get evicted.

773
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,279
Even so, how could you say such a lie?

774
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,655
What else could we do?

775
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,991
Don't you see all the red stickers?

776
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,160
If I didn't,
we'd be on the streets right now.

777
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,995
What if we get caught later?

778
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:46,913
Caught? Why would we?

779
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,916
She won't look up Sol's registration.

780
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,584
What're we going to do?

781
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,172
We're safe this month,
but what about next month?

782
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,090
I'm sure it'll work out.

783
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,259
Don't worry, it's okay.

784
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,846
Soo-ah.

785
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,223
Doo-sik!

786
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,766
It's been a while.

787
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,809
Have you been well?

788
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,144
Just okay.

789
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,520
Dong-goo's doing well?

790
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,398
Sure, he's okay.

791
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,942
Why are you at the realtors?

792
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,109
I'm selling my house.

793
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,489
Yoon-seok's opening stores in the U.S.,
and he wants me to go with him.

794
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,573
How long will you be gone?

795
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,908
Maybe one to two years?

796
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,702
Or we might just stay there.

797
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,665
Well... I have a lot to prepare,
so I better get going.

798
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,582
Take care!

799
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,834
Bye!

800
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,381
What if she marries him?

801
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,298
Seriously.

802
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,218
If Dong-goo finds out, he'll be miserable.
What do we do?

803
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,220
Idiot, just don't tell him.

804
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,055
He's finally getting over her, anyway.

805
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,308
Isn't that the building owner's car?

806
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,769
Yeah, looks like it.

807
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,314
Why is she going toward the guesthouse?

808
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,775
Something doesn't feel right.

809
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,988
-I'm home.
-You're back.

810
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,489
Did you take out your wisdom teeth?

811
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,740
Yeah.

812
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:06,909
But...

813
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,371
what are all these stickers?

814
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,249
We had a bit of trouble earlier...

815
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,750
I'll tell you later.

816
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,713
-Does it hurt a lot?
-No, it's okay.

817
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,384
I just wish I'd stop bleeding.

818
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,303
That's normal though.

819
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,388
You just have to suffer through for a day.

820
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,639
Really?

821
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,226
I should change the gauze.

822
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,937
Where was the gauze?

823
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,941
Let's see...

824
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,485
Welcome! Did you want to stay here?

825
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,654
I'm not a customer.

826
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,032
And... who are you?

827
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,326
Me? I'm Han Yoon-ah.

828
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,371
Oh, Sol. Are you hungry?

829
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,706
Should Mommy feed you?

830
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,790
Mommy?

831
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,417
You're the baby's mom?

832
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,128
-Yes.
-When did you come back?

833
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,588
Yes?

834
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,132
I just came back from the hospital.

835
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,425
Hospital?

836
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,510
The hospital, why?

837
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,429
Oh, for the past few days--

838
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,015
Wait! Wait!

839
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,017
You startled me!

840
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,644
Why are you yelling all the sudden?

841
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,979
I'm sorry, Madame Kim.

842
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,482
What brings you here today?

843
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,153
I felt so bad for the baby,
I bought some diapers.

844
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,489
What's with all the noise-- Madame!

845
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,907
Mr. Kang.

846
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,661
-When did you find the baby's mom?
-Well... you see...

847
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,579
So you see...

848
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,831
And why was she at the hospital?

849
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,501
The hospital? So you see...

850
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,878
The hospital called to say she collapsed,

851
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,089
so I brought her home.

852
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,673
She collapsed?

853
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,674
What's the problem?

854
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,594
Yes? I just...

855
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,138
Blood!

856
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,766
Gosh, not again.

857
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,563
Seo-jin, quickly!

858
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,190
Take her to the room. Hurry!

859
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,359
Yoon-ah, let's go to the room!

860
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,276
Oh my...

861
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,861
Why are you...

862
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,863
You need rest!

863
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,865
You're coughing up blood!

864
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,493
I mean...

865
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,871
why is she coughing up blood?

866
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,665
So the thing is...

867
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,333
Wait, we should take her to the hospital!

868
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,001
No! No, we can't!

869
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,170
-No! No, we can't!
-Why not?

870
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,090
The hospital said
there's nothing more they could do.

871
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,800
That's why I brought her home.

872
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,512
You mean it's an incurable disease?

873
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,805
Excuse me?

874
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,099
Yes... yes, it is.

875
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,685
Terminal?

876
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,980
Yes.

877
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,234
How could this happen to someone so young?

878
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,405
Mr. Kang, it must be so difficult for you.

879
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,782
Me? Oh... yes.

880
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,993
Be good to her.

881
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,871
Make her last days peaceful.

882
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,208
By the way, did you two have a wedding?

883
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,252
A wedding? Oh that...

884
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,670
Right...

885
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,715
you must not have had time for one.

886
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,178
I feel so bad for her.

887
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,139
She'll never get a chance
to wear a wedding dress.

888
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,145
Gosh.

889
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,190
Even so. Stay strong Mr. Kang.

890
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,318
I will. Thank you.

891
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,949
I'll be going now.

892
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,243
This way.

893
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,706
Thank you for the diapers. Goodbye.

894
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,416
Goodbye.

895
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,421
That was so close!

896
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,256
Why do you keep lying?

897
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,466
We almost got caught!

898
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,260
But we didn't, so don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

899
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,553
Don't worry.

900
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,554
What if she finds out?

901
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,014
Let me get the diapers.

902
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,225
Look at him, unbelievable.

903
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,851
I can't believe this.

904
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,772
This is driving me crazy.

905
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,274
What do you think?

906
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,152
What's this?

907
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,988
I want to throw one for you two...
a wedding.

908
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,949
-What?
-Pardon?

909
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,325
-A wedding?
-A wedding?

910
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,160
Don't worry, I'll pay for it.

911
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,620
Oh no, that's okay.

912
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,829
It's really unnecessary.

913
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,290
It's because
you don't know a woman's heart.

914
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,252
If a woman
never gets to wear a wedding dress...

915
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,878
it becomes a life-long regret.

916
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,547
No, I'm okay though.

917
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,382
I don't need to wear a wedding dress.

918
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,425
It's because I want to do this.
I want to.

919
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,013
The truth is, I was so busy working
and making a living...

920
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,224
my husband and I couldn't have a wedding.

921
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,102
I never got a chance
to wear a wedding dress.

922
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,771
I see...

923
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,315
So I completely understand your feelings,
Yoon-ah.

924
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,236
So don't feel burdened,
and just have a wedding.

925
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,532
No, we're truly okay without one.

926
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,409
Do you insist on ignoring my kindness?

927
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,120
Fine. Don't do it.

928
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,871
But then,
you have to move out immediately.

929
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,166
-Sorry? What does that mean?
-You decide.

930
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,502
Do you want to move out?
Or do you want to get married?

931
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,801
We'll do it.

932
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,177
We'll have a wedding.

933
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,471
You should've said that earlier.

934
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,933
The sooner the date, the better, right?

935
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,603
How's Sunday?

936
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,104
This week Sunday?

937
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,900
We don't know how much time she has.
The sooner the better, right?

938
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,532
Right, right...

939
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,327
What? She's holding a wedding for you two?

940
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,911
That's what I said.

941
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,205
This is all because of your stupid lies!

942
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,291
I didn't know it'd turn out like this.

943
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,917
This isn't right... this is...

944
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,336
fraud! It's marriage fraud!

945
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,130
I'm going to tell her the truth.

946
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,882
Wait!

947
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,008
-Why?
-Are you crazy?

948
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,718
Don't you know what she's like?

949
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,969
If she knows we lied,

950
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,805
not only will she throw us out,
she'll prosecute!

951
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,015
Then what do you suggest?

952
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,647
Dong-goo, I'm really sorry...

953
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,857
but can you just bite the bullet...

954
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,068
-and get married?
-Joon-ki!

955
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,194
You're crazy!

956
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,780
Then what can we do?

957
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,325
We can't end up on the streets
in this cold weather.

958
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,290
You and Yoon-ah...

959
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,709
should just do it.

960
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,045
Stop, just stop!

961
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,882
We don't need rings.

962
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,092
It's really okay.

963
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,928
It's because I want to do it for you.

964
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,887
Hurry and pick them.

965
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,308
Dong-goo?

966
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,145
Sang-pil!

967
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,526
It's been a long time!
How've you been?

968
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,194
I've been all right.

969
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,406
Who is this?

970
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,366
Well... she's...

971
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,992
your girlfriend?

972
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,203
Well, you see...

973
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,831
What do the bride and groom
think about these?

974
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,791
This is our most popular design.

975
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,127
Bride and groom?

976
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,129
What... are you getting married?

977
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,590
Well, you see...

978
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,430
Yes. I'm getting married.

979
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,141
Why didn't you call? When is it?

980
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,642
Oh that...

981
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,938
This Sunday.

982
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:36,316
You punk! You should've called! This guy.

983
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,068
Hey, don't worry, okay?

984
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,571
I'll bring the gang, our department,
professors, the club...

985
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,866
I'll bring all of them, so don't worry.

986
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,118
In any case. Congrats, man.

987
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,538
Hey, yeah. Thanks.

988
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,500
I'm so thankful I could cry, you little...

989
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,295
This is insane.

990
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,548
Why did I have to run into Sang-pil?

991
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,632
Sang-pil...

992
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,800
Sergeant Kang?

993
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,971
-Corporal Kim!
-Salute!

994
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,931
How have you been?

995
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,308
I've been okay.

996
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,350
It's been a long time.

997
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,478
Mr. Kang! How is this?

998
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,356
-You must wear a tuxedo to your wedding.
-Yes.

999
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,025
Wedding?

1000
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,485
Are you getting married?

1001
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,613
Well, you see...

1002
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,034
Yes, I'm getting married.

1003
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,076
When?

1004
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,329
-This Sunday.
-This Sunday?

1005
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,457
You should've told me sooner.
I'm disappointed.

1006
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,501
Don't be disappointed.

1007
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,669
He had his reasons for it.

1008
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,213
Reasons?

1009
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:40,964
What kind of...?

1010
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,052
What?

1011
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,596
Gosh. That's terrible.

1012
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,515
Be strong, Sergeant Kang.

1013
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,475
I will, thanks.

1014
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,311
Madame, you're doing a great thing.

1015
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,896
It's a beautiful story.

1016
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,148
Oh, it's not a big deal.

1017
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,818
All I want
is for these two people to be happy.

1018
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,572
In any case,
I'll tell our division, our platoon...

1019
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,823
I'll let everyone know.

1020
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,992
Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

1021
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,204
What do you mean? We need to band together
in difficult times.

1022
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,331
That's the meaning of family. Right?

1023
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,874
Let's go!

1024
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,546
Great. Thanks.

1025
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,299
Your sense of family is overwhelming,
you little...

1026
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,680
I'm going crazy.

1027
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,473
A wedding. That's insane.

1028
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,941
You're laughing?
How can you laugh right now?

1029
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,360
It's just so interesting.

1030
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,528
What?

1031
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,281
When I was young, I often imagined...

1032
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:51,201
where would I get married,
what kind of dress would I wear...

1033
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,161
what kind of bouquet I'd have.

1034
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,747
I gave up on all that when Sol came.

1035
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,917
But here I am now,
about to have a wedding.

1036
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,299
Walking around all day is so tiring,
right?

1037
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,925
I don't know.

1038
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,553
Things were so crazy today,
I can't tell if I'm tired.

1039
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,223
I wish all this were a dream.

1040
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,436
Yoon-ah, there's still time
to tell her the truth...

1041
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,440
What? You fell asleep?

1042
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,733
Hey?

1043
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,820
Gosh. Such a carefree lady.

1044
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,114
Sheesh.

1045
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,867
This thing...

1046
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,303
"Ledia"

1047
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,523
Gosh.

1048
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,570
This girl requires so much help.

1049
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,078
We're back.

1050
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,206
Our new groom is home!

1051
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,377
I was just joking around.

1052
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,587
You looked upset.
I was trying to cheer you up.

1053
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,672
You can joke right now?

1054
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,799
Do you know what I went through today?

1055
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,760
What kind of trouble
I'm in because of you?

1056
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,970
Wait a minute! What is this?

1057
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,347
Isn't this Madame Kim?

1058
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,264
What is it?

1059
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,308
There's a headline article about her!

1060
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,476
And article? What's it say?

1061
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,271
"Her kindness is melting hearts
in this cold weather."

1062
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,941
"Kang Dong-goo and Han Yoon-ah
run a guesthouse in Huam,

1063
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,275
but they've fallen on hard times,

1064
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,820
so she's giving them... a wedding."

1065
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,947
Who-- who wrote this?

1066
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,865
Who was it?

1067
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,076
Journalist Kim Tae-woong? That's...

1068
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,411
I became a journalist.

1069
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,829
Corporal Kim!

1070
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,248
That crazy kid! Why did he write this?

1071
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,041
Why didn't he write something else?

1072
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,626
Hello, this is Waikiki Guesthouse.

1073
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,836
Hello?

1074
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,130
Hello, this is Wheesung, the singer.

1075
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,508
-What? The singer, Wheesung?
-Wheesung?

1076
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,802
-You called the wrong--
-No, it's really...

1077
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,637
-I'm really Wheesung.
-You do sound alike.

1078
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,514
How can we help you?

1079
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,099
You saw the article?

1080
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,105
You want to sing a congratulatory song?

1081
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,774
Is that really Wheesung?

1082
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,402
Just a minute, there's another call.

1083
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,154
Hello, Waikiki Guesthouse?

1084
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,989
Park Sul-nyeo?

1085
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,741
-What?
-Really?

1086
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,826
You want to make them hanboks?

1087
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,287
This is getting out of control.

1088
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,997
If we get caught...

1089
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,623
we won't be able to live in Korea.

1090
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,001
People will beat us to death.

1091
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,836
Who? Chef Lee Yeon-bok?

1092
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,597
WE DON'T TAKE
CONGRATULATORY MONEY

1093
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,060
HUAM DISTRICT
THE 44TH INFANTRY

1094
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:04,978
Dong-goo!

1095
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,730
Congratulations!

1096
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,023
Thanks.

1097
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,524
You really brought everyone.

1098
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,984
Congrats!

1099
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,068
Thanks.

1100
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,113
-Congrats!
-Thanks so much.

1101
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,573
Thanks!

1102
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,657
What's this?

1103
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:18,992
Salute!

1104
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,161
Let's cheer the groom!

1105
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,455
Salute the new groom! Salute!

1106
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,998
Salute!

1107
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,208
-Salute!
-At ease.

1108
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,626
Sergeant Kang.

1109
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,668
Corporal Kim.

1110
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,213
I read the article.

1111
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,839
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1112
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,965
Congrats!

1113
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,133
Congratulations!

1114
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,637
Congratulations! You're so handsome!

1115
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,180
So you're the groom.

1116
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,349
-We'll be inside!
-Thank you.

1117
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,521
Are you okay?

1118
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,147
Do I look okay to you guys?

1119
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,609
My school friends, professors,
even my army general...

1120
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,529
even the leader
of the women's association is here.

1121
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,532
I'm officially a married man.

1122
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,159
But everyone's complimenting
how beautiful your bride is.

1123
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,745
That's right.
You didn't see her dress yet?

1124
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,414
It's awesome. So pretty. Awesome!

1125
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,833
So what?

1126
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,459
I should be happy with a pretty bride?

1127
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,047
Oh, I'm so happy I have a pretty bride,
I could go crazy!

1128
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,424
-Calm down!
-Does it look like I can calm down?

1129
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,592
This is all your fault!

1130
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,177
You're not even my friend.

1131
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,013
-You're my enemy!
-What are you all doing?

1132
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,891
The wedding is about to begin.

1133
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,351
Hurry and come inside.

1134
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,145
-Yes, let's go.
-Let's start.

1135
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,022
I'll go in first, Dong-goo.

1136
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,524
See you later!

1137
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,193
Good luck! Good luck!

1138
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,743
It's time to begin!

1139
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,579
GROOM KANG DONG-GOO
BRIDE HAN YOON-AH

1140
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:49,082
We will now begin the wedding
of Kang Dong-goo

1141
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:52,460
and Han Yoon-ah.

1142
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,546
Introducing the groom!

1143
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,099
There he is!

1144
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,267
Salute!

1145
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:10,145
There he goes!

1146
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,646
He's handsome!

1147
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,190
Look how happy he is.

1148
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,651
Isn't he quite spirited?

1149
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,325
Well, then.

1150
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,786
Today's real star...

1151
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,121
the bride of February...

1152
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:33,126
let's give a round of applause
for Han Yoon-ah!

1153
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,879
Here comes the bride!

1154
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,822
Wow!

1155
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,379
Salute the bride!

1156
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,838
Salute!

1157
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,382
At ease.

1158
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,596
She's really beautiful!

1159
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,027
Dong-goo? Dong-goo!

1160
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,697
Kang Dong-goo!

1161
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,759
Thank you!

1162
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:05,927
Wheesung!

1163
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,054
I genuinely congratulate you both,

1164
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,015
and I pray you'll be happy forever.

1165
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,934
I'm actually quite expensive to book,

1166
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,020
but I sang for free today.

1167
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,690
To make up for that though,
I'd like for them to give each other...

1168
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,608
a passionate kiss.

1169
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,365
-You want us to kiss?
-A passionate kiss.

1170
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,825
Don't be shy.

1171
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,871
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

1172
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:36,374
Kiss! Kiss!

1173
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,751
Kiss!

1174
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,294
This is insane.

1175
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,004
Kiss!

1176
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,841
Kiss! Kiss!

1177
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:49,888
Kiss! Kiss!

1178
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,556
Dong-goo... just do it.

1179
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,017
-What?
-Let's just kiss.

1180
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,561
How could we possibly do that?

1181
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,221
Have a great honeymoon.

1182
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,765
And use this...

1183
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,018
to buy Yoon-ah whatever she wants.

1184
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,562
Okay, I will. Thank you.

1185
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,980
Go on now.

1186
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,149
Have fun.

1187
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,861
Okay. We'll be back.

1188
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,696
Should we go, Yoon-ah...

1189
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,448
Oh, I mean, honey?

1190
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:52,826
Pardon?

1191
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,245
Yes, let's.

1192
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,246
Honey...

1193
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,425
Take care.

1194
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,520
Dong-goo.

1195
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,071
Dong-goo?

1196
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:32,949
-Dong-goo!
-What?

1197
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,617
What's up?

1198
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,119
What have you been thinking about?

1199
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,287
What?

1200
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,956
I'm not thinking anything.

1201
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,337
But how long do we have to
stay here like this?

1202
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,841
They said they'd call
once Madame Kim leaves.

1203
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,926
Let's wait for a bit and then leave.

1204
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,846
Mr. Kang!

1205
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,517
-Attorney Kim!
-What are you doing here?

1206
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,853
Oh, you must be going on your honeymoon.

1207
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,105
Yes, we are.

1208
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,691
You're going to Jeju Island, right?

1209
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,735
I'm on my way there for a business trip!

1210
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,236
What time is your flight?

1211
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:14,073
Well, it's... the 6:30 p.m. flight...

1212
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,409
I'm also on the 6:30 flight!

1213
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,203
Oh, it's the same plane!

1214
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,623
And our seats are next to each other.
That's amazing!

1215
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,750
It's almost time, so we should go!

1216
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,126
Right...

1217
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,586
Dong-goo, what should we do?

1218
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,464
I don't know. This is driving me insane.

1219
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,673
Come quickly!

1220
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,226
Their plane has probably landed by now.

1221
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,813
I hope she stayed healthy
and that they enjoyed the trip.

1222
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:50,777
What's this?
This slimy, disgusting feeling?

1223
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,279
Oh, shit!

1224
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,949
What dog pooped here?

1225
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,367
This is so disgusting!

1226
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,830
The house seems empty without those two.

1227
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,457
Seriously...

1228
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,168
They should be home soon though.
Shouldn't we meet them?

1229
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,378
Why?

1230
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,713
It wasn't even a real honeymoon,
why welcome them?

1231
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,675
It's uncanny they met Attorney Kim
right at the airport.

1232
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:14,634
Seriously!

1233
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,219
But... what if Dong-goo

1234
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,680
and Yoon-ah really grow attached
to each other?

1235
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,014
No way.

1236
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,475
I'm just relieved we didn't get caught
by Madame Kim.

1237
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,310
I agree. Speaking of her...

1238
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,521
I never imagined she would believe

1239
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,565
that they were a couple!

1240
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,193
What did you just say?

1241
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,195
Madame Kim!

1242
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,489
If those two aren't a couple,
what are they?

1243
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,535
Surely you guys haven't...

1244
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,786
lied to me, right?

1245
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,329
Madame, it's not that...

1246
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,998
Tell me the truth immediately!

1247
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,209
Madame Kim?

1248
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,336
MEMORANDUM OF PAYMENT

1249
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:54,007
I'm sorry, Madame. I didn't do this
on purpose, but actually--

1250
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,259
Shut your mouth,
and just sign your thumbprint.

1251
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,388
What is this?

1252
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,515
A memorandum of payment for your wedding.

1253
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,684
If you fail to repay within a month,

1254
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,561
it states something terrible could happen.

1255
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,229
Let's say it's a kind warning?

1256
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,773
By "something terrible," do you mean...?

1257
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,734
Calculate the expenses times a hundred.

1258
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,862
Imagine your most horrible nightmare.

1259
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:21,326
I really want to throw you all in jail...

1260
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,206
but I'm being generous
for the baby's sake.

1261
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,459
Your thumbprint. Now.

1262
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,295
But how could we possibly

1263
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,921
come up with this much money in a month?

1264
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,591
Then you want to go? To jail?

1265
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,761
I can just stamp here, right?

1266
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,433
ACKNOWLEDGED BY: KANG DONG-GOO

1267
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,195
What are we going to do now?

1268
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,573
We don't have any guests,
and now we have a debt...

1269
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,533
I don't know either...

1270
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:06,788
This is all because of Joon-ki,
that enemy...

1271
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:10,375
I'm going to teach that punk a lesson!

1272
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,306
Oh my goodness!

1273
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,768
Why was he driving so fast?
He could've caused an accident!

1274
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,033
Dong-goo?

1275
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:46,786
Dong-goo?

1276
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,123
Can you hear me?

1277
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,584
I said, can you hear me?

1278
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,716
Pardon? What? What did you say?

1279
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,844
Oh, just... thank you.

1280
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,595
Yes, well...

1281
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:09,016
So pay attention to where you're going!
To what's in front of you!

1282
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,812
You seriously are a helpless, needy woman.

1283
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,188
Step aside!

1284
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,193
Why don't you walk around
with your eyes closed, then?

1285
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,197
Wait up, Dong-goo!

1286
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,125
Soo-ah.

1287
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,629
Dong-goo!

1288
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,801
What...

1289
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,013
What're you doing here like this?

1290
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,514
Did something happen?

1291
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,647
What am I to do, Dong-goo?

1292
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,652
I can't burden Dong-goo anymore.

1293
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,403
How much longer do I have to be here?

1294
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,072
-Did you pay the extra fee?
-What?

1295
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,073
Hey! Stop right there!

1296
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,494
I can help out an ex-girlfriend, right?

1297
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,537
Soo-ah, here.

1298
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,247
-Why all of sudden?
-It's nice.

1299
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,373
You still like Soo-ah!

1300
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,666
Don't get the wrong idea.

1301
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:59,126
Why would I?
Take good care of Soo-ah.

1302
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,295
What's that album?
Why'd you draw hearts there?

1303
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,964
-My first love.
-How'd you meet?

1304
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,924
As an erotic writer and an erotic actress.

1305
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,094
Joon-ki. You asked for this, all of this.

1306
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,179
Don't blame me.

1307
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,305
Your savior, Joon-ki!

1308
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,682
So, do you have any extra money?

1309
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,100
I'm starting a foodie show.

1310
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,268
I have to pay off my cards.

1311
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,769
Food shows aren't that easy.

1312
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,813
If I eat the bones, I get 100 stars?

1313
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,147
He needs a full medical checkup.

1314
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,274
Is it that bad?
