1
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,260
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,971
Seo-jin, you should take a look as well.

3
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,309
What do you think?

4
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,811
-Guesthouse Boulanger?
-Yeah.

5
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,146
Why, all of a sudden?

6
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,190
It's springtime.

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,108
I thought we should
redo the interior here.

8
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,320
So I'm looking around
for research purposes.

9
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,531
-This place looks nice, right?
-It's pretty and I like the ambience.

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,409
There, they give out bread
that the owner makes for free.

11
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,827
Really?

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,245
-That's great service.
-Yeah.

13
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,383
Hey, Dong-goo,
I'm going to step out for a bit.

14
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,677
Now? It's late. Where are you going?

15
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,013
I just have something to take care of.

16
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,891
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Okay.

17
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,028
Hi, Joon-ki. I'm here.

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,071
Where are you?

19
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,034
It's me, Seo-jin.

20
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,870
-What the hell? You scared me.
-Sorry.

21
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,913
Come inside.

22
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,835
Come here.

23
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,463
Is...

24
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,843
anyone tailing you?
What about Dong-goo?

25
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,095
He's at home.

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,388
You're ridiculous.

27
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,014
What do you mean?

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,475
Haven't you noticed
he's been watching us very closely?

29
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,352
We can't even go on dates.

30
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,062
I can't even tell anyone
I have a boyfriend.

31
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,356
What is this?

32
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,275
We have no choice.

33
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,779
I don't have to shoot this weekend.
Want to go on a date?

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,865
Really? You don't have to work
this weekend?

35
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,869
I'm off this weekend, too.

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,705
Then let's go on a trip.

37
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,123
-A trip?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,542
An overnight trip somewhere nearby.
How about it?

39
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,213
-Overnight? Isn't it too soon for that?
-What are you thinking about?

40
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,925
We'll get separate rooms.
You're crazy.

41
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,261
Oh, really?

42
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,223
Okay, let's do this!

43
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,516
Let's go on this trip!

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,144
Let's do this! Let's go on this trip!

45
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,482
Hide.

46
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,946
Damn it, I lost her again!

47
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,657
She disappeared somewhere around here.

48
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,202
There's something going on.
I'm sure of it.

49
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,709
Kang Seo-jin, Lee Joon-ki,

50
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,837
I will get you two for certain.

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,511
HIDE-AND-SEEK

52
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,515
Hurry up! Get every nook and cranny!
Spick-and-span!

53
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,643
We get guests once every blue moon.

54
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,269
Why do we have to clean every day?

55
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,896
Exactly.

56
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,650
The weather's so nice, I wish I could go
on a trip somewhere and get some rest.

57
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,985
Trip, my ass.

58
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,112
We don't have the money for that.

59
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,030
Clean already!

60
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,740
Hi, Hyun-joon.

61
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,076
I haven't been able to ask him yet.

62
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,036
I think it'll be tough.

63
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,164
I'm sorry. Bye.

64
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,042
What is it? What's going to be tough?

65
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,796
Well, the baking school
is going on a retreat.

66
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,840
I told him I can't go because of Sol
and work at the guesthouse.

67
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,635
Why not? You should go.

68
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,012
Everyone in your class is going.
You can't miss out.

69
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,557
She's right. You should go.
We can look after Sol for you.

70
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,475
When is the retreat?

71
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,394
This Saturday, for one night.

72
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,146
What? It's overnight?

73
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,150
Does this mean she'll spend the night
with Song Hyun-joon, that bastard?

74
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,237
That can't happen. It mustn't.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,321
Wait!

76
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,200
Gosh, what are we going to do?

77
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,994
Your baking school retreat
and our offsite

78
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,123
are happening at the exact same time!

79
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,750
Offsite? We're going on an offsite?

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,710
Yes, we are.

81
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,754
It was a lot of hard work
doing the guests' laundry, dishes,

82
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,798
and cleaning, don't you think?

83
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,968
So I'd been planning
an overnight offsite for us.

84
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,845
Since when? You just said
we don't have any money.

85
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:04,887
I did?

86
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,891
I was acting so you'd be
even more surprised.

87
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,269
Surprise!

88
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,895
Anyway, Yoon-ah...

89
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,982
it's a shame,
but you'll have to miss the retreat.

90
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,276
That's all right.
There's nothing we can do.

91
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,279
Okay, then!
You're all free this weekend, right?

92
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,280
Wait!

93
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,532
You mean this weekend?

94
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,742
I can't make it.

95
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,994
Why? What's going on?

96
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,749
The thing is I have to cover
a story all night long.

97
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,292
I see.

98
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,669
I... I can't make it either.

99
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,088
I have to shoot all night long.

100
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,841
What? So the two of you

101
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,303
have something to do all night,
over the weekend of all times?

102
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,513
It's true.

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,931
Oh, really?

104
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,350
Which story are you working on
that you have to work all night?

105
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,436
Huh? It's...

106
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,022
I'm covering a funeral.

107
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,231
What? A funeral?

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,484
There's still a few days left
until the weekend.

109
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,570
How do you know when they're going to die
that you're covering a funeral?

110
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,322
-That doesn't make any sense.
-What?

111
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,324
Well...

112
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,367
it's going to be any day now.

113
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,994
-That's too bad.
-The consensus is

114
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,247
that he'll die this weekend,
so my seniors want me on standby.

115
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,209
-Are you serious?
-That's what I'm saying.

116
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,252
Then I'll call one of your seniors
to confirm.

117
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,338
What?

118
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,131
Jeez. There he goes again.

119
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,511
Fine. Go ahead.

120
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,889
Here. Call him. Do it already!

121
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,265
Oh, really?

122
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,518
I'll call him right now!

123
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,394
Call him. Do it!

124
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,521
You can check for yourself.

125
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,773
I'm dialing. I'm doing it!

126
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,734
I'm pressing the call button now!

127
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,491
Okay, that's enough.

128
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,326
Fine, I'll trust you.

129
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,912
The rest of you
all have to be there, okay?

130
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,455
-Okay!
-Doo-sik and I

131
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,333
have a photo shoot for our website
this weekend.

132
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,628
You can do that on the way there.

133
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,673
So, okay. We're leaving
first thing Saturday, and that's that.

134
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,466
-No more buts!
-All right!

135
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,968
-Clean up.
-Let's clean!

136
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,265
Hurry up! Come on!

137
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,975
-Come downstairs!
-Coming!

138
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,936
It's been so long since I've been away.

139
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,022
I couldn't sleep because I was so excited.

140
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,441
Are you that excited?

141
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,109
Totally. Where's Sol, Yoon-ah?

142
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,945
She's sleeping.
I don't want to wake her yet.

143
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,530
Good thinking.

144
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,324
Are you evacuating?
Are you emigrating somewhere?

145
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,367
What is all this?

146
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,786
What do you think?
It's the wardrobe for the shoot.

147
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,496
All this?

148
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,082
How much do you need to shoot?
You're taking so much.

149
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,876
Whose fault is this?

150
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,629
I said I didn't want to go,
yet you're dragging me there.

151
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,716
Of course we need to take everything.
Go get more!

152
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,761
Are you leaving now?
Have fun.

153
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,263
-Are you heading to work?
-Yeah.

154
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,348
What's with the backpack?

155
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,933
Well...

156
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,770
I have a lot to bring
because I'll be working all night.

157
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,981
It'd be really nice
if you came, too, Seo-jin.

158
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,399
I know.

159
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,612
I want to go with you more than anything,
but it just happens I have to work.

160
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,779
Hey, Seo-jin...

161
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,366
you know what will happen
if you hang out with Joon-ki

162
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,660
just because I'm not here, don't you?

163
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:21,334
He'll be attending his own funeral.

164
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,252
Is that what you want to say? Fine.

165
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,380
I'll stay at least 500m away from him
at all times, okay?

166
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,509
Great, well done.
Get going now.

167
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,139
Sol must be awake.
Let me go get her.

168
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,557
Sure, go ahead.

169
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,562
HYUN-JOON

170
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,025
Why the hell is this bastard calling?

171
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,196
Hello? Yes, it's Kang Dong-goo speaking.

172
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,865
Yoon-ah can't take your call
at the moment.

173
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,033
May I help you?

174
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,118
I heard you're going on an offsite today.

175
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,664
I called to tell her to have a good time.

176
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,499
Don't you worry about that.

177
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,252
Yoon-ah will have
a grand old time with us,

178
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,255
so you enjoy your retreat, okay?

179
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,590
Gotta go. We're leaving now.

180
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,762
Yes! I hung up while he was talking.

181
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,231
I'm here.

182
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,526
Huh? What?

183
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,069
Three o'clock position?

184
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,154
Where's that?

185
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,699
Oh, my goodness.

186
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,160
-What? You startled me.
-Get in before someone see you.

187
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,747
Just lift this up to get in. Come on.

188
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,416
Goodness gracious.

189
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,836
What is this, 007? Mission Impossible?

190
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,007
I don't know if I'm dating or taking part
in covert spy operations.

191
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,389
I'll take your bag.

192
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,354
Do you have to take it this far?

193
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,231
It can't hurt to be too careful.

194
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,361
What's that smell?

195
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,196
Something smells bad.

196
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,949
I don't know.
The car smelled funny ever since

197
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,492
Doo-sik and Soo-ah borrowed it.

198
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,037
Anyway, should we leave
for our first trip ever together?

199
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,169
Are you okay, Seo-jin?

200
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,046
Yeah, I'm fine.

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,383
Joon-ki, let's get you a new car
when you make money.

202
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,094
Why? Rebecca's still got what it takes.

203
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,638
Want to see?
Rebecca, you're fine, right?

204
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,931
See? She's fine. She's angry now.

205
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,142
Our trip starts now.

206
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,561
What is this?

207
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,735
-Are you sure we'll be okay?
-Rebecca!

208
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,033
The weather's nice, the view is nice.

209
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,826
It's even better because I'm with you.

210
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,122
It's paradise without
that devilish Dong-goo around!

211
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,666
I know.

212
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,376
That must be it.

213
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,961
-We're here.
-Wow.

214
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,799
Then shall I park the car?

215
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,012
This is great.

216
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,306
Let's do this!

217
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,393
It's so pretty here.

218
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,312
And it's called Boulanger?
What a pretty name.

219
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,022
How'd you find this place?

220
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,110
Dong-goo found it a few days ago
while he was doing research.

221
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,237
It was so pretty that I wanted to come.

222
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,364
With you.

223
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,741
My cute Bacca.

224
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,493
Did you want to come here with me
that much?

225
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,036
Stop teasing.

226
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,705
-Shall we go in?
-Okay.

227
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,582
I'm at your service, Princess.

228
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,335
-Okay.
-Let's do this!

229
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,760
-Are you okay?
-Of course!

230
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,560
Director Bong, are you okay?

231
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,644
I don't know.

232
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,604
I'm carsick.

233
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,190
We weren't even in the car for that long.

234
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,234
Stop being mean and help.

235
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,111
You're such a nuisance.

236
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,238
Ow! Be gentle.

237
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,241
-I'm about to throw up my organs.
-Fine.

238
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,455
Guesthouse Boulanger?

239
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,540
So we're staying at a guesthouse?

240
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,083
Yeah. Why?

241
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,837
Isn't it odd to go away to a guesthouse
when we run one ourselves?

242
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,839
A resort would've been better.

243
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,341
Do you know how much a resort costs?

244
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,845
I wanted to come here because they did
a really good job with the interior.

245
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,264
Yoon-ah, what do you think?

246
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,724
It's so pretty.

247
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,559
Okay, let's go inside.

248
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,853
-Jeez.
-Doo-sik, let's go.

249
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,854
Come on.

250
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,399
If you're done throwing up,
bring the suitcases from the car.

251
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,445
Hey, I'm so nauseous, it's killing me.
You do it.

252
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,989
Must the CEO do such menial work?

253
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,491
Shut up and do it.

254
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,996
What an evil boss.

255
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,539
Okay.

256
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,086
I have to look nice for Joon-ki.

257
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,549
Should I turn on my sex appeal?

258
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,845
Soo-ah, this must be the women's room.

259
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,473
-I think you're right.
-What?

260
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,308
I know that voice.

261
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,559
Goodness Sol, isn't this nice?

262
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,229
Shit!

263
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,073
They did a really good job
with the room, too.

264
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,699
It's cozy and nice.

265
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,621
There's another guest.

266
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:51,997
Is she sleeping?

267
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,334
-Let's unpack first.
-All right.

268
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,628
It's so nice.

269
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,339
What are they doing here?

270
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,966
What on Earth is going on?

271
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,677
My goodness.

272
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,805
I'm so tired from driving for so long.

273
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,392
But it's my first trip with Bacca.

274
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,769
It's going to be so much fun!

275
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,813
Doo-sik, this way.

276
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,356
Oh, okay.

277
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,276
I'm dying. I feel horrible.

278
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,029
What is up with that unpleasant voice?

279
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,281
Need help?

280
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,535
Why did she bring so much?

281
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,456
The room is spacious and clean. I love it.

282
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,292
-Don't you agree?
-I don't care.

283
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,793
Don't talk to me, I feel sick.

284
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,422
There's another guest here.

285
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,756
Is he sleeping?

286
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,426
Nope, but what the hell
are they doing here?

287
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,719
Why?

288
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,140
We can unpack later.
Let's go take a look around.

289
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,766
I want to rest.

290
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,186
We came all the way here. Let's go.

291
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,731
-I told you I'm not feeling well.
-Come on. Hurry up.

292
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,069
Oh, my God. Why are they here?

293
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,864
No way.
This is where they're having the offsite?

294
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,742
This is insane.

295
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,953
Wait. Seo-jin!

296
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,999
Yoon-ah, Soo-ah,
just leave your things and come outside!

297
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,667
Okay, we'll be right there!

298
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,086
-Shall we go, Yoon-ah?
-Shall we?

299
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,339
Let's go take a look, Sol.

300
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,716
-Go to Mommy.
-Let's go.

301
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,555
What the hell?
This is where they're having the offsite?

302
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,557
This is insane.

303
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,518
Damn it. I have to go see Joon-ki.

304
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,064
There's even a pool.
Did you bring your swimsuits?

305
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,692
It's incredible. It's really nice.

306
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,694
Isn't this place awesome?

307
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,613
-Hello.
-Towels for you.

308
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,115
Please tell me
if there's anything you need.

309
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,867
Thank you.

310
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,621
Your guesthouse is really pretty.

311
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,914
Thank you.

312
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,918
How do you manage
this place by yourself?

313
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,295
I didn't see any employees around.

314
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,006
My wife and I are running it by ourselves
because labor costs are high.

315
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:10,302
Actually, we run a guesthouse in Seoul.

316
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,220
Really?

317
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,806
Are you saying you came to stay
at a guesthouse

318
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,307
when you run one yourselves?

319
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,768
Excuse me? Oh, yes.

320
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,855
Then you should know better.
How come you called so late to book?

321
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,983
You're lucky we still had vacancies--

322
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,155
Aren't you busy, sir?

323
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,659
-You should get back to work.
-All right. Call me if you need anything.

324
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,412
That... really wasn't necessary.

325
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,125
So, anyway!
You've... what's it called...

326
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,376
You've done a great job

327
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,712
cleaning and doing laundry
and tending to the guests,

328
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,131
so forget all about the guesthouse.

329
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,924
Let's have a great time, all right?

330
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,676
What should we do?

331
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,430
I... I need to go rest
because I'm nauseous.

332
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,056
I'm dying, here.

333
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,434
Okay, then.

334
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,061
Let's all go in, then. I'll walk you over.

335
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,400
Joon-ki... are you here?

336
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,279
Where the hell is he?

337
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,948
Doo-sik, do you feel any better?

338
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,493
Shit. What the hell? Damn it!

339
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,748
Goodness.

340
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,877
Lie down.

341
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
-Thanks.
-Get some sleep.

342
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,258
I'll wake you up when it's time to eat.

343
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,302
That's all right.
I'm just going to lie down for a bit.

344
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,137
Don't worry about me and have fun.

345
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,306
Okay.

346
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,183
Call me if you need anything.

347
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,809
Okay.

348
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,186
Gosh.

349
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,943
He's been sleeping for a long time.

350
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,291
Seo-jin... are you here?

351
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,503
Where the hell did she go?

352
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,422
Sol, it's time to eat.

353
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,257
-Let's go eat, Sol.
-What the hell?

354
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,219
Mommy will feed you, Sol.
What a good girl.

355
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,598
Were you hungry?
Mommy's going to feed you now.

356
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,559
Hold on one second, okay?

357
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,895
What?

358
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:27,898
Where did it go?

359
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,566
Is something missing?

360
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,111
My camera's gone.

361
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,904
I know I left it here.

362
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,697
You must've put it somewhere else.

363
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,575
No, I'm sure I put it here.

364
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,452
Where did it go?

365
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,166
Excuse me. I'm really sorry,

366
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,086
but have you seen the camera
that was here?

367
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,718
Then did anyone else come in
while we were gone?

368
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,846
Go.

369
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,682
What's with her? She's acting strange.

370
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,352
Excuse me. Shouldn't you answer
when someone asks you a question?

371
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,980
What's wrong with you?

372
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,776
What the hell? Joon-ki!

373
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,404
Dong-goo? What are you doing here?

374
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,531
Hey, Soo-ah!

375
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,159
Yoon-ah's here, too.

376
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,828
What brings you here?

377
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,873
What? We're here for the offsite.
Why are you here?

378
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,916
-I thought you had a shoot.
-What?

379
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,918
Well...

380
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,463
We're shooting on location today. Nearby.

381
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,092
I had so much time between takes
that I got myself a room to nap in.

382
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,219
Why are you in the women's room?

383
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,097
What? This is the women's room?

384
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,475
I just followed the owner guy.

385
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,854
He must not have his wits about him.

386
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,480
We should give him a piece of our minds.

387
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,358
He must've gotten confused,
working all by himself.

388
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
-There's your camera!
-Where?

389
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,658
I'm so glad!

390
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,869
You didn't even look properly.

391
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,370
Thank you.

392
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,542
Goodness, really.
I mean, what are the chances?

393
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,628
Wow.

394
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,299
Who knew we'd meet you here?

395
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,093
-What a coincidence.
-Seriously.

396
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,055
It's such a freaky coincidence.

397
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,850
If only Seo-jin didn't have to work,
we'd all be here together.

398
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,352
What a shame.

399
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,396
Yeah... you're right.

400
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,067
I guess we can't help it.
Isn't it nice here?

401
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,030
I can't believe they thought
of opening a guesthouse here.

402
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,866
Huh? What's this rope for?

403
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,409
It wasn't here earlier.

404
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,037
Is it a bell?

405
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,960
Mister!

406
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,044
Are you all right?

407
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,255
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible.

408
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,383
I was cleaning.
How could you pull on the rope?

409
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,011
-That troublemaker. Jeez.
-I'm so sorry.

410
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,223
-Can I take you to the hospital?
-No, it's fine.

411
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,643
There's a group coming soon.
What will I do?

412
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,562
I have to clean and go buy groceries.
There's tons to do.

413
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,481
I'm really sorry...

414
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,441
Let me ask you for a favor, then.

415
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,402
A favor?

416
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,412
Good going, jerk.

417
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,039
You told us to forget about the guesthouse
and have fun.

418
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:31,957
What the hell is this?

419
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,711
What choice do I have?
He got hurt because of me.

420
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,629
Forget about us,

421
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,424
but you dragged Yoon-ah here
when she could've gone on her retreat.

422
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,342
Well done, you jerk.

423
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,136
I'm sorry, Yoon-ah.

424
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,346
Don't worry about it.

425
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,975
I feel like it's easier to fold towels
where the air is fresher.

426
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,564
It's only until the owner gets back
from the hospital,

427
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,733
-so just bear with it for a while.
-Okay.

428
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,738
It's him.

429
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,449
Hello, sir.

430
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,284
Excuse me?

431
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,286
I see.

432
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,205
Okay.

433
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,958
What? What did he say?

434
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,377
He says it'll take longer than he thought.

435
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:23,008
He asked us to take care of the guests
and to go buy groceries.

436
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,844
For goodness' sake. This sucks.

437
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:31,349
Sorry. I'll get the groceries,
so just finish up around here, please.

438
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,103
Are you sure you can go alone?
There's probably a lot to buy.

439
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,606
You two go ahead. We'll look after Sol.

440
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,734
-Okay, Joon-ki?
-Huh?

441
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,651
All right.

442
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,112
I'll leave Sol with you, then.

443
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,198
Mommy will be right back, okay?

444
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,993
-Let's go, Dong-goo.
-Okay.

445
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,578
-See you.
-Bye.

446
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,996
Sorry.

447
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,337
What's wrong with you?

448
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,130
You look like
you're about to shit your pants.

449
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,300
What? It's nothing.
There's nothing going on.

450
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,475
Joon-ki. Save me.
I'm trapped in the men's room.

451
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,477
Why did she go in there?

452
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,609
I'm done mopping the floors, so I'll go
change the sheets in the men's room.

453
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,985
Okay.

454
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,203
Joon-ki!

455
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,749
-Doo-sik!
-What are you doing here?

456
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,084
Don't you have a shoot today?

457
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,794
Yeah...

458
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,506
The shoot location is nearby,
so I decided to stay here.

459
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,924
Really?

460
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,259
What a coincidence.

461
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,677
I know.

462
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,139
I'm so dumbfounded, I could cry.

463
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:00,188
Why are you in bed?
You came all the way here.

464
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,483
Let's go out, Doo-sik.

465
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,528
That's okay. I'm nauseous and dizzy
from being carsick.

466
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,030
That's why you should get some air.

467
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,448
Let's go for a walk.

468
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,035
-I said I don't want to.
-Then you should sleep.

469
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,288
-I'm not sleepy.
-Then close your eyes or something.

470
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,541
-I'm playing a game on my phone.
-Leave, damn it! Why won't you go out?

471
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,418
That's none of your business.
Why are you mad?

472
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,711
Huh?

473
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,174
I'm just... worried about you.

474
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,592
I'm worried is all.

475
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,760
Since when did you care so much
about me?

476
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,388
Don't talk to me. I need to play this.
What the hell?

477
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,348
You punk.

478
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,727
Joon-ki, what are you doing?
The guests are here.

479
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,478
-Come on out.
-Okay! Be right there!

480
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:47,277
Well... then don't move a muscle
and stay here, okay?

481
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,321
I'll do whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

482
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,823
You trust me, don't you?
Just wait a while.

483
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,534
I'll be right back, okay?

484
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,708
What the hell?

485
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,586
Why is he saying he'll get me out of here?

486
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,924
What do we need to buy?

487
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,469
The group guests want to have
pork belly for dinner.

488
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,763
-Shall we get some vegetables first?
-Okay.

489
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,640
There's the produce store.

490
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,851
-Hello.
-Welcome. What would you like?

491
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,188
Lettuce and perilla leaves, please.
Enough for about ten people.

492
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,105
Sure thing.

493
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,608
You must be newlyweds.

494
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,818
You're quite a handsome couple.

495
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,111
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

496
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,531
It's nice of you to come grocery shopping
with your wife.

497
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,660
Reminds me of old times.

498
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,537
You're so adorable
that I'll throw in some extra.

499
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,582
Well, actually...

500
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,919
Thank you so much. You're very kind.

501
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,462
My hubby loves him some lettuce.

502
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,256
It's great, isn't it, honey?

503
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,174
-Sorry?
-Goodness.

504
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,135
Your wife is so lovable.
You're a lucky man.

505
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,348
-Be happy together, okay?
-Yes, thank you.

506
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,141
Honey, let's go.

507
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,060
Pardon? Oh... okay.

508
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,401
What are you doing?
Why'd you call me "honey"?

509
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,862
She gave us extra on the house.
There was no need to say she was wrong.

510
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,739
We can have what she threw in for free.

511
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,742
Still, this isn't right.

512
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,245
It's wrong to lie, Yoon-ah.

513
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,206
Honey...

514
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,459
pork belly is what you love most
in the entire world,

515
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,255
but I'm so sorry I can only afford
to buy three pounds' worth.

516
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:34,384
My honey can eat that in one go.

517
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,012
It's too little. What will we do?

518
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,977
Honey...

519
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,063
apples are what you love most
in the entire world,

520
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,151
but I'm sorry I can only afford
to buy you this much.

521
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,527
What will we do?

522
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,489
I'm so very upset.

523
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,789
What is this? You told me I shouldn't lie.

524
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,877
But we got free meat and fruit out of it.

525
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,676
What else do we need to get?

526
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,055
Come with me for a sec, Yoon-ah.

527
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,140
-Why?
-Just come with me.

528
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,266
Where are we going?

529
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,561
Why are we here?

530
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,980
This one's pretty.

531
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,027
Come here.

532
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,503
Dong-goo...

533
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,464
Your bangs

534
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,218
keep on covering your eyes.

535
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,514
It'll only cause me trouble
if you fall because of that.

536
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,517
That's why I'm getting it for you.
Don't feel pressured.

537
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,894
It doesn't mean anything, really.

538
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,815
Thank you.

539
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:13,983
It's nothing.

540
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,611
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

541
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,573
Let's go.

542
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,039
Yoon-ah.

543
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,624
Let's go.

544
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,968
-You like sundaes, don't you?
-I do.

545
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,595
-Shall we go eat a sundae?
-Shall we?

546
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:48,351
-Hello. Two sundaes, please.
-Sure.

547
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,862
Why, would you like some makgeolli?

548
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,114
Pardon? No, it's just...

549
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,159
they make it look so tasty.

550
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,619
You should have a glass, then.

551
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,829
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

552
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,457
-One bottle of makgeolli, please.
-Okay.

553
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,168
-It's really okay.
-It's fine.

554
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,137
It's so good.

555
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,599
Do you like it that much?
Want another glass?

556
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,185
I might get drunk if I have more.

557
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,354
You're here to have fun.
Who cares if you get drunk?

558
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,690
-Just have another.
-Shall I, then?

559
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:51,206
I shouldn't have given her
any more makgeolli...

560
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,210
My eyes sting.

561
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,380
Did we come all the way here
to light up a grill?

562
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,882
This is ridiculous.

563
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,512
So why did you come here
for the offsite? Why?

564
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,181
Why are you taking it out on me?
It was Dong-goo's decision.

565
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,976
-Isn't it ready yet?
-Almost done.

566
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,939
There it is.
You can grill the meat on this.

567
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,607
Thanks.

568
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,280
That looks really good.

569
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,825
Would you like to join us?
We brought a lot.

570
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,117
Really?

571
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,536
I almost forgot.

572
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,913
Doo-sik hasn't eaten all day.
He must be hungry.

573
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,707
-I should ask him if he wants any.
-Wait!

574
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,918
I'll go ask him. You stay here.

575
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,047
-Thank you!
-Sure.

576
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,757
Sol, look. It's meat.

577
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,686
Hey, Doo-sik. There's meat.
Let's go out together.

578
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,022
That's okay. I'm still nauseous,
so I don't feel like eating.

579
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,942
The smell of cooking meat
is making me sick. I can't eat that.

580
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,653
Who knows?
Maybe you'll feel better after eating.

581
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,572
I don't want to. I told you I'm nauseous.

582
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,033
You punk! If you're so sick, then how come
you're playing on your phone all day?

583
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,994
Get some sleep instead!

584
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,162
I told you I'm not sleepy.
Why do you keep yelling at me?

585
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,000
You bastard.

586
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,963
Just hold on for a little longer.

587
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,465
You need to be strong, okay?

588
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:29,470
I'll find a way to get you
out of here, okay?

589
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,102
I said no. I'm not leaving!

590
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,812
What's wrong with him?

591
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,647
Stay strong? For what?

592
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,401
Gosh, this is good.

593
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,489
Why are you alone? Isn't Doo-sik eating?

594
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,700
No, he's not.

595
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,203
He must really not be feeling well.

596
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,788
-You should eat.
-What?

597
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,042
I don't have much of an appetite.

598
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,632
Joon-ki! I want to eat pork belly.
I'm starving!

599
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,761
Goodness. How can she think
about eating in this situation?

600
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm speechless.

601
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,729
Give that to me.

602
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,358
Why are you taking that?

603
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,318
-You said Doo-sik isn't eating.
-What?

604
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,780
Well, yeah. It's...

605
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,866
There's a starving cat over there.

606
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,911
He's so pitiful.

607
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
-Do you mind if I take this to him?
-Sure, no problem.

608
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,082
Thank you.

609
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,595
Why are you back?
I told you I don't want to eat.

610
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,681
I'm not here for you,
so mind your own business!

611
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,350
-Then who are you here for?
-You don't need to know.

612
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,476
Just play your game, damn it!

613
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,602
Why are you getting mad?

614
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,398
What's with the paper cup?

615
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,732
Huh?

616
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,570
It's coffee.

617
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,542
Well... I'm off now
since I saw you in bed.

618
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,585
-Hold on.
-What?

619
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,796
Where's the coffee
you were holding in your hand?

620
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,173
What?

621
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,801
The thing is...

622
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,389
Ta-da!

623
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,849
It's magic.

624
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,102
It disappeared without a trace, didn't it?
Where do you think it went?

625
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,439
Wow, that's amazing!
It's fascinating! How did you do it?

626
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,024
Do it again.

627
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,817
Show me. Do it again.

628
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,861
Do what again? Get lost!

629
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,240
He was definitely holding it.

630
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,324
Where's the lettuce?

631
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,617
Damn it.

632
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,831
Don't be like that. Show me one more time.
It's so fascinating, that's why.

633
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,124
Are you serious?

634
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,585
Is that really what you want?

635
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,129
I do. I want to see it again.

636
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,464
Show me. Please?

637
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,132
Just a moment.

638
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,262
You said you'll do the magic trick!

639
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,638
Where are you going?

640
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,691
Ta-da!

641
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,487
Wow, that's amazing!
It's so fascinating!

642
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,572
Where did it go?
Show me. Do it again!

643
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,574
Do what again? Get lost!

644
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,868
Where did it go?

645
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,163
And the garlic and ssamjang?

646
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,126
Joon-ki, don't be like that.
Do it again. Just one more time.

647
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,797
Will you really be this way?
Are you serious?

648
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,717
Must you really have it all?

649
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,095
Does that make you happy?

650
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,639
What are you saying?

651
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,349
I'm really curious, that's why.

652
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,434
Show me just one last time, okay?

653
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,396
Fine. Is that really what you want?

654
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,701
Ta-da!

655
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,622
It's still so fascinating! So awesome!

656
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,873
How did you do it?

657
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,916
This is the last time.

658
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,001
Really, it's the last time.

659
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,503
I can't do it anymore!

660
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,588
Don't expect anything more from me.

661
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,257
Okay.

662
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,800
But it's really cool.

663
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,260
When did you learn how to do magic?

664
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,178
I don't know, you punk! Get lost!

665
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,723
You get lost! What's with the attitude?

666
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,582
Yoon-ah, I think you're drunk.
You should stop drinking.

667
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,501
I'm not drunk at all.

668
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,794
I'm totally fine.

669
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,255
Okay, so stop drinking.

670
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,757
We're not done grocery shopping.

671
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,426
Okay.

672
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,930
You know what, Dong-goo?
Do you like to play hide-and-seek?

673
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,724
Hide-and-seek?

674
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,644
I love playing hide-and-seek.

675
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,271
Do you want to play?

676
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,648
All of a sudden?

677
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,985
Let's get up. We're not done shopping.

678
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,661
-How much do we owe you?
-14,000 won.

679
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,876
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

680
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,169
-Thank you.
-Bye.

681
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,837
Yoon-ah, let's--

682
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,215
What the hell?

683
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,384
Yoon-ah!

684
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,304
Where the hell did she go?

685
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,264
She's driving me nuts.

686
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,642
Yoon-ah!

687
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,268
Yoon-ah!

688
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,229
Where did she go?

689
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,146
Yoon-ah!

690
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,856
Yoon-ah!

691
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,276
Yoon-ah!

692
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,194
-You're the groom.
-Hi.

693
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,738
She's hiding over there.

694
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,371
Yoon-ah, what are you doing here?

695
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,374
You got me!

696
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,961
You found me, Dong-goo!

697
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,045
My turn to find you.

698
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,339
Dong-goo, go hide.

699
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,801
Why would I hide?

700
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,135
Sober up, Yoon-ah.

701
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,430
Your wife was fine earlier. What happened?

702
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,017
She had some makgeolli.
She must be drunk.

703
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,144
I almost forgot.
Can I have some green onions?

704
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,312
Okay, sure.

705
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,149
-It's 2,000 won.
-Here.

706
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,236
What?

707
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,240
Yoon-ah! Where did she go?

708
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,994
She's killing me. Goodness.

709
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,002
What are you doing here?

710
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,714
What? Oh, you got me again!

711
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,258
Okay! My turn to find you.

712
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,718
Go hide, Dong-goo.

713
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,553
This is insane.

714
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,222
You're just dying to play hide-and-seek,
aren't you?

715
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,307
You don't want to hide?

716
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,517
Okay, fine.

717
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,519
I get to hide again!

718
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,647
Where do you think you're going?

719
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,858
Dong-goo, let go.

720
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:43,487
-I have to go hide!
-What am I going to do with her?

721
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,622
Can you untie me, Dong-goo?

722
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,958
I really have to go hide...

723
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,209
Be quiet!

724
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,588
I've never seen such a crazy drunk.

725
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,922
Just follow me, okay?

726
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,633
Geez.

727
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,928
I'm going nuts, seriously.

728
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,768
But I have to hide...

729
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,370
Yoon-ah... Yoon-ah, sober up!

730
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,664
Gosh, you got me again!

731
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,627
Fine, you can go hide now.

732
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,670
I'll be "it."

733
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,672
She's driving me crazy.

734
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,299
Huh?

735
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,634
Okay.

736
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,719
I'll be it again

737
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,805
so you can hide again. Got it?

738
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,101
There's one place I'll never find you.
Do you want to know where?

739
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,894
Where is it?

740
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,063
It's right here. Follow me.

741
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,898
Right here.

742
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,076
So you're saying you can't find me
if I hide in here, right?

743
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,452
I sure can't.

744
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,163
Okay.

745
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,004
Okay, shh. Hide.

746
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,549
Dong-goo, I'm done hiding.

747
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,050
Come find me!

748
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,427
Coming!

749
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,055
Goodness, you did such a great job hiding

750
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,641
that I can't find a single trace of you!

751
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,893
What will I ever do?

752
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,567
I came all the way here for this?

753
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,386
What? You got me again!

754
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,931
Dong-goo, it's really your turn to hide.
I'll be it.

755
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,017
Enough, Yoon-ah.

756
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,852
Sober up, will you?

757
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,523
Are you mad at me?

758
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,025
No, I'm not.

759
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,444
But it seems like you are.

760
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,987
I told you I'm not.

761
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,280
I'm sorry.

762
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,116
I'm really, really sorry, Dong-goo.

763
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,454
You don't have to be sorry,
so please get some sleep on the way back.

764
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,122
Please.

765
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,419
-Dong-goo...
-What is it now?

766
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,714
I caused you a lot of heartache, didn't I?

767
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,134
I know that I did.

768
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,720
But...

769
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,015
I'm afraid.

770
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,021
I don't want to get hurt again,

771
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,525
so I'm afraid.

772
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,195
I'm so scared.

773
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,993
So please don't hate me, Dong-goo.

774
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,664
Don't hate me.

775
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,610
How do you feel, Doo-sik?
Are you all right?

776
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,654
Yeah, I'm feeling better now.

777
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,864
Really? That's great.

778
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,825
Then should we go out for some air?

779
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,910
Let me finish this first.
I'm on the last stage.

780
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,958
What's that noise?

781
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,503
Is he snoring?

782
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:13,716
He was sleeping when we got here.
How many hours has it been?

783
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,344
What's that?

784
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,432
-He's got really long hair for a guy.
-You're right.

785
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,768
-Wait.
-What?

786
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,478
Are those flowers on his shirt?

787
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,771
Flowers?

788
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,315
They are.

789
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:33,068
Actually, it looks like a dress.
Are you sure he's a man?

790
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,448
What are you talking about?
Can't you tell he's a man?

791
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,575
So many guys grow out their hair
these days.

792
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,744
And haven't you heard of unisex?

793
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,288
There's no distinguishing between
guys' or girls' clothing now.

794
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,248
Look, I have flowers on my underwear!

795
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,375
What the hell are you doing?

796
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,711
It's still strange.

797
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,921
He even has a better figure than me.

798
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,256
-What?
-She's right.

799
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,800
-You think maybe... it's a woman?
-What?

800
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,135
Soo-ah, you should check.

801
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,136
Shall I?

802
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,514
Why do you need to check?
Don't bother a sleeping person.

803
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,183
That's bad manners. Don't.

804
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,560
Get out of my way. I'll just sneak a peek.

805
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,855
I told you to move.

806
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,023
Oh, my God.

807
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,154
I guess not.

808
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,283
It's a man. He's got facial hair.

809
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,703
-Facial hair?
-Really? I thought it might be a woman.

810
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,040
-Wait.
-What?

811
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,958
Seo-jin's a woman,
but she's got facial hair.

812
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:30,918
-Seo-jin?
-Hey.

813
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,380
She's got to be the only woman
to have that much facial hair.

814
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,547
I guess.

815
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,675
Let's go out for the photo shoot
when Dong-goo gets back

816
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,218
now that you're feeling better.

817
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,177
Okay.

818
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,320
Yoon-ah.

819
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,573
Yoon-ah, we're here.

820
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:28,911
Oh, my.

821
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,498
Dong-goo...

822
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,917
what happened?

823
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,377
What do you think?

824
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,422
You got drunk and wanted to play
hide-and-seek,

825
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,426
so I had to run around the entire market
trying to find you.

826
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,720
Oh, no. Did I do that?

827
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,514
I'm so sorry.

828
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,725
I have a habit of playing hide-and-seek
when I get drunk.

829
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,145
Is that all I did?
I didn't make any mistakes?

830
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,317
-No, you didn't.
-I'm so glad.

831
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,945
I'm sorry, Dong-goo.

832
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,781
It's fine. Get some rest.

833
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,491
I'm all right.

834
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,743
There's so much to do.

835
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,161
Goodness.

836
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:25,133
Where did everyone go?
It's almost time for the guests to arrive.

837
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,677
Anybody there?

838
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,637
I think the guests have arrived.

839
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:30,222
Welcome!

840
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,476
Hyun-joon?

841
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,187
Yoon-ah. What are you doing here?

842
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,356
Is this where you're holding the offsite?

843
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,192
Yes. What about you?

844
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,779
This is the guesthouse my friend runs.

845
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,406
This is pretty cool.

846
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,325
So that's what happened.
What a coincidence.

847
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,667
Let's take these suitcases outside.

848
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,043
Okay.

849
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,798
Why is it so loud?

850
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,175
Are the guests here?
Let's go see, Doo-sik.

851
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,435
Hey, Seo-jin. Get up. Seo-jin!

852
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:18,645
What do you want?

853
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,230
Wake up!

854
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,190
How can you sleep in this situation?

855
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,652
Huh? What the hell happened?

856
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,739
I don't know. We don't have much time,
so let's go before they come back.

857
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:29,656
-Hurry.
-Okay.

858
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,083
Why the hell is he sitting out there?
This is killing me.

859
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,754
I don't think you can go out this way.
What are we going to do?

860
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,672
Are you serious? What should we do?

861
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,925
Right. The window!

862
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,012
Open it.

863
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,556
What's wrong with this?

864
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,226
-It must be broken.
-What?

865
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,771
Damn it.

866
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,190
All hell will break loose
if Dong-goo finds out.

867
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,067
What do we do?

868
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:10,822
Yes!

869
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,283
Did you think of something?

870
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,661
-Seo-jin.
-Yes?

871
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,787
Go inside that.

872
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,749
You want me to go in the suitcase?

873
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,000
Are you crazy?

874
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,293
What else can we do?

875
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,545
Doo-sik's standing guard
and the window is broken.

876
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,047
Do you want to go back into bed?

877
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,466
What if you get caught? What will you do?

878
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,219
-Seriously, do we have to go this far?
-There's no other way.

879
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,305
Fine, I'll do it.

880
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,350
Good. Let's get you inside.

881
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,526
This is driving me crazy.

882
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,906
Get in, Seo-jin.

883
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,616
-Damn it.
-Get in.

884
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,994
Careful.

885
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,414
-I'll get you out right away.
-Okay.

886
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,932
It'll just be a short while.

887
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,826
Oh, no! Seo-jin!

888
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,453
I'm so sorry.

889
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:43,915
Let's go quickly.

890
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:44,875
-Joon-ki.
-Oh, my God!

891
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,836
You startled me! Why are you so surprised?

892
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,964
What are you doing with my suitcase?

893
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:54,551
Huh? Well... it's... I was going to...

894
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,554
You're helping us prepare
for the photo shoot? Thank you!

895
00:50:59,014 --> 00:50:59,890
Why is this so heavy?

896
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,975
Hey... Soo-ah.

897
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,895
Shit!

898
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,938
Why is this so heavy?

899
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,065
-How much did you bring?
-Shut up!

900
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,824
Why are you following us?

901
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,035
Yeah, why?

902
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,330
I just want to help out.

903
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,082
Soo-ah, isn't the suitcase heavy?

904
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,501
Allow me.

905
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,794
Yes, please.

906
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,003
Okay!

907
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,338
Let's go!

908
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,555
-Hurry up!
-Coming!

909
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,892
It really worked out.

910
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,269
I was so upset you couldn't make it.

911
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,813
How did we end up meeting here?

912
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:52,776
Seriously. I had no idea that this place
was run by Hyun-joon's friend.

913
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,070
What should we do now?

914
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,322
It's too early for dinner.

915
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,241
How about a game?

916
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,534
That sounds good.

917
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,161
-What shall we play?
-How about 007?

918
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,663
-Electricity game.
-Bang, bang!

919
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:08,917
Come on now, everyone. You all know
that when you're at a retreat,

920
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,086
you have to play jokgu.

921
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,170
Jokgu?

922
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,882
How can you suggest jokgu
when we have ladies here?

923
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,802
There's no gender discrimination
in sports.

924
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,846
You could easily be misunderstood,
you know.

925
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,306
That's not what I meant.
It's just that everyone's tired.

926
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,267
I don't think a ball game
is the way to go.

927
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,186
What about a game of charades?

928
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,354
We can play it indoors.

929
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,107
There's nothing like jokgu
at a retreat, I tell you!

930
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,400
Don't you agree, Yoon-ah?

931
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:37,028
I'm still a bit dizzy,
so jokgu might be difficult.

932
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,282
Let's play charades instead.

933
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,534
You should join us, Dong-goo.

934
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,329
Well, I guess I can.

935
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,880
I'm really bad at this.

936
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,008
We've lived under the same roof
for quite some time now.

937
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:02,137
I can't speak for Hyun-joon,
but I can definitely get it right.

938
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,598
EGG

939
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,562
Answer! Fart.

940
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,360
Answer! Constipation.

941
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,904
You can't poop.

942
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,615
-Egg?
-Correct!

943
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,825
SHRIMP

944
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,163
Answer! Zombie?

945
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,123
A zombie with a broken back!

946
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,042
-Shrimp!
-Nah...

947
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,293
Correct!

948
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,298
What is that? What are you doing?

949
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,799
The Unbearable Lightness of Being.

950
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,722
"Even if the world goes to pieces,
I'd still plant my apple tree."

951
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,933
-Correct!
-Amazing!

952
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,852
-Hyun-joon, you're really good at this!
-How did you get that right?

953
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,563
It doesn't make any sense!
It doesn't!

954
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,525
Okay, let's go. Nice.

955
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,568
One more.

956
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,862
That's a bit pretentious. Something else.

957
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,697
Very nice.

958
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,450
-Do full body shots now.
-Joon-ki...

959
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,035
-No, stop it.
-Okay.

960
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,082
-Are you okay?
-How long do I have to stay in here?

961
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,585
My legs hurt and it's suffocating.

962
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,088
I'm sorry. Just a bit longer.

963
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,923
I'll do whatever it takes, okay?

964
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,967
Joon-ki, who are you talking to?

965
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,552
What? Well...

966
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,346
To this rock.

967
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:31,142
Gosh. It must be so frustrating
to be stuck in the ground.

968
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,479
You're a very hard-headed fellow.

969
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,357
What are you talking about?
Move. I need to get some clothes.

970
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,734
-I need to change into the next outfit.
-No!

971
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,153
Goodness. What do you mean, no?

972
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,531
No, not this suitcase. Never!

973
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,533
That's my bag. What are you saying?

974
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,577
-Get out of the way.
-I said no! I can't give you this. Never!

975
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,037
Have you gone mad?

976
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,164
Stop it and give me my suitcase!

977
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,083
No! Never! I won't!

978
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,215
What's wrong with him?

979
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,925
-Doo-sik, go get him!
-Okay!

980
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,639
Hey! Joon-ki!

981
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,641
What's the matter with him?

982
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:16,688
This is so heavy.

983
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,455
Where the hell did he go?

984
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,749
Why would he run off with my suitcase?

985
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,168
He must've really lost it.

986
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,128
He must be somewhere else.

987
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,088
-Let's go that way.
-All right.

988
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,473
They left, Seo-jin.

989
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,017
It's over. It's all over now.

990
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,520
Where did she go?

991
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,940
What happened?

992
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,109
No way.

993
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,154
Shit!

994
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,990
Seo-jin!

995
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,576
Seo-jin!

996
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,917
SHRIMP,
THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING

997
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,796
The Unbearable Lightness of Being.

998
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,757
Didn't that work up your appetites?

999
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,717
Shall we eat dinner?

1000
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,594
Really?

1001
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,304
Then you should all rest.

1002
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,599
Men are supposed to cook
at a place like this.

1003
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,309
I'll make us something.

1004
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,812
Wait.

1005
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,981
You can cook with the real man,
Kang Dong-goo.

1006
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,360
-Do you know how to cook?
-Of course.

1007
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:48,279
I've been CEO of a guesthouse for years.

1008
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,698
Most chefs can't hold a candle to me.

1009
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,325
Is that so?

1010
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,452
Then please, join me.

1011
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,371
Great. Let's go.

1012
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,998
I'll show you the true taste
of a real man.

1013
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,424
What are you going to make?

1014
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,262
I'll grill some meat and make kimchi stew.

1015
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,222
Oh, kimchi stew?

1016
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,099
That's what I was going to make.

1017
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,684
It's my specialty.

1018
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,060
How exactly will you make it?

1019
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,605
With some pork shoulder and kimchi.
Then I'll boil it. Isn't that enough?

1020
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:28,153
A kimchi stew should be made
with none other than mackerel pike.

1021
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,697
Isn't pork kimchi stew the easiest choice?

1022
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,658
Goodness, you're mistaken.

1023
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,119
Do you want to make a bet
to see which is tastier?

1024
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,829
You're on.

1025
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,999
Let's begin.

1026
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,665
Why are there two kimchi stews?

1027
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,961
Well, Hyun-joon and I had
a difference in opinion.

1028
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,341
You should all try both
and let us know which one you prefer.

1029
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,761
We placed a bet.

1030
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,346
Really?

1031
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,431
Shall I taste it, then?

1032
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,603
Gosh, it's greasy.

1033
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,692
This one's perfect!

1034
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:54,113
You're right. I also think that
the pork kimchi stew tastes better.

1035
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,907
-How about you, Yoon-ah?
-Oh.

1036
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,413
This one's tasty.

1037
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,708
And that one?

1038
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,593
This one's also tasty...

1039
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,262
but a little greasy.

1040
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,932
To be honest, I'm not a big fan of fish.

1041
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,392
Yes!

1042
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,770
Why? Is the mackerel pike stew yours,
Dong-goo?

1043
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,733
Who cares who the winner is?

1044
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,028
What matters is that
we're all enjoying this food together.

1045
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,446
I'm sorry.

1046
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,616
No worries.

1047
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,953
Let me get some air. Excuse me.

1048
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,596
My goodness. The weather is great,
the fresh air is great,

1049
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,098
but Song Hyun-joon is not so great.

1050
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,435
Song Hyun-joon, that piece of shit.

1051
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,730
Nothing works out because of him.

1052
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,703
Looks like no one's eating this.
Shall I put it away?

1053
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,538
Just leave it. I'll eat it.

1054
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,082
-You said you don't like fish.
-Huh?

1055
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,377
But this looks tasty.

1056
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,296
I'll eat it.

1057
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,323
I've always known he was nuts,
but I just can't understand him.

1058
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,326
Why would he run off
with someone else's suitcase?

1059
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,786
Did he hit his head or something?

1060
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,623
Let him be. Don't try to understand him.
Just give up.

1061
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:12,168
We couldn't even have a proper photo
shoot because of that jerk. What the hell?

1062
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,756
-Joon-ki!
-Joon-ki.

1063
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,841
Give me that suitcase.

1064
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,260
What? Why do you keep doing this? Stop!

1065
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,347
Just give it to me. Please.

1066
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:28,059
What do you have against our suitcases?
Why are you doing this?

1067
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,394
Cut the crap and give it to me!

1068
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,271
-No, no. You can't. No!
-Give it to me.

1069
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,107
Let go of my suitcase!

1070
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,192
-Let go!
-What's wrong? Joon-ki, stop.

1071
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,360
Give it to me.

1072
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,078
Oh, my God! My clothes!
What are you going to do?

1073
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,580
Seo-jin... Seo-jin!

1074
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,040
Why are you yelling Seo-jin's name?

1075
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,459
Damn it. Seo-jin!

1076
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,134
Seo-jin!

1077
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,552
-What's wrong with him?
-Seo-jin.

1078
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,681
No, Seo-jin. No!

1079
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:07,598
Seo-jin.

1080
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,268
Wait. Why is he yelling Seo-jin's name?

1081
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,562
I don't know. He's nuts.
What do we do?

1082
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,855
Seo-jin!

1083
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:18,901
-No, Seo-jin. Hang on!
-Why is he calling out for her?

1084
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,028
-Joon-ki!
-Get out!

1085
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,532
-This way. Over here.
-Come here.

1086
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,869
-Oh, my gosh.
-Lift it!

1087
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,666
Seo-jin!

1088
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,337
What the hell?

1089
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,881
Are you all right?

1090
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,301
I'm all right. I'm fine.

1091
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:44,886
I'm okay.

1092
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,138
Is that Seo-jin?

1093
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:50,850
Why is Seo-jin here? What happened?

1094
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,481
No way...

1095
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,565
Is it magic?

1096
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,444
Wow, that's amazing.
Where'd you learn how to do this?

1097
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,279
Magic, my ass!
What are you talking about?

1098
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,741
Joon-ki, what happened?
Why is Seo-jin here?

1099
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,286
-Well... the thing is...
-What are you all doing there?

1100
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,331
-What's going on? What were you doing?
-Dong-goo...

1101
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,793
Hey, Seo-jin! What are you...?

1102
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,754
You said you were covering a funeral.

1103
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,132
Dong-goo, the thing is...

1104
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,342
Wait.

1105
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,136
What's this ominous vibe I'm getting?

1106
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,640
What's with this awful feeling

1107
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:34,143
that I'll find out something
of great magnitude?

1108
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,148
Well... the thing is... we...

1109
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,485
Joon-ki, enough is enough.

1110
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,404
Let's just tell him the truth.

1111
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,783
What truth?
What are you talking about?

1112
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:54,163
Well, you see... it's...

1113
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,751
Will you be like this until the end?
Fine, forget it.

1114
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,044
You son of a bitch.

1115
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,185
What is this?

1116
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:20,731
What do you think you're doing?

1117
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,900
Why are you holding hands?

1118
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:27,280
Dong-goo, I like Seo-jin.

1119
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,239
What?

1120
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:31,993
Excuse me?

1121
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,871
What do you mean?

1122
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,081
I, Lee Joon-ki,

1123
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,042
like your sister, Kang Seo-jin.

1124
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:40,960
No...

1125
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,671
I'm in love with her.

1126
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,217
What did you say? Love?

1127
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,430
So, to summarize,

1128
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,642
you and Seo-jin love each other?

1129
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,523
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I love Seo-jin.

1130
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,150
So...

1131
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,402
kill me or let me live.

1132
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,237
Do as you wish.

1133
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,156
Kill you or let you live?

1134
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,700
Fine.

1135
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,913
-Then I'll kill you!
-Don't.

1136
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,873
How can you do this to me?

1137
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,792
You didn't say a word to me about it!
My sister?

1138
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:22,710
You son of a bitch!

1139
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,297
When did it start? Tell me!

1140
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,858
So, you tricked me all this time?

1141
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,444
-You're not my sister anymore.
-Dong-goo, let's talk.

1142
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,404
As far as I'm concerned,
you no longer exist.

1143
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,448
So don't even talk to me
or act like you know me!

1144
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:56,744
I won't shave until you give us
your blessing. Got it?

1145
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:57,703
What?

1146
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,081
He's the Park Bo-gum
of the modeling industry.

1147
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,874
My name is Min Soo-ah.

1148
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:02,792
Bad rhinitis!

1149
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:05,920
What's that smell?

1150
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,380
It's so bad.

1151
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,384
-I'm sorry!
-I won't do the shoot today.

1152
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,387
Just stay here. You crazy bastard!

1153
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,390
How about we go out
for celebratory drinks?

1154
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,059
I should come with.

1155
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,978
Didn't you want to say something,
Hyun-joon?

1156
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,104
Actually, I...

1157
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:26,732
Song Hyun-joon seems like a decent guy.

1158
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,150
Do you know how foolish you are?

1159
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,527
Yoon-ah...
