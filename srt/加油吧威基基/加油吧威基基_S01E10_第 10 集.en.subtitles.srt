1
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,256
Today I was…

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:53,344
a bit touched by you.

3
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,724
No need to be touched.

4
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,144
Didn't you say it was a really
important interview?

5
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:06,483
So make sure you get the job, okay?
Got it?

6
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,777
You know…

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,905
when I saw you today,

8
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,075
my heart fluttered.

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,577
Why do you think that happened?

10
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,412
Am I nuts?

11
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,790
Hey, look at me.

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,500
Let me go!

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,877
Let me take a look at you!

14
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,177
I really don't get it.

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,889
Why'd I think you were good-looking?

16
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,332
You scared me!

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,918
Dong-goo! What are you doing there?

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,628
I can't sleep.

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,880
What's wrong?

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,679
Soo-ah, you had asked me…

21
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,973
if I'm ready to deal
with Yoon-ah's situation.

22
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,810
No matter how much I think about it,
I don't have an answer.

23
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,728
I'm not sure if I'm ready…

24
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,190
Well, it's not an easy task.

25
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,069
Want to have a drink?

26
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,071
I was planning to drink away my sorrows.

27
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,948
Sure, why not?

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,575
Let's do it.

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,035
Let's go.

30
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,129
Wait, take off your shoes.

31
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,924
Pull yourself together,
and walk by yourself now!

32
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,970
Ouch!

33
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,725
Get up.

34
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,560
Stop walking with your nose!

35
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,520
-I want to drink some more.
-Come here!

36
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,647
Another drink.

37
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,983
Not that way, this way!

38
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,027
I want to drink some more!

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,112
I said I want another drink!

40
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,490
Ow, that hurt!

41
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,618
My knee!

42
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,286
Are you okay?

43
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,330
What the heck is this?

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,504
Oh no! This is Dong-goo's camera.

45
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,175
Seo-jin! What should I do?

46
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,720
I broke Dong-goo's camera!

47
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,805
What should I do?

48
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,600
No, no, don't!

49
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,479
Not here, you can't!

50
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,689
OLIVIA, MY LOVE

51
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,695
My head is killing me…

52
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,909
My stomach…

53
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,911
Why did you guys drink so much?

54
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,163
Don't talk to me, I'm tired.

55
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,291
Min Soo-ah, you drink like a fish.

56
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,336
Hello? Yes, Detective.

57
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,421
Did you catch him?

58
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,548
Not yet?

59
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,468
All right.

60
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,889
All he ever says is "Wait."

61
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,017
Yoon-seok what's-his-face--
they didn't catch that con artist yet?

62
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,477
No.

63
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,064
Where could that jerk be hiding?

64
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,817
Just wait 'til you get caught. I'll just--

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,027
Don't worry. They'll get him soon.

66
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,281
Doo-sik, are you okay?
I mean, about Mal-geum.

67
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,536
I'm okay.

68
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,373
It's a great opportunity for her.
It's good that she went.

69
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,294
Besides, since I started writing
web fiction again,

70
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,628
I have no time to think about her.

71
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,424
Web fiction? I thought you quit that.

72
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,218
Yeah, but my fans made a big fuss.

73
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,846
They want
"My President Is Bruce Lee, Season 2."

74
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,431
Season 2?

75
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,600
That story about the POTUS
defeating aliens?

76
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,519
I wanted to take a break too,

77
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,815
but as a writer,
how could I reject my fans' requests?

78
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,942
Well, I'm off to work.

79
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,449
Say "ah."

80
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,243
There you go.

81
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,916
It seems everyone drank last night,
so I made some hangover soup.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,126
Really?

83
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,381
Ah, that feels so nice!

84
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,633
Dong-goo, go ahead and eat.

85
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,136
Okay, thank you.

86
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,354
Are Seo-jin and Joon-ki still sleeping?
I think they drank a lot last night.

87
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,275
Those two fight all the time,
but it's like they're joined at the hip.

88
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,360
They'll start having feelings
for each other.

89
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,737
"Feelings"?

90
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,448
What kind of foul suggestion is that?

91
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,742
Don't say that about my precious sister!

92
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,703
Joined at the hip
with that good-for-nothing?

93
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,000
-What's wrong with Joon-ki?
-Pardon? Oh, he's not a bad person,

94
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,544
but I know him inside and out.

95
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,004
Him and my sister…?

96
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,633
Soo-ah, don't ever
make that foul suggestion again.

97
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,551
Makes my skin crawl!

98
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,305
Oh, my head.

99
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,350
What's this?
Why did you drink together last night?

100
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,476
Where? Until when?

101
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,769
I don't know.

102
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,063
Seo-jin,
what time did we come in last night?

103
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,399
I blacked out
and only remember flashes of last night.

104
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,861
Me, too. I only remember bits and pieces.

105
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,029
You blacked out?

106
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,200
We started drinking soju at 7:00…

107
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,203
-Then we ordered beer…
-Then we ate noodles with sea snails.

108
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,289
We were going to end
with fish cake soup and rice wine…

109
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,043
Right. We were about to leave,
but the owner gave us extra tofu kimchi,

110
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,378
so we ordered more soju…

111
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,005
Right, and we had one or two more shots…

112
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,722
Why?
What kind of mess did we--?

113
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,558
Wait a minute…

114
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,977
I said I want another drink!

115
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,484
What? What happened?

116
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,611
Did something happen with you two?

117
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,905
What? No. Nothing happened.

118
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,200
Of course, nothing.

119
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,244
Well, I should go take a shower.

120
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm still sleepy.
I'm going back to bed.

121
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,896
It wasn't a dream.

122
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,481
This is…!

123
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,194
Dong-goo will flip if he finds out.

124
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,456
I must have been crazy!

125
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,540
But, why?

126
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,461
Why? Why did I kiss that good-for-nothing?

127
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,254
Why?

128
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,343
-Seo-jin.
-You scared me!

129
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,720
By any chance…
do you remember what happened?

130
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,599
Then… you remember too?

131
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,850
Of course. How could I not?

132
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,438
How could this happen? What do we do?

133
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,191
Joon-ki…

134
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,777
-Can we act like it didn't happen?
-Didn't happen?

135
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,737
How can we when it's already happened?

136
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,615
Why not? It's just between us anyway.

137
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,160
-What if Dong-goo finds out?
-What? Dong-goo?

138
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,372
How would he find out?
He wasn't even there.

139
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,707
Hey. Nothing stays secret forever.

140
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,043
What do you mean? No one else saw.

141
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,170
If we keep it between us,
no one will find out.

142
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,090
You think?

143
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,717
Yes! So… Joon-ki…

144
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,889
we're taking this with us to the grave.

145
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,018
Fine, for now.

146
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,521
This doesn't feel right.

147
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,025
I must have been crazy!
Why kiss a good-for-nothing like him?

148
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,487
Alcohol is my worst enemy!
Stupid, stupid!

149
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,413
Why did I break Dong-goo's camera?

150
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,042
Alcohol is my worst enemy! Alcohol!

151
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,675
But in Season 1,
the President died fighting aliens.

152
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,427
Should I resurrect him?

153
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,972
Zombie! That's it!

154
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,558
He becomes a zombie
and confronts the aliens again!

155
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,937
President is Bruce Lee

156
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,606
is Zombie.

157
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,359
Gosh! This title is out of this world!

158
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,695
Excuse me, do you have that ramyun?

159
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,821
Which one?

160
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,450
Pa-pai tapo tomnyang ramyun.

161
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,285
Pa-pai, po-pai what…?

162
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,706
Oh, that Thai ramyun?
We're all out of stock right now.

163
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,915
Oh, is that so?

164
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,709
Man, I really wanted that.

165
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,338
Soo-ah is already dating someone new?

166
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,341
-What does he do?
-He runs a Thai restaurant or something.

167
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,179
Hold on…

168
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,139
"Pa-pai, po-pai"…?

169
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,267
Thai!

170
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,442
I think that was Soo-ah's ex-boyfriend.

171
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,618
He's dead!

172
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,953
I'm pretty sure
something flew by just now.

173
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,497
Yeah, seemed like it.

174
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,956
"He's dead"…?

175
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,460
Dong-goo,
I'm sorry but I have to get to class.

176
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,795
could you watch Sol for me?

177
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,837
Yes, I will.

178
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,339
Thank you.

179
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:17,051
Here we go, Sol.
Your mom has to go to class.

180
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,595
Thank you, Dong-goo! I'll see you later!

181
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,764
Okay. Be safe.

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,977
I should check the reservations.

183
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,982
Who left such a mess here? Jeez.

184
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,403
Goodness.

185
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,947
What the--? Why is this on the floor?

186
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,496
What's this? What happened?
My camera!

187
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,165
What happened to my camera?
Who broke my camera?

188
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,419
It was you, wasn't it? You did this!

189
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,295
N-no…?

190
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,214
Hey! Kang Seo-jin!

191
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,217
You did this! Right? You did this!

192
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,554
What do you mean?
I've never even seen your camera.

193
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,183
Then it was Doo-sik, that punk!

194
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,604
Bong Doo-sik!

195
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,357
You're the one who broke my camera,
aren't you?

196
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,693
What? You didn't?
Hang up!

197
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,196
Who the hell broke my camera?

198
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,159
Just wait until I find you,
I'll break your back in half!

199
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,665
My poor camera! Just look at you!

200
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,543
Who did this to you? Who?

201
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,879
No!

202
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,428
But why the heck did I kiss Joon-ki?

203
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,345
Am I crazy?

204
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,640
Well, he was pretty charming
at the interview.

205
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,225
No, even so…

206
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,227
But, why? Why?

207
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,354
I don't know.

208
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,774
-Seo-jin.
-You started me!

209
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,734
You should knock!

210
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,651
Sorry, sorry.

211
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,364
-I just wanted to say something.
-Really? What is it?

212
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:11,665
Seo-jin… what happened yesterday…
let's just come clean and tell Dong-goo.

213
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,836
What?
Why do you keep insisting on telling him?

214
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,172
Didn't you see him just now?

215
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:22,051
If he finds out later, he'll be furious!
I feel so anxious right now!

216
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,887
What I'm saying is, how would he find out?

217
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,599
Seo-jin, nothing stays secret forever.

218
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,937
If he finds out later that we hid this,
he might literally kill us.

219
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,566
Don't you know what he's like?
Let's just confess.

220
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,194
Fine, let's say we confess.

221
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,031
Do you think my brother will say,
"I see, that's nice" and get over it?

222
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,368
The moment we confess,
you and I are done for.

223
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,328
Oh shoot, shoot…

224
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,997
Why did we do that?

225
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,209
Just erase it from your memory.

226
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,920
If we just keep quiet,
no one will ever know.

227
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,256
Fine, for now.

228
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,101
Why does he keep wanting to tell Dong-goo
about our kiss?

229
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,394
Is he out of his mind?

230
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,523
Will he really not find out
if we keep quiet?

231
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,318
But Seo-jin is something else.

232
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,530
How can she be so nonchalant about
breaking her brother's prized camera?

233
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,158
So scared to end up with a girl like her.

234
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,833
Detective, since we got the guy on camera,
you can catch him, right?

235
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,547
Again, I have to wait?
How long do I have to--

236
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,717
Hello? Detective?

237
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,346
Police always tell you to wait.

238
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,473
Forget it.

239
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,977
What are you doing?

240
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,397
I'm going to keep watch myself.

241
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,648
Why? Can't I do that?

242
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,986
It's not that.
Won't he run away if he sees you here?

243
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,449
Is that so? Then what do I do?

244
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,412
This design is so cheesy.
You call this a uniform?

245
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,875
All part-time uniforms are like this.
How long are you going to be here?

246
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,960
Until I catch that jerk.

247
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,712
Why? Can't I?

248
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,966
No, it's okay. I'm going to organize
the stock. Watch the counter.

249
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,176
Okay.

250
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,268
Welcome.

251
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,811
Get me a Coke.

252
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,439
And a chocolate bar.

253
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,025
Pardon? Why are you asking me to do that?

254
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,693
If a customer asks, just do it.

255
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,403
-No questions.
-What?

256
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,907
Why are you ordering me around?

257
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,867
Did I upset you?

258
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,411
You're just a part-timer.
Don't be so impolite.

259
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,913
What?

260
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,331
You're a piece of work!

261
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,376
Hey, stop it.

262
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,877
I apologize. I'll bring them now.

263
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,712
Should've done that sooner.

264
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,557
Here you go, sir.

265
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,648
Here.

266
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,698
Excuse me.

267
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,325
Why did you throw that on the floor?
The trash can is over there.

268
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,996
Your hourly wage includes cleaning up.

269
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,455
Didn't you know?

270
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,040
What did you say?

271
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,001
Who do you think you are?

272
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,502
Stop, already!

273
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,546
I'm sorry. This is her first day.

274
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,259
Jeez. I'll let it go for your sake.

275
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,218
Do your job right, punk.

276
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,095
Why you--!

277
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,014
Thank you, sir.

278
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,893
What's wrong with you?

279
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,062
What? He was clearly in the wrong!

280
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,815
He's always like that.
He owns the BBQ spot next door.

281
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,275
It's best to just steer clear.

282
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,528
Wow, you're such a pushover.

283
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,155
You…

284
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,705
Yoon-ah.

285
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,958
Hello.

286
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,460
Hold on…

287
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,338
why do you sound so down?
Did something happen?

288
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,718
It's just… everyone is doing so well,

289
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,012
but it seems I keep falling behind.

290
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,766
Don't worry too much.
With practice, you'll catch up in no time.

291
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,102
I don't have anywhere else
to practice but here.

292
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,522
Yoon-ah, do you have some time right now?

293
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,568
-Come in.
-Okay.

294
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,198
But why did we come to a bakery?

295
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,616
Hello, sir.

296
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,952
Oh! Is this your bakery?

297
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,497
Yep. Yoon-ah, come this way.

298
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,832
Okay.

299
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,929
What is this?

300
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,514
It's my private workspace.

301
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,265
I develop recipes here,

302
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,643
and secretly take naps
without telling my employees.

303
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,811
I see.

304
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,396
Yoon-ah.

305
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,858
Can you make the donut again
that you made in class?

306
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,776
I'll help you.

307
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,444
Really?

308
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,156
Why is this camera so expensive?

309
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,202
I don't even have money to eat.
I'm going to go crazy.

310
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,627
Dong-goo… did you go somewhere?

311
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,795
The camera repair shop.

312
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,007
They said it's broken beyond repair.

313
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,804
My poor Olivia.

314
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,472
Olivia?

315
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,766
Who's Olivia?

316
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,518
The camera's name.

317
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,523
I cherished her more than my own sister.

318
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,735
I bought her after working
at construction sites for a year.

319
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,448
I cleaned and took care of her
every day.

320
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,368
I became really attached to her.

321
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,497
Dong-goo…

322
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,124
are you crying?

323
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,961
Oh, it's nothing.

324
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,174
I just feel sad and empty
as though my own sister died.

325
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,429
Olivia!

326
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,432
Olivia!

327
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,772
Why aren't they sending
the interview results?

328
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,111
Sol, did I not get the job again?

329
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,655
It can't be.

330
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,493
Seo-jin.

331
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,329
You startled me. What?

332
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,749
I think I have to tell Dong-goo the truth.

333
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,917
What do you mean?

334
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,337
Dong-goo is crying right now!
He's crying!

335
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,589
What? Why is he crying?

336
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,383
What does his crying have to do with us?

337
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,301
Kang Seo-jin.

338
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,637
Do you even have a conscience?

339
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,182
What do you mean?
Conscience has nothing to do with it.

340
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,060
Isn't your conscience pricked?
Aren't you sorry for Dong-goo?

341
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,939
Why should I be sorry for Dong-goo?

342
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:36,443
How can you act like this?
I can't even look at you right now.

343
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,739
Joon-ki, it was just a drunken mistake.
A mistake.

344
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,783
It's nothing to feel guilty about.

345
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,369
Wow, you're really something.

346
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,330
Aren't you even a little embarrassed
in front of Sol?

347
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,625
I never dreamed
that you could be such a monster!

348
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,542
Monster?

349
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,839
Joon-ki…
it seems you're very upset right now.

350
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,675
Go get some sleep.

351
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,177
A good long sleep.
Then you'll feel much better.

352
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,720
Okay?

353
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,472
Go on and get some sleep.

354
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,016
It will be okay, won't it?

355
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,652
-Why are you laughing?
-Because it's so absurd!

356
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:23,282
The POTUS is not only a zombie,
but also a martial arts master?

357
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,909
The fact that POTUS was reborn
as Bruce Lee

358
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,744
has already been addressed in Season 1!

359
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,081
Does that make any sense?
Even I can write something like this.

360
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,794
Hey! How long will you be here?

361
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,588
Until I catch that jerk.

362
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,176
I'm off soon, though.
So hurry, change your clothes.

363
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,053
FAT BBQ RESTAURANT OWNER

364
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,310
-Yes, sir?
-It's me.

365
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,603
Bring me five cups of ramyun
filled with hot water.

366
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,771
Pardon?

367
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,357
Well, actually
I'm just getting off work, so…

368
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,984
Perfect. Bring them on your way out.

369
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,902
-Hurry up!
-Huh?

370
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,155
Sir? Sir?

371
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,659
Why? What was that?

372
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,662
What am I, his bellboy?

373
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,959
Sir, your five cups of ramyun.

374
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,462
Why are you so late?
You should've been quicker.

375
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,172
How much?

376
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,090
4,500 won.

377
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,175
Here.

378
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,689
-Goodbye, sir.
-Uh-huh.

379
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,149
Soo-ah, let's go.

380
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,986
Doo-sik.

381
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,947
Since we're here, let's eat some meat.

382
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:46,990
I'll buy.

383
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,868
Why, all of a sudden? Let's just go.

384
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,496
Hey, no, wait--!

385
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,876
Over here.

386
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,423
What? Oh, want to eat some meat?

387
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,842
Bring two servings of pork belly,
and one bottle of soda.

388
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,012
Grill the meat first, though,
because I don't want to.

389
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,932
-What?
-Why? You don't want to?

390
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,267
If a customer asks, just do it,
no questions.

391
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,728
You little brat!
How dare you order me around?

392
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,772
Why? Did I upset you?

393
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,524
Customers aren't allowed
to order employees?

394
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,441
What?

395
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,533
Did you just litter in here?

396
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,077
The price of meat
includes a cleaning service fee.

397
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,662
That's what you said earlier.

398
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,872
Wow, this bitch is crazy.

399
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,500
What? "Bitch"?

400
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,713
Did you just call
a revered customer a bitch?

401
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:48,426
Wow, this store really
treats their customers like dog crap!

402
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,178
-What are you doing?
-Goodness!

403
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,805
-Did you just do that?
-What?

404
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,306
Did you just hit me?

405
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,101
A fragile girl like me?

406
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,603
I didn't hit you, I just laid my hand--

407
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,021
What?

408
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,943
Look at this!

409
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,945
Look at how my arm's dangling!

410
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,905
My shoulder must be broken!

411
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,491
-All of a sudden?
-Doo-sik, report him to the police.

412
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,368
No, please don't.

413
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,121
Why are you doing this?
Please stop.

414
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,038
Oh, dear.

415
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,166
Please, just…

416
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,710
Mommy!

417
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,594
What's taking so long? Hurry up.

418
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,891
Ow, it's hurting again!
It's too much.

419
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,350
Doo-sik, call the police.

420
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,518
Sorry! Sorry!

421
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,688
Just…

422
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,274
"sorry"?

423
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,359
I am so sorry.

424
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,154
To him, too.

425
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,074
What's the hold-up? Spit it out.

426
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,827
I am so sorry.

427
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,580
Please forgive me for my actions.

428
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,623
Yes, of course.

429
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,627
-Hey, mister.
-Yes.

430
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,670
He may seem like a fool,

431
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,256
but his mom ate seaweed soup
after he was born,

432
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,758
had a party, and celebrated him.

433
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,345
So, he's not someone you can just ignore,

434
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,306
be rude to, or treat like a slave.

435
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,270
If I catch you treating him
like that again,

436
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,689
I don't even know
what I'll be capable of doing then.

437
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,900
-Understood?
-Yes.

438
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,195
By the way, how is your shoulder?

439
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,410
It's all better.

440
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,248
Give my medical expenses to your staff
as a bonus, please.

441
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,290
Doo-sik, let's go.

442
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,252
Okay.

443
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,547
-Have a nice evening.
-C'mon, let's go.

444
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,635
Have a pleasant evening.

445
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,389
Soo-ah, that was amazing.
You were incredible.

446
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,891
I feel like a huge weight
was lifted off my chest.

447
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,394
For you, too-- don't allow a person

448
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,605
abuse their power
or harass a weaker person.

449
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,360
If you do, they'll think it's okay.
And you'll really become a weakling.

450
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,070
Okay, I understand.

451
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,282
Why is my bag so heavy?

452
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,493
Hey, carry my bag.

453
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,997
-What?
-C'mon. I said, carry my bag.

454
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,999
Hurry, it's heavy.

455
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,210
My arm, it hurts!

456
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,964
Putting on an act made me hungry.

457
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,966
Buy me some spicy rice cake.

458
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,052
-What?
-Why not? I said I'm hungry.

459
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,847
Oh, I'm so hungry.

460
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,601
All right, all right.
Spicy rice cake, okay…

461
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,562
Wait.

462
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,316
Soo-ah. Isn't this also an abuse of power?

463
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,571
That's impossible between friends.
This is doing a favor.

464
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,576
What's the hold-up?
Hurry up and buy some.

465
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,369
Move it.

466
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,664
-Get going.
-Yeah, okay.

467
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,847
This tastes…

468
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,974
delicious!

469
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,393
-Really?
-Yes, really.

470
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,397
See, I said you could do it
if you practiced.

471
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,524
Thank you!

472
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,109
It's all thanks to you, Hyun-joon.

473
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,738
Yoon-ah.
Why do you want to be a pastry chef?

474
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,700
It's because…
well, it's a little embarrassing…

475
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,080
I'm a bit clumsy,
and I'm constantly making mistakes.

476
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:49,417
But the first compliment I ever got…
was for my homemade bread.

477
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,963
I thought maybe this was the one thing
I'm really good at.

478
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,426
I'm going to work harder
and be successful.

479
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,054
And have a huge bakery like yours.

480
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,934
That way I can support Sol
in doing whatever she wants.

481
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,520
I see.

482
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,522
Yoon-ah…from now on,

483
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,357
whenever you have time,
come here to practice.

484
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,484
I'll tell my employees.

485
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,652
Really?

486
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,781
Thank you! Thank you so much!

487
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,877
What's that sound?

488
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,386
What on earth is this?

489
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,349
It's me…Olivia.

490
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,601
Olivia?

491
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,395
Olivia is…

492
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,856
Dong-goo's camera?

493
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,694
My owner took such good care of me!

494
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,238
But you ruined everything!

495
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,741
This is all your fault.

496
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,284
It's all your fault!

497
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,119
I'm sorry!

498
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,538
-I didn't do it on purpose--
-Shut up!

499
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,208
How long did you think
you could hide the truth?

500
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,044
I wanted to tell him…

501
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,046
-but Seo-jin--
-Don't make excuses!

502
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,340
In the end, you didn't confess either.

503
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,384
I can't forgive you!

504
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,012
I will never forgive you!

505
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,017
Blood! Blood!

506
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,027
This isn't right…

507
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,321
It's not right!

508
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,365
Seo-jin, wake up.

509
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,034
Wake up, Seo-jin!

510
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,702
What, what now?

511
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,245
Olivia!

512
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,997
Olivia appeared to me.

513
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,540
Who's Olivia?

514
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,502
Blood tears… Dong-goo…

515
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,921
What're you talking about?

516
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,758
I can't live like this.
I have to tell Dong-goo the truth.

517
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,597
Wait a minute.
Why are you being like this?

518
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,683
Why do you keep wanting to tell him?

519
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,143
It's the only way I can go on.

520
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,188
Olivia… Olivia!

521
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,525
Joon-ki! Joon-ki!

522
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,568
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

523
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,990
How painful it must've been for you.

524
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,414
Dong-goo, I have something to confess.

525
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,582
What is it?

526
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,461
To be honest, Seo-jin and I-- you see…

527
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,381
-yest--
-Wait! Wait!

528
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,385
Joon-ki, what're you doing?
Are you crazy?

529
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,761
Are you for real?

530
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,388
How long will you deceive him?

531
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,766
How long will you lie
to your poor brother?

532
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,685
If you keep this up,

533
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,937
she'll find you someday.

534
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,148
Olivia… Olivia will…

535
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,819
-What are you doing right now?
-What are you talking about?

536
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,195
What's up?

537
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,990
Kang Seo-jin. You tell him.

538
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,118
This is your last chance
to tell him the truth.

539
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:15,039
You're driving me crazy!
Why do we need to tell my brother? Why?

540
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,624
You're really going to lie to the end?

541
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,964
Fine. I'll tell him. Happy?

542
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,924
This is driving me crazy.

543
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,175
What are you two doing?

544
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,304
I've no idea
why we have to tell my brother this.

545
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,471
Hurry and tell him!

546
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,560
-Dong-goo, to be honest…
-Yeah?

547
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,729
When we were drinking yesterday…

548
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,897
Yes, we drank a little…

549
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,064
Yeah…

550
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,567
Joon-ki and I…

551
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,738
What? What's taking you so long to say it?
Just spit it out.

552
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:48,948
We kissed!

553
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,658
Yeah, Seo-jin and I kiss--

554
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,076
Wait, what did you say?

555
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,122
What are you saying? What did we do?

556
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,709
-You weren't talking about the kiss?
-What are you talking about?

557
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,504
-I was talking about breaking his camera.
-What?

558
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,135
Wait just a minute.

559
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,055
So, let me get this straight…

560
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,602
You two had some drinks, broke my cam--

561
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,063
Wait! Nope! No, that's not it.

562
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,439
Before that…

563
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,902
you two had some drinks

564
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,820
and kissed.

565
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,239
Kissed? You two?

566
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,033
For real?

567
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,787
Dong-goo, you see…

568
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,830
that was a mistake. A mistake.

569
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,165
A mistake?

570
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,334
Hey, Dong-goo…

571
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,045
calm… just calm down…

572
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,881
Calm? Do I look like
I can calm down right now?

573
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,342
Come here.

574
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,808
Lock it!

575
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,309
Open this door!

576
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,061
What are you doing in there?

577
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,896
Open up! I'll kick it open!

578
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,147
I'm kicking it down, bastard!

579
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,316
-Kang Seo-jin!
-Dong-goo?

580
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,151
Dong-goo, please calm down!

581
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:11,072
Dong-goo, calm down,
and let's discuss this rationally.

582
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,073
Open up!

583
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,117
I…

584
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,995
What happened?
Why'd it suddenly get so quiet?

585
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,496
Did he leave?

586
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,041
Man, I thought I was going to die.

587
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,502
Hey, Chewbacca.

588
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,674
Did you and I really… do that?

589
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,343
Yes.

590
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,805
-How could you tell Dong-goo that?
-You told me to!

591
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,100
-You said it was my chance to confess!
-I thought it was about the camera!

592
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,518
Damn it!

593
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,022
Wait a minute.

594
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,649
-Look here, Kang Seo-jin…
-What?

595
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,611
You purposely gave me alcohol
to drink, didn't you?

596
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,697
What? You've completely lost it!

597
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,116
-Why would someone like me want to--
-You ingrates!

598
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,243
Come here!

599
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,541
Come here now! Damn it!

600
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,842
-Dong-goo--
-Shut it!

601
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,303
How dare you… and my little sister…

602
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,554
kiss!

603
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,060
I'm having a stroke!

604
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,480
Dong-goo, it really was a mistake.

605
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,274
I was drunk
and must've lost my mind for a minute.

606
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,901
Even if I have no boyfriend,

607
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,986
I'd never be with someone like him.

608
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,738
What? Hey!

609
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,948
I don't want a girl with a temper
and a beard like you!

610
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,034
What? You are so dead!

611
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,452
Be quiet!

612
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,830
From now on, you two stay at least
five meters apart at all times.

613
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,999
Don't even look at each other,

614
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,169
don't talk to each other,
don't even think about each other, got it?

615
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,504
Okay, okay.

616
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,798
Okay.

617
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,550
What are you doing? Move apart!

618
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,719
Now go to your separate rooms!
Hurry up!

619
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,013
Move!

620
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,724
Keep your distance! Away from each other!

621
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,688
I'll probably die from anxiety.
They worry me about every little thing.

622
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,323
Dong-goo, I'll vacuum.

623
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,533
It's okay, I'll do it.

624
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,867
I can take care of it.

625
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,494
I said I'll do it.

626
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,580
Don't mind me. Do what you need to.

627
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,041
-Okay.
-Okay.

628
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,960
Hey Dong-goo?

629
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,878
Are you upset with me by any chance?

630
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,881
You don't even really talk to me
anymore…

631
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,177
Who, me? I, what? It's nothing like that.

632
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,763
If not, then okay.

633
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,684
I'll go start on dinner, then.

634
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,228
Okay, sounds good.

635
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,123
What are you doing?

636
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,335
Just sitting. What's that?

637
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,590
This? It soothes swollen eyes.
It's a must-have for models.

638
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,386
I've been staking out at the store
so my eyes have been swollen.

639
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,763
Oh, I see.

640
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,521
The ground's going to sink under you.

641
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,899
What's wrong?

642
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,109
Is it about Yoon-ah again?

643
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:42,116
The thing is, I wanted to stop liking her.
But I can't.

644
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:47,580
Soo-ah, I like her more and more.
What am I going to do?

645
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,000
Why do you like Yoon-ah so much?

646
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:59,300
I don't even know. I don't know
what I like about her, or why.

647
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:12,021
LOVE'S GREETING

648
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,274
I don't know what to do.

649
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,318
I can't come up with any solutions.

650
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,196
How can I take care of her

651
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,616
doing part-time work
at babies' first birthday parties?

652
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,416
Can I really become a movie director?

653
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,922
Or will it end up as just a dream?

654
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:38,839
Who's this?

655
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,387
Wow, how many years has it been?
It's been a while.

656
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,846
Hello, Director.

657
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,725
-What are you doing these days?
-Just this and that. How about you?

658
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,227
I'm filming a movie soon.

659
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,020
Congratulations.

660
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,022
I'm recruiting staff members currently.

661
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,233
Any interest in working on my team?

662
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,859
Me?

663
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,615
-I'll think about it.
-All right.

664
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,158
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

665
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,085
We're short again this month.

666
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,129
At this rate,
we could end up on the streets.

667
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,506
What are we going to do?
This really is a problem.

668
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,883
I'm home.

669
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,386
-Hey.
-Hello.

670
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,595
Filming go all right?

671
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,180
Yes.

672
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,978
Why the sigh?
Did something happen?

673
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,441
On the way home,
I met a director I used to work with.

674
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,237
But he asked me
if I wanted to come work for him.

675
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,780
So? Are you going to?

676
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,907
I told him I'd think about it.

677
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,909
What is there to think about?

678
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,704
You'll get paid almost nothing
for working day and night,

679
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,999
you'll get no sleep, and just suffer.
And what about the guesthouse?

680
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,835
We might not be able to pay the rent.

681
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,337
You can't do it.

682
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,797
Did I say I would?
Can't I even think about it?

683
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,840
I wasn't serious.

684
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,185
Hello? Yes, this is Kang Seo-jin.

685
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,188
What?

686
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,856
What?

687
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,234
Okay… I understand.

688
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,363
What was that?

689
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,864
Did something happen again?

690
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,992
No, it was the newspaper company
I interviewed for.

691
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,327
I passed the final interview.

692
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,121
They told me I start tomorrow.

693
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,791
-Really?
-Yes.

694
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,251
This isn't a dream, is it? Right.

695
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,420
Why did you pinch me?

696
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,926
It's not a dream!
I really passed?

697
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,764
You worked so hard! Congratulations!

698
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,058
Good job! I'm so proud of you.

699
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,684
What's all the noise?

700
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,479
Seo-jin got the job at the newspaper.

701
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,563
She starts tomorrow!

702
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,981
Really?

703
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,235
Congratulations, Chewbacca!
Congrats!

704
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,155
Access prohibited!
I said keep a five-meter distance!

705
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,116
All right, you punk.

706
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,993
Congrats, Chewbacca!
You'll treat us later?

707
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,245
Yes!

708
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,331
Congratulations!

709
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,839
You'll be on a probation period
for three months.

710
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,924
The entertainment department
is a bit understaffed,

711
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,717
so you'll start there.

712
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,678
And your seat…

713
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,805
is right here. Good luck!

714
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,306
Thank you.

715
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,398
Wait, I should say hello first.

716
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,487
Hello!
I'm Kang Seo-jin, a new employee!

717
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,114
I promise to do my best!

718
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,501
-Everybody must be busy.
-You are?

719
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,672
Hello, I'm Kang Seo-jin.
I'm a new employee.

720
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,048
You're the new trainee?

721
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,800
Nice to meet you.

722
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,344
But what are you doing?
Why aren't you working?

723
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:19,185
Yes. Well… that's…
I'm just not sure what exactly to do.

724
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,437
Give me any task to do,
I'll do it well!

725
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,980
Do you know King of Masked Singer?

726
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,275
For seven weeks, there's been a singer
whose identity is unknown.

727
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,694
Everyone's going wild
trying to find out who it is.

728
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,863
-I see.
-You find out.

729
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,656
Yes?

730
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,992
Find out who Blushing Webfoot Octopus is.

731
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,411
How can I…?

732
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,872
You said I can give you any task,
and you'll do it well.

733
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,208
So, go find out and come back.

734
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,044
And when you come back,
bring photo evidence of their identity.

735
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,462
Make sure to take a photo.

736
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,340
-Okay?
-Yes.

737
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,722
How am I supposed to find out?

738
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,891
I'm going to go crazy.

739
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,812
All right, Blushing Webfoot Octopus…

740
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,357
Here we go.

741
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,152
Excuse me, is this where they film
King of Masked Singer?

742
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,529
Correct. Who are you?

743
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,072
I'm a reporter.

744
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,157
I'm here for a news article. I'll go in.

745
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,243
Wait. Go in where?

746
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,911
Filming is not open to the public.

747
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,956
I'm a reporter. A reporter.

748
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,916
I said it's closed.

749
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,460
Even the president wouldn't be allowed,
so just leave.

750
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,711
What did you say?

751
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,297
Are you blocking the people's right
to know?

752
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,925
If you keep on like this,
I won't hold back either.

753
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,094
What?

754
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,347
Let me go! Let go!

755
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,975
Don't violate the people's right to know!

756
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,643
Please, just leave.

757
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,563
I can't believe him!

758
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,772
Look here!

759
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,316
What should I do?

760
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,152
Are you serious?

761
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,988
What is this?

762
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,657
-Why? It looks good.
-That voice sounds familiar.

763
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,075
This suits you perfectly.

764
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,204
Seriously? What kind of outfit is this?

765
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,497
What is this?

766
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,750
Besides, you said it was a drama!

767
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,669
This is a drama!

768
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,504
-A children's drama.
-What?

769
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,339
All right, say that's the case.

770
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,966
You said I'd play opposite the lead.

771
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,843
You are!

772
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,845
The lead character, Aqua Man,

773
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,139
battles and defeats you,
the villainous octopus.

774
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,640
That's playing opposite the lead!

775
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,891
You con artist!

776
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,603
-Excuse me?
-What do you want?

777
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,023
Of course it's you.

778
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,191
But what are you wearing?

779
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,359
Are you a webfoot octopus?

780
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,530
I'm a regular octopus.
A webfoot octopus has smaller suctions.

781
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,990
-What are you doing here?
-Me?

782
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,285
I came for a news story.

783
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,163
Writing an article on day one!

784
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,664
That's impressive, Chewbacca!

785
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,709
Stop calling me Chewbacca!

786
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,630
Oh, by the way, on the show
King of Masked Singer,

787
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,757
do you know who
Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

788
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,675
-Blushing Webfoot Octopus?
-Yeah.

789
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,760
How the heck would I know?

790
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,803
Why are you asking?

791
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,639
My boss told me to find out.

792
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,349
Wow, that'll be difficult.

793
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,476
That team keeps really tight security.

794
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,687
-They won't even tell our producers.
-Really?

795
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,815
I have to take a photo for evidence too.
This is bad.

796
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,692
Forget about
Blushing Webfoot Octopus whatever.

797
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,320
What are you going to do about this?

798
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,155
What do you mean?

799
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,740
You're in costume, so just do it.

800
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,075
Come on, let's go.

801
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,036
-Wait, where are you going?
-Hurry up!

802
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,621
Wait!

803
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,500
That fool is no help at all.

804
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,418
Why did I kiss
a good-for-nothing like him?

805
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,088
Alcohol is my worst enemy!

806
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,175
In any case, how do I find out
who this Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

807
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,220
I'm back from the shoot.

808
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,348
You're here. Come, have a seat.

809
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,728
Do you have something to tell me?

810
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,399
We got a request for a video
of a child growing up.

811
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,484
How would you like to make it?

812
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,485
Me?

813
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,696
I can do it the way I want
from beginning to end?

814
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,574
Yes!
All the materials related to the baby

815
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,993
have been uploaded,
You just need to download them.

816
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,329
This is a special project,
so do a good job.

817
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,082
I'll make such a beautiful movie,

818
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,543
be prepared to be surprised!

819
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,427
After doing the same thing every day,
now I'm working on a storyboard.

820
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,762
Reminds me of the old days
when I shot short films.

821
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,180
This is exciting.

822
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:29,476
I think I need to shoot more footage.
What should I do?

823
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,021
Sir, aren't you tired?

824
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,274
Please, drink this.

825
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,567
Thank you.

826
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,361
I'll just be going in, then.

827
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,779
You cannot.

828
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,240
But, sir!

829
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,662
Here, that should do it, right?

830
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,830
Thank you.

831
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,374
Then, I'll go in now.

832
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,375
You cannot.

833
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,503
But, sir!

834
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,927
But, sir!

835
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,137
Sir!

836
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,308
Sir!

837
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,186
I'll just go in real quick one time.
Please?

838
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,897
If I don't find out today,
I'll really be in a mess.

839
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,108
I'm begging you.

840
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,612
If you come again, I'll call the police.

841
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:28,577
This is driving me crazy.
What should I do?

842
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:32,206
Where's Uncle? Where did Uncle go?

843
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,540
Here I am!

844
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,507
I guess you don't like that.

845
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,302
I'm not good at this. What do I do?

846
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,432
Oh, I'll do that.

847
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,644
Aren't we happy?

848
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,103
Yes, we are.

849
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,816
I'm sorry it's so sudden.
He was crying so much I couldn't shoot.

850
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,529
Don't mention it. What are you shooting?

851
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:09,201
It's a video of his growth,
but I need to shoot extra footage.

852
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,744
So I was wondering…

853
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:14,748
Yoon-ah, would you be able to help me
with the shoot?

854
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,377
Me? What can I do?

855
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,712
So…

856
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,257
I just stay like this?

857
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,676
Yes. Just stay still like that.

858
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,345
Do I have to wear this, though?

859
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,890
Yes. It'll make it easier to edit you out.

860
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,850
Please hang in there.

861
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,811
We'll be done soon.
Ready…

862
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,771
Action!

863
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,525
-Good, good!
-What a good baby.

864
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,735
You're doing so good.

865
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:46,947
Good job, Hyeon-ah!

866
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,782
Yoon-ah, good job too.

867
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,242
Are we done?

868
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,785
It's a bit out of focus.

869
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,288
Ready… action!

870
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,498
All right, Yoon-ah.

871
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,624
Raise him higher.

872
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,917
-Like this?
-Yes!

873
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,420
Look at me, Hyeon-ah!
What a good expression!

874
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,422
So good. Look over here!

875
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,469
Good job!

876
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,723
Yoon-ah, you really did great.

877
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,729
One more time!

878
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,899
This is so embarrassing.
How long do I have to do roles like this?

879
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,154
What? An octopus ink gun?

880
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,197
What a pretentious name.

881
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:33,410
I could hardly pee well
because of these tentacles.

882
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,712
Go, Korea! Go, Korea!

883
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,343
-We meet again!
-I know!

884
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,428
What an extraordinary coincidence!

885
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,388
Your costume…

886
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,433
I was cast in the children's drama,
Super Aquaman.

887
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,393
I'm Red Crab Man.

888
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,103
-Really?
-Yes.

889
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,438
That's great.

890
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,732
-I'm Octopus Man.
-Wow.

891
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,651
It's fate that we met again.

892
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,903
Should we go for seafood and soju tonight?

893
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,238
-Sounds good!
-Good!

894
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,157
Let's go.

895
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,620
After you.

896
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,126
What a terrible first day.

897
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,671
I thought all would go well
once I got a job.

898
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,676
Hey, trainee.

899
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,594
What are you doing here?

900
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,970
Ma'am.

901
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,473
Did you find out
who Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

902
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,141
No, not yet.

903
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,477
Security is too tight…

904
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,648
Are you asking me to go easy on you
because security is tight?

905
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,066
No, that's not it.

906
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,568
That's Seo-jin.

907
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,571
Hey. Are you sure
you can make it as a reporter?

908
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,906
Even if security is tight,

909
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,701
you should find out by all means.

910
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,078
How did you even make it into the company?

911
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,539
-I'm sorry.
-Enough.

912
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,542
Don't even think about coming back
to the office until you find out.

913
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,669
Actually, if you don't find out…

914
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,588
just quit. Got it?

915
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,424
Yes.

916
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,308
What kind of person is she?

917
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,686
Why? Do you know her?

918
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,772
-Red Crab Man.
-Yeah?

919
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,399
I have a favor…

920
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,322
Red Crab Man, you ready?

921
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,834
Hey, you!

922
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,503
-Do you know the taste of crab?
-What are you?

923
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,922
Look here, who are you?

924
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,382
Protector of the ocean's peace,

925
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,217
I'm the righteous…

926
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,261
Red Crab Man!

927
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,637
This guy…

928
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,972
You can't catch me!

929
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,057
Look here!

930
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,809
Octopus Man! Now!

931
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,227
Here I come!

932
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:09,691
Take this! My octopus ink!

933
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,540
Hurry and go! Go Octopus Man!

934
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,542
-Cover me!
-Go now!

935
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,259
Goodness! Let's see.

936
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,303
"Scallop"?

937
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,555
What's a "Spoon Worm"?

938
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,891
"Sea Squirt"?

939
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,102
Is this some kind of seafood special
or something?

940
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,354
Blushing Webfoot Octopus…

941
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,397
Webfoot Octopus…

942
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,399
Blushing Webfoot Octopus! I found it!

943
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,526
Webfoot Octopus!

944
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,324
You startled me!

945
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:01,910
Who are you?

946
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:06,206
Hello. You're Blushing Webfoot Octopus?

947
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,041
You've been winning for seven weeks?

948
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,835
Sorry but…who are you?

949
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,419
Nice to meet you.

950
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,797
I'm the villain of the sea,
Aquaman's enemy,

951
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,924
Octopus Man, Lee Joon-ki.

952
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,552
And your name is…?

953
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,387
Pardon? Why do you want my name?

954
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,765
I'm an octopus, you're a webfoot octopus.

955
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,393
Since we're both sea creatures,
let's exchange names too.

956
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,687
-I can't tell you my name. It's a secret.
-Wait!

957
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,858
C'mon, we're the same type.

958
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:36,278
Since I already told you my name,
shouldn't you tell me yours?

959
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,821
Yes, but I'm afraid I can't.

960
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,030
Wait!

961
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,198
This person, really…

962
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,534
I didn't want to go this far,
but I have no choice.

963
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,494
Come here, come here!

964
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,704
Oh my!

965
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,164
What are you doing?

966
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:49,916
Ouch!

967
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:54,963
My leg!

968
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,090
You murderer!

969
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:00,302
Who are you? Security! Security!

970
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,220
Where are they?
You startled me!

971
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,388
Now what?

972
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,682
Nice timing, Red Crab Man!

973
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,481
Take that!

974
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,987
Hold him, Red Crab Man!

975
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,159
It's now or never, Octopus Man!

976
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,493
Take off his mask!

977
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,765
What are you doing?

978
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,146
Shamelessly crying like a baby
in front of strangers.

979
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,357
I'm not in the mood to play around,
so just go.

980
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,651
I came to tell you
who the masked singer was.

981
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,278
But if you insist I leave--

982
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,239
Really?

983
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,699
How did you find out?

984
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,329
Shall we say it was thanks
to Red Crab Man's self-sacrifice?

985
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,498
-What?
-I thought you wanted me to leave.

986
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,376
Bye.

987
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,252
Joon-ki! Don't just leave!

988
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,921
You petty jerk!

989
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,094
What's this?

990
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,680
Blushing Webfoot Octopus
is Kang Kyun-sung.

991
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,556
What's this?

992
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,058
Photo attached for evidence.

993
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,852
I got you!

994
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,360
You're Blushing Webfoot Octopus?

995
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,320
I'm a fan.

996
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,076
Joon-ki.

997
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,164
Hey, punk. Cheer up.

998
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,543
Don't let your boss's harsh words
keep you down.

999
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,087
You're good at being bold.

1000
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,216
Kang Seo-jin. You can do it!

1001
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,301
You can do it!

1002
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,053
I'm busy.

1003
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,304
See you.

1004
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,878
I'm home. Hi, Sol!

1005
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,796
Why are you together?

1006
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,466
Yoon-ah helped me shoot some things.

1007
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,385
Doo-sik, I can take Sol now.

1008
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,345
Let's go to Mommy!

1009
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,098
Sol, did you have fun?

1010
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,892
Did you have a good day?

1011
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,478
Yoon-ah, you did so much today. Thank you.

1012
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,771
Don't mention it.

1013
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,731
Are you hungry?
I'll quickly make dinner.

1014
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,107
I'm okay.

1015
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,777
I have to edit the movie,
so I won't have time to eat.

1016
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,129
-Dong-goo!
-Did you sleep well?

1017
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,173
What are you doing?

1018
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,008
Did you stay up all night?

1019
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,677
I couldn't sleep
because I wanted to complete it.

1020
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,888
So I stayed up and finished editing.

1021
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,683
-Really?
-Yes.

1022
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,186
Okay! All done.

1023
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,023
I'm going to the studio.

1024
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,203
Hello.

1025
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,081
What are you doing here?

1026
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,127
I clearly told you to quit if you didn't
find out who Blushing Webfoot Octopus was.

1027
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,674
-Here you are.
-Let's see what you captured.

1028
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,260
Surely, it's not a photo
of a real webfoot octopus.

1029
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,970
Let's see.

1030
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,597
What's this?

1031
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,851
You really got a photo? How?

1032
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,894
An octopus told me.

1033
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,855
What octopus?

1034
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,652
He's quite foolish,

1035
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,321
but sometimes really amazing.

1036
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,366
Goodness.

1037
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,163
Min Soo-ah.

1038
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,331
How long are you going
to stand watch at the store?

1039
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,252
Until I catch the jerk.

1040
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,255
I got a nosebleed because of you today.

1041
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,091
Is this how you repay me
for getting rid of the BBQ store owner?

1042
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,218
You have no loyalty whatsoever.

1043
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,554
You're worse than he is, you tyrant!

1044
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,097
-What did you just say?
-I take it back.

1045
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,600
I'm home.

1046
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,979
Dong-goo, you're home. How'd it go?

1047
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,647
It was a total failure.

1048
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,817
He said it was terrible
and called me crazy.

1049
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,569
What do you mean? What happened?

1050
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,574
I made a video of a baby growing up,
but my boss completely hated it.

1051
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:15,992
How did you make it?

1052
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,953
Will you guys take a look and judge?

1053
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,462
THE BIRTH OF HYEON-AH

1054
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,343
Dong-goo… what is that?

1055
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,929
It's sperm.

1056
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,096
What?

1057
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,058
Why is there sperm in a baby's video?

1058
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:44,604
The introduction shows the birth of life.

1059
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,649
The sperm are racing and meet the egg,

1060
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,776
and then bam! A baby is made.

1061
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,903
Don't you know this? Isn't it realistic?

1062
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,906
Sure, it's definitely realistic.

1063
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,950
But I wonder if it needs to be
in this video.

1064
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,493
Is that so?

1065
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,287
But this next scene
is really incredible. Watch.

1066
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,210
HYEON-AH IS BORN

1067
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,838
Wait…

1068
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,007
What is that?

1069
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,718
Why did the baby pop out of--
what is that?

1070
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,136
It's from "The Matrix."

1071
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,265
The baby grew inside the mom's belly
for 10 months.

1072
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,683
Then with a great cry…

1073
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,851
it's born.
It's a dynamic way of showing it.

1074
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,146
Isn't that too bizarre?

1075
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,024
Why? Isn't it thrilling?

1076
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,026
It's like a movie, isn't it?

1077
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,445
In the next scene,
the baby does a jump

1078
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,364
like in "Whispering Corridors."

1079
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,200
Jump left, jump right!

1080
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,703
Enough. I think I've seen enough.

1081
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,956
I'm tired, so I'm just going to bed.

1082
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,251
-Thanks for "The Matrix."
-Why?

1083
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,171
Dong-goo. Do you really
have to become a movie director?

1084
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,090
What do you mean?

1085
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,342
I just am worried about your movies…

1086
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,344
being shown to the world.

1087
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,640
Hey, there's a little bit left.

1088
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,475
Finish watching it first.

1089
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:33,046
I think your video was entertaining.
Like a movie.

1090
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:34,797
Really.

1091
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,507
It's fine.

1092
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,552
Cheer up, Dong-goo.

1093
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,556
I want to, but I can't seem to.

1094
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,977
I'm worried I'll end up shooting
the same birthday parties

1095
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,104
and then it'll be over.

1096
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,983
And I'll never make it to the movies.

1097
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,860
Then you can just start now.

1098
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,446
Movies.

1099
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,531
You said you got an offer.

1100
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:05,078
-That's just--
-I've never seen you happy like that.

1101
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,538
I always thought you were just

1102
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,667
a grumpy, irritable, angry person.

1103
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,587
But when I saw you filming yesterday,

1104
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,924
I realized you could smile brightly.

1105
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,553
I realized you must really…

1106
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,263
love that kind of work.

1107
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,600
Was I like that?

1108
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,894
So, Dong-goo,

1109
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,814
don't be afraid, and start again.

1110
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,899
It's easier said than done.

1111
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,526
What?

1112
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,945
You're more of a coward than I thought.

1113
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,116
-What did you say?
-If you never do what you love

1114
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,536
because it's scary,
or you're afraid of that…

1115
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,497
can you ever be truly happy?

1116
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,418
Won't you regret it later?

1117
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,216
So what if you fail?
You can just start again.

1118
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,260
Don't you agree?

1119
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,222
Oh my…

1120
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:10,184
I overstepped my boundaries, didn't I?

1121
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:14,981
Forgive me.

1122
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,278
Dong-goo, I finished all the housework,

1123
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,613
so I'm going to go practice baking
for a bit.

1124
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:25,658
Yes, of course.

1125
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,083
Kang Dong-goo! You can do it!

1126
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,502
You can do it! Yeah!

1127
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,730
Director.

1128
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,690
Yes? Dong-goo!

1129
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,984
What's going on?

1130
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:05,114
The offer to work with your team.
I'd like to join.

1131
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,866
I'll do my best.

1132
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,125
Kang Dong-goo!

1133
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:20,838
Soo-ah! Where are you coming from?

1134
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,008
I was staking out the store
and came out for some fresh air.

1135
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,176
Why are you so happy?

1136
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,636
Did something happen?

1137
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,641
I decided to work on a movie.
I just decided to go for it.

1138
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,518
Really? That's good.

1139
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,856
And I realized why I like Yoon-ah.

1140
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,275
Really? Why?

1141
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,071
I just like her. Without reason.

1142
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,657
I just like her.

1143
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:53,329
What's that mean?
What about Yoon-ah's circumstances?

1144
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,500
I don't know about all that yet,
but I'm certain of one thing.

1145
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:01,254
If I lose her while calculating
this or that risk,

1146
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,422
I'll never be happy.

1147
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,633
I'll regret it my whole life.

1148
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,510
So I want to tell her.

1149
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,971
Really? When?

1150
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,181
Right now.

1151
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:27,989
Go on in, Yoon-ah.

1152
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,409
I'm sorry. You don't need to give me
a ride every time.

1153
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,744
It's okay. It's on my way home anyway.

1154
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,121
It's cold. Go on inside.

1155
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,915
Yes. See you at the next class.

1156
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,181
My phone.

1157
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,310
I must've left it in Hyun-joon's car.

1158
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,148
Dong-goo.

1159
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,160
Yoon-ah, I have something to say.

1160
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,995
Oh? What is it?

1161
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,341
I like you.

1162
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,427
I really like you, Yoon-ah.
