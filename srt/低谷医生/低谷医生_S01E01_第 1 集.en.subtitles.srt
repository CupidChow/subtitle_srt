00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,036
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,054
I still vividly remember…

3
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,893
when I walked out of the hospital.

4
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,314
A patient being helped by her guardian.

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,775
A delivery scooter.

6
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,320
A dog going on a walk.

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,990
Caffeine.

8
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,703
Trees.

9
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,919
Everything in the world was normal.

10
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,573
But all it took
for my everyday life to fall apart

11
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,076
was three minutes.

12
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,288
During that short amount of time,
some people have a smoke.

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,960
Some solve a math problem.

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,339
Some feel happiness.

15
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,610
What in the world?

16
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,742
And some die.

17
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,919
-What do we do? The bleeding won't stop!
-Gauze and a six-inch EB!

18
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,969
Please.

19
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,227
And some…

20
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,440
fail to save their patient.

21
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,780
The time it took for us to fall
from our once stable positions as doctors…

22
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,160
was just three minutes.

23
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,080
The incident that occurred that day

24
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,668
was more than enough to ruin our lives.

25
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,216
DOCTOR SLUMP

26
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,554
BUSAN, 2009

27
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,436
THE PRIDE OF DADAEPO, NAM HA-NEUL

28
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,396
CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING
KOREA'S TOP STUDENT

29
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,233
Upsy-daisy. I'm coming.

30
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,696
Goodness, Wol-seon! Congratulations!

31
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,323
Thank you so much!

32
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,991
Congratulations.

33
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,576
It's not a big deal.

34
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,161
Thank you.

35
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,163
Thank you for your hard work.

36
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,374
Can you pull it so it's nice and tight?

37
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,210
All right, have some milmyeon.

38
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,422
Let me know if you need
more milmyeon and dumplings.

39
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:21,469
I don't normally give out our food
for free, but I'm in a great mood today.

40
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,806
Goodness. Since Ha-neul became
the top-ranked student in the country,

41
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,850
her mom's opened up her factory,
and her uncle's giving free food.

42
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,686
You must be over the moon.

43
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,188
Ms. Kong.

44
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,484
I can't believe such a genius
was born here in Busan.

45
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,278
She's not a genius.

46
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:43,366
She just knew how to say
the alphabet when she was one.

47
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,910
Then, she mastered
factorization at age three.

48
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,164
And now, she's just the top student
in the country.

49
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,168
Gosh, you're neither being humble
nor bragging. How strange.

50
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,338
Then, is Ha-neul going
to a university in Seoul?

51
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,758
Well, her homeroom teacher said

52
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,512
she could easily get into medical school
at Hanguk National University.

53
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:09,976
It'd be easier to break into a bank vault
than to get into that school.

54
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,812
And yet, Ha-neul got in
for her achievements.

55
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,859
Did someone just pass by?

56
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,362
Oh, that's just Ha-neul.

57
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,158
I've never seen her walk before.

58
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,246
She's always running around like that
so she can save more time to study.

59
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,623
That's not all.

60
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:37,045
She hates wasting time thinking,
so she organizes and wears

61
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,672
socks, underwear,
and all her clothes by the day.

62
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,554
She says her stomach has to be comfortable
if she has to sit for a long time.

63
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,972
So regardless of taste,

64
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:52,393
she only eats easily digestible food
in just seven minutes.

65
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,485
Excluding time spent
on drinking water, flipping pages,

66
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,363
sharpening pencils,
stretching, and other things,

67
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,785
she needs to spend 17 hours
in total of just studying

68
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,245
before she can to go sleep.

69
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,583
My happiest memory?

70
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,048
When I worked on the Art of Mathematics.

71
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,343
I can't believe how unrelenting
my daughter is.

72
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,137
She was just born to study.

73
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,849
SEOUL, 2009

74
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,185
CONGRATS YEO JEONG-WOO
FOR PERFECT SCORE ON MOCK TEST

75
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,062
Gosh!

76
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,107
That's insane.

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,195
Now, why would they
hang something up like that

78
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,030
and make me want to take a selfie?

79
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,368
Of course, you should. Take tons of them.
You're the top student in the country.

80
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,828
-Give me your phone.
-My phone?

81
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,912
-Yes.
-Here.

82
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,455
-Stand over there.
-All right.

83
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,583
Okay, pose.

84
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,044
What is that?

85
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,839
-What?
-Peace signs? That's so uncool.

86
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,175
Give me the phone.
Go over there and walk up.

87
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,511
Act cool like you don't know
I'm taking your photo.

88
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,263
I'll do it like the paparazzi.

89
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,848
Hey, I like that.

90
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,183
-Right?
-Finally, a nice idea.

91
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,185
-Okay.
-A bit more. Okay, right there.

92
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,728
-That's good.
-Okay.

93
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,605
Get ready. And action!

94
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,400
-That's it. Look up.
-Looking up.

95
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,068
-Nice jawline.
-Look left 45 degrees.

96
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,986
That's it.

97
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,195
Look right 45 degrees.

98
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,114
-That's it.
-That's it.

99
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,032
Wave to your friends. Okay.

100
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,410
Look at the camera. Last one. And pose.

101
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,953
-Look straight.
-That's it.

102
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,498
-Let me see!
-Look!

103
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,958
-Let's see!
-Let's see.

104
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,377
You're so handsome! I'm blind!

105
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,545
I can't see!

106
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,427
Goodness, yellow corvina
was Man-seok's favorite.

107
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,888
Why didn't you buy the big ones?

108
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,639
These look like anchovies.

109
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,308
They're so tiny.

110
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,271
I know business isn't good,
but it's his first death anniversary.

111
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,690
You should've spent some money.

112
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,775
What's wrong?

113
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,528
Is business doing that badly?

114
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,074
Rumor has it you're making half
of what you used to make.

115
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,076
It's understandable.

116
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,329
Even fish cakes have brands now.

117
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,831
Like Gwangan Fish Cakes
and Mandeok Fish Cakes.

118
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,709
I heard if you're not well-known,
they won't accept you.

119
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,254
Maybe it's better to sell
your factory before it goes under.

120
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,172
Goodness.

121
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,925
I'm home.

122
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,760
Hey, Ha-neul!

123
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,638
Hey.

124
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,599
Goodness, you're soaked.

125
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,227
-Take a hot shower. You could get sick.
-Okay.

126
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,194
Are you seriously going to be like this?

127
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:53,741
I said now's the time to sell the factory,
but why aren't you answering me?

128
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,954
But your father passed on
the factory to us.

129
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,831
I'm not asking for equal shares.

130
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,500
You can take 50 percent.

131
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,003
I'll take 30, and Mi-ja will take 20.

132
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,547
Why am I only 20?

133
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,093
Wol-seon took care of the factory
when Man-seok was sick.

134
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,429
Plus, she tended to him for eight years.

135
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,890
She deserves 50 percent.

136
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,934
That's not what I meant.

137
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,896
Why do you get 30 and I get only 20?

138
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,566
Watch what you say to me, girl.

139
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,861
You want me to make it
your death anniversary today too?

140
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,323
Go ahead and kill me! I dare you!

141
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,159
Fine, you're dead meat today!

142
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,120
How dare you?

143
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,621
You little brat!

144
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,832
Come here, you brat!

145
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,001
-I'm your older sister!
-Are you crazy?

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,044
-You little--
-Damn you!

147
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,840
My goodness!

148
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,883
Goodness, Ha-neul! Are you okay?

149
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,042
Mom, let's sell the factory.

150
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,378
Ha-neul, what are you--

151
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,297
It's already going under.

152
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,256
Exactly.

153
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,175
Right, sell it before you go bankrupt.

154
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,178
Let's take all the money
from selling it and move to Seoul.

155
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,221
Dad's gone,
so let's leave our dumb in-laws.

156
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,723
Exactly!

157
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,475
Right, your dumb…

158
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,559
Dumb?

159
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,356
You wanted me to go to med school, right?
So let's go to Seoul.

160
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,002
-Hey, we're getting a transfer student.
-Is it a guy?

161
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,421
-I saw a girl in the teacher's room.
-Is she pretty?

162
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,132
-That's not important. She's from Busan.
-I see. And pretty?

163
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,009
Yeah, she is. No, just shut up.

164
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,135
Attention.

165
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,513
I overheard the teachers talking.

166
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,265
She aced the mock test
just like Jeong-woo did.

167
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,350
She's here now.

168
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,938
Jeong-woo, our top student.

169
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,857
So you're sure she's pretty?
Just tell me the truth.

170
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,986
Did you hear me?
That must bother you, right?

171
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,739
Not at all.

172
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,949
Here they come.

173
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,326
Sit down.

174
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,204
Why are you so chatty?

175
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,123
Today,

176
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,459
we have an incredible transfer student
who'll be joining us.

177
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,962
Come in, Ha-neul.

178
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,217
She's so pretty.

179
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,052
She got the perfect score?

180
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,892
Ha-neul has spent
her entire life in Busan,

181
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,936
and it's her first time in Seoul.

182
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,190
So I'd like it if everyone did their best
to help her out, okay?

183
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,275
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,653
Only one sun can exist in this universe.

185
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,740
And only one top student
can exist in this school.

186
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,075
Thus,

187
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,495
the war began.

188
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,965
So I heard you're from Busan?

189
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:42,261
Is it true you have sea urchin roe rice,
marinated seaweed, and boiled turbans

190
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,971
with chojang for lunch in Busan?

191
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,266
And flatfish sushi for special meals?
Hey, my dialect's pretty good.

192
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,145
Does your family go out to sea
and fish with your boat on weekends?

193
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,271
Yeah, that's possible.

194
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,564
Did you really ace--

195
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,232
Get lost.

196
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,904
What did you say?

197
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,657
Can't you see I'm studying?
I said get lost.

198
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,953
How could you say something so harsh?

199
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,581
-We should get lost.
-Yeah, let's get lost.

200
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,335
No wonder she's the top student.

201
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,051
Hey, I think Ha-neul
is totally obsessed about studying.

202
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,469
If we talk to her during break,

203
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,096
she glares at us like this
for interrupting her studies.

204
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,556
You know how huge her eyes are.

205
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,017
Look at her. Look what she's doing.

206
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,604
What is she doing?

207
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,898
She said her mobility
declines if she sits still.

208
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,653
So she works out in her spare time
to study better and longer.

209
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,905
She's really something, right?

210
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,329
Well… so she takes care
of her health as she studies.

211
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,164
That's great to see.

212
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,667
Okay, so to change cosine squared

213
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,337
to one minus sin squared, you do this.

214
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,592
And to change sin squared to one minus
cosine squared, you can do this.

215
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,969
So here's the question.

216
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,889
If the sum of the real root
that satisfies all these equations

217
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,560
is Q over P times pi,

218
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,815
what does P plus Q equal?

219
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,525
Go.

220
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,044
It's 11.

221
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,213
Ha-neul.

222
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,469
Good job, Ha-neul!

223
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,184
All right, that's it for today's class.

224
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,311
Class dismissed.

225
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,729
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

226
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,318
Hey, top student.
How about some kimbap and ramyeon?

227
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,153
-On you, of course!
-Sounds great.

228
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,196
But I have tutoring with Kyung-min.

229
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,698
-He said to hurry.
-What a shame.

230
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,954
What is she eating?

231
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,247
I heard from other students

232
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,208
she eats instant coffee dry
so she won't need to go pee often.

233
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,960
But you can just go pee.

234
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,589
She'd rather spend that time
solving another problem or whatever.

235
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,840
What?

236
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,303
She just keeps getting more ridiculous.

237
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,639
-I have goosebumps.
-So unique.

238
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,390
So weird.

239
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,652
Hello.

240
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,403
Hey, Jeong-woo.

241
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,238
It's been a while since you've been first.

242
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,824
-It's been a while?
-What?

243
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,701
Right.

244
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,788
Lately, she's been arriving here first.

245
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,248
She runs so she can study sooner.

246
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,500
She sure is incredible.

247
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,709
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

248
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,670
Watch your step, Jeong-woo!

249
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,353
Darn it!

250
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,817
What?

251
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,905
Darn it!

252
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,951
Wait--

253
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,454
Back then, I thought
if I kept trying hard as I'd always done,

254
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,667
life would continue to be
just fine like it had been before.

255
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,796
Back then, I thought all I had to do
was look ahead and keep moving.

256
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,592
However,

257
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,096
things in life didn't work out
the way we wanted.

258
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,435
In the end, only one of us was accepted
to Hanguk National University med school.

259
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,357
HANGUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
PLASTIC SURGERY ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

260
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,110
Long time no see.

261
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,531
Long time no see, Dae-yeong.

262
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,657
-How've you been?
-Good.

263
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,575
See you around.

264
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,788
-Gosh, how have you two been?
-Dae-yeong, it's been a while.

265
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,832
-It has.
-How long has it been, Dae-yeong?

266
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,750
Gosh.

267
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,251
Goodness, it's been ages.

268
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,211
-You've become so handsome.
-Come on.

269
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,589
I heard you have your own practice.
Congratulations.

270
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,506
Right. Thanks.

271
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,134
But is it true you only have
one patient per week?

272
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,721
Am I wrong?

273
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,556
No?

274
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,268
You see, I've been so busy
with research and writing my thesis

275
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,479
that I don't take
many patients on purpose.

276
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,397
Focusing on my thesis is more rewarding.

277
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,940
Then, why open a practice?

278
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,361
He's become funnier.

279
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,280
Why don't you promote it more instead?

280
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,991
Even university hospitals
promote themselves on NeoTube.

281
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,701
In the past, people would've said

282
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,329
we're attention-seekers
and just doing it for show.

283
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,998
But honestly, videos online
are nicer and more descriptive

284
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,209
than a minute at the doctor's office.

285
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,961
And the result?
You gain popularity and recognition.

286
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,838
Times have changed.

287
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,424
Don't hold your hands like that.
Just relax.

288
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:17,054
I'm going to ask him today for his method
of getting a million subscribers.

289
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,433
He has no method. He was just
the first doctor to do it and got lucky.

290
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,810
So what?

291
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,063
He just acts quick,
reads trends well, and has good ideas.

292
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,773
What's so impressive about that?

293
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,691
Being friendly to his patients?

294
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,026
-You can't do that?
-What?

295
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,486
You can't either?

296
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,281
We can do it.

297
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,950
Right. Good luck.

298
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,618
-Good luck.
-Here he comes.

299
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,547
-Gosh!
-Long time no see, Jeong-woo!

300
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,882
-It's been a while.
-How have you been, Jeong-woo?

301
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,635
You look good even when you're not trying.

302
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,886
Look, Dae-yeong.

303
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,640
Dae-yeong, how have you been?

304
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,809
Hey, Jeong-woo.

305
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,146
I've been well. Very well.

306
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,149
I see.

307
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,359
Let's all sit down.

308
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,735
-Should we sit?
-Sure.

309
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,613
Thanks, Dae-yeong.

310
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,159
Gosh, what have you been up to?

311
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,494
What else?
We've been watching you, of course.

312
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,246
You're still just as witty.

313
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,289
Right.

314
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,126
Jeong-woo, I wanted to ask you something.

315
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,836
-What is it?
-It's about NeoTube.

316
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,753
Hey, Jeong-woo.

317
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,382
-Why are you so self-centered?
-What?

318
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,302
I was going to sit here,
and this wine was for me.

319
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,012
Sorry, Dae-yeong.

320
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,764
My friends would always do this,
so I guess I got used to it.

321
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,225
-Sit down. Let me pour you a drink.
-Gosh.

322
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,437
As if he was the only one
who was pampered.

323
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,439
Hey, Jeong-woo.

324
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,567
Let me give you some advice
as someone who's older than you.

325
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:58,989
If you keep living selfishly like this,
you'll be punished for it.

326
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:04,620
The Minister of Health and Welfare Award
goes to plastic surgeon, Yeo Jeong-woo.

327
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,707
For your sense of professional duty
and devotion to service, we present you

328
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:13,003
this award for making great contributions
to improving the nation's health.

329
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:18,592
Dated March 1, 2023. Signed by Minister
of Health and Welfare, Lee Gi-hwan.

330
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:35,150
What will you do? He's getting
an award instead of punishment.

331
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,152
And it's a Minister's Award.

332
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,612
He honestly deserves it.

333
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,698
He donated all of his NeoTube earnings,

334
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,536
and he's volunteered at shelters
for a decade ever since he was a student.

335
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,374
He's smart, competent, and generous.

336
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,917
How sexy is that?

337
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,962
Sexy, my foot. He just looks greedy.

338
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,173
NeoTube and TV appearances.
Does he even have time for his patients?

339
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,343
He doesn't focus on one thing.
He dips his toes into this and that.

340
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,344
What is he?

341
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,390
-Shabu-shabu? What's his deal?
-We'll now hear his speech.

342
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,227
I'm just a plastic surgeon.

343
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,231
To be honest, plastic surgery
isn't a life-or-death procedure.

344
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,944
But to some, it may be something
that feels just as desperate.

345
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
Some are born

346
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,200
with facial features
that differ from others.

347
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,121
But through reconstructive surgery,
they're able to live better lives.

348
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,333
Of course, the majority
is cosmetic surgery.

349
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,672
But as long as they don't become addicted,
I believe it'll boost their self-esteem.

350
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,969
And I'll do my best to treat
my patients' inner beauty as well.

351
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,053
Thank you.

352
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,601
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE AWARD
PLASTIC SURGEON YEO JEONG-WOO

353
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,524
Was Hippocrates just born or something?

354
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,569
The god of medical science is here.

355
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,862
Be honest, Dae-yeong.

356
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,157
Deep down inside,
you're jealous of him, aren't you?

357
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,075
No, I'm not.

358
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,536
I'm not one bit jealous of that punk.

359
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,997
I couldn't care less what he's up to.

360
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,082
DR. YEO WON A MINISTER'S AWARD

361
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,043
I uploaded this a few hours ago.

362
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,545
But it already has over 100,000 views.

363
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,049
It's all thanks
to your editing skills. I'm grateful.

364
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,508
-Are you?
-Yeah.

365
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,136
Then, please come
to the class reunion this time.

366
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,387
Do you remember Min-ho?

367
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,056
Of course, I do.

368
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,850
He loved pork belly,
and whenever it was on the lunch menu,

369
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,560
he always brought lettuce to school.

370
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,104
Yeah, and he opened
a barbecue place last week.

371
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,398
This year's reunion will be there.

372
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,067
So come with us this time.

373
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,903
I'll have to see.
You know I can't go if I have surgery.

374
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,280
You scared that Ha-neul will be there?

375
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,408
Why would you suddenly bring her up?

376
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,078
I was just joking.

377
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,080
Jeez, you idiot.

378
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,916
How's she doing by the way?
Have you heard anything?

379
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,376
How would I know?

380
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,422
I heard she slightly messed up her exams
and went to some other med school.

381
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,217
But that's all I know.
And I'm not curious either.

382
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,764
Given how unrelenting she is,
I'm sure she's doing just fine.

383
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,848
Don't you think so?

384
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,976
Hey!

385
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:23,360
Did you really think this trash
was good enough material? Did you?

386
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,320
Hey.

387
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,741
Are you aware that my dissertation
was rejected or not?

388
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,077
I'm aware of it.

389
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,621
The dissertation I wrote
with a second-year fellow

390
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,289
was easily accepted by the BJA.

391
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:40,043
So why do you think ours was rejected?

392
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,503
Whose fault is it?

393
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,213
I'm sorry, sir.

394
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,466
No! I asked you whose fault it was.

395
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,720
I believe it's my fault, sir.

396
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,139
As a third-year fellow,

397
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:56,059
this is a crucial period
where you'll either move up or crash.

398
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,186
You know this better than anyone, right?

399
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,065
For crying out loud,
do a better job, will you?

400
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,608
Damn it.

401
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,758
-Are you okay, Dr. Nam?
-Are you okay?

402
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,886
We heard his shouts from the corridor.

403
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,015
He should blame himself
for structuring the dissertation poorly.

404
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,767
Dr. Nam.

405
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,438
Professor Park wants you
to take over her surgery.

406
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,232
-What kind of surgery?
-Well…

407
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,611
It's an emergency patient
with an aortic dissection.

408
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,405
The patient was resuscitated
with CPR twice in the ER.

409
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:54,618
Jeez, how can you make her
take over every emergency situation?

410
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,537
If you start now,
it'll be an all-nighter in the OR.

411
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,707
Will you be okay?
You didn't sleep much yesterday either.

412
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,709
I'll have to hang in there.

413
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,835
I'll head down now.

414
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,174
Ventilator circuit.

415
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,023
Start the blood transfusion.

416
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,822
Increasing the norepinephrine dosage.

417
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
Phenylephrine.

418
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,593
Dr. Nam, we'll start
the surgery now. May I begin?

419
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,846
Yes, he has enough blood now,
so you may start.

420
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,182
Scalpel.

421
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,033
-Hello, Dr. Yeo.
-Good morning.

422
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,244
-Hello, Dr. Yeo.
-Hello.

423
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,745
-Hello, doctor.
-Hello.

424
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,706
Good morning.

425
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,040
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

426
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,002
Latte with an extra shot for Nurse Park.

427
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,672
Cafe mocha with low-fat milk
and no whipped cream for Nurse Oh.

428
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,882
Ms. Kim. Americano
with two pumps of syrup.

429
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,134
Thank you, Doctor.

430
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,176
My pleasure.

431
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,554
How do you remember all of this?

432
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,848
Well, I'm just that smart.

433
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,933
-I see.
-All right, then.

434
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,019
-Let's do our best. We can do it.
-We can do it.

435
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,439
How does he have such a beautiful smile?

436
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,649
He's as sweet as this latte.

437
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,665
Mom, you said we have to eat
breakfast like a king. No meat?

438
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,667
No, just eat what you get and shove it in.

439
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,835
"Shove it in"?

440
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,129
Why are you so cranky this morning?

441
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,507
-I'm home.
-Hey, Ha-neul.

442
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,886
Goodness! You should've told me
you were coming.

443
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,763
I would've made some food.

444
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,139
Hold on.

445
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,766
I'll grill some beef for you.

446
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
Beef?

447
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,436
But that's mine.

448
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,107
Can you please move?

449
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,777
You wrapped it in newspaper and hid it?

450
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,363
You said we didn't have any meat!

451
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,491
What I meant was
I didn't have any meat for you.

452
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,702
I'm going to wash my hands.

453
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,997
So you're going to be home all day, right?

454
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,043
Are you craving anything?
I'll cook you something good for lunch.

455
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,711
Don't just eat nurungji.

456
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,214
Right.

457
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,632
Well…

458
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,386
So I was offered a blind date for you.

459
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,929
Would you be interested?

460
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,056
He's also a doctor.

461
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,516
I saw a photo of him.

462
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,395
Goodness, he has a great physique
and a really handsome face.

463
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,191
-I'll take whatever you give me.
-Take? Take what?

464
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,402
You must be very desperate.

465
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,406
What? What do you mean?
Weren't we talking about lunch?

466
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,956
What's wrong?
What is it? What's the matter?

467
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,751
I stayed up a few days,
so I'm not feeling well.

468
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,212
One minute.

469
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,048
Hello, Professor.

470
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,300
Okay, I'm on my way.

471
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,262
-Okay, bye.
-But you're not feeling well.

472
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,930
At least eat first.

473
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,432
Or take a nap!

474
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,475
Ha-neul.

475
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,353
She seems really sick.

476
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,106
She finally came home
but didn't even stay for five minutes.

477
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,568
I know. Work must be really tough.

478
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,821
Gosh, I'm glad I didn't become a doctor.

479
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,616
-You had a choice?
-Of course.

480
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,577
If I really studied,
I'd be better than her.

481
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,037
Get out before I give you
a better beating.

482
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,082
What are you doing?
I'm too old to be spanked.

483
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,084
Aren't you too old to be jobless too?

484
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:14,711
I'll find one then.

485
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,129
-I'll find one!
-You idiot!

486
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,339
-Come here!
-It hurts!

487
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,550
-You little…
-I said it hurts.

488
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,719
Jeez, I should just…

489
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,305
You better stay right there.

490
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,639
-What's that?
-Where?

491
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,932
Where, you scumbag?

492
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,692
Ha-neul.

493
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,943
Your shoe.

494
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,575
-Thanks, Uncle Tae-seon. Bye.
-Bye.

495
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,121
Goodness, is she Cinderella or something?

496
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,539
I hope she isn't skipping meals.

497
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,419
The public first saw me…

498
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,757
…on a documentary
about medical volunteers overseas.

499
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,259
DOCTORS WHO INSTILL HOPE
PART 1

500
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,427
YEO JEONG-WOO
PLASTIC SURGEON

501
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,597
For some reason, that appearance
garnered a lot of attention.

502
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:16,314
LIVE BROADCAST

503
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,398
There we go.

504
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,738
At first, I just wanted people
to gain easy access to information.

505
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,408
Then, I reached a million subscribers.

506
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,453
No one uses boring sheet masks anymore.

507
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,164
Now, it's ultra-whitening
and moisturizing sheet masks.

508
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:38,336
ON SET WITH DR. YEO
AT HIS SHEET MASK COMMERCIAL SHOOT

509
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,587
How was that?

510
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,422
-It was great.
-Okay.

511
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,092
But could you hold the masks higher?

512
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,468
-The masks? My hand?
-Yes.

513
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,886
Then, your legs.

514
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,012
-Cross them.
-Cross them?

515
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,722
-That's good.
-More? Like this?

516
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,850
-Yes, that's it.
-Okay. That's good.

517
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,060
Like this? Let's do it.

518
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,772
Moisturizing sheet masks.

519
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,357
I launched my own sheet masks.

LOGIN PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC
OVER A MILLION SOLD!

521
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,988
And I opened dozens of clinics.

TEN MEDICAL REFERRAL CENTERS

523
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,787
Thanks to my comfortable
and laidback life,

524
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,040
I was able to live peacefully.

525
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,504
At least until that incident occurred.

526
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,202
I heard the patient who just came
will have surgery next week.

527
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,497
She'll get three types of contouring,
so check how many screws we have.

528
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,582
Yes, Doctor.

529
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:02,086
By the way, I heard she's from Macau.

530
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,130
She had this mysterious aura about her,

531
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,299
and she even brought her own interpreter.

532
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,259
-And the people with her--
-Nurse Oh!

533
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,261
Can you check the patient's jawline?

534
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,429
Okay.

535
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,347
-I have to go.
-Okay.

536
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,379
Hey. Don't mind me.

537
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,094
Dr. Nam. About our dissertation…

538
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,263
How about we add
Dr. Yu Chang-eun from the lab to it?

539
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,809
-Sorry?
-You've written plenty of dissertations.

540
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,105
So let's help Dr. Yu out this time. Okay?

541
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,318
You can go back to work. Do your best.

542
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,202
Is this because Dr. Yu's father
is running for office?

543
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,787
What are you talking about?

544
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,456
Jeez, this is absolutely unbelievable.

545
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,823
I'll put your mask on.

546
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,741
Okay.

547
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,670
Dr. Kang, everything okay
with the anesthesia?

548
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,423
Okay, let's begin.

549
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,551
-My chair, please.
-Yes, Doctor.

550
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,764
I'll begin with her eyes. Pen, please.

551
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,695
Send them our reply of what we discussed.

552
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,405
-Okay?
-Yes, Doctor.

553
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,535
Dr. Nam, are you okay?
You've looked a little ill.

554
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,538
I don't know.
It might be an upset stomach.

555
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,207
Want to have it checked out?

556
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,958
I'll contact Internal Medicine.

557
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,877
I have lunch plans, so I have to go.

558
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,671
What? In this state?

559
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,132
It's been a while since Hong-ran came.

560
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,718
Bye. Keep up the good work.

561
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,981
-Are you here?
-Yeah, almost.

562
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,236
Whenever I come here,
this place reminds me of those hard times.

563
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,987
I'm already feeling drained.

564
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,531
Can't we eat somewhere else?

565
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,493
I'm not sure.

566
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,830
I think I need to see a doctor,
so I can't stay long.

567
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,998
Yeah, you sound terrible.

568
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,961
Then, just take the cookies
I bought for you and your colleagues.

569
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,088
Okay.

570
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,115
What in the world?

571
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,793
Ha-neul!

572
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:27,768
Ha-neul.

573
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,116
I'm a doctor. Please call
Daehan National University Hospital.

574
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,993
-Call them right now.
-Yes, sir.

575
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,204
Ha-neul.

576
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,332
Wake up. Ha-neul.

577
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,754
Suction.

578
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,800
Give me the Bovie and hold this.

579
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,762
Suction.

580
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,653
Can we lower her blood pressure
a bit more? She's bleeding a lot.

581
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,154
It's already very low.

582
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,906
Local anesthesia!

583
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,874
One more.

584
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,252
Hurry!

585
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,722
-What do we do? The bleeding won't stop!
-Gauze and a six-inch EB!

586
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,469
Is it really cardiac arrest?

587
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,387
I believe so.

588
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,854
Call 911 now! Get the defibrillator!

589
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,525
This is Login Plastic Surgery Clinic.
We have an emergency. Please hurry.

590
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,215
So you're telling me
there were no issues during surgery?

591
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,175
Yes, sir.

592
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,804
I didn't hit any blood vessels
by accident.

593
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,391
And she wasn't on any medication.

594
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,102
And the anesthesiologist
was present the entire time.

595
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,646
Well, you're here as a witness,
so that'll be all.

596
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,231
You may go now.

597
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,486
It's on the news.

598
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,076
At a plastic surgery clinic
in Gangnam this afternoon,

599
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,162
a patient passed away
during contouring surgery

600
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,081
due to excessive bleeding.

601
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,459
Yeo, the doctor who conducted the surgery,

602
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,712
is a popular plastic surgeon
renowned for his media appearances,

603
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,632
and he has denied
all claims of malpractice.

604
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:32,346
Yeo testified that CCTV cameras in the OR
had only malfunctioned during surgery.

605
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,309
But police are investigating whether video
was paused or erased intentionally.

606
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,563
The late patient, Chang, was from Macau.

607
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,065
Here's our reporter
Song Gyeong-mi with more.

608
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,322
What in the…

609
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,311
You must've been devastated.
How do you feel?

610
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,645
Could you give us a word?

611
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,855
Please tell us.

612
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:26,150
COURT

613
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,068
Please tell us!

614
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,156
-It's Yeo Jeong-woo!
-It's Yeo!

615
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,782
He's here!

616
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,784
Mr. Yeo.

617
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,621
We heard the late patient
was a casino heiress from Macau.

618
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:42,333
-Did you know this prior to surgery?
-Did her family say anything?

619
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,212
Today, we'll discuss
the impending trial over the death

620
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,131
of a casino heiress from Macau.

621
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:53,636
First, Yeo claims the CCTV cameras
malfunctioned only during surgery.

622
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,721
That's just ridiculous.

623
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,516
You'd obviously look suspicious
if only that footage was gone,

624
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,434
so who'd be dumb enough to do that?

625
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,354
There are differing opinions
regarding Yeo's actions.

626
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,814
Traces of anticoagulants
in the patient's body…

627
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,316
Exactly.

628
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:11,570
It's a plastic surgery clinic, not an ER.
So why were there anticoagulants? Right?

629
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,489
Don't yell at me. I didn't do it.

630
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
Because it makes no sense!

631
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,535
If you're that worried,
you should attend the trial.

632
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,370
Why would I?

633
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,081
I don't even know the date of the trial.

634
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,544
Before surgery,
why was prohibited medication

635
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,796
found in the late patient's body?

636
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,006
It's starting in ten minutes.

637
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,217
Jeez, what is he going to do?

638
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,430
The defendant, Yeo Jeong-woo,

639
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,892
was conducting contouring surgery
on the victim, Chang Bing.

640
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,520
However, the victim died
from excessive bleeding.

641
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,564
AUTOPSY REPORT

642
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,441
The autopsy report showed
an intracerebral hemorrhage

643
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,944
and internal bleeding in multiple areas.

644
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,364
Anticoagulants were detected
from the blood test.

645
00:42:56,198 --> 00:43:01,495
This shows the patient was administered
anticoagulants during surgery.

646
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,165
In accordance with Article 268
of criminal law, the prosecution charges

647
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:09,086
the defendant, Yeo Jeong-woo,
with death due to occupational negligence.

648
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,505
Your Honor.

649
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,341
We deny all the charges
from the prosecution.

650
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,595
Confirmed by medical supply order history
and inventory records,

651
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,722
there is no evidence that the defendant

652
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,183
ordered anticoagulants
from a pharmaceutical company.

653
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,729
Furthermore, the victim's
medical report in Korea clearly shows

654
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,274
that due to arrhythmia,
also known as atrial fibrillation,

655
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:34,820
she had been taking warfarin,
a type of anticoagulant, for a while.

656
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:41,035
Your Honor, even if there was
long-term use of warfarin,

657
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,995
it couldn't cause that much bleeding.

658
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,538
Therefore,

659
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,042
the prosecution would like to question
the defendant regarding this matter.

660
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,168
Okay, I'll allow it.

661
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,588
Mr. Yeo, you may sit at the witness stand.

662
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,132
DEFENDANT

663
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,023
WITNESS STAND

664
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,232
Mr. Yeo.

665
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,778
Are you certain
you never ordered anticoagulants?

666
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,072
Yes, I've never ordered them before.

667
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,698
In that case,

668
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,450
how will you explain this?

669
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,498
This is the anticoagulant heparin.
We'd like to submit this as evidence.

670
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,375
Objection, Your Honor.

671
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,710
That evidence
wasn't in the investigation report,

672
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,214
and we don't even know
where it was found or its origin.

673
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,842
They found this bottle of heparin

674
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,178
at the defendant's clinic.

675
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,224
The defendant consistently testified

676
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:48,811
that he never kept
anticoagulants in his clinic.

677
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,647
But they found this bottle
in the trash at his clinic.

678
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,317
And they found
his fingerprints on it as well.

679
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,445
That's impossible.

680
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,115
I know nothing of this.

681
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,504
EVIDENCE OF ANTICOAGULANTS

682
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,978
They once said in a movie…

683
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,983
that failure and defeat

684
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,986
meant different things.

685
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,824
Anyone can fail,

686
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:50,122
but defeat was an utter fiasco
usually found in legends.

687
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,376
I was defeated.

688
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,008
Nevertheless,

689
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,012
-I still had friends who believed in me.
-Hey.

690
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,431
-Sit down.
-Hey.

691
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,808
-So I'll keep fighting for the truth.
-Jeong-woo.

692
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,519
How could you do this to me?

693
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,771
Let's talk it out!

694
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,611
-Come here!
-That's enough!

695
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,070
I said that's enough!

696
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,030
Hey!

697
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,116
Hey.

698
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,410
Do you know how much we need to cough up?

699
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,746
One billion won!

700
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,581
You pay for it!

701
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,208
-That's enough!
-Let go!

702
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,169
You really had nothing to do with it?

703
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,006
Then, why were your fingerprints
found on that bottle?

704
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,677
Everyone says the appearance
of medication that the clinic never used

705
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,971
could mean it was intentional murder.

706
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,681
Damn it, you bastard.

707
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,391
You bastard.

708
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,605
Give it a rest, you crazy bastards!

709
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,025
-What are you doing?
-God!

710
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,788
Why are you throwing
a pity party here by yourself?

711
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,041
What happened to your face?
Were you in a fight?

712
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,461
What in the world happened?

713
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,300
Our clinic never had heparin
to begin with. So how--

714
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,427
I really didn't do it, Kyung-min!

715
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,721
Jeong-woo, I know.

716
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,723
Damn it.

717
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:37,229
I know you're really frustrated,
but let's focus on being acquitted.

718
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,731
Get some new attorneys. Here.

719
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,070
A former chief judge of the court,

720
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,364
and a former doctor
who handles medical lawsuits.

721
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,325
Thanks for looking into this.

722
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,829
But I'm billions in debt.

723
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,707
I discussed that a bit
with the attorney today.

724
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,711
Severance pay for your employees,
advertisement cancellation penalties,

725
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,880
and compensation for the branches
adds up to around ten billion.

726
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,141
INVOICE OF PENALTIES

727
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,185
Gosh.

728
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,565
You'd have to also compensate
her family if they file a civil suit.

729
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,528
Jeong-woo.

730
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:31,366
I'm going to take out as big a loan
as I can to form a new team of lawyers.

731
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,577
You should sell your house,
car, clinics, stocks,

732
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,787
and whatever else to pay off
what's most pressing.

733
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,788
Okay?

734
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,708
Jeong-woo.

735
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,711
You need to stay strong.

736
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,313
Remember how you removed
your gall last month?

737
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,315
-Is that okay now?
-Yeah.

738
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,942
Is it safe to remove that?
Where exactly was it?

739
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,864
Here, but there's no issue in removing it.

740
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,825
It's short for gallbladder.

741
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,951
Gallbladder?

742
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,081
I guess all you have now
is just a bladder.

743
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,668
Gosh, it must've hurt so much.

744
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,380
Why did you wait like a fool?
You ended up fainting.

745
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,256
What if you got hit by a car?

746
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,425
But I didn't.

747
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,887
Well anyways,
you're all better now, right?

748
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,891
Sit down. I'll bring your food soon.

749
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,352
Okay.

750
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:47,317
This three-year government grant
is worth one billion won!

751
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,989
You know you'll only get paid
if you earn it, right?

752
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,992
Hand out the surveys yourself
if you don't want to code.

753
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,703
Do your job right. Got it?

754
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,212
Despite working harder
than anyone else for 17 hours a day,

755
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,756
I was still treated like a sinner

756
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,091
and an idiot.

757
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,346
I spent every single day
being scolded and apologizing.

758
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,311
But it was still okay.

759
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,314
Congratulations!

760
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,816
-Thank you.
-Cheers!

761
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,152
Thanks.

762
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,160
Sir, congratulations
on becoming assistant professor.

763
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,620
Another spot will open for you soon.

764
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,749
Even if it does,
that's only one spot for eight fellows.

765
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,460
I wonder if my turn will ever come.

766
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,879
You're all doing well. It'll happen soon.

767
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,505
Let's enjoy some good food today.

768
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,174
Thanks. Eat up.

769
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,884
-Thank you for the food.
-Dig in!

770
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:58,305
I thought, "The path I'm on
might not lead to an island of treasure."

771
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,098
But I kept going while full of doubt.

772
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,310
Even if the treasure chest was empty,

773
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,064
I wanted to keep going
until I could open it myself.

774
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,895
How may I help you?

775
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,606
Well…

776
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,608
Something happened to me recently.

777
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,862
I had acute inflammation
of the gallbladder.

778
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,281
I fainted from stomach pains
and a high fever.

779
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,451
But it happened in the road,
so I was almost hit by a truck.

780
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,915
Gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
You must've been very upset.

781
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,501
But more importantly,

782
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,088
I don't understand why
I had those thought back then.

783
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,424
What kind of thoughts?

784
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,594
When I was almost hit by the truck,

785
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,763
what I thought was…

786
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,061
Sure, let's just die.

787
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,106
That would be the better option.

788
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,570
Even if my life wasn't that precious,

789
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,156
I still didn't think
it was a worthless life.

790
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:26,036
So why did I want to die?

791
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,208
It may be something you're not aware of.

792
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,880
But the anxiety, pain, or depression
that have settled in your subconscious

793
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,883
may have manifested those thoughts.

794
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:45,388
In this box called your subconscious,
you filled it up with pain from your past,

795
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,141
but that box was opened.

796
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,688
If it's okay with you,
how about we take a simple test?

797
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,584
"I feel lonely and dejected."

798
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,801
ALWAYS

799
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,720
"I feel emotional and want to cry."

800
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,473
ALWAYS

801
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,393
"I feel miserable."

802
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,939
ALWAYS

803
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,236
"I don't think good things happen to me."

804
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:54,749
ALWAYS

805
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,431
You have depression.

806
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,475
Depression?

807
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,102
Me?

808
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,521
But I've been doing pretty well.

809
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,484
You're just not aware
that you're exhausted.

810
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,821
But we all get emotionally weary at times.

811
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,907
Have you heard of the term
"burnout" before?

812
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,368
After being excessively immersed
in something,

813
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,163
you become physically
and emotionally stressed.

814
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:37,542
As a result, you develop symptoms,
such as feeling lethargic or depressed.

815
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,421
I believe that's the state
you're in right now.

816
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,300
Me?

817
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:50,263
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to start you on some medication.

818
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,498
You don't have to take it so seriously.

819
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:21,044
You pushed yourself too hard
and couldn't rest when you were tired.

820
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,587
It's an illness of the mind.

821
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,425
Ridiculous. I don't have time
to be depressed.

822
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,678
There's nothing wrong with me.

823
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,263
Damn it.

824
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,731
I said I'm fine!

825
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,941
Goodness.

826
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,318
He hits the breaking ball.

827
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,404
To right field. Toward the wall!

828
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,115
It's a home run!

829
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,094
Let's drink some beer and shake it off.

830
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,554
Stop watching TV.

831
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,721
I just turned it on.

832
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,890
I could hear it. Don't lie.

833
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,600
What do you mean? I just turned it on.

834
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,146
Damn it. Don't turn on the TV
when you don't pay for electricity.

835
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,523
Whatever. I need to focus. Leave me alone.

836
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,484
Lambada, come here.

837
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,278
My name's Nam Ba-da, not lambada!

838
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,322
Don't speak that way to your mom.
Come on, Ba-da.

839
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,661
What's all this?

840
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,483
Who are you?

841
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,122
I asked who you were.

842
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,066
-You…
-Why are you…

843
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,503
Gosh, that hurts.

844
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,426
The girl I liked back then.

845
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,015
What in the world?

846
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,602
She's totally insane!

847
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,399
Darn it!

848
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,820
The girl I hated back then.

849
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,365
The boy I wanted to grab
by the collar back then.

850
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:24,829
I met him again
during the lowest point in my life.

851
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,792
Right when I was hanging off the edge

852
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,670
at the world's end…

853
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,692
DOCTOR SLUMP

854
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:58,321
It's the worst thing
that could've happened to my ruined life.

855
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,989
-First love?
-Is he cute?

856
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,157
Are you two going to date?

857
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,409
She's not my first love.
She's my biggest nemesis.

858
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,328
Hey, is that how you think of me?

859
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,913
-Want to have some soju?
-No.

860
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,916
What?

861
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,210
Is she crazy?

862
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,464
You of all people can't be depressed.

863
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,675
I can't even be sick?

864
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,763
Are you still up
for three bottles of soju?

865
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:25,556
Of course.

866
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:33,648
