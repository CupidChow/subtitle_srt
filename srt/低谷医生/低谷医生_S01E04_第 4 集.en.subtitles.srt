DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,008
Hey, do you want to play jumpsies?

3
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,093
No, let's play jacks.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,304
Let's just have some snacks instead.

5
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,972
Forget it.

6
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,807
Let's just review for math class.

7
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:05,231
How many numbers
from one to 20 are less than 17?

8
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,153
I never had any friends.

9
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,120
I enjoyed studying over playing
with friends in elementary school.

10
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:24,292
I really enjoyed studying over hanging
with friends in middle school.

11
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,384
And I really enjoyed studying even more
over hanging with friends in high school.

12
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,929
BUSAN SEA FISH CAKES' NAM HA-NEUL
KOREA'S TOP STUDENT

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,266
That's how I ended up as the country's
best student in academics.

14
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,354
Then, is Ha-neul going
to a university in Seoul?

15
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,440
Well, her homeroom teacher said

16
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,527
she could easily get into medical school
at Hanguk National University.

17
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,528
Isn't that incredible?

18
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,531
Ha-neul got in for her achievements.

19
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,117
As a result,
my family's expectations grew.

20
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,054
REPORT CARD

21
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,806
The top-ranked student at school.

22
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,979
This was the only time…

23
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,359
when my weary dad could smile.

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,739
That's why I became
more earnest in studying.

25
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,499
-Ha-neul.
-Yeah?

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,877
Do you want to eat
some tteokbokki with us?

27
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,296
I'm allergic to tteokbokki.

28
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,798
Then, want to go to the arcade?

29
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,717
Whoever loses at Tetris buys drinks.

30
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,594
I don't like Tetris.

31
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,804
-I see.
-I see.

32
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,557
Then, how about a movie this weekend?

33
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,475
I've already seen it.

34
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,687
But I didn't say which movie it was.

35
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,772
Let's go.

36
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,033
I gradually forgot
how to hang out with friends.

37
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,206
OCEAN VIEW CAFE

38
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,468
Guess what?

39
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,553
Remember that guy I told you about?

40
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,471
What? Wait.

41
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,017
I don't have any friends
from my school days.

42
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,104
But then,

43
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,107
a friend…

44
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,654
from those days came into my life.

45
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,201
I now have a friend…

46
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,164
to reminisce about the past with.

47
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,676
Hey, what are you
writing on the sand? Stop it.

48
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,052
These will be memories too.

49
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,764
Memories, my foot.
It's giving me goosebumps. It's so corny.

50
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,350
Hey, don't touch it.
This is like a monument.

51
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,393
No.

52
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,437
Hey, you. Come here.

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,440
Go over there, all right?

54
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,025
I need to take a photo of it.

55
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,401
Okay. I got it.

56
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,195
No!

57
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,113
Hey!

58
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,157
Come on! Hey!

59
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,367
Hey! Are you serious?

00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,494

00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,289
NAM HA-NEUL AND YEO JEONG-WOO
FRIENDS SINCE APRIL 2023

62
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,590
Goodness, come on in.

63
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,175
Hello.

64
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,176
Sit over there.

65
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,349
-Here.
-Thank you.

66
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,311
-All right.
-What would you like?

67
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,191
Two bowls of seafood kalguksu, please.

68
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,901
All right. It won't take long.

69
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,985
Okay.

70
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,030
Right.

71
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,617
Here. It's the dissertation
I brought yesterday.

72
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,328
I printed out a copy
so you could read it too.

73
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,538
Thanks.

74
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,792
We never came across this case though.

75
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,004
I told you. Finding obscure dissertations
to read is my hobby.

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,799
We found a similar case,

77
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,218
so you'll have the advantage
in the next hearing.

78
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,687
You must be tired.

79
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,190
You couldn't sleep while coming here.

80
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,693
That's not all.
I spent three nights looking for that.

81
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,946
Are you serious?

82
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,452
Gosh, it's out of battery.

83
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,579
Here. I'll ask if they have a charger.

84
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,706
-Thanks.
-No problem.

85
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,875
Okay.

86
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,675
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes?

87
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,386
Do you have a charger by any chance?

88
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,139
Gosh, I don't have one. I'm sorry.

89
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,559
I see. It's okay.

90
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,234
She doesn't have a…

91
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,083
My goodness.

92
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,877
She fell asleep.

93
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,546
Yes. Ma'am, could I see you for a moment?

94
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,305
So… I'm sorry,
but could you let her sleep a bit?

95
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,848
What? In there?

96
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,560
We run an inn too.

97
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,353
An inn?

98
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,522
Gosh, we're not dating.

99
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,317
We're just friends.

100
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,445
Anyway, we don't need an inn.

101
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,780
If you could let her sleep
for an hour or two,

102
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,409
I'll order the spicy braised seafood
and octopus dumplings.

103
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,785
-Really?
-Yes.

104
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,120
Then, I'll let her sleep.

105
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,539
It's early so there are
no customers anyway.

106
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,249
Thank you.

107
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,381
Things will work out.

108
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,242
Am I being too cheesy?

109
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,664
No, I can do this much for a friend.

110
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,442
Come on in!

111
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,777
What would you like?

112
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,236
-Three rice bowls.
-Okay.

113
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
Ma'am!

114
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,747
Where's our food?

115
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,297
What?

116
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,051
What? When did I fall asleep?

117
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,011
When did I fall asleep?

118
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,392
Hey, you're finally up.

119
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,938
Then, I'll bring out
all the dishes you ordered.

120
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,316
Right. Okay.

121
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,452
Is that so?

122
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,122
No, I'm glad to hear that.

123
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,999
Thank you. You really helped me out.

124
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,848
What's wrong?

125
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,101
Nothing. My clinic got sold.

126
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,064
Goodness, some things
are finally starting to pan out.

127
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,027
Let's go.

128
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,199
How about some fresh air first?

129
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,082
Bitter, right?

130
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,127
It's sweet and delicious.

131
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,713
Not the coffee.

132
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,341
I bet you worked hard
to save up all that money.

133
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,178
I can't even imagine such a figure.

134
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,973
But you spent it all
on penalties and compensations.

135
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,350
You even sold your clinic.

136
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,061
I thought you wouldn't be all right.

137
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,858
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I was delighted.

138
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,568
But…

139
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,155
I also just think

140
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,576
it's a relief to have had
that much saved up.

141
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,539
In any case, some people's lives
were ruined because of me.

142
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,336
I'm glad I had enough money
to at least give them

143
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,131
what they deserved.

144
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,592
That's how I feel.

145
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,746
Mom.

146
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,916
Where's Ha-neul's car keys?
They're not in the drawer.

147
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,460
What do you need them for?

148
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,755
It's a waste having it always parked,
so I was going to drive it.

149
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,674
I thought I'd take my crush for a drive.

150
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,677
Drive, my foot.

151
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,012
You don't even earn money
for the gas. Forget it.

152
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,057
She took the car keys with her anyway.

153
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,810
Really? Where did she go?

154
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,521
She went to Sokcho
with a friend to see the sunrise.

155
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,482
And she spent the night outside.

156
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,321
She's never been out all night
hanging out. I'm proud of her.

157
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,991
-Who's the friend?
-Who do you think?

158
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,201
I see. Hong-ran?

159
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,079
Gosh. She must be distraught.

160
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,624
I hope she gets fresh air with Hong-ran
in Sokcho and feels better.

161
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,588
Who is it?

162
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,428
Hello, ma'am.

163
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,096
Hey, Lambada.

164
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,598
It's Nam Ba-da, not Lambada.

165
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,894
Anyway, how was Sokcho? Where's Ha-neul?

166
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,730
What do you mean "Sokcho"?
Is Ha-neul not home?

167
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,481
No, she's not.

168
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:05,446
She said yesterday she's spending
the night in Sokcho with a friend,

169
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,656
so of course, I thought she went with you.

170
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,491
Then who could it be?

171
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,164
Goodness! No way! Oh, my gosh!

172
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,337
Where are you going?

173
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,882
To Sokcho! I need to find my daughter!

174
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,216
How will you find her there?

175
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,218
Just call her instead!

176
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,180
Her phone is off!

177
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm sure something's wrong!
She could've jumped into the sea!

178
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,769
Why would she do such a thing?

179
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,938
She has depression!

180
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,522
What? She does?

181
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,275
Ha-neul!

182
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,360
Come on!

183
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,405
Ha-neul!

184
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,117
-Mom.
-What?

185
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,997
Wait. Why is he… What's going on?

186
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,834
Ha-neul, did you go
to Sokcho with Mr. Rooftop?

187
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,003
"Mr. Rooftop"?

188
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,590
Is this your first love
who moved into the rooftop room?

189
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,762
-What?
-I'm your first love?

190
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,599
-No, you're not.
-What?

191
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,103
No, you got it wrong.

192
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,604
He isn't.

193
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,148
What are you doing here?

194
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,235
What?

195
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,910
Where do I even begin?

196
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,453
What should I ask first?

197
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,914
Hey, let me ask you first.

198
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,666
Why did you come unannounced?

199
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,293
I thought I'd see you
before my night shift today.

200
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,130
Your phone was off,
so I thought you'd be home.

201
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,215
Seriously, where do I begin?

202
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,883
What are you so curious about?

203
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:54,263
Do you… really have depression?

204
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,975
I told you I was depressed
over drinks last time.

205
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,145
I didn't know it was serious.

206
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,771
Is that why you quit your job?

207
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,649
I had no idea.

208
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,401
Hey, don't overreact.

209
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,779
You said you were depressed too
like everyone else in this day and age.

210
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,949
I was screened and quit work as advised.

211
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
I'm also taking medication,
so don't worry.

212
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,246
Knowing you, you must've mustered
the courage to tell me.

213
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,749
But I just blabbered on
about your first love.

214
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,461
I nagged you for another round of drinks
and kept ordering more food. I was so…

215
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,463
I was insane.

216
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,298
Don't be so hard on yourself.

217
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,926
Enough with the pity party.
Next question. What do you want to know?

218
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,805
-The rooftop room guy.
-I said he wasn't my first love.

219
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,974
Then, that's even weirder.

220
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,896
How is your nemesis and rival from school
Yeo Jeong-woo, "the nation's doctor"?

221
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,898
Fine, let's say that's true.

222
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,068
But I thought you hated each other.
You despised him.

223
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:53,447
You said he was moving out, so why did you
go to Sokcho to see the sunrise with him?

224
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,286
I don't want to repeat myself,
so all of you just listen.

225
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,914
Should we?

226
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,208
He's just a friend, not my first love.

227
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,752
We weren't close before,
but we became friends.

228
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,379
But the news said--

229
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,924
Since when did you watch the news?

230
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,928
There's more to the story.

231
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,263
It's still an ongoing trial.
And above all else…

232
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,309
I can handle it myself.

233
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,774
I know how to judge if someone
is good enough to be friends with or not.

234
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,165
Hong-ran, take this with you and eat.

235
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,001
Thank you.

236
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,378
By the way,

237
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:56,552
is it really okay to let Ha-neul
hang out with the rooftop fellow?

238
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,389
I'm sure she'll be fine. Like she said,
she knows how to judge such things.

239
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,809
But still, it doesn't seem
like a normal medical malpractice case.

240
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,811
It makes me so worried.

241
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,691
Speaking of which,
why don't you set up a blind date for her?

242
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,862
-All of a sudden?
-She's not interested in getting married.

243
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,782
But I'm afraid if they hang out together,
they'll start liking each other.

244
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:24,288
I think it'd be better if she had
someone by her side while she's depressed.

245
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,748
Then, I'll ask her--

246
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,919
Come on. Then, she'd definitely refuse.

247
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,547
Let's look for a guy first,
and then pressure her.

248
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:38,302
Just set her up with someone,
and I'll carry her there if I must. Okay?

249
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,679
I'll give it a try then.

250
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,056
-All right. Take this.
-Okay.

251
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,605
That's what I said, but…

252
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,360
This guy got married last year.

253
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,738
And this one…

254
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,823
No, he has terrible habits when drunk.

255
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,163
Ha-neul knows the rest of them.
How will I ever find anyone?

256
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,208
Dr. Lee, here's the list
of the C-section patients for tomorrow.

257
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,543
-Nurse Joo.
-Yes?

258
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,546
Do you happen to know any decent guys?

259
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,089
What? Guys?

260
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,550
I'm just looking
for good blind date candidates.

261
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,552
Blind dates?

262
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,430
Hello, Professor Park.

263
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,390
-Let's talk later.
-Okay.

264
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,481
"Lee Hong-ran."

265
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,609
RECENT SUBSCRIBERS
LEE HONG-RAN

266
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,363
Who in the world could she be?
Why would she subscribe to me?

267
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,114
CHANNEL DASHBOARD

268
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,951
Come in.

269
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,037
What is it?

270
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,665
-Do you want to go on a blind date?
-A blind date?

271
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,502
No. No, thank you.

272
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,256
She's the anesthesiologist
at Hope OBGYN Clinic.

273
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,758
-I'm not interested.
-Her name's Lee Hong-ran.

274
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,261
Lee Hong-ran?

275
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,935
The person who chose me just for my videos
and isn't family or someone I know?

276
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,479
This Lee Hong-ran?

277
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,856
I'm not sure.

278
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,444
I can't tell if they're the same person,
but you did get offered a blind date.

279
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,115
Did she really subscribe to you
and ask for a blind date

280
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,658
because she's interested in you?

281
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,369
I'll tell her you said no.

282
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,580
No! I'll go on the blind date! Nurse Do!

283
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,833
Nurse Do!

284
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,754
Things are getting weird.

285
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,507
We used to be archenemies.

286
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,177
"Mr. Rooftop"?

287
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,930
Is this your first love
who moved into the rooftop room?

288
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,474
Am I really

289
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,769
Ha-neul's first love?

290
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,064
Come on. No way.

291
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,525
Come on. That's ridiculous.

292
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,030
-Who is it?
-It's me.

293
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,242
Hold on.

294
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,920
Come on in.

295
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,887
I found these alongside that dissertation.
I thought you might want to read them too.

296
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,472
Okay. Thanks.

297
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,604
Right. Who pulls all-nighters
to find papers to help someone?

298
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,775
It's only because I'm her first love.

299
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,404
Do you want a drink? Want some coffee?

300
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,699
Sure. Let's drink outside.

301
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,367
Okay. Go sit down.

302
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,720
Did your mom scold you
for hanging out with me?

303
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,849
What am I, a kid? I'm too old for that.
Don't take anything you hear to heart.

304
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,189
Right. Are you free later today?

305
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,529
Well, I have nothing planned. Why?

306
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,741
Then, can you come shopping
with me tonight?

307
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,285
Why shopping all of a sudden?

308
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,580
No, I just…

309
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,627
What? Why are you being shy?

310
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,255
Right.

311
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,299
Of course, she'd be shy
with her first love.

312
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,096
So are you coming or not?

313
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,391
I'll come. Jeez.

314
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,770
Let's nap so we won't be tired,
and I'll see you at 7:00 p.m.

315
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,689
Sure.

316
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,192
Thanks for the coffee.

317
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,240
My goodness.

318
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,871
Gosh, how blinding. What's that?

319
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,831
Wait, it's just me.

320
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,042
What should I wear?

321
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,879
Gosh, she's such a nuisance.

322
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,883
Then…

323
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,683
No. Not you.

324
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,020
Pink. No, thank you.

325
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,522
Get out of here. No use in clinging on.

326
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,107
Gosh, too dull.

327
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,193
You're…

328
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,750
Why are you wearing
a cap at night? There's no sun.

329
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,963
Well, no reason. I don't want people
to gossip if they recognize me.

330
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,091
Sorry. I shouldn't have invited you.

331
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,970
I meant you, not me.
I wore it so you wouldn't be embarrassed.

332
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,933
In that case, I'm fine. Just take it off.

333
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,435
-It's okay.
-Come on.

334
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,770
-Take it off.
-I said I'm okay.

335
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,104
-Take it off.
-I'm okay. Stop--

336
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,879
Hey, thanks.

337
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,048
If it wasn't for you, I would've fallen.

338
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,883
Right.

339
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,719
Let's go.

340
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,721
What? Okay.

341
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,234
Is this one pretty? Or is this one pretty?

342
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,198
I think they'll both look fine.

343
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,327
But I think that one will look better.

344
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,412
Really?

345
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,248
Then, I'll try this one on.

346
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,881
What is this?

347
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,217
Does she still care about what I think?

348
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,889
Is this why they say
you can never forget your first love?

349
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,445
Jeez.

350
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,209
What do you think? Does it look pretty?

351
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,337
Very pretty.

352
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,755
Really?

353
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,598
The dress.

354
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,601
It's really pretty.

355
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,188
What? Why are you suddenly being shy?

356
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,192
Is it because we touched
when you caught me earlier?

357
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,986
What are you talking about?
As if that was a big deal.

358
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,780
Don't be ridiculous.

359
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,451
To be honest, I was a bit surprised.

360
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,411
You seemed to have matured a lot.

361
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,374
-What?
-You once threw me.

362
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,709
So I almost broke both wrists. Remember?

363
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,669
-What do you mean?
-You remember.

364
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,881
It was when I'd just transferred,
and in our classroom fan broke.

365
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,760
Right.

366
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,762
That fan incident.

367
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,055
Gosh, it's hot.

368
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,061
STUDY HALL

369
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,938
This is way too hot.

370
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,980
I'm going crazy.

371
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,110
It's spring. Why is it so hot?

372
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,325
That's so noisy.

373
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,746
Hey.

374
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,289
What are you doing?

375
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:35,004
Jeez, it's not that loud.
She's making such a fuss.

376
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,479
Gosh.

377
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:06,870
-Date!
-Date!

378
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,998
-Date!
-Date!

379
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,250
What's the matter with you guys?

380
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,794
Don't be ridiculous.

381
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:16,880
Hey!

382
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,298
-Gosh.
-Hey.

383
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,092
Did she hurt her wrists?

384
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,343
I think she broke them.

385
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,430
It hurts.

386
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,268
Stop doodling and solve the problem.

387
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,358
She doesn't know when to give up.

388
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,611
How is she able to work like that?

389
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,947
Jeong-woo. Be honest.

390
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,783
Helping her was an excuse.

391
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,118
You were actually trying
to kill her, right?

392
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,036
What?

393
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,915
Didn't you try to get rid of your rival
since you're unhappy she came here?

394
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,210
Right. He destroyed both her wrists,

395
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,670
so she can't take notes
or solve problems quick.

396
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,339
She's struggling to keep up.

397
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,549
Hey, things are going
just as you as planned.

398
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,178
You guys are dangerous.

399
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,596
Who keeps chatting?

400
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,556
-Who?
-It's Jeong-woo.

401
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,059
-Do you have a question?
-No, sir.

402
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,440
-I'll kill you.
-You're the teacher's pet.

403
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,394
Are your wrists okay?
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

404
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,897
It's okay. I just sprained them.

405
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,485
Hold on.

406
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,240
-Here.
-What's that?

407
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,077
I took notes and recorded the lectures.

408
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,080
I got our teacher's permission
to record, so don't worry.

409
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,628
I'll do it until your wrists get better.
I'm really sorry.

410
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,718
Right.

411
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,152
Let's go. I'll carry this for you.

412
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,284
What are you doing? Come on.

413
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,077
Okay.

414
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,113
Even if I was hurt back then,

415
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:35,662
you found seats for me, took notes for me,
and got permission to record lectures.

416
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,373
I thought you were kind.

417
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,920
Is that why she fell for me?

418
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,385
I wasn't trying to be nice.
I just wanted to play fair and square.

419
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,514
-I finally get it.
-Get what?

420
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,726
All this time, I just thought
you were framed for some vague reason.

421
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,439
My gut told me you weren't the type
to brazenly deny your wrongdoings.

422
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,028
But after getting to know you
and reminiscing about that incident,

423
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,948
I finally get why I trust you so much.

424
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,955
You're extremely competitive
but still thoughtful of others.

425
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:24,544
Despite losing everything you had,
you worry about the pain of others first.

426
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,297
So you couldn't have done it.

427
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,226
Thanks for making time today.

428
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,105
And actually…

429
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,943
I have something to tell you.

430
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,824
What is it?

431
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,996
You see, I…

432
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,182
I have a blind date tomorrow.

433
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,150
What?

434
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,402
A blind date.

435
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,238
What's wrong?

436
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,657
Nothing.

437
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,119
It was so unexpected.

438
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,039
They say blind dates
are supposed to be sudden like this.

439
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,417
I was going to tell you earlier,
but I was too shy.

440
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,546
Asking you to come help me
buy a dress for the date was hard.

441
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,716
A dress for the date?

442
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,634
Yeah.

443
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,806
The internet said asking guy friends
was the best option, so I brought you.

444
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,267
I see.

445
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,563
But I thought
you wouldn't be interested in blind dates.

446
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,566
I wasn't, but after spending
some time with you,

447
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,485
I realized I hadn't done much in life.

448
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,655
So I'm going to have some fun
like you told me to.

449
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,406
I'm going to try every new thing.

450
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,827
I see.

451
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,080
Hong-ran did kind of pressure me
to do the blind date.

452
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,748
Right. You saw her, didn't you?

453
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,959
She blabbered on
about you being my first love.

454
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,878
She's always making a fool of herself.

455
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,421
Wasn't that really funny?

456
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,340
Right.

457
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,594
She's going to be
the death of me. Let's go.

458
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,610
I'm glad.

459
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,571
This is a good thing.

460
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,159
It was uncomfortable
thinking that I was her first love.

461
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,618
So this turned out great.

462
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,913
What a relief.

463
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,624
Let's clean up.

464
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,377
Damn it!

465
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,559
Okay, I'll see you there.

466
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,188
-Was that your blind date?
-How'd you know?

467
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,899
I could tell right away
from your despicable tone.

468
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,402
What does that scum--

469
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,198
What does that guy do?

470
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,574
-He's a plastic surgeon.
-Age?

471
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,409
-He's a year older.
-Any hobbies?

472
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,661
How would I know? I'll ask.

473
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,664
All right, you do that. A good scum--

474
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,459
I hope he's a good guy.

475
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,212
I hope so too.

476
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,506
Bye.

477
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,429
What?

478
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,950
Eat up.

479
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:28,246
This is the best restaurant in our area,
so it wasn't easy to reserve a table.

480
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,664
I see.

481
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,916
So you're an anesthesiologist?

482
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,501
Yes. And you're a plastic surgeon?

483
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,461
Yes.

484
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,213
I opened my practice here recently.

485
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,259
Gosh, hold on. Please excuse me.

486
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,844
There it is!

487
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,932
This is my business card.

488
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,850
Feel free to visit whenever you like.

489
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,978
Okay.

490
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,980
LA BEAUTE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC
BIN DAE-YEONG

491
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,982
"La Beaute Plastic Surgery Clinic"?

492
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,151
Yes. It's a noun in French
meaning "beauty."

493
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,864
But I believe "beauty"
is a verb, not a noun.

494
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,618
Because I could change beauty
with my fingertips.

495
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,830
I see.

496
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:14,458
If your practice recently opened,
it must've been tough settling in.

497
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,544
No, not at all.

498
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,632
I have an excellent aesthetic sense,
and my hands are quite dexterous.

499
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,511
So I'm your best bet
in helping you transform yourself.

500
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,389
I don't know
if you're familiar with this saying.

501
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,644
It's the art of medicine,
and I create that art.

502
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,063
Call me "The Michelangelo of Surgery."

503
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,607
I see.

504
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,903
Anyway, that's why I chose
that name for my channel.

505
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,824
It actually wasn't my intention
to bring in more patients.

506
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,576
How do I put it?

507
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,036
It's just a hobby. Yes.

508
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,079
NeoTube is just a hobby for me.

509
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,498
I see.

510
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,793
And I just started, so that's why
I don't have many subscribers.

511
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,420
But I'll gradually get more.

512
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,714
I see.

513
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,594
What? Why does he keep talking
about NeoTube?

514
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,180
"Why did you subscribe to me?"

515
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:13,392
"Are you interested in me?"
It'd be rude to ask right away, right?

516
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,314
-Eat up.
-Okay.

517
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,155
I wonder how the blind date is going.

518
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,462
Whatever.

519
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,173
I don't have time for that.

520
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,719
Let's not think about nonsense
and just focus on the trial.

521
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,687
I guess Ms. Hong-ran
doesn't like meat that much?

522
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,732
What? That's not true.

523
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,693
-Hong-ran likes meat.
-Sorry?

524
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,822
I see.

525
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,200
What else does Hong-ran like?

526
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,081
Hong-ran likes alcohol.

527
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,791
She also likes junk food.

528
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,252
I see.

529
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:25,673
What's her deal? Why does she keep talking
about herself in the third person?

530
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,677
Why does he keep asking about Hong-ran?

531
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,641
You seem to be great at grilling meat.

532
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,559
Right.

533
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,476
Hold on!

534
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,561
Hey, Eun-jeong.

535
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,939
-Isn't that your dad?
-What?

536
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,943
-You're right.
-He's with a woman.

537
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,362
Your dad likes someone!

538
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,280
No, he doesn't.

539
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,948
-He has a girlfriend?
-No.

540
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:56,579
Jeez, why did he have to go
on a date in our neighborhood?

541
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,538
This is so annoying.

542
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,915
What does Hong-ran
usually do on her days off?

543
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,627
She usually spends time with her son.

544
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,672
I see. So that's what she does.

545
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,887
Still, it must be nice that Ms. Hong-ran
gets to spend time with her son.

546
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,765
My daughter's all grown up and only wants
to hang out with her friends.

547
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,517
She doesn't even hang out with me.

548
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,061
You have a daughter?

549
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,189
Dad.

550
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,691
Dad, who is this woman?

551
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,154
-You have a girlfriend?
-Well… You see…

552
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,575
She's not my girlfriend.
It's a blind date.

553
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,202
What? A blind date?

554
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,496
Hey, why are you doing this?

555
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,249
Even I don't go on blind dates.
Why would an old guy like you go on one?

556
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,169
You just got divorced too.

557
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,379
It's actually been a while, okay?

558
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,757
It's been four years already.

559
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,009
-Sure, brag about it.
-I wasn't bragging.

560
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,385
You think I wanted a divorce?

561
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,346
Later on, you might get divorced too…

562
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,098
-Gosh, I'm sorry.
-Are you trying to curse me?

563
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,225
Are you really my dad?

564
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,727
-You're so annoying.
-Eun-jeong.

565
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,271
I…

566
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,400
Goodness, I apologize.

567
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,487
Let's talk again next time.
I'll be in touch, Hong-ran.

568
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,906
What? Hold on.

569
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,823
Hong-ran?

570
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,451
I'm Ha-neul.

571
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,246
-Sorry?
-What?

572
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,830
What?

573
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:32,800
Damn it.

574
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,930
Hey. I can't believe this.

575
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,142
I asked our nurse if she knew
any blind date candidates,

576
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,395
and she thought
I was asking for one by mistake.

577
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,106
-So that guy thought it was me.
-Forget it.

578
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,818
What's his deal? He showed up to see you.
He wanted to ask you something.

579
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,113
-Ask me? Ask me what?
-How would I know?

580
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,365
Then, how would I know?
I've never met him.

581
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,951
Hey, is he cute?

582
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,744
Find out for yourself if you're curious.

583
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,582
Jeez, I regret buying this dress
and wasting my time for this date.

584
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,500
Yeah, you're all dressed up.

585
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,588
It'd be a waste to just go home.
Want to go somewhere nice and have wine?

586
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,339
I'll pay for everything.

587
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,509
-Really?
-You bet.

588
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,637
Hang on.

589
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,807
It's an emergency. Bye.

590
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,394
Yes, I'm coming.

591
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,937
Unbelievable.

592
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,484
Did she go on the blind date yet?

593
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,904
Should I call her?

594
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,077
MY SMART DAUGHTER

595
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,498
Never mind.
She'll come home once she's done.

596
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:49,835
Goodness!

597
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,045
SUK-JA

598
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,757
Jeez, why is she calling me?

599
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,260
Hello, Suk-ja. It's been a while.

600
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,013
Wol-seon, did Ha-neul quit her job?

601
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,849
How did you know?

602
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,768
The thing is

603
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,605
Mi-ja and I are in Seoul for a wedding.

604
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,983
The venue was right next
to Ha-neul's hospital,

605
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:18,113
so we visited thinking
she could treat us to some coffee.

606
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,865
But they said she quit.

607
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,326
Well, you see…

608
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,203
You should've called her first.

609
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,246
Goodness, never mind.

610
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,706
Let's talk at your house.

611
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,999
I'll be there in five.

612
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,210
What? Five minutes?

613
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,128
Goodness! What should I do?

614
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,256
Gosh, what do I do?

615
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,180
Jeong-woo.

616
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,936
That little… Jeong-woo.

617
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,897
Jeong-woo!

618
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,607
What do you want?

619
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:58,195
What? That's no way to greet your friend.
Plus, I just came back from a blind date.

620
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,990
Isn't asking me how it went
the polite thing to do?

621
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm not the polite type.
I'm not that curious either.

622
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,078
Jeez.

623
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,288
It didn't go well.

624
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,586
The date was a flop.

625
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,798
-What?
-Jeez.

626
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,308
Why was it a flop?

627
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,020
What happened?

628
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,523
How's business here?

629
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,151
In Busan, there are tons
of milmyeon restaurants,

630
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,279
but none could hold a candle
to Tae-seon's noodles.

631
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,196
That's true.

632
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,032
Here are your noodles.

633
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,201
Goodness.

634
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,663
-Thank you, Tae-seon.
-My pleasure.

635
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,832
This looks delicious.

636
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,919
By the way,
why did Ha-neul quit such a great job?

637
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,839
I doubt she quit willingly.

638
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,801
She was probably shunned
after failing to become a professor.

639
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,095
It's not like that.

640
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,681
She was just exhausted,
so she's taking a break.

641
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,142
Well, what a lucky girl.

642
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,352
She can even take a break.

643
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:16,231
I heard you had to jump through hoops
to become a professor.

644
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,108
You think there's time for rest?

645
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:25,157
Goodness, our dear Ha-neul
must be extremely naive. Right?

646
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,536
Or she's too weak to endure things.

647
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,746
What the hell?

648
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,793
Goodness, I spilled the broth.

649
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,379
Have some of this too.

650
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:41,924
Okay.

651
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,595
Well, since she's not working,

652
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,889
she might as well find
a decent guy to marry.

653
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,684
Gosh, not everyone can get married.
Who would like her personality?

654
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,354
What's wrong with Ha-neul?

655
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,563
Do you really not know?

656
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,483
She loves to brag, and she's inflexible.

657
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,652
She's arrogant too. Gosh.

658
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:05,239
She's not the type that men usually like.

659
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,574
She's single too, right?

660
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,578
No, she's not!
She's even on a date right now.

661
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,748
He's a plastic surgeon
who's just as successful as she is.

662
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,834
To be honest, she quit work
to prepare for her wedding.

663
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,712
-What?
-Wedding?

664
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,925
Wol-seon, I'm a bit busy.
Can you steam the dumplings?

665
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:25,926
Sure.

666
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:28,804
Goodness.

667
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,681
Ha-neul is getting married?

668
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,350
-Why did you say that nonsense?
-I don't know.

669
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,060
I must be insane.

670
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,062
What do I do?

671
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,232
Gosh, isn't that Ha-neul?

672
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,445
Goodness, she really is with a guy.

673
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,241
Holy cow. How could that happen?

674
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,661
Why do you look so excited?
Are you happy that my date flopped?

675
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,663
-No, that's not why.
-Goodness!

676
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,498
Ha-neul!

677
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,292
You're finally here!

678
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,794
Hello, Aunt Suk-ja. What brings you here?

679
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:04,590
We were in Seoul for something
and decided to drop by.

680
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,759
Goodness. Hello.

681
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,221
I heard you're a plastic surgeon.

682
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,182
Yes, I am.

683
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,604
So Wol-seon was right, wasn't she?

684
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,564
Goodness. Please come in.

685
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,024
-Sorry?
-Let's chat inside.

686
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,609
-Ha-neul, come in.
-No, I…

687
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,485
All right.

688
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,987
No, you see…

689
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,447
Over here.

690
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,865
-Sorry?
-Sit down.

691
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,408
You can sit here, Ha-neul.

692
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:38,040
Goodness. I can't believe
we get to meet Ha-neul's boyfriend.

693
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,917
Gosh, you're so handsome!

694
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,212
So? I heard you're getting married soon.

695
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,298
-What?
-What do you mean?

696
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,053
No, he's just my friend.

697
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,638
-That's right.
-Just a friend?

698
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,266
Your mom said you went out
to meet a plastic surgeon.

699
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:57,934
Oh, that?

700
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,855
I did have a blind date today,
but it didn't work out.

701
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,899
What?

702
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:08,987
Then, he's just a friend,
and she went on a blind date today.

703
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,115
So the whole marriage thing was a lie?

704
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,620
Well, you see…

705
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,000
I finally get it.

706
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,713
You were so proud
that your daughter was a doctor.

707
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,967
Imagine how humiliating it must be
now that she's jobless like Ba-da.

708
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,761
Right? I get it.

709
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,471
You were lying.

710
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,558
Goodness, of course.

711
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,937
You packed up and went to Seoul
so she could get into HNU's med school.

712
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,647
But she didn't get in.

713
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,359
Then, you bragged about her
becoming a doctor at a big hospital,

714
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,778
but even that went down the drain.

715
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,988
What'll you do now?

716
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,365
Hey.

717
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,866
Mr. Just a Friend.

718
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,788
Then, why did you lie
about being a plastic surgeon?

719
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,165
-Because I am.
-What?

720
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,836
Then, does that mean
you can give us a discount?

721
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,755
I was actually planning
on getting my eyes redone.

722
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,050
Hey, your eyes are already so beautiful.

723
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,552
You don't need surgery.

724
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,762
Let's just get Botox instead.

725
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,639
Goodness, Suk-ja.

726
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,892
We already look so young.
We don't need Botox.

727
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,729
Come on. Tell us how much work we need.

728
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,988
Then, I'll be as honest as I can
since you're Ha-neul's aunts.

729
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,573
All right.

730
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,824
I'll start with you, ma'am.

731
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,037
Given how old you are,
your face has aged quite a bit.

732
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,458
Your double eyelids were thick, right?
But you can barely see them now.

733
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,919
It's because your skin
is aging and sagging.

734
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,298
But getting something minor done
won't solve the problem.

735
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,300
You need major eye surgery.

736
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,218
What? Major?

737
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,053
Yes. As for you, ma'am…

738
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,767
I see. You got fillers
for your smile lines, didn't you?

739
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,481
But those fillers have spread out
and are creating more wrinkles.

740
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,901
What's even more serious
is those saggy, bulldog-like cheeks.

741
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:15,363
Gosh, you'll need a complete facelift.

742
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,284
It needs to be lifted as much as possible
to fix the saggy skin and wrinkles.

743
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:23,163
You think a few tweaks will make you
look a decade younger, right?

744
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,081
No, there's no chance.

745
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,167
You won't even look six months younger.

746
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,253
Normally, people say
plastic surgery is reconstruction.

747
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,799
But you two will need
a full redevelopment.

748
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,008
Young man!

749
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,927
How dare you bad-mouth our faces?

750
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,637
Hold on. "Bad-mouth"?

751
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,139
You asked him how much work you needed.

752
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,643
So he was providing medical consultation,
not bad-mouthing you.

753
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,020
And let me say this
since we're on the topic.

754
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:51,399
Before you consider Botox for your faces,
you should think and speak more kindly

755
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,527
and frown less.

756
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,614
They say inner beauty matters more
than outer beauty as you age.

757
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,784
All right. Good for you.

758
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,537
Is that why you were shunned
by your hospital?

759
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,919
Gosh, Suk-ja. Let's go.

760
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,046
Let's go. Come on, Suk-ja.

761
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,382
-That's enough. Let's go.
-Let go of me.

762
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,009
Let's go.

763
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,261
Goodness.

764
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,805
-That'll be 23,000 won.
-We barely had any.

765
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,224
I guess it didn't suit your tastes.

766
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,309
You still need to pay 23,000 won.

767
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,172
Hello, did you look over
that case report you received at court?

768
00:52:56,256 --> 00:53:00,635
Yes, we got in touch with the writer,
and they'll appear in court if needed.

769
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,639
You'll have an advantage in court
since we found a similar case.

770
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,557
That's a relief.

771
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,852
Right. Have you looked into Dr. Kang?

772
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,979
We're keeping a close eye on that.

773
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,023
Just wait a little bit more.

774
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:16,401
All right. Thank you. Goodbye.

775
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,329
Jeong-woo.

776
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,790
What is it?

777
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,337
-What is that?
-Let's have a drink.

778
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:39,341
Jeez, I told myself
I wouldn't waste time on nonsense.

779
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,967
Why is she doing this to me?

780
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,850
I can't believe you're mixing them.

781
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,229
I've ruined my life,
so I need to drink all the alcohol I can.

782
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,943
Why would you say that?
Is this because of your aunts?

783
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,612
That too.

784
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,239
I'm depressed and unemployed.

785
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,785
I'm so unlucky that my blind date
even had a teenage daughter.

786
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,125
This crushed can reminds me of my life.

787
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,546
Hey, I should drink more
than you if that's the case.

788
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,550
-My life's been crushed more than yours.
-That's not true. My life's worse.

789
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,844
Jeez, you're being so competitive again.

790
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,976
I'm always exhausted because of you.

791
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,560
Here's a sneak peek into my life.

792
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,774
Here you go.

793
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,444
My life is worse.

794
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,449
Fine. Let's find out
whose life is worse tonight.

795
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,577
I won't lose.
Ruining my life's my specialty.

796
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,012
Gosh, I really don't know.

797
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,891
-Don't know what?
-Just…

798
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,728
I told myself I'd start having fun.

799
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,732
That's why I went on that blind date
and shopped for clothes.

800
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,109
But it wasn't fun at all.

801
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,655
I feel so pathetic right now.

802
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,615
I hate myself.

803
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,414
Do I sound too depressed?

804
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,708
Yes.

805
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,795
You do. You're definitely depressed.

806
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,380
Hey.

807
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,758
Is it a sin to be depressed?

808
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,052
-No.
-No!

809
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,887
Right?

810
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,556
Does everyone have to be
bright and cheerful?

811
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,310
I'm choosing to be sad,
so why does it matter?

812
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,728
Exactly. Hey.

813
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,814
Don't worry about others
and just be depressed.

814
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,862
But I don't want that either.

815
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,075
Then, what do you want?

816
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,369
I don't know.

817
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,748
It's so hard to even please myself.

818
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,961
Even if it wasn't
a life full of happiness,

819
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,380
I just wanted a decent life.

820
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:25,799
Hey.

821
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,927
You can do just that.

822
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,138
Really?

823
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,433
You really think I can work again?

824
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,102
Of course!

825
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,896
I give you my word.

826
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:42,982
Why?

827
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,861
How are you so sure? What is it?

828
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,405
Do you have a job referral for me?

829
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,202
-No.
-Damn it.

830
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,830
-Hey.
-What?

831
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:02,127
Submit your résumé
on that job site for doctors.

832
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,507
You're right! I can do that.

833
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,426
Hey, I'm going to write a résumé. Okay?

834
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,719
But before that!

835
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,933
We're out of alcohol.

836
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,896
Running out of alcohol midway
is so annoying.

837
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,232
However…

838
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,150
"However"?

839
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,277
We have a secret weapon.

840
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,155
-What is it?
-In my room…

841
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,494
I have whiskey!

842
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,042
Let's drink it.

843
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,090
Wait here.

844
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,759
Hey, be careful.

845
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,094
I won't be long.

846
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:27,921
Damn it.

847
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,090
Why is it suddenly raining?

848
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,384
Then, what about this?

849
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:38,056
We can drink under an umbrella!

850
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,620
When are you going to bed?

851
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,165
After you do.

852
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:09,254
I see. After I do.

853
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,507
After I do…

854
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,483
She's a habitual offender.

855
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,445
She just falls asleep anywhere.

856
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,585
I wasn't going to think about this.

857
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,429
I shouldn't think about it.

858
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:13,503
STANDARD PLASTIC SURGERY

859
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,324
"Zero, five, four"?
What area code is that?

860
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,578
Hello?

861
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,998
Yes, this is Nam Ha-neul.

862
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,214
What?

863
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,811
-Hey!
-What?

864
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,187
I'm in huge trouble.

865
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,900
I was drunk yesterday and sent
my résumé to a medical center in Hwabon.

866
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,863
What? Hwabon?
As in North Gyeongsang Province?

867
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,450
Yeah, it was
for the Chief of Anesthesiology position.

868
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,660
And they want me for an interview.

869
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,579
What?

870
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,836
Coffee.

871
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,504
Thanks.

872
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,175
So tell me.

873
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:44,802
What's your plan?

874
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,307
I'm not sure. What should I do?

875
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,519
That place is so far away,
and you won't know anyone there,

876
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,813
so wouldn't it be hard on your own?

877
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,068
Plus, you didn't think it through
before applying.

878
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,987
You did it impulsively while drunk.

879
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,285
Take your time.

880
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,414
I wish I could.

881
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,460
But I can't help but feel impatient.

882
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,589
Work has been so tough for me lately.

883
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,677
Even if I do exactly what they wanted,
some patients complain about the outcome.

884
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,931
They'd file complaints.
Now, I'm just going through the motions…

885
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,557
To be honest,

886
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,520
rather than figuring out
if I liked my date or not,

887
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,064
I felt pitiful for being unable to relate.

888
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,533
I was envious of my friend who had a job.

889
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,118
All right. Good for you.

890
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,914
Is that why you were shunned
by your hospital?

891
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,123
Gosh, Suk-ja. Let's go.

892
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,918
-Her words cut deep.
-Let's go.

893
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,713
That's how far my self-esteem had fallen.

894
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,595
Thanks for the coffee.

895
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,224
Rest up.

896
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:17,895
And your interview outfit?

897
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,026
-Don't you need my help to pick them out?
-What?

898
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,153
Do the interview.

899
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:33,494
They say when someone asks you for advice,
they've already made up their mind.

900
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:40,042
No matter where you go, you'll do great.

901
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:56,893
Hwabon?

902
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,979
-You're going all the way there to work?
-Yes.

903
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:04,191
It's not a bad idea to start afresh
in a completely new place.

904
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,111
But still,

905
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,530
returning to your hospital
after resting a bit more--

906
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:12,033
How can she? She beat up her professor.

907
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,205
Before I beat you up,
just shut it and eat.

908
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:21,542
How can I? I need to open it to eat.

909
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:27,006
Anyway, just know I'm going
to the interview tomorrow.

910
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,676
They said it was just a formality
and I'd likely get the job.

911
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,762
So it's safe to say I'm leaving soon.

912
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,812
Gosh, why is she in such a rush?

913
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,441
Is it because of what her aunts said?

914
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:48,027
Why did you have to lie
and rub salt in her wound?

915
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,197
Damn it, I know. I'm out of my mind!

916
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,115
This is all my fault!

917
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:54,867
What's with you, Mom?

918
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,370
You cry so easily nowadays.

919
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,289
Ha-neul's depressed.
And are you going through menopause?

920
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,005
I guess it's not that.

921
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,134
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

922
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,886
-Be safe.
-Okay.

923
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,137
Don't skip your meals.

924
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,055
I won't.

925
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:18,933
Go on in.

926
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,611
SURPRISE SALE!

927
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,031
He hasn't wished me luck on my interview.

928
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,535
What kind of friend is he? Jeez.

929
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,997
NAM HA-NEUL

930
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,541
Good luck with your interview.

931
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,718
Be safe.

932
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,140
Jeong-woo.

933
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,644
Kyung-min! What suddenly brings you here?

934
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,896
I haven't visited at all
after you moved in.

935
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,190
It's not bad.

936
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,026
Jeez.

937
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,988
-I thought we could grab some food.
-Then, you should've called.

938
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,323
So tell me.

939
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:19,660
-What are you buying?
-What do you want to eat?

940
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,163
-There is something I want.
-What? Gukbap?

941
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,457
-Yeah.
-Why are you so surprised?

942
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,750
You must be psychic!

943
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,126
-Let's go.
-Okay.

944
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,675
Right. I heard Ha-neul gave you
a dissertation at your hearing.

945
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,847
The victim had taken warfarin
for over six months.

946
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:40,765
Right.

947
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:44,268
But there was a case in India
where a patient also had taken warfarin

948
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:47,313
and died during surgery
due to excessive bleeding.

949
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,192
Gosh, Ha-neul is impressive.

950
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:53,360
She must've searched
a long time to find that.

951
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,445
Tell me about it.

952
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:00,367
Gosh, she had so much potential.
I feel bad for her.

953
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:04,497
She lacks social skills,
so she didn't have many close colleagues.

954
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,625
It seems like she looked
for a job in a rural area.

955
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:10,461
How did you know that?

956
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:13,047
I know the director of that clinic.

957
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,676
-I got a call this morning about Ha-neul.
-And so?

958
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,722
So I told the truth.
I said she had issues with her professor.

959
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,226
Afterwards, I think they asked
others about her too.

960
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:29,647
They said she kicked her professor
and didn't get along with her colleagues.

961
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,108
They're afraid of Professor Kim
and didn't defend her.

962
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,235
But why did you say that?

963
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,321
I just said the truth.

964
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:39,865
Then, you should've told the entire story.

965
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,992
He stole her dissertation, bullied her,

966
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,537
and took the research funds
and her severance pay.

967
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,039
Hey, what's wrong with you?

968
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,335
She was so excited to go there.

969
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,213
Hey.

970
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,952
RAILROAD CROSSING

971
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,378
Hello, I just arrived.

972
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,214
I'm so sorry, Dr. Nam.

973
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,841
You don't have to
come in today for the interview.

974
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,344
Sorry? Why all of a sudden…

975
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:36,899
HWABON STATION

976
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,702
Our director looked into
your history a bit.

977
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:52,289
He doesn't think you would be
a good fit for our hospital.

978
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:21,944
Hey, Jeong-woo.

979
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,196
I couldn't do the interview.

980
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,411
I think

981
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,580
I've lived my life wrong.

982
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,548
What are you doing here?

983
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,844
You didn't live your life wrong.

984
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,558
It's not your fault.

985
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,024
I came here to tell you this.

986
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:05,339
EPILOGUE

987
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,927
DOCTOR SLUMP

988
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,556
What do you want to do
if you can go back to being a student?

989
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,350
I'd like to give you a hug.

990
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,185
Are you sure that you won't feel a thing

991
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,729
even if you spent the night
at a hotel together?

992
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,064
Confess, my foot.

993
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,691
I told you we were friends.

994
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,318
I have no right to be happy.

995
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:09,987
I missed you.

996
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,949
You care about me, right?

997
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:17,119
Stay with me.

998
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:25,627
