00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,994
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,927
My uncle has been making
milmyeon for 20 years now.

3
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,265
After his military service, he agreed
to work at my dad's fish cake factory,

4
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,311
but no one knows why
he had a sudden change of heart.

5
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,819
Ba-da has been pretty persistent lately.

6
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,197
Why am I chopping cucumber at night?

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,909
Why am I spending
my Friday nights making broth now?

8
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,288
I have to do it.

9
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,665
But of course, I'm not sure

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,793
how long he'll last.

11
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,551
By the way,

12
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,223
is Ha-neul still jobless
and lounging around at home?

13
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,309
I haven't heard any news, so I guess so.

14
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,604
Gosh, so what if she was a doctor?
She's jobless and stuck at home now.

15
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,022
Exactly.

16
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,359
Wol-seon used to always brag
about Ha-neul becoming a professor.

17
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,863
Goodness, I bet she'll come today
looking all dispirited again.

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:59,202
When I think about how depressed
she's going to look, it breaks my heart.

19
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,496
Goodness, I'm worried too.

20
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:46,166
As for my mom,
she's never been prouder in her life.

21
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,840
I can't believe you want to make
alcohol on our first date.

22
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,174
Why not?

23
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,343
Once we have this brewed and fermented,

24
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,848
imagine how nice it would be to drink it
with some grilled beef brisket.

25
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,726
You said it'll take three months, right?

26
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,854
Then, we can drink this
on our 100th day together.

27
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,024
Why would we celebrate that?
We're not kids.

28
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,276
Why not? I want to celebrate every moment.

29
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
I'll treat you well.

30
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,822
I'll always call
and buy you good food to eat.

31
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,866
And I'll carry anything
that's heavy for you.

32
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,993
I'm going to protect you.

33
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,370
You're so ridiculous.

34
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,253
How can someone drink
from a bottle so elegantly?

35
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,466
-That was so beautiful.
-What are you talking about?

36
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,719
-Right. I have a question.
-What is it?

37
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,638
Have you always been this beautiful?

38
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,056
Seriously.

39
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,058
-Hong-ran started dating again.
-Stop it.

40
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,769
-Stop asking odd questions.
-And she realized something.

41
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,774
Being in love was like waiting
for plum wine to ferment.

42
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,401
They're both wonderful things.

43
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,532
Everyone was living their lives,

44
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,662
and I was slowly walking
down my path as well.

45
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,142
"I wonder what kind of scene
awaits me around this corner."

46
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,437
"Am I truly okay now?"

47
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,235
These were the questions I'd ask myself.

48
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,320
DOCTOR SLUMP

49
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,433
All right.

50
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,934
Give it a taste.

51
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,148
-It's the first milmyeon I've ever made.
-Goodness.

52
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,360
Did you chop the cucumbers
and make the sauce yourself?

53
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,278
Of course.

54
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,488
I also made the broth and the noodles.

55
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,075
I should take a photo.

56
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,244
Ba-da's first milmyeon!

57
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,042
All right, dig in already.
It'll get soggy.

58
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,084
Okay.

59
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,762
It tastes pretty similar to yours.

60
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,846
-Right?
-Yeah.

61
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,394
It's not bad.

62
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,938
My goodness!

63
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,400
I can't believe this.

64
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,027
Why are you crying?

65
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,571
I'm pretty sure
it doesn't taste that good.

66
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,866
I'm just proud of him.

67
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,867
What?

68
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,661
Why are you being dramatic
over some milmyeon?

69
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,914
Did your depression get worse?

70
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,540
You little…

71
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,836
I heard you helped Uncle Tae-seon
every day so you could make this.

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,923
Have you ever been
this persistent with anything before?

73
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:22,965
No.

74
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,718
He quit Taekwondo after three days.

75
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,346
He quit art academy after three days.

76
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,475
He quit on the civil service exam
before the workbook he ordered even came.

77
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,392
Exactly.

78
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,980
He was the epitome of serial quitting.

79
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,444
But that same kid made this food
with patience and persistence.

80
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,865
Ba-da.

81
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,578
I'm just glad you kept working hard
to learn and achieve something.

82
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,580
That's what we wanted as well.

83
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:59,335
Think about what you really want
to do in life while working here.

84
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,464
Yes, and I'll help in any way I can too.

85
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,931
It's delicious.

86
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,185
I'm back.

87
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,520
Come on in.

88
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,063
-Sorry I'm late.
-Quick. It's okay.

89
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,358
-Try this.
-Okay. It looks good.

90
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,035
-How is it? Be honest.
-What?

91
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,580
Is this a new dish?

92
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,168
It does taste a bit different.

93
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,503
In what way?

94
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,924
It's a bit bland.

95
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,929
And maybe it's because I was late,
but the noodles are slightly soggy.

96
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,598
And…

97
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,568
What's wrong?

98
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,070
-Don't eat it.
-Sorry?

99
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,281
What?

100
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,408
Uncle Tae-seon.

101
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,160
Where are you going?

102
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,078
-Let's step outside.
-What's wrong?

103
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,497
-I said let's go.
-Ba-da.

104
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,207
-Come on out.
-Wait, I…

105
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,750
-What's going on?
-Come on.

106
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,126
Did I do something wrong?

107
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,840
Really?

108
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,678
Ba-da really made that milmyeon?

109
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,056
The Ba-da I know? Ba-da, your brother?

110
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,935
Yes, it seems he's worked
really hard to learn.

111
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,313
When I saw the finished product,

112
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,483
I cried like a fool, because it seemed
like he'd finally grown up.

113
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:50,613
Gosh, and I criticized his precious dish.
No wonder I got kicked out.

114
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,408
Honestly, I was frustrated
to see him slack off all this time.

115
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,454
But to see him be responsible
and achieve something, it made me proud.

116
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,291
-That's one less worry for me.
-Right.

117
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,420
-Then, what about my worry?
-What?

118
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,423
I asked you to be my family,

119
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,925
but you still haven't answered me.

120
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,011
I didn't have a chance to tell you then.

121
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,263
You know what happened.

122
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,370
Ba-da.

123
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,373
What's this?

124
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,591
Are you feeling shy
about getting your very first paycheck?

125
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,843
No, that's not why.

126
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,721
You suddenly gave me
an envelope full of money.

127
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,015
I'm not sure if I should take it.

128
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,350
Why are you suddenly acting all mature?

129
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,811
You used to always ask me for 50,000 won.

130
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,607
Use it wisely. Don't waste it all
on alcohol and video games.

131
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,025
That's for me to decide.

132
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,530
And who pays their workers these days
with envelopes? You're so old-fashioned.

133
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,742
Bye.

134
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,369
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

135
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,500
My baby.

136
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,467
What are you doing?

137
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,844
Why are you nuzzling that envelope?

138
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,013
Did you get a letter from a girl you like?

139
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,016
Who writes letters these days?
That's old-fashioned.

140
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,685
-Jeez.
-There are so many old people around me.

141
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,190
Ha-neul, let's go eat some meat.

142
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,983
I'm full from the milmyeon.

143
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,903
Let's still go. I want to buy you some.

144
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,945
Buy me some?

145
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,032
It's your treat?

146
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,159
-Yes.
-Say it again.

147
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,995
You're buying,
not asking me to buy for you?

148
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,624
Well, it's awkward for me too
since I've never treated you to anything.

149
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,836
Let's hurry! They're going to close soon.

150
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,754
Hey.

151
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,589
Is this a dream?

152
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,343
Am I being scammed? Are you really Ba-da?

153
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,178
Are you sure this isn't a mask?

154
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,639
-Something smells fishy.
-It's me.

155
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,183
-Let's go.
-Goodness.

156
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,602
HANYANG HWARO

157
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,025
How's the beef your brother bought
with his first paycheck?

158
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,652
It's so delicious.

159
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,780
I never imagined
that this day would ever come.

160
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,865
Me neither.

161
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,909
Who knew I'd become such a great adult?

162
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,287
Eat up.

163
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,958
All I ever did was take money from you,

164
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,377
but I've always wanted
to treat you at least once.

165
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,171
Why just once? You should do this often.

166
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,424
I'll think about it.

167
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,260
Why? Don't just talk the talk.
Walk the walk too.

168
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,221
I'm already treating you today, so eat up.

169
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,139
Just eat.

170
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
I'm so full. I can't eat anymore.

171
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,436
Here's the food you ordered.

172
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,520
Thank you.

173
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,525
-What's that?
-It's for Mom and Uncle Tae-seon.

174
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,610
Here. Let me pay.

175
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,529
No, I said I'd pay.

176
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,322
But take a photo of me paying.

177
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,493
Make it seem like I've always done this.
You know, like a paparazzi shot.

178
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,578
Fine.

179
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,621
Jeez.

180
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,593
I wasn't rejected, was I?

181
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,513
I proposed to her,

182
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,142
but it's been days,
and she hasn't answered me.

183
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,896
She hasn't responded in any way.

184
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,524
Didn't I tell you it was too soon?

185
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,486
What'll you do now?

186
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,363
She must've felt too unsure
to give you an answer.

187
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,285
I guess you're okay for dating

188
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,786
but not for marriage.

189
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,206
What are you talking about?
That's not true.

190
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,791
Hey, that's not up to you to decide.

191
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,502
It's up to her.

192
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,129
And think about it.

193
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,466
Wouldn't she have already replied
if you were husband material?

194
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,594
My goodness.

195
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,764
What?

196
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,060
I wonder what she doesn't like about you.

197
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,854
Let's fight.

198
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,774
-Let's fight to the death.
-You can't even get married

199
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,109
-Okay. Let's dig your grave today.
-Fine then.

200
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,573
The NI patient is here.

201
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,908
Okay, I'll get ready.

202
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,079
But you could've just messaged me
instead of coming all the way here.

203
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:50,996
Well…

204
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,750
She's been odd since consultations,
so I wanted to double-check.

205
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,127
Odd? How so?

206
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:01,674
She's changed her mind several times,
and I think she's been secretly recording.

207
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,843
She also reeked of alcohol
during consultations.

208
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,679
Nevertheless,

209
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,390
as long as she gets results
that satisfy her, it'll be fine.

210
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,724
You know me.

211
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,977
I never nick blood vessels with a scalpel.

212
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,980
My hands are so careful and quick.
They move at mach speed.

213
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,524
I had no idea. Anyway, good luck.

214
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,405
That little punk.

215
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,619
Good morning, everyone.
Let's give it our best today too.

216
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,459
I'm going make a new sketch of the design

217
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,254
from your consultation
with more exact measurements.

218
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,049
I don't want to go under the knife again,
so please make this my last one.

219
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,175
You can count on me.

220
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,761
-Administer 0.5 ml of ketamine.
-Yes, Doctor.

221
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,679
GV.

222
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,943
Right. Are you ready for next week's
morbidity and mortality conference?

223
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,862
Not yet. It's a bit tricky.

224
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,115
Send me the rough draft
of your presentation and I'll check.

225
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,700
Thank you, Professor!

226
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,412
We have many ill patients,
so assess them and tell me tomorrow.

227
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,623
-Yes, Professor.
-Bye.

228
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,212
BOYFRIEND

229
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,924
Are you in surgery? Don't skip your meals.

230
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,312
Hey.

231
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,358
Hey, Jeong-woo.
Want to have dinner together tonight?

232
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,402
I'd love that. Think about what you want.

233
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,906
I'll think about it
and make a reservation too.

234
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,033
A reservation?

235
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,663
Let's have some steak
while overlooking the Han River.

236
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,540
All of a sudden?

237
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,920
Well, I have something to tell you.

238
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,630
See you later then.

239
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,930
See? I'm okay not just for dating.

240
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,308
Goodness.

241
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,559
I'm so amazing.

242
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,565
Okay. Make it comfortable

243
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,317
and simple.

244
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,869
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, Dr. Nam.

245
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,872
Are you free right now?
Can we have some tea?

246
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,040
Sure, come on in.

247
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,217
A view of the river and wine…

248
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,638
It's a perfect night
for hearing an answer.

249
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,351
Jeong-woo.

250
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,228
Hey.

251
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,443
This place is really nice.
When did you come here?

252
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,779
Do you think I've been here before?
I looked it up for us.

253
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,450
You looked this place up
and reserved a table?

254
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,829
What could you possibly have to tell me?

255
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,289
Well…

256
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,917
Should we eat something first?

257
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,304
Gosh.

258
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm too nervous to eat.

259
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,559
Can you just tell me
what you want to say right now?

260
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,021
-What?
-I'm about to suffocate to death.

261
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
Well…

262
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,321
I was actually going to give you
an answer about the ring.

263
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,949
No, there's nothing to answer
since I feel the same way as you do.

264
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,076
But…

265
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,079
Something unexpected happened.

266
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
Unexpected?

267
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,085
My chief wants me
to spend six months abroad.

268
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,712
What?

269
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,840
We're opening
a new children's hospital next year.

270
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,051
He wants me to visit
other hospitals overseas

271
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,261
and check out
their anesthesiology departments.

272
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,763
Right.

273
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,680
Hold on.

274
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,183
What do you want to do?

275
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,227
Well…

276
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,563
To be honest, I think it'd be fun.

277
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,358
I'm curious, and I think it'll help.

278
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,444
Then, what's stopping you?

279
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,615
Still, I feel bad about telling you

280
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,700
that we need to be apart for six months

281
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,036
when you had just proposed to me.

282
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,081
I feel bad for leaving you here.

283
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,624
Ha-neul.

284
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,712
I want you to always follow your heart.

285
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,093
If there's a certain decision
you need to make,

286
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,513
I don't want you
to hesitate because of me.

287
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,395
I told you. I won't get in the way
of your career.

288
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,649
So don't worry about me

289
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,359
and go.

290
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,155
Jeong-woo.

291
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,913
-What are you doing?
-What?

292
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,584
Oh, the steak was over here.

293
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,169
Eat up.

294
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,879
-It'll get cold.
-Okay.

295
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,505
So when are you leaving?

296
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,216
It was a pretty abrupt decision.

297
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,469
So I need to leave soon. It's next month.

298
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,513
Next month?

299
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,933
I'm thirsty.

300
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,185
That's a vase!

301
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,230
There are too many glasses here.

302
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,403
I bet others made the same mistake, right?

303
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,740
You got a great offer.

304
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,535
Congratulations.

305
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,703
Thanks.

306
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,497
It's such a great offer.

307
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,127
I'm so happy for you.

308
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,553
He seems okay
but not okay at the same time.

309
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,682
Gosh.

310
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,228
What? Six months?

311
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,231
Are you kidding me?
How can I wait for six months?

312
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,690
Even three months is long.

313
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,027
One month is long too.
I mean, a day. No, just don't go!

314
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,945
Why?

315
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,821
Damn it!

316
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,202
I thought things were finally
looking up for us after those ordeals.

317
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,955
No!

318
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,539
Don't go. Why?

319
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,624
Why?

320
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,667
Please don't go!

321
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,669
Please!

322
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,575
Hey, Jeong-woo!

323
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,037
Hey, wait up!

324
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,546
You punk.

325
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,883
I almost didn't make it.

326
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,888
-What's wrong? What's with your face?
-What about it?

327
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,391
You've looked really troubled these days.

328
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,643
What's wrong?
Did Ha-neul end up rejecting you?

329
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,270
No, she didn't.

330
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:57,149
Then, what? Did you invest in stocks
with your compensation but they plummeted?

331
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,737
-Did you fall for a real estate scam?
-Please just leave and let me be!

332
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,655
Leave? How?

333
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,658
Excuse me! Please open up!

334
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,494
Please just leave!

335
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,495
How do I leave?

336
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,332
Hey, wait up.

337
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,000
What in the world is it?

338
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,461
Did one of your patients file a complaint?

339
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,837
Dr. Bin Dae-yeong!

340
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,682
You're Ms. Oh Ji-eun, right?
What brings you here so early?

341
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,101
What are you going to do about my eyes?

342
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:38,023
You promised to make me
look pretty, but they're uneven!

343
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,734
They're not uneven, ma'am.

344
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,736
Don't lie. I knew you'd deny it.

345
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,196
Look.

346
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,700
This side is 3 mm,
but this side is 3.1 mm.

347
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,369
You're responsible for ruining my life!

348
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,040
I went to an audition
like this yesterday, and I failed.

349
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,418
Ma'am, I already explained everything.

350
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,297
Due to your asymmetrical face
and different eye sizes,

351
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,592
your eyelids will naturally look uneven
even if they were the same size.

352
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,095
And it's only been five days,

353
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,806
so the swelling might make it look uneven.

354
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,975
Give it some time.
If you're still unhappy, I'll redo--

355
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,103
No, thank you.

356
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,188
I can't believe I trusted a quack.

357
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,358
It seems you've been drinking.
Maybe you should come back next time--

358
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,567
You.

359
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,152
I want a refund right now,

360
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,822
and take responsibility
for my failed audition.

361
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,449
Why must I take responsibility for that?

362
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,743
Let's be honest.

363
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,663
You should've put off surgery
if the audition was so important.

364
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,374
Being stubborn like this
after I explained it all--

365
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,127
Stubborn? How dare you say that
after ruining my life?

366
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,129
Move!

367
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,005
-Ma'am.
-You little…

368
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,383
Ma'am!

369
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,221
What are you doing?

370
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,473
Please don't, ma'am!

371
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,837
I can't believe she saw that.

372
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,715
I'm sure she's disappointed in me.

373
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,218
I said I'd protect her,

374
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,637
but she protected me instead.

375
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,266
Gosh, I'm such an idiot.

376
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,314
Come in.

377
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,610
I heard the news.

378
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,070
-Has word spread already?
-Yes.

379
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,616
Everyone said she was odd
from the start and tried to dissuade you.

380
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:56,286
I only wanted to do
as many surgeries as we could.

381
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,456
The procedure went well,
so there's nothing to worry about.

382
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,877
But stop being too kind,
and don't take patients who seem off.

383
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,503
Fine.

384
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,881
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

385
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,841
What is this?

386
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,636
-I wish you well even without me.
-You're resigning?

387
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,680
Did I upset you in any way?

388
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,390
You did in many ways.

389
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,767
Hold on.

390
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,353
Don't tell me you're quitting

391
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,522
because I have a girlfriend
but you have feelings for me.

392
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,441
What kind of crazy nonsense is that?

393
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,734
Crazy nonsense?

394
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,611
You said last time

395
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,322
feelings for me could develop
if we were stuck on an island.

396
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,908
That's why the other nurses gasped.

397
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,326
I only said that

398
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,996
to help you out since things between you
and Dr. Lee were so lukewarm.

399
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:45,168
I disgraced my family when I fell
and accidentally kissed you.

400
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,670
Well, then…

401
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,590
are you quitting to restore
your family's honor or something?

402
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,758
That's not why.

403
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,219
-I'm going to travel.
-Travel?

404
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:58,598
It's been my dream
to spend all my money traveling the world.

405
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,143
I want to do it before it gets too late.

406
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,730
Is that so?

407
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,775
I'm leaving to pursue my happiness.

408
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,988
Goodbye, Dr. Bin!

409
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:30,255
LA BEAUTE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

410
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,931
Are you okay?

411
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,726
No, I'm not.

412
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,772
A patient filed a complaint,
and Hong-ran witnessed it.

413
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,317
And on top of that, Nurse Do resigned.

414
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,653
-What?
-I got all the bad news at once.

415
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:58,783
I was only able to come this far
because Nurse Do took care everything.

416
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,037
I relied on her a lot,
so I'm sad to let her go.

417
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,415
Then, I'm sure you'll miss her a lot.

418
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,502
You should try to make her stay.

419
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,254
I doubt she'll listen.

420
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,840
I wouldn't feel good even if she stayed.

421
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,842
I should let her pursue her dream.

422
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,803
Dream?

423
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,057
Her dream is to travel.
She wants to go before it's too late.

424
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,144
It was pretty cool to hear her say that.

425
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,480
It's an incredible thing to have a dream.

426
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,648
Her eyes were glistening
when she spoke about it.

427
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,235
Some things can only be done now.

428
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,031
I didn't want to be selfish
and make her put it off.

429
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,825
If I really care about her,

430
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,995
then I should let her go.

431
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,920
BOYFRIEND

432
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,092
-Hey, are you done with work?
-Yeah.

433
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,719
I just need to check
charts before leaving.

434
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,637
Really?

435
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,263
How long will it take?

436
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,848
About ten minutes?

437
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,308
I see.

438
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,936
Then, can I wait inside?

439
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:08,853
What?

440
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
What's going on?

441
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,988
I wanted to go home together.

442
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,784
Don't mind me and work.
I'll do my work while I wait.

443
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,078
No, I can come in
early tomorrow to look at them.

444
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,162
Let's go.

445
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,374
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

446
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,052
Did you tell your chief you're going?

447
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,137
Not yet.

448
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,098
I asked him
for some time to think over it.

449
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,810
-Why?
-Well…

450
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,604
Six months can either be
really short or really long.

451
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,023
I thought maybe I was a bit rash.

452
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,069
You seemed flustered too,
and that bothered me.

453
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:03,700
And now that I'm a professor,
I'll have a lot of work to do here.

454
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:08,455
I'm doing fine right now,
so maybe I don't need to go abroad.

455
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,875
I don't want to leave you either.

456
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,917
I agree.

457
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,919
I don't want you to go.

458
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,965
Not seeing your beautiful face
for six months is so unfair.

459
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,178
But I did change my mind.

460
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,766
Some things can only be done right now.

461
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:33,062
I don't think it's right for me
to take that chance away from you.

462
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,276
Six months will fly by.
We'll call each other often.

463
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,487
I'll visit you whenever I have time.

464
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,697
-Really?
-Yes.

465
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,741
You'll visit me in the US?

466
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,700
Of course.

467
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,788
You can give me a tour
of the hospitals there too.

468
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,999
That night,

469
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,878
the news was unexpected
and I was flustered,

470
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,881
so I acted like it didn't bother me.

471
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,051
But I mean it this time.

472
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,303
You should go.

473
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,806
Jeong-woo.

474
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,351
But promise that you'll spend
a lot of time with me until then.

475
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,895
And go on all the dates I want. Okay?

476
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,022
Okay.

477
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,024
Thank you.

478
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,692
I'm thankful too.

479
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,030
By the way,

480
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,990
could you tell I was flustered that night?

481
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,828
Well… No, not at all.

482
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,914
I'm serious.

483
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,832
Jeez.

484
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,250
Hello, sir.

485
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,755
I did give it some thought.

486
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,098
I'll give it a shot.

487
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,308
I'm looking forward to it.

488
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,192
Well done.

489
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,110
Gosh.

490
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,029
-Do you think I can do well?
-Of course.

491
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,323
-You can do it!
-I can do it.

492
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,954
It feels so strange.

493
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,373
What's strange?

494
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,626
The thought of you
walking here without me.

495
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,424
Six months will fly by, right?

496
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,385
Of course.

497
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,054
You're going to call often, right?

498
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,389
You bet!

499
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,350
You'll visit me, right?

500
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,232
I already miss you!

501
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,526
I'm going to miss you so much!

502
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,821
I miss you even when you're here!

503
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,698
What am I going to do?

504
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,824
Jeong-woo.

505
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,452
I miss you already.

506
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,454
Don't leave me!

507
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,501
Sorry? What do you mean?

508
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,172
You're rescinding the offer? Why?

509
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,007
To be honest,

510
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,844
Professor Na Seong-sik
wanted to send Professor Kim Jin-i.

511
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:14,349
But Professor Kim declined,
so the offer went to you.

512
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,601
However, she changed her mind.

513
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,605
So Professor Na thinks
it's better that she goes instead.

514
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,149
I'm sorry about this.

515
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,528
I promise I'll recommend you first
if another opportunity comes up.

516
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,865
I should get going.

517
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,667
Then, why make the offer at all?

518
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,714
Gosh.

519
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,183
Ha-neul!

520
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,685
Hey, Jeong-woo.

521
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,645
Did you get off work too?

522
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,898
No, I took the afternoon off
since you were ending work early today.

523
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,194
I told you. Before you leave,
we'll go on all the dates I want.

524
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,572
I narrowed them to five,
and one of them is

525
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,826
secretly waiting for you after work
and going home while holding hands.

526
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,995
-You see--
-It's okay.

527
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,914
I didn't wait long. Only about 17 minutes?

528
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,458
-Let's go.
-Okay.

529
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,170
TTEOKBOKKI

530
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,597
It's so nice to have
a little snack together after work.

531
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,682
Right?

532
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,475
Yeah, I guess.

533
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,854
But this happiness won't last long

534
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,274
since you'll be leaving
next month on the third.

535
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,151
Jeong-woo--

536
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,527
I shouldn't have said that.

537
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,072
Don't feel pressured. I'm just sad
you're leaving, but I'm not stopping you.

538
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,284
I'm so proud that you're a modern woman
who's going on a bigger stage

539
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,952
to show what you're capable of.

540
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,957
We can have tteokbokki every day
once you return in six months.

541
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,500
-No, listen--
-No, listen to me.

542
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,837
I'm not trying
to pressure you at all. Okay?

543
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,965
Right.

544
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,633
So next thing on the agenda is…

545
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,110
-Why are you staring at me?
-What?

546
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,197
Right.

547
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,241
You must be curious
about why we're at the arcade.

548
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,495
When I first brought you here,

549
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,915
I saw how excited you were
when we got change over there.

550
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,958
It was the first time
I thought you were cute.

551
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,213
I suddenly remembered it,
so I wanted to come here again.

552
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,594
Why am I tearing up?
Gosh. What's wrong with me?

553
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,889
Jeong-woo, I have something to tell you.

554
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,891
-My offer will be canceled--
-Canceled?

555
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,810
Don't you dare say that.

556
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,938
I was only tearing up
for a minute. I'm fine.

557
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:07,939
Look--

558
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,358
And I won't be crying while you're gone.

559
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,860
I'll improve myself in the meantime.

560
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,778
So…

561
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,279
One minute.

562
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,657
Hey.

563
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,161
I'll leave in ten. Okay.

564
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,793
Anyway, don't worry about me
and just focus on your work.

565
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,461
-Okay?
-Okay. But--

566
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,131
We're going to die.

567
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,638
What is all this?

568
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,265
Ta-da!

569
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,103
Jeong-woo wanted
to give you a goodbye party,

570
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,647
so we prepared US-style one.

571
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,566
What?

572
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,109
Gosh, come sit. My legs hurt.

573
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,193
-Hurry.
-Come here.

574
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,736
-Come here.
-Over here.

575
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,864
Let's go.

576
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,282
Okay.

577
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,244
KOREA'S NAM HA-NEUL
PARTY FOR US VENTURE

578
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,456
Here. Take this.

579
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,666
What?

580
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,502
Don't drown yourself in work
when you get there.

581
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:16,174
Use that money to go sightseeing
and eat good food.

582
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:21,179
-Goodness.
-Here. This is from me.

583
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,722
I made a pillow out of buckwheat.

584
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,934
They say it's difficult
to adjust to foreign pillows.

585
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:32,106
I worked all night on that,
so use it and sleep well.

586
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,483
There you go again.

587
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,111
Goodbye doesn't mean

588
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:41,282
We're parting ways forever

589
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,619
It means we'll promise

590
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,912
CONGRATS ON YOUR US VENTURE

591
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,248
To meet again

592
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,251
Our times together

593
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,422
Will become memories

594
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,798
We have to find our own paths

595
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,927
Dr. Nam, I'm truly sorry
your offer was canceled.

596
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,387
I'm sure you'll get another chance.

597
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,848
Congratulations
on your US venture, Ha-neul!

598
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,558
-Congratulations!
-Wait, Mom.

599
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,354
I…

600
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,314
To be honest--

601
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,024
-Please don't go!
-Oh, my gosh.

602
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,444
-I just I can't do this.
-Do what?

603
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,655
I can't let you go.

604
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,075
-No, but--
-Don't go, Ha-neul!

605
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,201
Wait!

606
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,456
I can't live without you!

607
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,834
Promise me you won't go!

608
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,794
-What?
-Okay?

609
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,963
Please don't go!

610
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,759
-Let me go!
-Please don't go!

611
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,386
Ha-neul…

612
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,553
Please don't go…

613
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,275
Please don't go, Ha-neul!

614
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,693
What have you done?

615
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,325
You got more drenched than I thought.

616
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,869
-How did you know?
-What?

617
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,540
About what?

618
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,668
You said you wouldn't get in the way
and that I had to go.

619
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,378
But why are you stopping me now?

620
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,755
You found out I can't go, didn't you?

621
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,884
To be honest,

622
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,179
I read a text you got by accident.

623
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,140
A text?

624
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,271
Canceled? What in the world happened?

625
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,274
They decided to send
a different professor instead.

626
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,734
Your hospital's ridiculous.

627
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,820
They can't toy with you like that.
How can they change their mind?

628
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,742
You must've been so upset.
But you couldn't say anything.

629
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,661
That's not true.

630
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,914
I did speak my mind.

631
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,750
I should get going.

632
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,670
Sir.

633
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,346
If Professor Kim had refused,
shouldn't that have been the end?

634
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,807
You gave me the offer afterward,

635
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,893
and I told you I'd go.

636
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,145
Then, I believe I should go.

637
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,525
Why do I have to change a decision
that I took time to think about and make?

638
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,780
Is it because the chairman favors her?

639
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:27,823
Professor Nam.

640
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,658
Sir.

641
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,788
There was one decision I made
when I came back to work.

642
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:39,293
I promised to at least express myself
whenever I was hurt or offended.

643
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,588
I know it won't change anything,

644
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:47,218
but I thought I'd express myself
for my own sake.

645
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,267
I was a bit upset at first,

646
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,895
but I expressed how I felt
and moved past it.

647
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,606
I've been through much worse.

648
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,861
And thanks for helping me
save face back there,

649
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,532
but I'm going to tell my family
the truth too. It's nothing too bad.

650
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,497
-Why are you smiling?
-It just seems like you've changed.

651
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,500
-I have?
-Yes.

652
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,421
I think so too.

653
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,590
Right.

654
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,553
You had five different dates
you wanted to do before I left for the US.

655
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,222
How many have we done so far?

656
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,892
We came home after work together,
went to the arcade,

657
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,853
and just had the goodbye party.

658
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,980
We did three and have two more to go.

659
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,857
Then, let's do the rest.

660
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,026
You put a lot of thought into it,
so it'd be a waste. What are they?

661
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,949
I thought you'd miss
Korean food while living in America.

662
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,702
I'm sure there are
Korean restaurants there too.

663
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,831
But they wouldn't have food made by me,
so I wanted to cook for you.

664
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,499
Really?

665
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,042
I bet it'll be so good.

666
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,545
It was so impressive
when you made kimbap last time.

667
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,714
-Should I look forward to it?
-Brace yourself.

668
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,757
I'm so excited!

669
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,885
Right. What's the last one?

670
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,141
-It's a secret.
-Oh, my gosh!

671
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,809
Why? Tell me.

672
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,603
The old me would've thought,

673
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,689
"Why can't I go? What am I lacking?"

674
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,817
I would've blamed myself
and been discouraged.

675
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,207
SUNSHINE MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

676
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,625
But now, I know.

677
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,171
Even if I don't get the desired result
after working hard,

678
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,798
it's okay to be upset for a moment.

679
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,343
Then, I can wait for better luck next time

680
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,221
and quietly focus on my work.

681
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,591
That looks so good.

682
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,679
What can I help you with?

683
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,765
Your beautiful face
is helping me a lot already.

684
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,141
You're so silly.

685
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,476
It's true though.

686
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,396
It looks really good.

687
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,487
This is a royal meal,
not just Korean food.

688
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,738
How did you make all this?

689
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,242
I just took a few cooking classes.

690
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,869
Eat up.

691
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,871
Thank you for the meal.

692
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,873
Let me give you one.

693
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,376
Here. Try this too.

694
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,966
-Is it good?
-It's so delicious.

695
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,428
I can't believe you can cook this well
from just a few classes.

696
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,892
Life is a long journey.

697
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:28,564
Even if I fail to reach a goal
at a specific time or place,

698
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,400
it doesn't make my life worthless.

699
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,405
It could happen tomorrow,
or it could be in the next place I visit.

700
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,284
Good fortune exists,
and it's waiting for me.

701
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,745
That's what I believe now.

702
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,712
-Did you really feel that way?
-Yes.

703
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,717
After you had seen
Professor Min's photo here,

704
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,511
I saw the news about him
and was very worried.

705
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,639
But seeing how brave…

706
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,476
After seeing how much stronger
you've become,

707
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,561
I'm relieved.

708
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,438
Do you think so?

709
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,567
How do you feel?
Do you think you've become healthier?

710
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,237
I think I'm better than I used to be.

711
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,783
Then, should we take
the test again this time?

712
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,875
"I'm happy."

713
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,753
MEASURE OF HOPELESSNESS AND DEPRESSION

714
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,047
"I'm at peace."

715
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,092
YES

716
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,513
"I'm disappointed about the future."

717
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,601
NO

718
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:52,272
"I'm disappointed in myself."

719
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,733
NO

720
00:44:56,276 --> 00:45:00,531
"Looking back,
my life was full of failures."

721
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,337
NO

722
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,604
I think you're all better now.

723
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,858
You don't have to visit me anymore.

724
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,070
Are you sure that's okay?

725
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:26,783
You already have the power
to overcome your pain.

726
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,746
The hard work you've put in up until now

727
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,248
will protect you from now on.

728
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,099
You don't have to see me out.

729
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,938
I prefer to see
my patients out on their last day.

730
00:46:56,021 --> 00:47:00,651
SUNSHINE MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

731
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,292
There's a lot
of people in pain, isn't there?

732
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:23,173
But just like how we go
to the library to read books

733
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,718
or to the art gallery
to look at paintings,

734
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:30,681
everyone came here to get better.

735
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,932
So…

736
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,394
they'll all get better.

737
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,105
What does "better" mean?

738
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,569
Does that mean they'll become happy?

739
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,445
No.

740
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,156
They'll accept their misfortunes.

741
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,828
"I can become miserable again,
but that's okay."

742
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:59,126
"Should misfortunes come,
I have the strength to endure them."

743
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,169
That's what they believe.

744
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,345
Hurry up!

745
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,346
Goodness.

746
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,640
Why are you so intent
on buying me a handbag?

747
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,684
You don't have a decent one.

748
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,604
My first paycheck wasn't enough,
so I saved my next one too.

749
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,815
How's this one? I've had my eyes on it.

750
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,736
Goodness, but you can't spend
your hard-earned money on a bag.

751
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,653
Jeez.

752
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,160
It's 1.8 million won?

753
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:34,911
Let's go.

754
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,623
Why? I want to buy you one.

755
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,082
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.

756
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,876
May we see this bag?

757
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,630
Is it from the winter collection?
It suits her perfectly.

758
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,881
-It's so nice.
-Let's go.

759
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,090
Why? Hold on.

760
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,092
Come here! Could we take a look?

761
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,052
I'm sorry.

762
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,262
Hold on!

763
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,305
Come back here!

764
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,355
Gosh, when did you prepare all this?

765
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,023
I made them this morning.

766
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,317
Jeez, is this it?

767
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,737
Didn't you pack any sausages or chicken?

768
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,156
No, just eat what we brought.

769
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,075
Being a picky eater isn't good.

770
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,826
But you don't eat carrots.

771
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,038
I'm an adult, so it's okay.
I'm already all grown up.

772
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,041
That's not fair.
Adults should set a good example.

773
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,542
-Mr. Bin.
-Yes?

774
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,543
What do you think?

775
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,880
I agree with you.
She should set a good example, right?

776
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,717
Are you saying I'm an awful mom
who's setting a bad example?

777
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,552
No, that's not what I meant.

778
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,055
He's a kid, so I was siding with him.

779
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,683
Siding with me?
Are you treating me like a kid?

780
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,227
No, I'm not.

781
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,561
Cheer up, Mom.

782
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,730
I'll give you a grape.

783
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,066
-Here.
-Thanks.

784
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,776
You're the best.

785
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,657
You too.

786
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,367
Isn't it good?

787
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,285
What is this?

788
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,913
Why do I feel sad?

789
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,456
So adorable.

790
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,965
You should've just let me buy you one.

791
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,883
I didn't know you were so unambitious.

792
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,010
It's better that I'm unambitious.

793
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,264
I can't use two months' worth
of your pay to buy a 1.8 million-won bag.

794
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,390
I'd be senile if I did.

795
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,437
And I like this one much better.

796
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,771
I can use it every day.

797
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,153
It's nice that you have a job.

798
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,654
You bought me this wallet

799
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,240
and this pretty ice cream as well.

800
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,199
Right?

801
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,286
I'm not as great as Ha-neul
but not too bad either, right?

802
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,037
What are you talking about?

803
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,956
You two are good in different ways.

804
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,625
Whatever. You're always scolding me.

805
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,421
I know, but that doesn't mean
you're not precious to me.

806
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,923
You're my child too.
Of course, you're special.

807
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,592
Save it. Don't lie.

808
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,635
I know she's much better.

809
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:59,765
She's a doctor, and I'm an average guy.
Of course, you'd be more proud of her.

810
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,602
Perhaps our fates had already
been determined from the start.

811
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,605
The sky was pretty
when she was born, so she's Ha-neul.

812
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,690
And I was named Ba-da
to just match with her.

813
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,026
What are you talking about?

814
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,403
I named you "Ba-da,"
because I dreamed of the ocean.

815
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,156
-Really?
-Yes.

816
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:22,329
I dreamed of a rainbow
stretching over a glistening ocean.

817
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:26,750
I couldn't forget how beautiful it was
even after I woke up.

818
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,086
So I decided to name you
"Ba-da" instead of "Rainbow."

819
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,297
Is that so?

820
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,468
Like you said,

821
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:40,388
you can become a building owner
or take over Uncle Tae-seon's restaurant.

822
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,641
Or whatever you decide to do,

823
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,060
to me, you'll always be

824
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:48,855
that rainbow over the glistening ocean.

825
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:53,610
So you can shine in your own way. Okay?

826
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,031
That was so cheesy.

827
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,785
You're making me cringe today
with that story about rainbows.

828
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,748
Strike a pose. I'll take your photo.

829
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,666
Should I?

830
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:09,751
Okay.

831
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,462
-Smile.
-Okay.

832
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,136
-Let's see.
-Send them to me.

833
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,600
MY SON'S FIRST DISH!

834
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,814
Goodness, you look gorgeous.

835
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,400
MY SON

836
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,111
How nice.

837
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,489
This is great!

838
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,712
I didn't yawn out of boredom.

839
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,840
I read conference papers last night,
so I didn't sleep much.

840
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,842
Then, you must be tired.

841
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,012
-Do you want some coffee?
-Coffee?

842
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,892
Take one.

843
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,324
Maybe it's because you're tired,
but you look lethargic today.

844
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,912
It's not that I'm lethargic.

845
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,830
To be honest,

846
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,625
I'm a bit embarrassed to see you.

847
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,336
-Why?
-Because of that day.

848
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,963
You know, at the clinic.

849
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,466
Because of the incident that day?

850
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,343
That patient was in the wrong.

851
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,804
Still, I'm embarrassed about you
seeing me like that.

852
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,934
I said I'd protect you
when we were making that plum wine.

853
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,769
But you had to protect me instead.

854
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,021
Who cares about that?

855
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,107
We can take turns protecting each other.

856
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,693
But still, I'm older than you.

857
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,279
I want to always impress you.

858
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:06,326
I'm not dating you so you can impress me.

859
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,080
I like that you're warmhearted.

860
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,417
I realized that kind,
gentle souls are the best.

861
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:19,422
I like how you're a sincere person
who devotes his time to small things,

862
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,800
like crouching with a kid to catch ants.

863
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,890
It must've been difficult
to let both Nurse Do and Jeong-woo go.

864
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,725
No, it was rather easy.

865
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,146
Now that he's doing better,
it's only right that he opens up

866
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,399
his own clinic
that he can manage in his own way.

867
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,070
I would've eventually had to let him go.

868
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,245
Anyway, she wants to pursue her dream.

869
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,163
So I'm going to happily let her go.

870
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,708
And not only her.

871
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,502
Since we're on the topic,
I'm going to let you go too.

872
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,420
What?

873
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,089
-Me?
-Yes.

874
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,092
-Why me?
-You should open up your own practice.

875
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,139
It hasn't even been six months here.

876
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,308
Why does that matter?
What matters is that you're better now.

877
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,770
But still…

878
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,399
When people heard
that I dropped my scalpel during surgery,

879
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,526
your clinic's reputation took a big hit.

880
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,362
But you still helped me

881
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,033
get back on my feet,
so I should repay you.

882
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,493
You can repay me by leaving.

883
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,747
Your paycheck
is too much for me to handle.

884
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,793
Right now,

885
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,963
it's your time to leave.

886
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,553
He would've never brought it up,

887
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,764
so I mentioned it first.

888
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,640
That's all.

889
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,313
Gosh. Why are you hugging me?

890
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,775
See? You're a very kind man.

891
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,907
I'm very happy to be with you right now.

892
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,079
So how's the preparation
for his clinic going?

893
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,498
I'm not sure.

894
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,668
Now that he has money,
he'll probably buy a nice car.

895
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,012
AUDI DRIVE SELECT

896
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,782
Don't you think
he'll open up a bigger clinic

897
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,784
and make a more flashy return?

898
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,054
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON
TAE-SEON, BA-DA

899
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,973
THERE'S NEVER BEEN
A CLINIC LIKE THIS BEFORE

900
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,354
LOGIN PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC
YEO JEONG-WOO

901
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,931
Congratulations, Jeong-woo.
I'm proud of you.

902
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,600
Your clinic's finally open.

903
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,811
What? Are you crying?

904
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,396
It feels strange.

905
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,066
I didn't give much thought
to opening clinics in the past.

906
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,735
But everything's so moving now.

907
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,738
This sofa is amazing.

908
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,533
And this table is so precious.

909
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,956
I'm going to donate lots of money,
do good deeds, and work hard.

910
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,291
My life is so precious.

911
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,542
You're unbelievable.

912
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:28,463
But will you be okay on your own?
You used to have many doctors to help.

913
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,217
Well, I wanted to start small.

914
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:36,846
I'll only accept a few patients,
and I'll try to build rapport with them.

915
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,890
I'm not going to exhaust myself.

916
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,267
Right. Here.

917
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,479
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

918
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,731
It's because I wanted to drink it.

919
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,733
I wanted an opening party for just us two.

920
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,860
A party for just us two?

921
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:52,946
Sit down.

922
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,701
Jeong-woo started
a new chapter in his life.

923
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,620
And those around me

924
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,581
also continued to live their lives.

925
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,254
Ba-da is pursuing a small dream.

926
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,715
He wants to become famous
through his milmyeon.

927
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:17,303
And he no longer asked for money from us.

928
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,974
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

929
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,809
Hello.

930
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,482
We don't do deliveries.

931
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,528
-That's not why I'm here.
-Dan-bi.

932
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,595
Tae-seon?

933
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,556
Is it really you?

934
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,102
Have you been well? I mean…

935
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,437
How have you been? No.

936
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,105
What brings you here?

937
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,985
I was doing a delivery around this area

938
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,779
and came here to eat milmyeon.

939
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,867
But why are you in Seoul?

940
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,660
I moved here.

941
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,913
Gosh, it's been ages.

942
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,833
I still remember the day

943
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:32,045
when you came to Busan on vacation
and asked me for directions.

944
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,131
You haven't changed one bit.

945
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,842
You haven't either.

946
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,053
You gave me directions

947
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:46,100
to popular pork soup and rice, milmyeon,
and nakgopsae restaurants in Busan.

948
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,103
You're still the same helpful

949
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,272
and warmhearted guy.

950
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:02,575
Didn't you say you were going to work
at your brother-in-law's factory?

951
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,286
Yes, I did.

952
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,748
But since you loved milmyeon so much,

953
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,585
we always had some on our dates.

954
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,337
Right.

955
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,798
So if I opened a milmyeon restaurant,

956
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:20,551
I thought you'd come visit me once.

957
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,014
That's what I thought
when I first moved here.

958
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,476
And here you are.

959
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,275
Are you married?

960
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,405
No.

961
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,866
Are you seeing anyone?

962
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,202
No.

963
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,207
All right, then.

964
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,714
Uncle Tae-seon reunited
with his first love.

965
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,675
I hoped his once quiet and constant life

966
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:04,220
would be full of happiness,
like a big dumpling.

967
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,723
PURE LOVE DELIVERY

968
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,600
DING-DONG
DAN-BI IS HERE TO FILL UP YOUR EMPTY LIFE

969
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,689
My mom was the one who laughed…

970
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,193
and cried the most because of us.

971
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,198
She stopped growing cabbage.

972
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:30,538
She wanted to keep her promise
of raising her children well.

973
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,540
My heart always went out to her

974
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,961
as she strived to do her best every day.

975
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,347
All right.

976
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,409
Hello, my Bindungs

977
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,621
Hi, my Bindung friends!

978
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,165
Long time no see.

979
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,793
I'm sure many of you

980
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,879
are not curious
about what I've been up to.

981
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,256
But nevertheless,
I decided to record today

982
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,217
to tell you how I've been doing.

983
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,384
Goodness.

984
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,390
What is it? Are you embarrassed?

985
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,935
I'm used to this now, so I'm fine.

986
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,770
But what about Ms. Lee?

987
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,981
-Does she know about this?
-Well…

988
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:44,111
She knows everything and still likes me.

989
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,240
She's happy just the way I am.

990
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,325
And as for this warmhearted man…

991
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,953
THE MICHELANGELO OF SURGERY

992
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:57,250
CATCHING UP WITH DR. BIN
FEATURING THE RICE COOKER ORCHESTRA

993
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:08,302
He'll have a happy life
with someone just like him.

994
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,184
I'd like 25,000 won's worth
of skewers, please.

995
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,269
-Okay.
-Mr. Han!

996
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,312
How did you find us?

997
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,274
Jeong-woo told me
everything about you guys.

998
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:22,984
Right.

999
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,653
I heard he operated on you.

1000
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,115
You did need a few tweaks,
but is this the final result?

1001
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:30,867
Hey!

1002
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,618
It was for my back.

1003
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,913
But don't you need
more work done on the front?

1004
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,748
Look at you two rascals.

1005
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,501
You're teasing me
just like you did back in the day.

1006
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,420
Forget the skewers. I'm leaving.

1007
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:44,463
-We're just kidding.
-Come here.

1008
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,507
-Have a taste.
-Try some.

1009
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,427
-It's made with our special sauce.
-We made it.

1010
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,182
-It's good!
-Right?

1011
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,893
-It's good!
-Cheers!

1012
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,477
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1013
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,645
Good luck to you two!

1014
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,064
Even though each day
may be filled with hardships…

1015
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,582
Dr. Kang.

1016
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,710
Will you be able to work with me?

1017
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:25,171
I need someone trustworthy.

1018
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,426
But I believe I can overcome

1019
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,303
anything in life.

1020
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,599
Lastly, for us…

1021
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:41,771
Seeing the clinic with the lights off
reminds me of that day.

1022
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:43,940
What day?

1023
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:48,027
When I went to give you the dissertation,

1024
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,863
I fell outside the court and got hurt.

1025
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,282
Right.

1026
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:57,495
So you took me to your closed clinic
to treat my wound.

1027
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:06,504
That empty room reminded me of you,
and it broke my heart.

1028
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,343
But seeing you back on your feet like this

1029
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,387
makes me so emotional.

1030
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,555
I'll be honest.

1031
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,101
I couldn't have done this without you.

1032
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,775
Do you remember the day
when we failed to watch the sunrise?

1033
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,527
Of course.

1034
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,154
It was such a shame
since we traveled so far.

1035
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,155
Tell me about it.

1036
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,700
Then…

1037
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,035
how about we go now?

1038
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,371
Right now?

1039
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,915
I still had one more date
I wanted to go on.

1040
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:47,670
It was watching the sunrise together.
Not seeing it last time bothered me.

1041
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,590
So what do you say?

1042
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,676
Should we go?

1043
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,807
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go!

1044
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,768
-Nice!
-Will there be any train tickets left?

1045
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:06,022
When we first experienced despair,

1046
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:10,317
everything was out of control.

1047
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,654
We thought our lives were over.

1048
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,742
We thought we wouldn't be able

1049
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:20,536
to get out of our slumps for a long time.

1050
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,457
However,

1051
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,544
our slumps weren't as deep
as we had originally thought.

1052
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:34,425
He and I cried together that night.

1053
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,595
We endured pain together,

1054
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,139
overcame our fears,

1055
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,561
and finally recovered.

1056
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,402
MIN KYUNG-MIN

1057
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:59,950
We learned to be in pain for a moment
and to cherish memories for a while.

1058
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,000
Dr. Yeo, you may begin now.

1059
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:22,723
In the end,
we were able to escape our slumps.

1060
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:37,321
This is nice.

1061
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,497
-There it is!
-You're right!

1062
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,794
It's so round and beautiful.

1063
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,176
We missed it last time,
but we finally got to see it this time.

1064
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,345
You're right.

1065
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,809
I hope we continue to get along.

1066
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,187
-Okay.
-Okay.

1067
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,065
Right.

1068
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:16,944
Do you know
that you still haven't answered me?

1069
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:18,696
About what?

1070
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,032
I proposed,
but you still haven't answered.

1071
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,286
Come on.
Our wedding photoshoot is next week,

1072
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,704
so why does it matter now?

1073
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:29,540
You should still give me an answer, okay?

1074
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,209
Jeez. Fine.

1075
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,306
Let's get married already.

1076
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,561
"Let's get married already"?

1077
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,855
Are we late or something?

1078
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,273
Give me a proper answer!

1079
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,483
No, I can't do it.

1080
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,486
What do you mean? Of course, you can.

1081
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,989
Wait. Where are you going?

1082
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:03,032
-I--
-Come back.

1083
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,617
I'm too embarrassed to stay.

1084
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,202
Then, wait for me.

1085
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,756
I could be happy today…

1086
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:21,800
and suddenly sad tomorrow.

1087
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,056
But it's okay.

1088
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:32,186
If there's sadness,
there will always be happiness as well.

1089
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,774
We have the strength now to endure

1090
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,443
sadness and misfortunes.

1091
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:43,155
And that's enough.

1092
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,800
EPILOGUE

1093
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,470
NAM HA-NEUL, YEO JEONG-WOO
WE ARE GETTING MARRIED!

1094
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,745
FORTRESS TRAIL MART

1095
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,499
DOCTOR SLUMP

1096
