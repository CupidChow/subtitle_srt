00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,994
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,923
I wanted to get her a ring.

3
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,926
I've always wanted to.

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,854
That was the moment when I realized…

5
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,484
I wanted to be with her

6
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,778
for a long time.

7
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,699
Could I see this one?

8
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,743
-Sure.
-The one that's open like this.

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,411
I'll get it out for you.

10
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,704
Thank you.

11
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,975
But when and how do I give this to her?

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,115
Should I give it to her like this?
Or like this?

13
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,160
Or maybe…

14
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,162
like…

15
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,124
Or like this?

16
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,959
Or like this? Or maybe like this?

17
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,252
Or--

18
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,920
Oh, no!

19
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,507
Damn it.

20
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,846
Where is it?

21
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,265
What are you doing?

22
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,766
Nothing.

23
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,184
Did you drop something?

24
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,270
No. It's okay.

25
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,355
Go do your work. Pursue your dreams.

26
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,274
What is it? What fell under?

27
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,986
A coin. It's 100 won, but don't worry.

28
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,697
Goodness.

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,614
Use this.

30
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,532
What?

31
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,118
No, don't! I can--

32
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,369
I can do it. Please.

33
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,620
Please don't!

34
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,707
I don't want to give it to you like this!

35
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,833
Give me what?

36
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,668
-The 100 won?
-What?

37
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,300
-To be honest, I got you a gift.
-A gift?

38
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,595
-You see…
-Is that it?

39
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,308
Fine, I'll just tell you.

40
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,856
I wanted to give that to you.

41
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,113
Cockroaches!

42
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,823
Over here!

43
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,173
You pushed me and ran away.

44
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,468
I never did that. I'm not afraid of them.

45
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,553
DOCTOR SLUMP

46
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,013
Why won't they leave?

47
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,474
I was going to give her the ring.

48
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,393
I was thinking about how to give it
to her but I dropped it.

49
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,478
It rolled under the sofa.

50
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,813
So I looked for it and guess what I found.

51
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,483
Cockroaches, so we were
on the sofa like this. Okay?

52
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,235
So I couldn't give it to her.

53
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,324
I've heard of people
hiding rings in cakes before.

54
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,868
But I've never heard of people
hiding them under sofas.

55
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,287
-You're the worst.
-Whatever.

56
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,206
Everything is the worst.

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,543
So what did you tell her?
Did you come clean about the ring?

58
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,921
Of course not. How could I?

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,968
I didn't want her to remember cockroaches
if I gave it later, so I played dumb.

60
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,719
Good. Hold on.

61
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,890
That ring you tried to give…
Were you trying to propose?

62
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,479
Well, no. That wasn't why I bought it.

63
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:36,567
But I don't mind if she takes it that way
since I'd love to marry her.

64
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,613
You little rascal.
You're getting in the way of her career.

65
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,031
-How?
-Hey.

66
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,701
She must be so busy
as a new assistant professor,

67
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,828
so you should let her focus.

68
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,038
Don't you think
she'd be very uncomfortable

69
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,581
if you suddenly gave her a ring?

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,044
This is unlike you today.
Why are you saying what's right?

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,505
I'm speaking from experience.

72
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,967
And I think you're rushing it a bit.

73
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,469
You haven't gone out for even a year.

74
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,014
You need to date someone
for at least a full year.

75
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:10,143
Different people show
their obnoxious side in different seasons.

76
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,022
Hold on. Are you saying
Ha-neul's obnoxious?

77
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,732
No, I'm talking about you.

78
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,194
From Ha-neul's standpoint,
she might still have doubts about you.

79
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,780
Anyway, whether it's due to
how long you've been dating

80
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,825
or her recent hiring,
it's too early for a ring.

81
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,163
You're right, but why am I offended?

82
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,414
This.

83
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,999
A bracelet will do.

84
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,084
Forget it.

85
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,252
I'll figure it out myself.

86
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,795
Don't be ridiculous.

87
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,763
Hello, sir. Was there a problem?

88
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,599
No, there wasn't.

89
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,645
Could I see some bracelets?

90
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,612
Was it right to buy this?

91
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,656
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

92
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,241
Did you get off work just now?

93
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,119
Ba-da, you're working hard these days.

94
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,914
I'm slowly starting to lose motivation.

95
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,291
-But I'm still hanging in there.
-Really?

96
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,629
Do you think you could comfort me
by treating me to some tteokbokki?

97
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,632
Of course, I can.
But are you okay with the spiciest kind?

98
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,675
-I'd love that.
-Really?

99
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,593
Nice.

100
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,513
This is good.

101
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,183
It only took 20 minutes for delivery.
What a great world we live in now.

102
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,559
Exactly.

103
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,478
So why aren't you doing the same?

104
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,106
Let's make deliveries too.
All restaurants do it.

105
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,774
That's a hard no.

106
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,194
The broth will get lukewarm,
and the noodles will get soggy on the way.

107
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,114
You have to make
quality over quantity, you fool.

108
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,784
You and your milmyeon pride.
Are you the creator or something?

109
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,453
By the way, why isn't Ha-neul joining us?

110
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,996
She's still at work.

111
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,997
I see.

112
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,917
Gosh, it's been hard to see her
now that she's a professor.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,253
Treat her well, okay?

114
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,172
Don't prank her
by giving her cockroaches as a gift.

115
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,593
-How did you know?
-It's okay.

116
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,388
Couples can prank each other
like that on occasion.

117
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,722
I wasn't pranking her!

118
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,268
To be honest,

119
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,521
I was going to give her a ring.

120
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,233
But I dropped it,
and it rolled under the sofa.

121
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,861
I tried to retrieve it
when that unfortunately happened.

122
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,195
I see.

123
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,699
We'll pretend not to know then,
so wipe it clean with a wet wipe.

124
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,909
Uncle Tae-seon, that's not right.

125
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,036
She deserves better treatment than that.

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,204
Don't you know who she is?

127
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,207
Right, she's a professor now.
That'd be wrong.

128
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,043
No. Forget her job.
She's been single forever.

129
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,380
She's never received jewelry
from a guy before.

130
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,049
That ring he gives would be
her first and last ring.

131
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,095
So giving her one that's rolled around
in dust and cockroaches would be wrong.

132
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,182
-What do you think?
-I agree.

133
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,393
So I got her something new. A bracelet.

134
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,482
-Bracelets aren't her thing though.
-What?

135
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,361
Well, my mom gave her a bracelet
made of gold when she became a doctor.

136
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,197
She said it was a hassle
and never wore it.

137
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,033
She said removing it
before surgery was bothersome.

138
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,870
Then, you secretly sold it
and got in big trouble with your mom.

139
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,583
She beat me to a pulp.
I still have the scars she gave me.

140
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,335
I need to be somewhere right now.

141
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,753
Thank you for the meal.

142
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,379
What?

143
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,594
Excuse me.

144
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,055
You're back again. Was there a problem?

145
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,684
Necklaces. Can I see your necklaces?

146
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,458
You've become tricky to give.

147
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,336
As for you,

148
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,380
she might not like you.

149
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,841
And you…

150
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,219
I really hope she likes you.

151
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:18,099
But exactly when and how
do I give this to her?

152
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,061
Not where there's a sofa or cockroaches.

153
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,647
Not at home
but the clinic would be weirder.

154
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,399
I think I need to see a doctor.

155
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,401
I think I'm going insane.

156
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,611
-Then I--
-Look! Jeong-woo hit the jackpot!

157
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,407
It's too early for a ruckus.
What do you mean he hit the jackpot?

158
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,992
Look.

159
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,452
Jeong-woo is filthy rich now.

160
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,080
-They said he got 2.5 billion won.
-What?

161
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,583
Look at this. They've written articles.

162
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,460
"As the biggest victim
of the Macau casino heiress murder case,

163
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,506
Yeo received back the penalties he paid
to his medical referral center owners."

164
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,802
Ha-neul, did you know about this?

165
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,638
I did. When did that article come out?

166
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,473
A few hours ago.

167
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,852
Wait. Hold on.

168
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,939
He's this rich, but all he bought us
was tteokbokki last night?

169
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,442
He didn't order
any fried sides or blood sausage.

170
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,570
Did he buy food for you again yesterday?

171
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,656
Goodness, stop pestering him.

172
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,866
I didn't pester him.

173
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,578
He enjoys spending time with us.
You know he doesn't have many friends.

174
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,330
Of course, he does.

175
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,040
That's what he said in the past.

176
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,043
He said he lost all his friends
after the medical accident.

177
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,087
And he recently lost
his good friend from childhood…

178
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,551
I'm leaving now.

179
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,012
Hold on. Have some of this first.

180
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,557
Ha-neul!

181
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,148
Come here so I can rip you to pieces!

182
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,025
Why don't you dote on me too?

183
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,861
I may speak carelessly,
but I'm your precious child too!

184
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,029
You little punk!

185
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,532
You didn't even let her have
some tomatoes for breakfast!

186
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,790
-Jeong-woo, are you up?
-Yeah.

187
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,502
I was meaning to call you
because I missed you this morning.

188
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,088
Really? Then, count to three.

189
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,089
Why?

190
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,383
Are you going to appear
in front of my eyes?

191
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,388
Maybe, so earnestly count to three.

192
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,141
Okay. I'm going to be super earnest.

193
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,560
One.

194
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,979
Two.

195
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,315
-Three!
-Oh, my gosh!

196
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,402
What? I thought you were home.

197
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,989
I couldn't sleep, so I went for a run.
Then, I saw you and followed you upstairs.

198
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,324
You did?

199
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,285
I'm free for 15 minutes.
Want to have some coffee?

200
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,162
I'd love to.

201
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,248
Please come in.

202
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,332
Okay.

203
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,252
Here's your iced coffee.

204
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,837
Thanks.

205
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,050
This is good.

206
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,888
I'm sorry for breaking my promise
and being so busy.

207
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,892
No, don't be sorry.
Do all the things you want to do.

208
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,854
I won't get in the way of your career.

209
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,026
Just a second.

210
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,073
Jeong-woo, I love you.

211
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,785
-What?
-What is it?

212
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,539
Ba-da texted me. What's wrong with him?

213
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,292
That idiot.

214
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,962
Listen carefully.

215
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,675
Stay alert and don't give Ba-da
any pocket money no matter what.

216
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,595
He knows you have money now.

217
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,680
What do you mean?

218
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,643
He found out about the returned penalties.
I didn't tell him though.

219
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,188
I know.

220
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,023
I saw the article too.

221
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,192
Jeez.

222
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,527
They just won't let you be.

223
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,322
Why can't they
just mind their own business?

224
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,700
You've gone through enough.
What's their deal?

225
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,036
-But I'm--
-"Okay"?

226
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,121
Is that what you were going to say?

227
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,790
No, I'm not okay about the article.

228
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,337
But I'm okay since you're by my side.

229
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,841
Of course, it's uncomfortable.

230
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,676
When the medical accident first happened,

231
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:28,849
I was hurt by comments left by people
saying it was a deliberate murder.

232
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,521
And I was hurt even more when
the people I knew believed those comments.

233
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,815
I hate it

234
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,695
how my pain is exposed
to the world against my own will.

235
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,408
But I meant it's okay because I have you.

236
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,119
So don't worry about me,

237
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,122
and let's just focus
on the surgery next week. Okay?

238
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,292
Okay.

239
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,463
Right, do you want to see
the cases I've compiled?

240
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,923
There's a USB in my drawer.

241
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,551
Drawer? This one?

242
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,095
No!

243
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,691
What is it? Why won't you
let me open the drawer?

244
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,360
Did you hide a beetle in there this time?

245
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,612
That's not important right now.

246
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,035
Actually…

247
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,915
I have something for you.

248
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,545
Jeong-woo!

249
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,757
Hey.

250
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,511
I'm so out of shape these days.

251
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,265
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

252
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,766
I came by for some tea.

253
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,227
Why am I explaining myself?

254
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,188
-And why are you here?
-Right.

255
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,483
I came to deliver your breakfast.

256
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,360
-What?
-Let's see.

257
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,324
We have your favorite,
stir-fried peppers and anchovies.

258
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,159
-Okay.
-And soy-braised black beans.

259
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,745
-Green onion kimchi.
-That's too much.

260
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,747
And marinated squid and pork belly.

261
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,709
Hey, did you get
Mom's permission to bring these?

262
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,878
You have no right
since you didn't buy them.

263
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,547
Come on, we're family. That doesn't apply.

264
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,841
My money is yours, and your money is mine.

265
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,385
My money is his, and his money is mine.

266
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,722
Right?

267
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,725
So can I borrow 50,000 won--

268
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,061
-My goodness!
-I knew it.

269
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,063
-Let's go.
-Ha-neul.

270
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,940
When did you learn the guillotine choke?

271
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,442
If you can spare it, send it to Duna Bank.

272
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,736
-Account number 352-20020408!
-Ha-neul.

273
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,237
Send it to my account.

274
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,656
Even 30,000 won will do.

275
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,241
-Shut it or I'll hit you 30,000 times.
-Ha-neul.

276
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,244
Okay. I hope you make it out alive.

277
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,834
What? You still haven't given it to her?

278
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,796
Hey, you have a ring,
a bracelet, and a necklace.

279
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,799
You have your own jewelry shop,
so what's stopping you?

280
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,384
I don't know.

281
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,761
I want it to be meaningful
even if I'm not proposing,

282
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,262
but I can't get the timing right.

283
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,392
I'm going to focus
on the surgery next week for now

284
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,060
and then think about it.

285
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,355
Right. You're doing
that surgery next week.

286
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,272
Yeah.

287
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,318
I won't be able to work
for two days. I'm sorry.

288
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,488
Don't be. It's for a good cause,
so of course, I'll cooperate.

289
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,909
But will you be coming back?

290
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,705
I don't want you two-timing me.

291
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,623
That's the worst.

292
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,586
-I'm not sure.
-You little…

293
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,101
-Hello.
-Hello.

294
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,940
-Wait, aren't you going to work?
-No, I--

295
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,775
You're so odd at times.

296
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,709
-Is something up?
-Be quiet.

297
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,587
What's going on?

298
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,714
-Shut it.
-Tell me.

299
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,340
I'll hear you out.

300
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,676
Maybe I can help you in some way.

301
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,594
I said get lost!

302
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,890
Did you just tell me to get lost?

303
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,183
No, I didn't.

304
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,310
Then, was that for me?

305
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,437
No, not you either.

306
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,732
I…

307
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,735
Wait, Hong-ran. I…

308
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,820
Nurse Do! I…

309
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,325
Okay. We appreciate the article.

310
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,994
-Thank you.
-What's going on?

311
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,996
Why are you all being so awkward?

312
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,914
Hello.

313
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,209
We've been getting
tons of calls since this morning.

314
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,418
It's been so hectic.

315
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,170
Calls? What kind?

316
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,964
People have been asking
about Dr. Yeo being compensated

317
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,094
and if he's really performing surgery
on a child patient with microtia.

318
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,805
So I thanked them
for the article they'll write.

319
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,600
I don't think this is right.

320
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,312
Dr. Yeo only made
this big decision out of goodwill,

321
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,980
so how could you use it for PR?

322
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,440
I'm not using him.

323
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,777
We've been getting
a lot of calls from reporters,

324
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,239
and his good deed could serve
as a good example to others.

325
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,574
So it'd be nice
if many people heard about it.

326
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,119
That's only what the media
and the hospital think.

327
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,623
Dr. Yeo and I won't do
this surgery if it's for PR.

328
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:50,337
Our PR team is talking to him
as we speak, so let's see what he says.

329
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,255
Sorry?

330
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,591
Is Dr. Yeo here right now?

331
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,596
-Have a nice day, Doctor.
-You too.

332
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,890
Jeong-woo.

333
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,768
What are you doing here?

334
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,564
What do you think? To see you.
Did you speak to the PR team?

335
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,568
-So you heard.
-What did you tell them?

336
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,529
I told them I'd think about it.

337
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,406
For what?

338
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,285
Are you worried that saying no
would hurt me since I work here?

339
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,497
You see, this is absurd to begin with.

340
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,207
Because above all else,

341
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,544
I won't allow
for the patient's identity to be revealed.

342
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,048
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

343
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,009
But…

344
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,262
Why do they keep putting you
in these tough situations?

345
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,973
Why can't they just leave you alone?

346
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,810
In that case,
at least you should treat me well.

347
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,606
-What can I do for you?
-Let's grab a bite.

348
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,734
How long until I can have dinner with you?

349
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,819
I'm all done with surgeries for the day.

350
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,362
Let me just get changed.

351
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,162
Why aren't you answering?

352
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,039
It's just a reporter I know.

353
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,583
What? They want an interview?

354
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,087
Jeez. Ma'am, can we get a bottle of soju?

355
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,590
-Sure.
-What? Are you allowed to drink?

356
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,925
Of course, I am.

357
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,178
I'm upset today,
so I'm in need of a drink.

358
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:24,681
But…

359
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,141
Here's your soju.

360
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,227
-Ha-neul, what are you up to?
-Hey.

361
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,729
I'm having a drink with Jeong-woo.

362
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,397
-Let me join you.
-You too?

363
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,734
No, I want it to be just us two tonight.

364
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,611
You're so mean.

365
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,530
I'm feeling down today.

366
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,950
Why are you feeling down?
Did something happen?

367
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,661
I'm okay. Tell her to come.

368
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,579
Hey.

369
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,917
Sorry for interrupting your date.

370
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,085
Not at all.

371
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,255
But I needed some alcohol today.

372
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,006
Actually, a lot of it.

373
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,885
I sensed something earlier today.
What's going on?

374
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,098
That's not why I'm down,
but that incident wasn't nice either.

375
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,392
-What is this about?
-Well…

376
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,063
Can I be honest though?
He's close with Dr. Bin.

377
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,106
It's about Dr. Bin?

378
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,024
Then, tell us.

379
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,735
Who knows?
Maybe he can help you understand.

380
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,655
She's right. You can say
what's on your mind.

381
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,285
As you already know,
he and I had a thing going on.

382
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,329
But as soon as he said
he had feelings for me,

383
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,374
he and Nurse Do kissed
right in front of me.

384
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,875
-What?
-What?

385
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,877
Of course, it wasn't intentional.

386
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,380
She tripped and fell toward him.

387
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,717
But I didn't feel good when I saw that.

388
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,596
And it seemed like
they liked each other during that dinner.

389
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,143
I don't think there's anything
going on with Nurse Do.

390
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,105
-Right.
-Let's drink.

391
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,232
Cheers.

392
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:08,368
I just realized my romantic feelings
for him made me upset over trivial things.

393
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,537
"Is this okay?"

394
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,748
"Can I be doing this when I have a child?"

395
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,292
I just suddenly feel lost.

396
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,296
That's understandable. Totally.

397
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,757
Gosh, have a drink.

398
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,425
Goodness.

399
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,642
Ha-neul.

400
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:37,647
You're drinking every 15 seconds.
Why don't you slow down a bit?

401
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,441
Don't worry.

402
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,194
It tastes bitter today,
so I'll only drink one bottle.

403
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,987
Just one?

404
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,281
A bottle each or between us?

405
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,325
Of course, a bottle each.

406
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,743
I was almost disappointed.

407
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,579
And when that happens…

408
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,998
You need a drink.

409
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,711
I'm truly worried about this pace.

410
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,463
Cheers.

411
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,973
I was worried.

412
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,602
And I was right.

413
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,652
Wake up, you two.

414
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,445
Your ramyeon is getting soggy.

415
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,324
Ha-neul, you wanted ramyeon
to ease your stomach.

416
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,994
Goodness. Is that so?

417
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,206
Ha-neul, see how Hong-ran
is enjoying her food?

418
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,919
You'll have a bad hangover later.
Ha-neul? Are you breathing?

419
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,172
It's good, Ha-neul.

420
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,134
I'm Jeong-woo.

421
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,636
Since when?

422
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,888
Since the very beginning.

423
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,390
Are you drunk?

424
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,477
You're the one who's drunk.

425
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,063
Are you up?

426
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,523
-Let's eat.
-Who are you?

427
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,151
Your boyfriend.

428
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,654
-Since when?
-Since a few months back.

429
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,366
What kind of conversation is this?

430
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,952
Let's eat, Ha-neul.

431
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,583
Ms. Girlfriend,
you need to take the cap off.

432
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,084
Right.

433
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,419
Let me open it for you.

434
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,546
Thank you.

435
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,758
-Drink slowly.
-Jeong-woo!

436
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,010
Dae-yeong, hurry up.

437
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,595
-Hurry!
-It's Dae-yeong.

438
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,721
Did you call him?

439
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,347
No, you did.

440
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,349
What's going on?

441
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,269
Goodness. Are you okay?

442
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,730
Why are you hiding the bottle?

443
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,523
The water…

444
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:45,984
-I--
-Hey, Ha-neul.

445
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,277
Come on.

446
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,196
Damn it. I dropped it.

447
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,198
-Get up already.
-Please don't fight.

448
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,784
Nice. Let's go.

449
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,962
Gosh, how much did they drink?

450
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:10,759
Not much, but they drank
at the speed of light.

451
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,761
Unbelievable.

452
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,763
Why didn't you stop them?

453
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,224
This is all because of you.

454
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,810
You said I was the worst,
but it was actually you.

455
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,314
-What do you mean?
-She told me what you did in front of her.

456
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,442
Hey, then you should know
that it was an accident.

457
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,110
I'm already upset as is, you punk.

458
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,278
"Punk"?

459
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,280
Don't call him that.

460
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,700
-Stop harassing him.
-That's right!

461
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,328
Hey, don't be like that to Dae-yeong.

462
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,413
He's such a pitiful guy.

463
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,414
That's right!

464
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,541
Hey, Jeong-woo is more pitiful.

465
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,962
He's the most pathetic person
in this street.

466
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,173
Hey, Dae-yeong is
the most pathetic person in Seoul.

467
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,841
That's not true.

468
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,345
Jeong-woo is
the most pathetic person in Asia!

469
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,222
What are we, their horses? Jeez.

470
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,267
We'll take a taxi
before I become even more pathetic.

471
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,434
Okay, go on ahead.

472
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,352
Good luck.

473
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,313
I feel so bad for Jeong-woo.

474
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:10,026
He's the most pathetic person
in the world.

475
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,738
Jeong-woo…

476
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,116
I'm the most pathetic one right now.

477
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,118
Jeong-woo…

478
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,869
We'll be home soon.

479
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,080
Taxi!

480
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,758
We're home.

481
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,970
Goodness. Why is she so drunk?

482
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,641
She hasn't had alcohol in a while,
so she must've gotten drunk quick.

483
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,643
She's going to be the death of me.

484
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,938
Who is she calling?

485
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:54,529
MY DAUGHTER, PROFESSOR NAM

486
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,158
Mom.

487
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,702
I'm on night shift tonight,
so I can't come home.

488
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,078
Bye.

489
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,045
Jeong-woo, I lied to my mom.

490
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,963
I'm going to sleep at your place tonight.

491
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,319
Please don't look at me like that.

492
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,905
Where are you going?

493
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,866
Good night.

494
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,290
-Can we sit here for a minute?
-Sure.

495
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,503
Hey.

496
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,922
Are you okay?

497
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,591
Should I go get a hangover drink?

498
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,720
No, it'd be a waste of alcohol then.

499
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,681
By the way,

500
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:09,270
I really wasn't talking to you
when I said to get lost in the elevator.

501
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,941
And what happened with Nurse Do
wasn't on purpose either.

502
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,486
I know that too.

503
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,864
Then, why have you been ignoring my texts?

504
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,035
You see…

505
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,663
I think

506
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,042
dating is like being drunk.

507
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,465
Everything's great
when you're chugging it down.

508
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,803
That tipsy feeling is nice.

509
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,265
You laugh at the smallest things.

510
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,560
It feels like you're walking on clouds.

511
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,568
But if you get swept up
in that feeling and keep drinking,

512
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,574
you'll only end up a mess.

513
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,415
After my divorce,

514
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,170
I promised myself

515
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:21,926
I would never fall in love again.

516
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,014
After all, I have a son to take care of.

517
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,685
Because in the end,

518
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,563
all that's left is painful memories.

519
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,279
You made me happy.

520
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,617
You cared for me and helped me,

521
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,287
so I swooned
for the first time in a while.

522
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,255
But after I get swept up
in this feeling and keep drinking,

523
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,720
I might wake up in pain, like a hangover.

524
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,140
So I'm a bit scared.

525
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,344
You better not harass Jeong-woo.

526
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,096
Damn it.

527
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,223
I won't sit still!

528
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,189
What? Why was I sleeping here?

529
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:02,318
You said it was stuffy, so you came out
of your room in the middle of the night.

530
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,319
I did?

531
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,571
-Jeong-woo.
-Yes, ma'am?

532
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,364
I can't let you have Ha-neul.

533
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,701
How could I give
this terrible drunk to you? Never.

534
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,247
What did I even do?

535
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,334
For the first time in my life,
I was embarrassed by you last night.

536
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,254
I never thought I'd ever see you
be embarrassed by Ha-neul.

537
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,881
You were always embarrassed by me.

538
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,549
That's enough.

539
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,844
Everyone becomes drunk
and obnoxious at least once in their life.

540
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,429
"Obnoxious"?

541
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,849
I'm sure I wasn't that horrible.

542
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,434
Eat up.

543
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,745
Ms. Girlfriend,
you need to take the cap off.

544
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,624
Jeong-woo, I lied to my mom.

545
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,459
I'm going to sleep at your place tonight.

546
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,093
Everything she does is so cute.

547
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,929
Unbelievable.

548
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,600
Nice. Looking good.

549
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,812
She's so cute.

550
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,361
What are you doing here?

551
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,280
Well… Ha-neul called me.

552
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,491
Ha-neul?

553
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,910
She was totally drunk
when she called me last night.

554
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,788
She called Min-ho's restaurant
and asked for my number.

555
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,291
She said I'd better
properly apologize to you.

556
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,378
-Or else she'd kill me.
-What?

557
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,588
I thought this was for the best.

558
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,049
I wanted to call you.

559
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,802
But I thought you wouldn't like it,
and I was too ashamed.

560
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,178
I didn't know what to do.

561
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,640
But I'm glad I have
a chance to apologize to you.

562
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,560
I'm sorry, Jeong-woo.

563
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,022
I didn't know
our friendship would be that shallow.

564
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,526
But I was about to lose everything,
so I didn't know what to do.

565
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,487
I'll forever regret hurting you.

566
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,864
I'll live in shame from now on.

567
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,867
This isn't like you.

568
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,452
I can kneel if you want.

569
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,081
Actually, I'll do that.
I don't have any use for my knees anyway.

570
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,416
Don't be so dramatic.

571
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,252
Fine.

572
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,005
I accept your apology.

573
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,507
I…

574
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,762
COLD MILMYEON
SPICY MILMYEON

575
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,722
You should go.

576
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,348
Okay. See you next time.

577
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,155
-Yeo Jeong-woo speaking.
-Hello, Dr. Yeo.

578
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,365
This is the PR team lead
from Daehan Hospital.

579
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,326
It's about the conversation
we had yesterday.

580
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,662
Remember we agreed
to do an interview before surgery

581
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,082
and to take a photo
of the patient afterward?

582
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,877
Please ignore all of that.

583
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,921
Okay.

584
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,174
But why all of a sudden?

585
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:14,343
Professor Nam told us adamantly last night

586
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,431
that you two would back out of the surgery
if we asked you to do those things.

587
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,892
I'd like to offer my sincere apologies.

588
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,061
That's okay.

589
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,105
Okay. Goodbye.

590
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,529
Was this what she meant?

591
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:38,993
Are you okay?

592
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,829
Why did you drink so much?

593
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,917
Because I was so upset for you.

594
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,839
While we've been together,
I've seen you in pain

595
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,175
more than I've seen you be happy.

596
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,138
You know what?

597
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:04,519
I sometimes picture you sitting
in that defendant's seat all by yourself.

598
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,481
And I always cry when I see that.

599
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,486
You've lost so much.

600
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,447
You've received unwarranted hate.

601
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,908
You've lost all your friends.

602
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,494
Your life was ruined.

603
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,707
So why are they making such a fuss
about the compensation you received?

604
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,754
But then,

605
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,092
you used that money you received
to help other in need.

606
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,182
I was so impressed by you,
but I also felt so sorry for you.

607
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,145
You didn't put yourself first,

608
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,981
and that broke my heart.

609
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,525
It did?

610
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,826
If anyone else harasses you again,
I'll make sure they pay.

611
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,790
I'll make sure you receive
apologies from everyone who hurt you.

612
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,793
I've already called them.

613
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,132
So that was it?

614
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,354
-You haven't left for work yet?
-No.

615
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,814
I see.

616
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,984
Then, I'll get going first.

617
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,279
Wait. Let's go together.

618
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:44,577
See? You gave me an earful
for drinking too much last time.

619
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,455
But sometimes, you just can't help it.
Don't you agree?

620
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,165
I do.

621
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,084
By the way, was I that obnoxious?

622
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,545
You weren't that bad.

623
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,673
Then, how bad was I?
Did I do something wrong?

624
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,468
No, you didn't.

625
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,261
Right.

626
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,098
You didn't do anything wrong.

627
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,351
But you were incorrect about one thing.

628
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,894
I did something wrong, right?

629
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,898
You said you saw me in pain more
while we'd been together.

630
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,191
Just tell me already.

631
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,861
But I was happy many more times.

632
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:25,409
You taught me how to reduce the pain.

633
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:32,124
I learned how to forget my sadness.

634
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,254
When I saw you…

635
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,591
cry for my pain,

636
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,179
it made me…

637
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,687
believe in the power of warmth.

638
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,696
So I wanted to give back
that warmth I'd received

639
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,783
to someone who was also in pain…

640
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,416
in my own way.

641
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,879
Did you sleep well, sir?

642
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,674
Yes, I'm in good condition. And you?

643
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,884
I'm good thanks to you.

644
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,263
-Right. I heard you refused the interview.
-I did.

645
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,849
I didn't want to tarnish our purpose.

646
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,600
Well done.

647
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,811
Let's just focus on the surgery.

648
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,065
Thank you for understanding
and accepting my proposal.

649
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,110
I'm more than happy
to be a part of this meaningful work.

650
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,577
Did you sleep well? How are you feeling?

651
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,633
She said she slept well
because the bed was soft.

652
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,727
She hopes the surgery will go well
and would like to thank you.

653
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,732
We'll do our utmost best, so don't worry.

654
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,866
Thank you so much.

655
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,751
How do you feel about leading the surgery?

656
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,294
Sorry?

657
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,546
No, I can't do that.

658
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,590
-You'll here too.
-Why not?

659
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,551
You've done a ton of surgeries
like this while volunteering.

660
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,844
And who knows?

661
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,597
Maybe I'll learn a few things from you.

662
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,438
I'm sure you feel closer
to the patient than I do.

663
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,025
Okay, I'm sure you've done your homework.

664
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,736
So why don't you oversee it yourself?

665
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,244
Then, I'll give it my best.

666
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,379
All right.

667
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,319
Good. Let's turn.

668
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:00,958
And let's turn.

669
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,638
I'll begin the anesthesia.

670
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,852
You can breathe comfortably.

671
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,483
Please administer 35 mg of propofol.

672
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,818
Administering 35 mg of propofol.

673
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,335
Turn on the anesthetic gas.

674
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,218
Hello, Doctor.

675
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:53,844
Hello.

676
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,700
May I begin the surgery?

677
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,786
Yes, you may.

678
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,248
As we agreed,
if you take care of the donor site,

679
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,166
I'll be ready with the ear flap.

680
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,669
Scalpel.

681
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,217
-Let's begin.
-Yes, sir.

682
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,081
Open it up a bit more.

683
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,795
Why is this so hard to detach?

684
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,881
Dr. Song. Was there
anything else of note about her?

685
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,883
No, she only had microtia.

686
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,011
She had no other syndromes
or complications.

687
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,057
Darn it!

688
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:23,976
Jeez.

689
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,061
I believe it's a pleural tear.

690
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,691
Her tidal volume is low.

691
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,943
-Let me.
-Okay.

692
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,157
The pleurae is torn.

693
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,868
I suspect lung injury too.
We must treat it now.

694
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,245
Dr. Nam, we suspect there's a lung injury.

695
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,748
Let me know right away
if her oxygen saturation drops.

696
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,042
Please hang in there.
I'll do my best to be quick.

697
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,168
Yes, Doctor.

698
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,671
If there's a problem with ventilation,
I'll resort to one-lung.

699
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,424
Prepare a bronchial blocker
for bronchoscopy.

700
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,260
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

701
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,512
-Contact CS as well.
-Yes, Doctor.

702
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,931
Can you hold this? I'll take a look.

703
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,541
There's an adhesion
in the lungs and pleurae.

704
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,002
That's why the tissue tore
instead of detaching.

705
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,003
Right?

706
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,464
Something kept getting in the way.

707
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,801
Dr. Song, why is there a scar
when you said she had no issues?

708
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,263
I did a thorough check,
but I couldn't find anything.

709
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,933
Nothing came up on the X-ray either.

710
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,690
Her saturation level is dropping.
It's at 94% now, but it'll soon drop more.

711
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,984
She's losing air due to the lung injury.
We need CS right away.

712
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,570
Forceps and Metz.

713
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,996
Let me take a look.

714
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,462
There seems to be an adhesion
in the pleurae and lungs.

715
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,880
Did she suffer from TB before?

716
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,174
She had no underlying conditions.

717
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,394
SHE COUGHED A LOT FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS

718
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,479
MEDICAL HISTORY AND MEDICATION

719
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,734
COUGHED A LOT THE PAST 3 YEARS

720
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,990
I remember her mother wrote on her history
that she had a severe cough.

721
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,493
If the scar was caused by TB,

722
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,121
neither the X-ray
nor the CT scan would've detected it.

723
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,832
Thankfully, the alveoli
aren't too damaged.

724
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,836
We'll suture the torn area,
insert a chest tube, and see how it goes.

725
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,881
-All right. Let's begin.
-Okay.

726
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,508
-I'll hold it.
-Okay.

727
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,404
It's finished.

728
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,579
Dr. Nam, I'll check for any air leaks.
Perform the Valsalva maneuver slowly.

729
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,955
Okay, I'll begin.

730
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,211
Fortunately, there's no leak.

731
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,381
I'll check for any ventilation leaks.

732
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,053
The tidal volume is stable.

733
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,765
Thank you. I'll wrap up now.

734
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,350
Okay. Good luck.

735
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,728
-Please hold this.
-Okay.

736
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,733
Forceps and Freer.

737
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:44,403
The surgery was neither
a life-or-death situation

738
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,364
nor was it a particularly tricky
or hard one.

739
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,535
But looking back on it,
that was the turning point in our lives.

740
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,454
JP, please.

741
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,333
Forceps too.

742
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,923
Jeong-woo seemed
to have overcome everything.

743
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,139
And she seemed
to have found her place once again.

744
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,976
Looking back,

745
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,895
the moment when we fell down

746
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,898
was the turning point in our lives.

747
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,194
The moment when we believed
our lives were over

748
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,031
was a new beginning.

749
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,537
Let them know she'll receive
her second surgery in six months.

750
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,498
If anything comes up,
they can contact me right away.

751
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:40,959
You did well.

752
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,531
Ta-da!

753
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,745
-Gosh, it's so cute.
-So pretty!

754
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,087
All right. We have to catch our flight.
Thank you for everything.

755
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,672
Thank you.

756
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,549
Thank you so much.

757
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,677
Right. Here.

758
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,303
Thank you.

759
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,181
Bye.

760
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,648
Good job.

761
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,651
You too. Should we eat
something nice for dinner?

762
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,697
I actually have to go somewhere.

763
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,116
CHICKEN SKEWERS THAT DUDES REMEMBER

764
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,790
It's a nice day for chicken skewers.

765
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,834
Should we… Let's just go.

766
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:10,799
-Hello.
-Hello.

767
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,967
Hey, Jeong-woo!

768
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,472
What brings you here?

769
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,808
Did you come to see us?

770
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:25,605
Yeah, I did. Okay?
I'm here to find out how bad your food is.

771
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,441
Thanks, Jeong-woo.

772
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,234
I didn't think you'd accept my apology.

773
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,863
I thought I'd never see you again
and I'd just miss you forever!

774
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,865
What's wrong with you?

775
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,578
You're not even going to
say hello or apologize?

776
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,831
How could you eat those skewers
after hurting me like that?

777
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,794
What do you mean "eat"?
I'm just grilling them.

778
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,174
Jeong-woo.

779
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,385
I'm sorry.

780
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:57,637
I am…

781
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,806
so sorry.

782
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,156
Honestly, I thought
you'd never want to see us again.

783
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,616
That was my original plan.

784
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,367
But hey,

785
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,495
if I cut ties with you,

786
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,997
I'd have nothing in life.

787
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,251
Jeong-woo, I'm truly sorry.

788
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,963
We'll pay back all the ad revenue
we secretly took from you

789
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,340
by selling lots of skewers.

790
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,843
Actually back then,

791
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,638
my girlfriend had become pregnant,

792
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,558
and my mom's thyroid cancer
suddenly returned.

793
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,103
I was at my wit's end.

794
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,065
I think that's why I lost my mind.

795
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,109
Hey, is your mother okay now?

796
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,154
Yeah, her second surgery went well.

797
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,031
And I'm having a son soon.

798
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,324
What a relief.

799
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:03,745
By the way, what happened to you?
What's up with you and Ha-neul?

800
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,414
-What do you mean?
-Remember the reunion?

801
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,167
You two came
to Min-ho's restaurant together.

802
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:13,630
Then, she yelled at me over the phone,
demanding that I apologize to you.

803
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,465
Are you two dating?

804
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,425
To be honest--

805
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,343
Jeez.

806
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,513
Hey, you want him to cut ties again
after just being forgiven?

807
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,973
You should watch what you say.

808
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,809
Jeong-woo would be insane
to date that horrible Ha-neul.

809
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:26,935
Hey.

810
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,603
Can I get a glass here, please?

811
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,647
Hi, Chan-yeong.

812
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,440
Hey, Ha-neul.

813
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,735
By the way, what are you doing here?

814
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,696
I invited her.

815
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,781
We are dating.

816
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,991
-What?
-Seriously?

817
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,868
Did you do something wrong?

818
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:46,204
We mean, what in the world happened?

819
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,665
You were sworn enemies back in school.

820
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,125
-So how?
-It just happened.

821
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,042
"Just happened"?

822
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,003
You're so pretty.

823
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,379
You two.

824
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,382
I didn't come here because I missed you.

825
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,343
I saw how you treated
Jeong-woo in the past.

826
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,637
I only called so you'd apologize to him,

827
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,181
so I'm not happy
that he's here drinking with you.

828
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,935
However, I only came here to say
that you should be sorry to Jeong-woo

829
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,437
for the rest of your lives. Got it?

830
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,438
-Okay.
-Okay.

831
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,316
And what were you saying, Chan-yeong?

832
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,277
"Jeong-woo would be insane
to date that horrible Ha-neul"?

833
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,321
Want to see how horrible I can be?

834
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,698
Right. It's rich coming from a guy
who almost wrote

835
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,617
an apology letter
for following her around.

836
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,577
-Gosh.
-What are you talking about?

837
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,579
-Who followed who around?
-Chan-yeong.

838
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,663
Look.

839
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,041
I didn't have any serious feelings.

840
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,960
It's just a memory from our youth.

841
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,337
Something like that.

842
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,007
"Just a memory"?

843
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,217
Why? Why won't it work?

844
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:45,513
I've been at this for three days,
but why am I still stuck?

845
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,307
How do I solve this?

846
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,060
This is driving me crazy.
None of these methods work.

847
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,646
Forget it. I'm done!
I'm not going to college!

848
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,292
Okay, look.

849
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,295
This is the function.

850
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,090
Just find the differential
and substitute this with that.

851
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,759
Jeez, you're so darn noisy.

852
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,599
Hey, Ha-neul.

853
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,143
Do you like Pikachu pork cutlets?
I can buy you some.

854
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,772
How about pork cutlets
with mustard and ketchup

855
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,982
and soda on the side? Okay?

856
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,736
I'll be honest, Ha-neul.

857
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,947
I think you are
the prettiest girl in our school.

858
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:48,034
When you first transferred here,
I thought you were some sort of goddess.

859
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,830
You're the prettiest
top-ranked student I've ever met.

860
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,832
No, you're just the prettiest.

861
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,125
You're just pretty.

862
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:59,337
And you're the dumbest student
I've ever taught.

863
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,214
Pikachu pork cutlet, my foot.

864
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,591
Hey, did you get shocked
by Pikachu or something?

865
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,968
Mr. Han, let me explain.

866
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,096
Ha-neul, I'll take care
of this Pikachu. Go study.

867
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,639
-Bye.
-Thank you.

868
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,557
Sir!

869
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,560
-Come here.
-I'll see you at the snack bar later!

870
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,023
You got it wrong.

871
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,191
No, it wasn't like that.

872
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,069
There was a question
I'd been wrestling with for days.

873
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:27,240
So I was touched
when she solved it for me.

874
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,701
Hey. I did it for my sake, not yours.

875
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:34,414
You kept mumbling and distracting me
from studying, so I solved it for my sake.

876
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:39,377
That's right.
She'd never solve questions for others.

877
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:44,466
How could you be so deluded
when you bad-mouthed her all the time?

878
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:50,221
Come on. I know I did you wrong,
but let's get our facts straight.

879
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,308
You actually did all the bad-mouthing.
We'd just agree with you.

880
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,356
You've gone completely insane!

881
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,484
When did I ever do that?

882
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,568
Probably every day.

883
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,488
You hated seeing
how crazy she was about her studies.

884
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,573
-Right.
-You didn't want to be near her.

885
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,201
-You wished she'd stub her toe.
-Right.

886
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,202
What else did he say?

887
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,245
Remember when she solved that equation?

888
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,580
I'm embarrassed to mention it.

889
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,957
Hey, isn't Ha-neul so obnoxious?

890
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,501
-Of course.
-Totally.

891
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,128
Honestly, I'm better
at calculus than her, right?

892
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,797
-Yeah.
-Not just calculus.

893
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,798
Definitely true.

894
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,800
Your middle name is "Calculus."

895
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,641
It's not true.

896
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,518
Not at all.

897
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,435
Hey.

898
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,356
Jeez!

899
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,067
We were so childish back then, weren't we?

900
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,568
Yeah, we were all immature.

901
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,029
So please forget
that I momentarily liked you.

902
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,239
-Please.
-Please.

903
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,826
Honestly, all the boys back then
liked her at one point.

904
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:57,080
Uk-ryeol from the news club liked her.
Seok-pil from the baseball team did too.

905
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,334
-Was Ha-neul that popular?
-You bet.

906
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,386
I didn't do something wrong, right?

907
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,263
What do you mean?

908
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,722
I mean,

909
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,351
I only called Mu-geun
so he'd give you a proper apology.

910
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:19,811
Maybe I was being too nosy.

911
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,065
You did well.

912
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:28,486
Every time they wrote
new articles about me,

913
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,488
I knew I shouldn't read the comments,

914
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,032
but I couldn't help it.

915
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:38,037
But there was one commenter
who would always defend me.

916
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,290
It was Mu-geun.

917
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,666
Really?

918
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,126
When I saw that, I thought,

919
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,005
"Yeah, I should start forgiving people

920
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,091
and live life with optimism."

921
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,551
That's when you called him.

922
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:53,887
I see.

923
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,346
But…

924
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,684
I'm afraid I heard way too much today
to just be optimistic.

925
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,980
I had no idea my girlfriend
was that popular.

926
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:09,027
Well… Yes, I was.
Boys would occasionally ask me out.

927
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,361
I'd say

928
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,322
it was once every term.

929
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,951
Gosh, you were so popular.

930
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,580
So you never went on a date
because of your studies and work?

931
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,665
"Never went on a date"?

932
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,709
Ba-da said you've always been single.

933
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,212
That's not true.
I told you I'd dated before.

934
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,963
That was true?

935
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,840
-Yes, of course.
-With who?

936
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,927
A guy from my neighborhood
who followed me around for three years.

937
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,887
-When?
-I was a freshman in college.

938
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,307
I felt like a grown-up
once I got to college,

939
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,809
so I thought I'd give dating a try, but…

940
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,895
-But?
-We broke up after five hours.

941
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,022
Studying seemed more fun.

942
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:47,941
Jeez.

943
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,527
You said guys asked you out every term,

944
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,655
so why did you say yes
to him in particular?

945
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,202
It was chilly one night.

946
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,289
And he gave me his jacket.

947
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,709
-That's it?
-Yes.

948
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,336
-Nothing more?
-No.

949
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,173
-Ha-neul.
-Yes?

950
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,841
I can do much better than him.

951
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,262
-I take off my clothes better.
-What are you saying?

952
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,846
I'm serious.

953
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,974
-What? Should I take this off?
-No!

954
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,892
-Should I? Ha-neul.
-Jeez, put it back on.

955
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,394
Isn't dating so fascinating?

956
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,688
Sometimes, you act childish.

957
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,192
Sometimes,
the smallest of things affect you.

958
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,862
But you don't want to be affected.
Right, Hong-ran?

959
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,782
You don't want to get hurt again.

960
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,160
But I won't hurt you. I'll--

961
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,704
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

962
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:43,788
DAUGHTER

963
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,833
Dad, I'll be home soon.
Order some malatang for me.

964
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,171
MS. HONG-RAN

965
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,632
I'll only make you happy.

966
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,468
Is that too cheesy?

967
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,231
Dad, order some tteokbokki
instead of malatang.

968
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,777
"Hong-ran,

969
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,905
I'm different

970
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,199
from your ex-husband."

971
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,494
The spiciest one with extra cheese.

972
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,999
I can't let you go like this, Hong-ran.

973
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,045
-Come on.
-And some glass noodles too.

974
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,714
I really like you, Hong-ran.

975
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,424
Please accept my love.

976
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,384
DAUGHTER

977
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,896
Wait!

978
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,147
Delete.

979
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,484
Damn it!

980
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,654
What do I… How…

981
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,034
Eun-jeong, you see…

982
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,952
Let me explain.

983
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,454
Let's order some tteokbokki first.

984
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,582
You wanted the spiciest one
with cheese and carrots, right?

985
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,167
-Or eggplants and mushrooms--
-Dad.

986
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,335
Yes?

987
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,212
Is there someone you like?

988
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,423
Yes.

989
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:21,010
Did this "Hong-ran"
give me those macarons?

990
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,263
How did you know?

991
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,893
I know you don't follow trends enough
to buy such things yourself.

992
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,772
Was buying me underwear
and raising my allowance

993
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,525
because of her help too?

994
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,402
Yes.

995
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,362
Dad.

996
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,782
The coolest thing to do is
to ask someone out in person.

997
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,283
What?

998
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:48,246
Wear your best clothes and put on
lotion that smells nice before seeing her.

999
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,581
And don't go empty-handed.

1000
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,960
Then, what should I bring?

1001
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,964
Buy her a bouquet of flowers.

1002
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,717
Don't get a big one. Get something small.

1003
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,634
Be nonchalant.

1004
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,053
Okay. Nonchalant?

1005
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,056
Hurry. You should act when you've decided.

1006
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,391
All right, then.

1007
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,643
Let me get dressed up. Okay?

1008
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,693
Hong-ran, can I see you for a minute?

1009
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,906
This late at night? Why?

1010
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,829
I have something to tell you right now.

1011
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,625
What is it about?

1012
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,757
I'll tell you in person.

1013
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,272
Hong-ran.

1014
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,998
Goodness, I'm sorry.

1015
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,001
You said you'd tell me
in person, but you just…

1016
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,921
What did you want to tell me?

1017
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,506
Well…

1018
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,511
Let's just drink
and not worry about the hangover.

1019
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,180
-Let's live like there's no tomorrow.
-Sorry?

1020
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,557
You can hold your liquor,
so why are you worried?

1021
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,309
I can become your hangover drink.

1022
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,729
I like you.

1023
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,358
I like your cute face,
how you take good care of your son,

1024
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:42,401
and your nonchalant way of speaking.

1025
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,863
My feelings for you grew every day.

1026
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:50,576
And they'll continue to grow.

1027
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,037
Give that to me already.

1028
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,223
Thank you.

1029
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,853
-Here.
-Thanks.

1030
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,897
I'll be honest.

1031
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,693
I've become a bit uneasy
now that I know how popular you were.

1032
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,152
Why?

1033
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:29,365
You used to have a million subscribers
on NeoTube and received tons of messages.

1034
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,411
That was only because I was
a plastic surgeon who gave good tips

1035
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,913
and did it in a friendly way
for the viewers.

1036
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:39,500
But you had guys falling
head over heels with just your looks.

1037
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:41,419
That's…

1038
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,963
This won't do.
Have your face covered from now on.

1039
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,381
Oh, please.

1040
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,593
Right. You're not going to move?

1041
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,429
-Move?
-Yeah.

1042
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:55,516
It's cramped and uncomfortable here.
You have money now to find a new place.

1043
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,603
Gosh. But I don't want to.

1044
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,442
You've become so busy nowadays,

1045
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:07,028
so I have to stay here
to see you as much as I can.

1046
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:09,322
You think so?

1047
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,117
Also, your mother, uncle, and Ba-da

1048
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,077
have grown on me.

1049
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,747
I feel closer to them than my own family.

1050
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,460
I want stay here
and continue living with them.

1051
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,050
In that case,

1052
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,636
do you want to join my family?

1053
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:35,973
What?

1054
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,894
I want you to be part of my family.

1055
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:44,941
Oh, no!

1056
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,651
Oh, my gosh!

1057
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,153
-Where are the bandages?
-In the drawer.

1058
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,449
Propose--

1059
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,700
No!

1060
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:00,998
What's all this?

1061
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,797
I bought them for you.

1062
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,967
All of them?

1063
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:12,927
Why did you buy so many?

1064
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,889
I didn't know what you liked,
so I ended up buying one of each.

1065
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,187
But I didn't know what to say
or how to give them to you.

1066
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,691
That's why I haven't been able
to give them to you.

1067
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,444
You're unbelievable.

1068
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,489
Let's put some ointment on first.

1069
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,011
It looks like a ring.

1070
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,513
You're right.

1071
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,433
You prepared so much for me,

1072
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,935
but all I have is this bandage.

1073
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,354
I like this much better.

1074
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,067
Whenever I was struggling or in pain,

1075
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,445
you embraced me like this bandage.

1076
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:17,908
This was the most touching proposal ever.

1077
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,245
Proposal?

1078
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,458
You wanted me to join your family.

1079
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:30,880
What I meant was we should be lovers
who are as close as family.

1080
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,089
Hey!

1081
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,007
Hold on.

1082
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,885
You can't make me swoon and then say that!

1083
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,680
I can't believe
you would do this to me! Gosh.

1084
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,224
-I--
-So you're going to be like this?

1085
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,310
I get it. Okay. Got it.

1086
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,227
Wait.

1087
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,146
Look, I just meant…

1088
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,606
What are you doing?

1089
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:57,907
You're so pretty.

1090
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,619
What is this? It's too much. Jeez.

1091
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:06,457
But I couldn't help it. How much it shines
shows just how much I like you.

1092
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,167
Unbelievable.

1093
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,525
Be my family.

1094
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,322
Be my lover, my friend,

1095
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:40,991
and my wife too.

1096
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,328
I want you to be

1097
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,373
all of them.

1098
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,594
MS. KONG WOL-SEON

1099
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,852
Tell her you have the night shift today.

1100
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:09,979
What?

1101
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,479
DOCTOR SLUMP

1102
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:34,980
I wasn't rejected, was I?

1103
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,732
-Let's fight.
-You can't even get married.

1104
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,818
My chief wants me
to spend six months abroad.

1105
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,071
I feel bad for leaving you here.

1106
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:45,241
I told you. I won't get in the way
of your career.

1107
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,533
Jeong-woo.

1108
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,328
Are you kidding me?
How can I wait for six months?

1109
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,664
Please don't go!

1110
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,375
I'm so proud that you're a modern woman.

1111
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,502
Don't leave me!

1112
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:57,670
CONGRATS ON YOUR US VENTURE

1113
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:58,754
I could be happy today…

1114
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,298
-I hope we continue to get along.
-Okay.

1115
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,342
…and suddenly sad tomorrow.

1116
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,385
Let's go.

1117
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:05,302
But it's okay.

1118
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,637
I'll give it a shot.

1119
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:11,267
If there's sadness,
there will always be happiness as well.

1120
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,271
And that's enough.

1121
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:22,653
