1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,036
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,627
By the way, are you going to stay
at that apartment near the clinic?

3
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,797
-No, I'm going to move back here today.
-Really?

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,967
That way, I'll be able
to see you a bit more.

5
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,136
Right.

6
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,764
-Give me your phone.
-My phone?

7
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,057
-Yeah.
-Why?

8
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,811
Why do you think?
I'm going to change my name.

9
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,522
YEO JEONG-WOO

10
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,815
BOYFRIEND
SAVE

11
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,733
Here.

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,903
Give me yours too.

13
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,947
What? Are you gonna change mine too?

14
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,493
Yes. I'm going to change my name

15
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,661
and erase all the numbers of other women.

16
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,206
Be my guest.

17
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,000
There aren't many,
but erase all the ones you dislike.

18
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,712
I'll only change my name for today.

19
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,172
There. Let's end it here.

20
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,010
The phrase "Let's end it here"
is banned from now on.

21
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,305
-Why?
-That's what you said to break up with me.

22
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,890
"Let's end it here."

23
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,810
I've been traumatized by those words,
so please don't say them.

24
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,770
Why bring that up on such a good day?

25
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,355
This won't do. I'm too uneasy.

26
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,900
Write a promise saying you'll never ask
to break up for the next 100 years.

27
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:53,071
Let's get it notarized tomorrow.
I'll be at ease with the law's protection.

28
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,491
Fine. I won't say that ever again.

29
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,576
Do you mean that?

30
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,203
Promise me.

31
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,330
I promise.

32
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,586
You promised we'll be together forever.

33
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,630
All right.

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,510
By the way,

35
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,179
you're pretty handsome.

36
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,057
Did you know?

37
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,727
You're really beautiful.
You're the prettiest doctor I've seen.

38
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:31,109
You're the most handsome man
I've ever seen in my entire life.

39
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:36,489
You're the prettiest person I've ever met
and will meet for the rest of my life.

40
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,117
You are--

41
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,713
Will you just shut up?

42
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,886
He wasn't talking about us, was he?

43
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,389
No way. Of course not.
We didn't say anything wrong.

44
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,307
Right.

45
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,309
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,228
What were we talking about again?

47
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,232
You said I was the prettiest person
you've ever met and will meet.

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,275
Right.

49
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,486
But back then,
you used to say I was obnoxious

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,239
and that I should've stayed in Busan.

51
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,744
I must've been insane back then.

52
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:29,125
But the things you did were
a little obnoxious. Just a little.

53
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,711
I thought you were pretty though.

54
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,004
-Really?
-Yes.

55
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,006
To be honest,

56
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,468
I didn't like your behavior either
but always thought you were cute.

57
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,303
I see.

58
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,056
Then, you can have this cute face.

59
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,892
-I can?
-Yes. Look at it all you want.

60
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,899
Someone might see us!

61
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,568
You're so cute!

62
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,947
You look so cute even when you're shy.

63
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,950
You're cuter.

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,119
You're the cutest person I've ever met.

65
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,121
You're the cutest in the world.

66
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,791
No, you're the cutest
and the most handsome.

67
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,459
You're cute and sexy.

68
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,344
I'm home.

69
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,637
-Hey.
-Hi, Ha-neul.

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,722
What? You're drinking beer without me?

71
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,308
You know I like beer.
Why didn't you text me?

72
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,434
You're so mean.

73
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,440
Should we say cheers?

74
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,485
What are you doing?
Is this a company dinner?

75
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,070
Are you going to make a toast?

76
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,239
Why can't I?

77
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,826
I wish you all good health and good luck
in all your future endeavors.

78
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,662
Cheers to this beautiful night.

79
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,918
Did you get some good news today?

80
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,045
Good news? No.

81
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,798
You look needlessly happy
for someone without good news.

82
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,384
Really?

83
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,594
Well, there's not much to being happy.

84
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,723
If you think you're happy,
then you are happy.

85
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,353
BOYFRIEND

86
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,399
I'll be in my room then.

87
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,613
Did she pick up a religion?

88
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,074
Or did she win the lottery?

89
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,746
It's neither. I think…

90
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,125
She has bipolar disorder.

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,836
You know. You keep flipping
between happy and depressed.

92
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,340
She's been depressed lately.
But now, she's suddenly happy?

93
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm sure it's bipolar disorder.

94
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,427
Right? She has bipolar disorder.

95
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,060
Hey, Jeong-woo.

96
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,520
Of course, I got home safely.

97
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,774
Why are you so curious? You saw me go in.

98
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,152
Still, I wanted to know.

99
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,740
To be honest, I have so many things
I want to know about you.

100
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,285
Such as what time you go to bed,
how many cups of water you drink,

101
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:13,039
what kind of ice cream you like,
and whether you like it in cups or cones.

102
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,083
Then, should we talk
on the phone all night?

103
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,752
We can ask each other about everything.

104
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,713
Think you can handle it?

105
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,175
I've always been good
at burning the midnight oil.

106
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,765
How many hours do you normally sleep?

107
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,059
About five hours?

108
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,769
-Me too.
-Really?

109
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,022
We both don't sleep much.

110
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,148
You're right.

111
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,776
Maybe it's because I lack sleep,

112
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,821
but I hate it when people talk to me
when I'm about to go to bed.

113
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,742
Me too. I don't like when people
talk to me when I'm upset.

114
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,701
Me too.

115
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,372
I need time alone
to cool down when I'm upset.

116
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,457
I see.

117
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,626
Anything else?

118
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,713
There's one thing
I'm the most curious about.

119
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,134
How does it feel to get back together?

120
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,844
Well…

121
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,181
-It feels better.
-"Better"?

122
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,433
Yeah.

123
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,727
It's better than
when we first decided to date.

124
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,856
How do I put it?

125
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,069
Maybe it was because I still had
a lot of issues that weren't resolved,

126
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,738
but I wasn't sure
if I should've been dating.

127
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,577
But I've decided to conquer them now,
and I want to move on.

128
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,705
I have a different mindset now,

129
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,084
so I feel much more relieved and happier.

130
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,046
I'm glad to hear that.

131
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,509
I miss you.

132
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,892
Do you want to come up?

133
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,019
Right now?

134
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,188
Yeah. Let's have a midnight snack.

135
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,690
How about some fried chicken?
Or jjajang ramyeon?

136
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,859
Jjajang ramyeon sounds good.

137
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,862
Right. Mom made
green onion kimchi yesterday.

138
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,198
-Should I bring some over?
-Holy cow.

139
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,242
Those two go hand in hand.
Bring it right now.

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,869
Okay. Boil some water.

141
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,913
-I'll be there before it heats up.
-Got it.

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,535
Back then, I had no idea

143
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,870
that jjajang ramyeon
and green onion kimchi

144
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,539
could make one's heart race.

145
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:04,001
Since I'm in love, even little things
in life shine as bright as stars.

146
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,591
Why are you still up?
What are you doing with the kimchi?

147
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,304
I was craving some.

148
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,391
Goodness, you're eating it without rice?

149
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,851
This is delicious.

150
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,730
I'll eat this while reading dissertations.
Go to bed, Mom.

151
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,276
Eating kimchi while reading dissertations?

152
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,777
How strange.

153
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,446
Goodness. She didn't clean up.

154
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,284
Goodness.

155
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,852
That was close.

156
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,854
I was so scared that she'd catch me.

157
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,689
Good job sneaking up here.

158
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,566
-All right.
-Gosh, this looks good.

159
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,693
I've never had jjajang ramyeon
this late before.

160
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,661
By the way, it'd be best

161
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,999
to keep our relationship a secret, right?

162
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,001
Well…

163
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
At work, yes.

164
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,882
I don't know when I'll quit,
so I don't see the point of telling.

165
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,885
And our colleagues
could feel uncomfortable about it,

166
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,094
so let's keep it a secret.

167
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,016
Then, what about here?

168
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,602
I mean,

169
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,021
you'll be going to work from now on,

170
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,358
so they'll be curious
about where you're going every day.

171
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:55,988
And if you tell them you're helping me,
they might ask how that came to be.

172
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,992
I'm going to tell them the truth
and say we're dating.

173
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,828
Really?

174
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,539
Of course. Why can't I?

175
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:10,378
I mean, you did all you could
to sneak the kimchi up here.

176
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,463
So I thought you wanted to hide it.

177
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,966
That's because she suddenly appeared,
so I had to make something up.

178
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,718
Of course, I should tell them.

179
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,761
They'll love it.

180
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,639
They love you. Especially my mom.

181
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,265
Really?

182
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,692
What in the world?

183
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,070
My mother-in-law's cooking--

184
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,531
Your mother's cooking is the best.

185
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,157
It's perfect.

186
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,159
You're so silly.

187
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,331
-Eat up.
-Okay.

188
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,000
Jjajang ramyeon
and green onion kimchi go hand in hand.

189
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,085
It's perfect.

190
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,514
Are you cold? I opened the window
to air out the room. Should I close it?

191
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,184
No, it helps me stay awake.
I was full and feeling drowsy.

192
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,020
Are you sleepy?

193
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,319
Then, lie down.

194
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,700
What are you doing?

195
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,162
Why are you slapping the bed?
To show how firm it is?

196
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,081
You know that's not why!

197
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,542
Come here.

198
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,796
Come on. Stop telling me to lie down.

199
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,473
Just lie down for 30 minutes.

200
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,604
Fine.

201
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,647
Only 30 minutes, okay?

202
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,733
Okay.

203
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,331
What?

204
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,378
The door was stuffed with bills yesterday.
Where did they all go?

205
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,756
Goodness! Jeong-woo must be here!

206
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,511
Jeez, he slept with the window open.
He'll catch a cold.

207
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,662
Good morning, Ms. Kong.
I mean, morning. How have you been?

208
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,622
Good. I…

209
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,250
I wasn't meaning to look inside.

210
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,003
The window was open,
so I was going to close it and…

211
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,636
I can explain. You see…

212
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,014
This woman is actually--

213
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,016
What is it?

214
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,269
Okay. I'm leaving now.

215
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,688
Bye.

216
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,689
No, don't…

217
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,821
-Did she leave?
-We're done for.

218
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,370
Jeong-woo,
let's keep this a secret for now.

219
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:15,956
What?

220
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,417
That's not what you said last night.

221
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,127
I was going to tell her,

222
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,881
and all we did was sleep last night.

223
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,343
But she'll easily get the wrong idea
after seeing us like this.

224
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,804
She'll think we did something else.
Then, she'll suddenly get all nosy.

225
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,557
I won't be able to stand it.
Let's keep it quiet for now.

226
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,853
Then… What about my reputation?

227
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,730
She clearly knows we like each other.

228
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:44,068
But she'll think I've already moved on
to another woman and slept with her.

229
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,362
Will my reputation be okay?
No, it won't be.

230
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,489
What if she hates me?

231
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,408
That's… She'll find out the truth later.

232
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,911
-She'll realize it was a misunderstanding.
-What?

233
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,081
We're going to be late.
We'll talk again at the clinic. Bye.

234
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,251
Are you sure she'll understand?
I don't think she will.

235
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,046
Let me take a bottle of water.

236
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,298
I'll tell her I bought it
after working out.

237
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,216
Bye.

238
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,593
Ha-neul, I'm really scared.

239
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,511
Ha-neul.

240
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,140
No!

241
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,899
I have a bad feeling about this.

242
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,076
My goodness!

243
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,164
What's wrong? Why are you so upset?
Was the morning soap opera canceled?

244
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,958
I'm so dumbfounded right now!

245
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,586
I went to the rooftop garden
to get some lettuce.

246
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,963
Jeong-woo finally visited again.

247
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,008
But he wasn't alone.
He was with some girl.

248
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,718
What girl? Who was it?

249
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,261
How would I know?

250
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,848
The window was open, so I went to close it
and happened to look inside.

251
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,226
That's when I saw him
cuddling with some woman in bed!

252
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,394
Was she pretty?

253
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,645
How would I know?

254
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,148
Her entire face
was covered by the blanket!

255
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,900
-Maybe it was Ha-neul.
-Ha-neul?

256
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,445
You didn't see her face.
It could've been Ha-neul.

257
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,073
I'm home.

258
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,451
Where have you been?

259
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,788
I woke up early, so I went for a jog.

260
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,334
I'm so hungry. Mom, let's eat.

261
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,586
Okay.

262
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,176
-What?
-Gosh, I'm so hot.

263
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,219
She must've really gone for a jog.

264
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,890
Does this mean Jeong-woo
really is seeing someone else?

265
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:42,144
Damn it. That little scumbag!

266
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,938
-This is why you can't be nice to anyone!
-Mom.

267
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,775
Jeong-woo's not just anyone.

268
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,110
We know him pretty well.

269
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,946
That's not important!
What's important is that he betrayed her.

270
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,741
I'm going to cook him alive.

271
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,826
Meanwhile, on top
of having bipolar disorder,

272
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,537
Ha-neul's so out of her mind
she's eating green onion kimchi

273
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,289
while reading dissertations.

274
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,249
What am I going to do with that punk?

275
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:09,421
-I should throw him in boiling water!
-Oh, no.

276
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,339
Forget it.

277
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,933
Hello.

278
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,103
Hi. I guess you're going to work.

279
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,856
-Yes.
-You're even wearing a tie.

280
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,238
I'm only wearing this because the clinic
needs to upload my photo on their website.

281
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,823
I had no choice but to wear one.

282
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,408
-I didn't say anything.
-Right.

283
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:44,206
I'm truly happy that you're doing well.

284
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,627
Oh, no. Your tie is a little crooked.

285
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,254
-It is?
-Yes.

286
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,547
It should be fine.

287
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,260
Ms. Kong! Tap!

288
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,263
Goodness, your suit is so dusty.

289
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,307
It shouldn't be dusty at all.

290
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,059
Ms. Kong, not the elbow! Wait!

291
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,479
Ha…

292
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,772
Sorry!

293
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,484
Good luck at work.

294
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,488
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

295
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,614
Have a nice day.

296
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,124
-Jin-woo, didn't we have fun?
-Yes.

297
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,669
It must've been hectic
these past few days.

298
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,504
Working and babysitting.

299
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,089
-Goodness.
-You had it worse, Mom.

300
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,757
You had to take care of your sister.

301
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,551
Jin-woo, have a safe trip.

302
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,846
Don't horse around or remove
your seat belt. Take it easy on Grandma.

303
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,889
I'm not a kid.

304
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,515
Right.

305
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,309
Here. It's a gift.

306
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,603
A gift? What is it?

307
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,604
It's for Mr. Bin.

308
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,315
I drew this to thank him
for catching those ants for me.

309
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,316
Really?

310
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,067
He'll love it.

311
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,360
This is him.

312
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,570
-This?
-Goodness.

313
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,614
He's going to be late for kindergarten.

314
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,365
We have to go now. Okay.

315
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,992
Let's go.

316
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,660
See you this weekend, Jin-woo.

317
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,287
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

318
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,538
You don't have to come out.

319
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,165
-Bye.
-Bye.

320
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,666
Let's go.

321
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,387
What did you want to give me
so early in the morning?

322
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,974
Jin-woo said to give this to you.

323
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,684
-It's a gift.
-A gift?

324
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,731
What is this?

325
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,734
He drew an ant, you, and himself.

326
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,069
I see.

327
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,239
-So this is the ant.
-No, that's you.

328
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,075
I see.

329
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,285
What a nice, cool drawing.

330
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,745
Right.

331
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,207
I bought some macarons on my way here.

332
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,501
You didn't have to.

333
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,129
I prefer soju.
You could've just bought me a drink later.

334
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,589
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

335
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,092
Why would I drink soju with you?

336
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,719
-This is for your daughter.
-It's for Eun-jeong?

337
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,471
Remember what you said last time?

338
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,267
You said she didn't like it
when you'd buy her taiyaki or egg bread.

339
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,062
Kids today are active on social media.
They like pretty, fancy, and cool snacks.

340
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,981
Ones they can take pictures of and upload.

341
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:18,360
So look it up on social media next time
and get her something pretty and fancy.

342
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:19,945
Okay.

343
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:28,370
LA BEAUTE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

344
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,669
Do you want some coffee?
Should we get some downstairs?

345
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:45,220
Dr. Yeo, are you free to take
the photo for our website right now?

346
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes, sure.

347
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,643
We're ready to take it
next to our clinic's logo.

348
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,562
I'll be there.

349
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,818
Let's have coffee next time.

350
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,738
Okay. Well…

351
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,948
Good luck on the photo.

352
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,033
Bye.

353
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,382
Mom, don't be shocked.

354
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,927
The woman you saw this morning was me.

355
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,389
No.

356
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,141
Let's try again.

357
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,479
I have something to tell you.

358
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,773
Jeong-woo and I are dating.

359
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,699
Dr. Yeo, you look so handsome!

360
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,201
You look like a celebrity!

361
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,787
This is insane. You look great.

362
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,582
Dr. Yeo, can you start your channel again
and show how handsome you are?

363
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,959
I'll subscribe and press like. Please?

364
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,295
-I'm not quite ready.
-One minute.

365
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,715
I think you'll look even better
with a bit more makeup.

366
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,051
-You already look good though.
-No, that's okay.

367
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,678
Come on.
You need to look good for the photo.

368
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,933
By the way, are you seeing anyone?

369
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,186
-Sorry?
-I'm just curious.

370
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,687
You don't have a girlfriend?

371
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,274
A girlfriend?

372
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,620
And our colleagues
could feel uncomfortable about it,

373
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,163
so let's keep it a secret.

374
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,333
Gosh, no.

375
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,253
A girlfriend? That's ridiculous.

376
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,631
So you're single too.

377
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,384
Of course, I am.
I don't have a girlfriend.

378
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,302
Dr. Yeo, what's your ideal type?

379
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,220
My ideal type?

380
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,305
Well…

381
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,892
Someone with long hair, big eyes,

382
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,687
and who cares about me more than I do.

383
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,954
Gosh. This is my first time here,
and their food is spicy and delicious.

384
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,665
I should bring Eun-jeong here
for her birthday next month.

385
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,500
She's going to scold you again.

386
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,254
Kids these days prefer food
like pizza and pasta.

387
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,297
You're right.

388
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,966
They like to post photos online.

389
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,474
Ms. Woo, I need you to consult someone
next Friday and book her for surgery.

390
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,810
My aunt's friend wants
an upper blepharoplasty

391
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,021
and a thread lift.
Give her a discount too.

392
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:41,938
Yes, sir.

393
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,442
You two must get
a lot of requests for discounts.

394
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,610
Don't get me started.

395
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,279
"How much is the discount?
How much work I need done?"

396
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,240
Without exaggerating,
I'm asked such questions every day.

397
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,201
They ask how much work they need too?

398
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,327
All the time.

399
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,704
If you become a plastic surgeon,

400
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,498
distant relatives,
former classmates, and even teachers

401
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,375
ask about how much work they need.

402
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,377
But you need to be cautious.

403
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,589
They might think we're judging them
and feel offended.

404
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,551
Still, can you tell me
how much work I need?

405
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,220
Come on.

406
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,347
Are you making me work while I'm eating?

407
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,391
Come on, do it for us
as a perk of working at a clinic.

408
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,977
I want to get an NI double eyelid surgery.

409
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,646
What do you think?

410
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,773
You're already so beautiful.

411
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,609
You are. But if you do get it,

412
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,654
then I think you could become
a little prettier. Just a bit.

413
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,738
What do you think?

414
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,741
I don't think she needs it.

415
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,035
Then, what about me?

416
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,828
What about a mouth corner lift?

417
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,833
Ms. Han, if you get it…
If you end up getting it,

418
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,003
I think you'll look slightly younger.

419
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,673
-I don't think she needs it.
-Really?

420
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,344
Dr. Nam, you're already perfect.
But some fillers in your brow…

421
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,682
So…

422
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,227
You look perfect in this natural state--

423
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,937
No, I think she could get some.

424
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,314
If she gets fillers in her brow…

425
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,534
This rolled omelette is good.

426
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,995
Dr. Yeo.

427
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,247
This is my piece.

428
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:28,169
This rolled omelette had eight pieces,
and there are four people at this table.

429
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,255
Then, the unwritten rule says
we each get two.

430
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,591
You already had your share,
so this is mine.

431
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,886
I'm sorry.

432
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,056
Let's not argue over food.

433
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,517
Ma'am, could we get…

434
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,314
an additional plate
of rolled omelettes for each table?

435
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,773
All right!

436
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,696
Dr. Bin, you should've
bought this coffee--

437
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,573
Come on.

438
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,539
What's the matter?

439
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,875
Do you really not know?

440
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,336
I'm really sorry.

441
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,504
It's like an occupational disease.

442
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,051
I only said you could get the fillers
because it wouldn't be bad.

443
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,427
But you don't need them.

444
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,096
You really don't,
but a lot of people get them nowadays.

445
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,514
Do you want get a beating?

446
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,685
It's an occupational disease? I work too.

447
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,562
You want me to put you to sleep?

448
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,439
Don't say such frightening things.

449
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,234
I mean, you're always scowling,

450
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,403
so I thought… I think it's rather cute.

451
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,449
But since you've always done that,
I guess I felt bad and blurted it out.

452
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,827
Forget it. Yesterday, you said
I was the prettiest person

453
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,247
you've ever met and will meet.
But now, you want me to get fillers.

454
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,292
I can't help but be disappointed
by all your fickle words.

455
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,213
"All"? Did I say something else wrong?

456
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,465
No, it wasn't wrong.
But it was disappointing.

457
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,510
When I asked you to erase the numbers
of other women on your phone,

458
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,928
you were fine with it.

459
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,097
So I thought you were the devoted type.

460
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,431
But you were having a blast

461
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,975
with our female colleagues,
getting your makeup done too.

462
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,019
And what? You don't have a girlfriend?

463
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,731
-Why are you making yourself available?
-What do you mean?

464
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,193
That's really unfair. I only said that
since you wanted it to be a secret.

465
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,530
No, that meant you should keep
our relationship a secret.

466
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,865
I didn't say
you should claim to be single.

467
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,577
You could've just said you were taken.
That hurt my feelings.

468
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,371
My feelings were hurt too, you know.

469
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,290
Remember how your mother choked me today?

470
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,459
And speaking of which,

471
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,586
you even ignored us when she elbowed me.

472
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,131
I thought you'd step in then
and say something.

473
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,924
Do you know how hurt I was?

474
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,760
I had no choice though.

475
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,222
She saw us cuddling in bed.

476
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,224
So how could I tell about that?

477
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,393
I wanted to wait
a few days before telling her.

478
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,187
-Is that so hard to understand?
-That's not what I mean.

479
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,857
I'm just hurt.
You can't even understand that?

480
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,776
You're hurt that I don't understand?

481
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,279
You can't understand that I'm…

482
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,781
What's your MBTI type?

483
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,409
That's such a random question.

484
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,953
Guys? Are you coming or what?

485
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,748
Yes, we're coming.

486
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:15,837
I'm definitely a thinker.

487
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,031
-Are you leaving?
-Am I not supposed to?

488
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,202
You're leaving just like that?

489
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,371
Then, what should I do?

490
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:55,877
Bye.

491
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,754
But…

492
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,006
Hey, wait up.

493
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,430
Gosh.

494
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,059
What in the world? Why did he follow me?

495
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,269
If you have something to say, then say it.

496
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,480
Where's the bus?

497
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,273
Jeez.

498
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,709
Should I talk first?

499
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,338
All right. It wasn't over
anything big anyway.

500
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,757
No!

501
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,761
I'm safe.

502
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,686
No, I wasn't trying to--

503
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,448
I thought he wanted to reconcile,
but he steals my seat?

504
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,370
He's still just as competitive
as he was back then.

505
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,300
What is this?

506
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,179
We should be going on dates
to places like these, but look at us.

507
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,561
Hey, welcome back. For a jobless person,
you were out a while.

508
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,605
What about you?

509
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,232
I bought some ingredients
for seaweed soup.

510
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,775
It's Mom's birthday tomorrow.

511
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,156
No way. Don't tell me you forgot.

512
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,326
Goodness. Look at you.

513
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,204
What's the point of having
a daughter who's a doctor

514
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,498
when I'm the one
who remembers her birthday?

515
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,835
What? What's this?

516
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,422
"Sky Lounge"?

517
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,009
So you did remember her birthday.

518
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,428
-What?
-Right. You've always had a good memory.

519
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,014
Yeah, good thinking.

520
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,185
Other daughters would take their mothers
to go shopping and eat good food.

521
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,355
But you were always too busy
to take her to a nice restaurant.

522
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,232
Did you book a reservation?
If not, then hurry.

523
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,528
Three people, including me.
No. With Uncle Tae-seon, it's four.

524
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,155
Hurry up.

525
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,990
Okay. I'll call them.

526
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,206
Ha-neul.

527
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,375
I'm really sorry about today.

528
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,711
I said your beautiful face needed fillers.

529
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,507
I tried to eat the last piece
of rolled omelette.

530
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,260
And I even said I was single.
I'm sorry for everything.

531
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:11,531
I'm terrible at relationships
and at being a good daughter.

532
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,703
However, what happened on the bus
was a misunderstanding.

533
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,331
I lost balance and fell forward.

534
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,834
What am I doing?

535
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,212
I'm like a kid
writing an apology letter. Come on!

536
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,714
Gosh.

537
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,057
Ha-neul, can I at least see
your face before going to bed?

538
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,809
I miss you.

539
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,147
I need time alone
to cool down when I'm upset.

540
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,295
Hi, Suk-ja. Why did you call
so early this morning?

541
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,882
Come on. A birthday isn't a big deal.

542
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,176
I'm just getting a year older.

543
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,636
Anyway, thank you for calling.

544
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,930
Right.

545
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,558
Is Ha-neul still unemployed?

546
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:27,690
Goodness. She should've treated
her blind date better!

547
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,402
Jeez. She has no job or boyfriend.

548
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,531
Goodness. It's your birthday today,

549
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,284
but I'm sorry you have
nothing to smile about.

550
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,286
Goodbye!

551
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,121
Her dad--

552
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,625
What? Did she hang up on me again?

553
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,795
Damn it. Did she call
to congratulate me or upset me?

554
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,713
What an annoying start to my day.

555
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:55,176
Ha-neul's going to meet someone
much better than that blind date guy.

556
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,512
Much better than him too.

557
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,477
I woke up early, so I went for a jog.

558
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,859
Every store sells that brand of water.

559
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,128
This is delicious.

560
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,548
I'll eat this while reading dissertations.
Go to bed, Mom.

561
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,134
It can't be.

562
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,222
Then, that woman from yesterday

563
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,100
was Ha-neul?

564
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,416
Hey, Jeong-woo.

565
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,209
Hello.

566
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,128
-Are you going to work?
-Yes, I am.

567
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,963
Goodbye, then.

568
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,381
What? Jeong-woo!

569
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,757
Jeong-woo, wait!

570
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,134
Jeong-woo, stop right there!

571
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,594
Ms. Kong!

572
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,053
Hold on!

573
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,640
Goodness, I see dust.

574
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,272
Jeong-woo.

575
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,941
I really like you.

576
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,068
-Sorry?
-I always have.

577
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,113
For Ha-neul's sake the other day,

578
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,782
I know you kept it a secret
and didn't tell me the truth.

579
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,618
That made me like you more.

580
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,828
You're qualified to be her boyfriend.

581
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,581
What do you mean?

582
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,460
That woman in your bed was Ha-neul, right?

583
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,048
No. It wasn't her. It was someone else.

584
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,468
GIRLFRIEND

585
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,386
Pick it up.

586
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,310
Hey.

587
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,563
Did you go to work?

588
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,024
I'm about to.

589
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,109
I see. Okay.

590
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,611
Have a good day.

591
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,407
Can I see you later at night?

592
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,369
Sure.

593
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,038
I'll call you later. Bye.

594
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,626
That must've been your girlfriend.

595
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:38,047
Her number looked very familiar though.

596
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,217
The last four digits were 0402.

597
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,595
Ms. Kong.

598
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,640
I assure you nothing happened that night.

599
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,351
Whether that's true or not,
it's not my business.

600
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,314
She must be too embarrassed to tell me.

601
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,359
I'll play dumb,
so I hope you two get along.

602
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,570
Goodness! How long were you
going to hide it?

603
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,740
You two sure make things complicated.

604
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,454
-Jeong-woo.
-Yes?

605
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,374
Did you know that it's my birthday today?

606
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,335
No, I didn't. Happy birthday, Ms. Kong.

607
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:20,798
Then, could you do me a favor
as a birthday present?

608
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,218
What is it?

609
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,185
This is amazing!
I can't believe you brought me here.

610
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,688
Thank you so much, Ha-neul.

611
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,065
Come on. You should thank me instead.

612
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,443
She just made
a reservation and paid for it.

613
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,820
I was the one
who said we should come here.

614
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,155
So you should thank me.

615
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,407
By the way,

616
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,743
what are you wearing?

617
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,079
I got this outfit as a gift
after finding Seok-won his bride.

618
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,332
Then, it's about 20 years old.

619
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:58,044
It's not as old as I thought.
I thought it was from the 1800s.

620
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,795
You want to get hit 1800 times?

621
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,339
Then, buy me some clothes.

622
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,631
Mom.

623
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,970
Hello. Did you make a reservation?

624
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,139
-Yes.
-It's under "Nam Ha-neul."

625
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,515
For three.

626
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,979
-This way, please.
-Okay.

627
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,649
What's with the Seoul accent?

628
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,153
You already know I can speak
in both Seoul and Busan dialects.

629
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,198
When I'm with women
or come to fancy places like this,

630
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,033
I use the Seoul dialect.

631
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,285
"I use."

632
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,713
The appetizers are apple tart
and rosemary crusted chicken.

633
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,592
The sweet flavor of the apples
will stimulate our appetites.

634
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,098
Right. Could you recommend
a nice bottle of champagne too?

635
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,141
We're celebrating today.

636
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,020
Sure, we'll prepare something
that pairs well with the steak.

637
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,732
You got to be kidding me.

638
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,403
What's wrong with you? You sound so gross.

639
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,696
-Tell me about it.
-What do you mean "gross"?

640
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,658
Busan girls love it
and say I sound intelligent and sweet.

641
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,827
This is why I'm popular.

642
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,912
I use the Busan dialect with Seoul girls

643
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,373
and the Seoul dialect with Busan girls.

644
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,125
I see. Good for you.

645
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,091
Excuse me.
We're expecting one more person.

646
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,136
Could we have another plate and glass?

647
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,430
Sure, I'll get them for you.

648
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,514
What?

649
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,058
We're expecting someone else? Who?

650
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,311
Who else? Probably Uncle Tae-seon.

651
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,313
Is he closing early?

652
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,461
Jeong-woo, why are you here?

653
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,171
Your mother invited me.

654
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,423
Happy birthday.

655
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,092
Thank you for coming.

656
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,886
What is this?

657
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,929
Did you forget he's our family's enemy?

658
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,140
You said he was in bed with another woman!

659
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,725
That woman was your sister.

660
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,727
Seriously?

661
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,731
I wasn't the one who told her.

662
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,068
That's right. We're dating.
He's my boyfriend.

663
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,821
Ba-da. Show him some respect.

664
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,282
You shouldn't bother him either, Mom.

665
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,493
I won't sit still if you elbow him again.

666
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,829
Share your good side dishes
and lower his maintenance fees.

667
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,874
-Treat him well.
-Of course. That won't be a problem.

668
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,668
-I won't charge rent either.
-That's okay.

669
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,587
Who charges their own family rent?

670
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,006
You're pretty much one of us now.

671
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,346
Hi, my brother-in-law.
Please treat Ha-neul well.

672
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,098
I thought she had bipolar disorder,
but she really was happy.

673
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,892
You made a great decision.

674
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,186
What is this? Some kind of huddle?

675
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:06,106
Are we playing for the World Cup?
Don't be so dramatic and sit down.

676
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,902
-We need to talk.
-What?

677
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,737
Okay.

678
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,909
What's going on?

679
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,870
Well, I ran into your mother this morning,

680
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,498
and she knew everything.

681
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,168
I wasn't going to tell her for your sake.

682
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,548
But you happened to call me right then.

683
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,051
I see. That's why you sounded so awkward.

684
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,137
You didn't sound too happy,

685
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,931
so I thought you were still upset.

686
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,059
Why would I be? It was my fault anyway.

687
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,188
Jeez. Then, why didn't you call me?

688
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,690
I wanted to.

689
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,568
I wanted to call you over a hundred times,

690
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,030
but I remembered you said
you needed time alone to cool down.

691
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,074
Hey.

692
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,451
That's when I'm upset about other things.

693
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,787
If it's about us,
I'd rather make up quickly.

694
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,746
Do you mean that?

695
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,458
Gosh. What was I doing yesterday?

696
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,961
I was too sad to sleep.

697
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,254
You didn't sleep?

698
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,213
Did you?

699
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,549
I sleep when I'm upset.

700
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,175
That's a good habit.

701
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,435
I'm sorry, Ha-neul.

702
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,187
I'm sorry about yesterday.

703
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,609
And I'm sorry about any fights
we'll have in the future.

704
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,154
-You don't know what we'll fight about.
-That doesn't matter.

705
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,785
Your mother must be waiting. Let's hurry.

706
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,421
Thank you for coming.

707
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,927
I was worried
you wouldn't be happy to see me.

708
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,555
So thank you.

709
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,145
Right.

710
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,106
But the bus incident
is a misunderstanding.

711
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,651
I lost balance and fell.

712
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,653
You saw me flying forward, right?

713
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,739
Fine. I'll believe you if you want.

714
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,202
What? No, that's not it.

715
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,371
-It's true.
-Back then, I had no idea.

716
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,331
I didn't know dating could be this hard.

717
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,835
I feel hurt, sorry, and grateful

718
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,504
on a whole different level.

719
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:38,592
All the most trivial things
feel so tremendous.

720
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,511
-Cheers.
-Bravo!

721
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:41,970
Bottoms up.

722
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:42,888
Okay.

723
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,648
You don't do that with champagne.

724
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,068
You shouldn't drink
since you're going back to work.

725
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,737
It's okay.
I didn't have any surgeries today,

726
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,072
so I took the afternoon off.

727
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,782
Well done.

728
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,243
-What a smart guy.
-Thank you.

729
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,453
Today, let's drink until we keel over.

730
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,455
-Yes, ma'am.
-How ridiculous.

731
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,583
Hey, that's too much--

732
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,168
She wants to give me a lot.

733
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,837
Please fill it to the brim.

734
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,255
-Thank you.
-Okay.

735
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,759
Take it easy.
You have surgery tomorrow morning.

736
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,555
You even know his schedule.
You're so obsessed.

737
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,474
No, I'm not. I know
because we're doing it together.

738
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,767
Do it together? Do what?

739
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,146
Well… To be honest,

740
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,523
I've been helping him out in the OR.

741
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,404
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

742
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,531
It's not permanent though.

743
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,700
I didn't want to stay home all the time.

744
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:48,328
I'm only helping him out briefly
while figuring out what to do.

745
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,667
Are you okay?

746
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:59,381
What? Did you expect her to return
to her hospital to become a professor?

747
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,883
Are you disappointed?

748
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:05,429
No, I'm not.
I'm just glad she's doing something again.

749
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,475
My daughter brought me
to a fancy restaurant like this,

750
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,061
and she's sitting next to her boyfriend.

751
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,063
She even got a job.

752
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,735
It truly feels like my birthday today.
I'm on cloud nine.

753
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,115
You should be smiling then, not crying.

754
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:28,911
All right.

755
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,329
Let's drink.

756
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:35,876
Whoever walks out of here sober
is a traitor.

757
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,545
-Yes, ma'am.
-What are you talking about?

758
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,343
Drink slowly or you'll get drunk.

759
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,263
Here!

760
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,556
Unbelievable!

761
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,892
Okay. Hang in there!

762
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,061
You're almost there!

763
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,312
We're here!

764
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:56,772
Goodness.

765
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,440
Jeez.

766
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,358
Here.

767
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,902
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

768
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,951
What's wrong?

769
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,084
-There's a flower behind your ear.
-What?

770
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,380
When did she put this here?

771
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,839
Beats me.

772
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,924
Goodness.

773
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,009
Where are you, Ha-neul?

774
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,011
What are you doing?

775
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:28,929
Here.

776
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,892
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

777
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,448
Are the macarons good?

778
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,868
Yes. It's unlike you
to buy something like this.

779
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,079
Well, my colleague--

780
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,582
No, someone I know--

781
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,544
A friend?

782
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,670
Who was it?

783
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,715
Anyway, someone wanted you to have them.

784
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,341
Want to try one?

785
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,679
How about this one? It's chocolate.

786
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,473
Gosh. How did you know I like chocolate?

787
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,397
-Not bad.
-It's good, right?

788
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,691
-Yeah.
-We're finally on the same page.

789
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,652
-You should buy more stuff like this.
-Okay.

790
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,118
What's gotten into her? She smiled.

791
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,919
Hong-ran, thank you for the macarons.

792
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,546
My daughter loves them.

793
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,561
Dad, my friends want to--

794
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,980
What is this? Isn't this blood?

795
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,650
Why do you have my underwear? Gross.

796
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,319
Bin Eun-jeong, tell me the truth.

797
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,238
Are you being bullied?
Did someone hit you?

798
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,950
What are you talking about?
I would've bled a lot more if I was hit.

799
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,411
Then, what is it? Why can't you tell me?

800
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,537
Darn it.

801
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,253
The wire from my bra
poked out and cut me, okay?

802
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,508
That happens?

803
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,178
Then, you should've told me about it.

804
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:36,390
How can I possibly ask you
to buy me a bra? It's embarrassing.

805
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,100
Wait, Eun-jeong.

806
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:49,986
BRAS FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS

807
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,168
-What are you doing here?
-Hello.

808
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,879
"Bras for middle school girls"?

809
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:08,797
What?

810
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,510
They're… They're not for me.

811
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,679
Of course, they're not.

812
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,596
Right.

813
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,809
No, wait.

814
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,310
No!

815
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,479
It's for Eun-jeong.

816
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,733
I was looking it up for her.

817
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,902
That's true. If you wear
an old bra for too long,

818
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,654
the wire will poke out sometimes.

819
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:37,492
Goodness. Why do you think
she never told me about it?

820
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,121
Because you're her dad.
Girls her age are sensitive.

821
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,915
Give her your card
and tell her to buy a nice one.

822
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,333
I was going to,

823
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,128
but she stormed out
and won't read my texts.

824
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,173
You know that underwear store
near our clinic?

825
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,717
-Yes.
-I thought I'd buy something there.

826
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,511
But I don't know what to buy.

827
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,723
Then, want me to come with you?

828
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,309
Would you?

829
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,570
How's this one?

830
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,155
Good.

831
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,408
May I help you?
Is there anything you need?

832
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,203
Is this 100% cotton?
Is it sweat absorbing?

833
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,746
Of course.

834
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:26,458
It's wireless and perfect for students.

835
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,127
Then, I'd like three sets in nude,

836
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,962
and two shorts to wear under the uniform.

837
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,464
All right, then.

838
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,801
You're very caring parents.

839
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,221
It's rare for both parents
to shop for their daughter's underwear.

840
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,265
Right. Would you like me
to recommend one for you too?

841
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,934
This is a new design.

842
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,811
I'm not his wife.

843
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,897
We're not married.

844
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,735
I bought just a few,
so tell her to try them on.

845
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,986
Okay. Thank you.

846
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:59,658
And try to be more nonchalant
about sensitive matters.

847
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,870
She could feel more embarrassed
if you're awkward about it.

848
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,788
Okay.

849
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,499
Thank you for buying them for me

850
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,044
and giving me advice. Thank you so much.

851
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,630
Don't mention it.
You've helped me a lot too.

852
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,342
I should get going now.

853
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,760
Okay.

854
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,012
Good night.

855
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,608
Goodness.

856
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,279
Why did you have to drop them?

857
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,996
Jeez.

858
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,795
Thank you for today.

859
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,215
My mom is such an embarrassment.

860
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,302
No, she's not. She's great.

861
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,764
I'm so envious of your family.

862
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:10,854
When I look at you, I can tell your family
doted on you as you grew up.

863
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,817
I know their love and expectations
were a burden on you at times.

864
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,613
But I could feel how your family
truly cared about you,

865
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,073
and that often made me envious.

866
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,325
My family isn't like yours.

867
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,915
By the way, how come
you've never asked about my family?

868
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,336
-What?
-Well, they never came to my hearings.

869
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,714
I never mentioned
my parents to you either.

870
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:42,469
You could've found that strange.
But I was surprised how you never asked.

871
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,680
Right. About that…

872
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,518
Actually, I've seen your mother before.

873
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,981
Near the nurse's office
when we were seniors.

874
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:55,899
Sir.

875
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,777
I heard he's just anemic.

876
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,570
Fainting while studying isn't uncommon.

877
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,114
And you made me come here for this?

878
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,201
Not only are his grades falling
but he also ended up like that.

879
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,120
How could he not come
in first even in high school?

880
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,126
Then, you do know what my family is like.

881
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,214
You must've been surprised
since we're so different.

882
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,132
Rather than being surprised,

883
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,803
I just thought you'd be lonely.

884
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,645
What kind of people are your parents?

885
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,402
First, they're both
cardiothoracic surgeons.

886
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:45,448
My father is a professor
at a medical school in the US.

887
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:49,119
Recently, he became the first Asian chair
of the American Heart Association.

888
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,705
My mother's a researcher
at my father's school too.

889
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,874
They're incredible.

890
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,751
They are.

891
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,088
But because of that,

892
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:03,633
they always wanted me
to follow in their footsteps.

893
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,595
When I chose to study plastic surgery,

894
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:11,016
they were totally against it
when they found out.

895
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,270
They couldn't understand why
I didn't choose to support them

896
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,521
in researching the heart.

897
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,066
They scolded me
for taking a different path

898
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,193
than the one they paved for me.

899
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,821
Gosh. They just couldn't understand.

900
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,533
So? How did you convince them?

901
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,243
I didn't.

902
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,039
They still don't understand to this day.

903
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,338
I sometimes felt bad about it.

904
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,676
I always gave them
what they wanted in life,

905
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,304
so I regretted
not following in their footsteps.

906
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,391
But not too long ago,

907
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,560
you know I went through
some serious hardship.

908
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,439
My mother found out and called.

909
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,069
So I thought she was worried about me.

910
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,029
But guess what she said?

911
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:10,325
She told me to make sure
it wouldn't affect them.

912
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,328
When I heard that,

913
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,207
every ounce of regret I had
just disappeared.

914
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,422
I don't think they'll ever understand me.
We'll always be strangers.

915
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,011
-You must've been so lonely.
-I was.

916
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,555
But thankfully,

917
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,350
I quickly learned
how to fill that loneliness.

918
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,895
Everyone has

919
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:42,440
something they can never attain
no matter how much they try.

920
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,153
For me, I always thought
that was love from my parents.

921
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:53,743
But aside from that,
I had many other things.

922
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,455
So I tried to be grateful
and worked hard as I stayed focused.

923
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,127
Doing that seemed to make me feel better.

924
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,590
Then, there wasn't anyone else
you could talk about this with besides me?

925
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,342
Well…

926
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,803
Min Kyung-min?

927
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,060
We met when I was a senior,
and we were like brothers since then.

928
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,604
Then, was it my fault--

929
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,022
It's not your fault.

930
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,401
He's not a good person.
Look what he did to you.

931
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,778
But still.

932
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,781
Actually, I had a hunch.

933
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,452
I had a feeling
that maybe he wasn't a good person.

934
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,291
There were times when he seemed a bit odd.

935
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,422
"Director Min Kyung-min."

936
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,257
Gosh.

937
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,510
Professor Min-- Right.

938
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,638
Should I call you
Director Min from now on?

939
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,764
It's up to you.

940
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,433
Please sit down, sir.

941
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,144
You got a nice view here.

942
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,688
Right?

943
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,441
I was sad to see you go
as soon as you became a professor.

944
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,777
But now that I'm here, I get it.
I would've quit right away too.

945
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,572
You shouldn't quit.

946
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,659
-You're the backbone of the hospital.
-Please.

947
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,207
By the way, our department needs
a new pharmaceutical supplier.

948
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,754
As you already know, we spend
a hefty sum on medicine each year.

949
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,715
But it would be a shame

950
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,551
to give this opportunity
to people I'm not close with.

951
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,097
Then, may I take you up on that offer?

952
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,772
You know I always repay you
for your kindness.

953
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:51,027
How about we discuss the details
sometime soon over a round of golf?

954
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,613
You always pick up on things quickly.

955
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,949
You won't be disappointed.

956
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,034
Good. We're in the same boat anyway.

957
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:13,383
The numbers indicate you've improved.
How do you feel?

958
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:18,388
I've been trying
to put the past behind and move on.

959
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:22,225
I also realized I have
many people who care about me.

960
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,310
I'm also working again,

961
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,604
and it makes me feel important.

962
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,899
That's what we call self-esteem.

963
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,610
Self-esteem

964
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,822
is like a tower of pebbles
you stack every day.

965
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:39,492
It crumbles the moment you have doubts
and think, "What's the point?"

966
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,704
Have confidence, believe in yourself,

967
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,957
and continue to stack those pebbles up.

968
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,795
Then, before you know it,
you'll have a house or a sturdy castle.

969
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,342
I think we can lower your dosage now.

970
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,179
Okay.

971
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,725
I was getting stronger
than I'd been in the past.

972
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,358
Dr. Nam, I'll begin
the rib cartilage harvest.

973
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,569
Could you administer
some muscle relaxants?

974
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,196
Okay. I administered some 30 minutes ago,

975
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,616
so I'll administer
20 mg of rocuronium right now.

976
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,160
Thank you. Local anesthesia.

977
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,925
I was also proud of how well
Jeong-woo was holding up.

978
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,555
Hey, Jeong-woo.

979
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,518
Should we go to a bar
and have a glass of whiskey tonight?

980
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,355
Sure.

981
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,397
I'd love to,

982
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,941
but you could've just asked me
back in the office.

983
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,861
Well, colleagues who date each other

984
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,405
all seemed to meet up in the stairwell.

985
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,283
So…

986
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,244
I wanted to try it too.

987
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:06,788
Come on.

988
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,081
How silly.

989
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,001
Hello?

990
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,130
Today? No, I'm busy.

991
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,675
Maybe in two months?

992
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:26,307
We wanted to believe
that only good things awaited us.

993
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:32,772
Even if it wasn't astonishing,
we hoped to have a decent life.

994
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,067
We desperately prayed for this small wish.

995
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:53,501
We used to always drink beer and soju,
so now this whiskey is…

996
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,585
Is it too strong?

997
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,130
No, I love it.

998
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,725
By the way, about what you said last time…

999
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,353
You said Kyung-min seemed odd at times.

1000
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,022
Can you tell me about that?

1001
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,904
I think

1002
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,283
he once spiked my drink.

1003
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,369
What?

1004
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,121
When I got into medical school,

1005
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,374
he bought me a drink
for the first time to congratulate me.

1006
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,502
But I ended up in the ER that day.

1007
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,386
I think I'm too drunk.

1008
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,861
Professor.

1009
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:46,447
His blood alcohol level was high,

1010
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,534
and we found traces of Ambien.

1011
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:50,868
Ambien?

1012
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,955
I heard he was taking medication
for his insomnia.

1013
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,832
He shouldn't have had so much alcohol.

1014
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,211
Why did you sweep that
under the rug instead of looking into it?

1015
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,923
I wasn't sure whether what I saw

1016
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:08,553
was real, a dream, or an illusion.

1017
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,892
And objectively, it didn't make sense.

1018
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:19,480
If he wanted to hurt me,
he would've used something stronger.

1019
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,065
He wouldn't have used Ambien.

1020
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:24,151
if it's mixed with alcohol,
that's still dangerous.

1021
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,654
Your cognitive abilities drop,
and you become delirious.

1022
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,949
You can't control your impulses,
so you could do something dangerous.

1023
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,494
But what would he get
out of doing that to me?

1024
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,004
How was he after that incident?

1025
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,339
He was the same as always.

1026
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,551
He was still just as friendly

1027
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,221
and supported me all along like a brother.

1028
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:57,143
Nothing like that ever happened again,

1029
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,936
so I guess I forgot about it.

1030
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,523
To be honest,

1031
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,444
if there was even the tiniest possibility…

1032
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,365
I wanted to believe him.

1033
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,746
Because you relied on him a lot?

1034
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,083
No.

1035
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,045
For my sake.

1036
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,133
If he really had done that…

1037
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,803
I would've felt so pitiful.

1038
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:44,398
I had forgotten about that incident.

1039
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,152
But after learning what he did to you,

1040
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,616
I'm starting to think
that maybe what I saw was real.

1041
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,035
It scares me.

1042
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,253
Yes, Professor Kim. I'll see you
this weekend on the golf course.

1043
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,630
Okay.

1044
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:12,009
Also, about your daughter's paintings
from her exhibition you mentioned…

1045
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,679
Our company has decided
to purchase all of them.

1046
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:18,265
It's my pleasure. I liked the drawings.

1047
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,518
I'll see you this weekend.

1048
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,269
Goodbye.

1049
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,065
Come in.

1050
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,207
What brings you here?

1051
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,211
You need to keep your promise.

1052
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:00,599
Are you okay?

1053
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,360
I hope we weren't wrong

1054
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,280
about things looking up.

1055
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,857
DOCTOR SLUMP

1056
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,110
Doesn't it feel
like we've gone back in time?

1057
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,071
Stop right there!

1058
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,655
Cheers!

1059
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,199
I like how things are right now.

1060
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,243
I hope this peace will continue to last.

1061
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,999
Are you involved
in Jeong-woo's medical accident?

1062
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,669
You're curious about many things.

1063
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:17,802
Taking a stroll at night
without a care in the world.

1064
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,264
Was wishing for such a day
asking for too much?

1065
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:28,562
