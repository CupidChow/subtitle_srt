00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,036
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,414
Here's our next story.

3
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:43,752
It's been revealed that a Korean doctor
was involved in the shocking death

4
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,547
of a casino heiress
from Macau last spring.

5
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,341
Here's our reporter
Jeong Chae-hong with more.

6
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,888
It's been revealed that "A,"
an anesthesiologist and an executive

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,724
at a pharmaceutical company,
contributed to the death of Chang

8
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,644
by providing a gang from Macau with drugs,
such as heparin, in return for shares.

9
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,107
In addition, he paid large amounts
of kickbacks to a university hospital,

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,026
which has shocked the public.

11
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,737
But with A's death
from a car accident three weeks ago,

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,114
the charges and the case
have been dismissed.

13
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,075
The car accident before his death…

14
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,827
Why are you watching this?
It's nothing good.

15
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,746
Why not?

16
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,791
I have to know to see
if I need to console Ha-neul or not.

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,253
So Haesung Pharmaceutical
caused the car accident on purpose.

18
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,423
The police were closing in,
so they decided to kill him off.

19
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,383
Ha-neul could've been in huge danger.

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,724
It's awkward to see you
in normal clothes again.

21
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,601
Right.

22
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,103
What did your doctor say?
Are you doing better now?

23
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,857
Yeah, he said I'm progressing well
and to come in two weeks to check.

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,192
Goodness. Okay.

25
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,445
Good job. Let's go home.
I made some beef bone soup last night.

26
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,613
You can go first.

27
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,199
I have to stop by somewhere.

28
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,535
DAEHAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

29
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,495
Come in.

30
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,749
Dr. Nam.

31
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,253
-How have you been?
-Good.

32
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,547
-How about you?
-It's always the same for me.

33
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,174
-Sit down.
-Okay.

34
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,305
I quit so suddenly then

35
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,017
and didn't even get to
say goodbye. I'm sorry.

36
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,561
Don't be.

37
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,396
As the Chief of Anesthesiology,

38
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,440
I apologize for not knowing
what happened in our department.

39
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,235
He stole your dissertation and position.

40
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,571
In a way, your youth was stolen.

41
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,739
You must have suffered so much.

42
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,994
Dr. Nam. I'm truly sorry.

43
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:42,996
It's all right.

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,207
I know it's late, but you should return
to your rightful place.

45
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,588
You played a key role
in removing corruption from our hospital

46
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,756
and leading us in the right way.

47
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,177
Your return will help
both you and the hospital

48
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,889
in recovering lost reputations.

49
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,147
Seriously? They offered
a full-time assistant professor role?

50
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,859
Hey, Ha-neul!

51
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,776
Congratulations!

52
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,530
What's the matter?

53
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,242
You always said your ultimate goal in life
was to become a professor.

54
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,368
It's just feels

55
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,497
like I got rid of people
to get this position.

56
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,041
It feels wrong.

57
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,084
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,296
Those who did wrong were punished,

59
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,298
and you're taking your rightful place.

60
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,718
This was how it should've been.
But you just took a detour.

61
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,762
I'll be honest.

62
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,016
I'm not sure

63
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,394
if I can go back and do well…

64
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,899
or if I'm even completely better now.

65
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,321
This is tough.

66
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,823
Gosh, I'm hungry. What should we eat?

67
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,533
Cold noodles? Kongguksu?

68
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,912
Or spicy webfoot octopus
to relieve stress?

69
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,413
-Anything's--
-"Anything's fine."

70
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,791
Guys who say that are the most boring.

71
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,794
So pick. Cold noodles? Kongguksu?
Spicy webfoot octopus?

72
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,087
Or something else?

73
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,429
-Hey.
-What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,140
Lunch is on me!

75
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,394
-Coffee too!
-Jeez.

76
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,276
I'm sorry, but my schedule's empty
this afternoon. Can I go home early?

77
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,611
Of course, you can.

78
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,113
What? Is something up?

79
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,948
I think I have to hear

80
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,118
about what happened in person.

81
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,163
Please follow instructions
during your visit of inmates.

82
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:54,002
Giving inmates food or items
from the outside is prohibited.

83
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,296
Physical contact
with inmates is not allowed.

84
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,516
The case is closed,

85
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,602
but I came because I needed
to know something.

86
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,732
What was written on the note

87
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,277
you received from Kyung-min?

88
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,114
It said he had something to say…

89
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,869
about the medical accident.

90
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,082
I actually didn't know
Haesung was involved back then.

91
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,712
I was shocked that he knew about it,
so I decided to go talk to him.

92
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,424
He suggested we lower the heparin dosage.

93
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,803
He said the CCTV cameras would be broken,

94
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,474
which meant the surgery
wouldn't be recorded anyway.

95
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,894
He didn't want there to be

96
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,105
a fatal accident at your clinic.

97
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,875
MOM

98
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,256
Hello?

99
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,842
Why haven't you been picking up?

100
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,219
I've been worried sick.

101
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,138
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,767
I saw the news. I can't believe
you were close with that lowlife.

103
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,311
Being in pain because of him
is a waste of time.

104
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,355
I have a question.

105
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,356
What is it?

106
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,110
Right before my CSATs,
Kyung-min was sick and took time off.

107
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,278
Did you know

108
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,367
his father had… passed away?

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,451
I did.

110
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,287
I didn't tell you
so it wouldn't distract you.

111
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,290
I was so flustered that it happened
right before your exam.

112
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,584
Thank goodness you got into HNU.

113
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,254
I wouldn't have sat still
if you ruined your exam.

114
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,674
Right. Are you free on Saturday?

115
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,927
I've been meaning to visit,
but I've had no time.

116
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,179
We're coming to Seoul
for your father's conference.

117
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,806
I hope we can meet then.

118
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm a bit busy, so I'll call you back.

119
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,038
I was only hospitalized for three weeks,

120
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,999
but the world had changed a lot.

121
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,002
It was almost the end of summer.

122
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,879
The air had become cool.

123
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,214
And now,

124
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,341
Kyung-min was gone.

125
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,762
Get in.

126
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,851
What if we hadn't met that night?

127
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,395
What if…

128
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,148
I had forgiven him then,

129
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,693
would things be better now?

130
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,364
Our what-if questions

131
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,075
continued to torment us.

132
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,372
-Did you just get off work?
-Yeah.

133
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,000
I was going to call you.

134
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,045
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you were discharged.

135
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,880
Don't be. I'm not a kid.

136
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,718
Let's go.

137
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,599
How was your day?

138
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,185
It was okay.

139
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,437
How was yours?

140
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,148
Good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

141
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,154
We knew it'd be
too painful for each other,

142
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,741
so we each dealt with
our sadness on our own.

143
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,577
We never agreed to do it,

144
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,997
but we pretended to be okay
in front of each other.

145
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,169
We didn't know how to deal
with such immense sadness.

146
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,423
So we pretended like everything was fine.

147
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,343
DOCTOR SLUMP

148
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,429
Eat up. You too, Jeong-woo.

149
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,556
Okay. Thank you.

150
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,393
Your food is always so good,
so I can't help but eat a lot.

151
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,436
Especially the stir-fried fish cakes.

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,189
I'm amazed each time I eat them.
How are they so good?

153
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,607
There's a reason for that.

154
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,192
She used to run a fish cake factory.

155
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,529
Even though we had to close it
since popular brands took over,

156
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,115
she uses her expertise
to pick the best fish cakes.

157
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,077
Since you seem to love them,

158
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,080
I should buy a box of them
when I visit Busan this weekend.

159
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,083
-You're going to Busan this weekend?
-Yeah, on Saturday.

160
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,253
We always visit
around this time of the year.

161
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:52,258
It's not hot and there's a cool breeze.
The weather's perfect for going out.

162
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,343
We eat good food

163
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,639
and visit people we miss.
That's what we do.

164
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,684
Ha-neul is usually too busy.

165
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,978
So normally, it's just us
and Uncle Tae-seon.

166
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,063
I'm planning to go this time.

167
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,065
Goodness. Just stay here.

168
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,276
Your ribs are still healing.

169
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,194
What if you break them again?

170
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,946
They're held in place with metal plates.

171
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,907
When other patients are discharged,

172
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,826
they all take the train or fly home.

173
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,161
Still.

174
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,746
And…

175
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,665
I want to visit again.

176
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,003
Okay. Let's go.

177
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,172
Let's get some fresh air too.

178
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,428
In that case,

179
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,306
is it okay if I come too?

180
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,308
-You too?
-You too?

181
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,313
Okay.

182
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,107
You're really going with us?

183
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,236
Why not? It's hot. I can't go?

184
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,947
Of course, you can.

185
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,950
Because of our uncle's shop,
it's only for a day. You'll be tired.

186
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,580
I'm okay. I didn't want to be in Seoul
this weekend, so things worked out.

187
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,832
What?

188
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,127
It's nothing.

189
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,090
How are Jeong-woo and Ha-neul doing?

190
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,676
I'm not sure.

191
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,262
I don't know if they're really okay
or just pretending to be.

192
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,183
Doesn't it seem like
they've bounced back pretty quickly?

193
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,103
They stayed in their rooms
for days after the funeral.

194
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,563
But they started talking
and laughing last week.

195
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,481
They look fine.

196
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,233
Who knows how they actually feel?

197
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,569
Anyway, since they both
want to visit Busan,

198
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,696
they must want some fresh air.

199
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,574
Let's use this chance to cheer them up.

200
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,159
Let's really relax and--

201
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,829
I'm home.

202
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,082
So tell me, Ba-da.
How much progress have you made?

203
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,626
Progress? With who?

204
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,796
So far, Se-a and I have kissed.

205
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,341
I wasn't asking about that.

206
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,843
I meant making milmyeon.

207
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,805
I already taught him
how to make the noodles. And so…

208
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,850
He'll learn how to make
the sauce properly tomorrow.

209
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,394
I'll be in my room then.

210
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,311
Okay.

211
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,896
You must be tired, so go and rest.

212
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,481
I put down a blanket for you.

213
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,486
What?

214
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,323
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

215
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,826
I guess they're not out yet.

216
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,041
Hello, Father.

217
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,087
Yes, Mother told me already.

218
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,007
But I don't think I can make it today.

219
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,009
I forgot I had a conference too.

220
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,303
Have a good trip.

221
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,805
Goodbye.

222
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,690
Let's go!

223
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,110
-Did you bring everything?
-Of course.

224
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,196
-The lights and gas are off.
-And the charger?

225
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,697
I packed it.

226
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,781
And the car keys?

227
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,575
-I have them.
-All right.

228
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,577
Gosh. What's all this?

229
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,997
I steamed some corn
in case we get hungry on the way.

230
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,042
I also prepared some makgeolli bread
and monkfish jerky.

231
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,419
Basically, we brought our whole kitchen.

232
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,254
We're not going there to eat.

233
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,797
Eating is the most important part.

234
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,050
Okay, get in. We have a long way to go.

235
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,051
I'll drive, Ba-da.

236
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,221
No, I will. It's Ha-neul's car,
but I drive it more and know it well.

237
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,223
-But still--
-Goodness, it's fine.

238
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,475
Just sit back and enjoy the scenery.

239
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,143
You must be hurting after your ordeal.

240
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,811
Gosh, who cares who drives?

241
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,022
It's a long trip,
so we need to take turns.

242
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,650
-Go first, Ba-da. I'll take over later.
-Get in!

243
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,026
Okay.

244
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,417
Should we eat something?

245
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,294
-Sure.
-Already?

246
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,546
Still.

247
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,548
Each of you take one.

248
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,632
Thank you.

249
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,717
This's for you, Ha-neul.

250
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,886
-Give one to Ba-da.
-Okay.

251
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,973
And I steamed this myself.

252
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,558
-Gosh.
-I made it myself.

253
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,517
Thank you.

254
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,812
-Gosh. This is good while it's still hot.
-Okay.

255
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,605
Jeong-woo.

256
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,149
I packed some head cheese too. Try some.

257
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,278
Who eats head cheese in the car?

258
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,529
It's to eat with the alcohol.

259
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,908
Because I brought some makgeolli too.

260
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,661
Jeez, who eats makgeolli
and head cheese in the car?

261
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,664
Exactly. What is Jeong-woo
going to think about our family?

262
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,251
What's the matter?
This is what a fun trip is all about.

263
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,003
-Right, Jeong-woo?
-Of course.

264
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,922
All right, have a drink. Here.

265
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,132
All right.

266
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,049
Come on, Mom.

267
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,302
What?

268
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,929
It's nice to have a drink on a trip.

269
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,600
Of course. Please pour me a glass.

270
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,436
Okay. This will lift your mood right up.

271
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,979
-Here.
-Thank you.

272
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,857
No!

273
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,609
-Oh, no!
-Jeez.

274
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,694
-Do we have any towels?
-I'm okay.

275
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,529
I told you not to drink in the car!

276
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,823
-It's okay.
-Hey.

277
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,658
Here.

278
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,452
-Oh, no.
-Gosh.

279
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,913
-My goodness!
-I have some clothes in the trunk.

280
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,124
This girl I used to see
liked men who worked out.

281
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,752
So I used to work out
and put my clothes in the trunk.

282
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,630
-Do you want to wear those?
-I'd be grateful.

283
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,965
So you went to the gym? Is it a tracksuit?

284
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,140
I'm surprised
you didn't sell your uniform.

285
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,309
I could start up again, so I kept it.

286
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,228
Whatever. Don't eat anything
in the car from now on.

287
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,522
Goodness, you look great!

288
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,193
Since you're so tall and handsome,
everything looks great on you.

289
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,612
It looks better on me,
but you don't look too bad.

290
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,822
You look like you've done
kendo for 10 years.

291
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,368
Thanks. But I think
I should just wear my clothes.

292
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,203
You can't wear these. They reek.

293
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,580
I'll wash out the stains,
so wear them when they dry.

294
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,209
It won't take long since it's sunny.
Let's go to avoid the traffic.

295
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,377
But I…

296
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,712
I'm so sorry.

297
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,298
We're making memories. Don't you agree?

298
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,009
Let's go.

299
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,021
I purposely sat in the middle
so she wouldn't abuse you again.

300
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,773
Abuse? Not at all.

301
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,153
Why are we going so slow though?

302
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,697
It's taking ages. Step on it.

303
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,657
I'm trying to, but it's not working.

304
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,284
What's wrong with this?
Maybe it needs a tune up.

305
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,913
The car's inching along,

306
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,333
and it's dead silent inside.

307
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,419
Lighten up the mood.

308
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,047
Should we listen to some music as we go?

309
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,259
Sounds good!
Road trips and music go hand in hand.

310
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,469
Let's listen to my favorite song.

311
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,441
You are beautiful

312
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,822
You are trustworthy

313
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,037
Don't be shy

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,996
Jeong-woo!

315
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,249
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

316
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,001
Why can't you leave him alone?

317
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,544
No, I'm okay.

318
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,920
-I'm really okay.
-Okay.

319
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,339
-Jeez.
-What? The warning light turned on.

320
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,550
I think something's wrong with the car.

321
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,519
There's a nail stuck in the tire.

322
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,314
-Where?
-Over here.

323
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,857
Goodness.

324
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,651
Okay, please come
as soon as possible. Goodbye.

325
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,864
-What did they say? Are they coming soon?
-Well…

326
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,451
There's traffic on the highway,
so it'll take them an hour or two.

327
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,876
Why did you want to meet at the sauna?

328
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,630
I thought about it,
and there's a lot to do here.

329
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,257
There's table tennis
and a basketball hoop.

330
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,469
I can teach him sports
and we can bathe together too.

331
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,846
-It's perfect for Jin-woo, right?
-Yes, but…

332
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,307
-Jin-woo.
-Yes?

333
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,558
-Are you done eating?
-Yes.

334
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,270
Good, get up. We have lots to do.

335
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,688
You don't have to do that.

336
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,232
Don't ride his shoulders. Just walk.

337
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,567
No. Grandma has a weak neck.

338
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,361
Her older sister has a weak back.

339
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,780
And her younger sister has weak joints.

340
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,032
And you don't let me ride
because you're tired.

341
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,784
Then, when will I get the chance?

342
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,078
So I'll never get to try before I grow up?

343
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,040
Gosh, this just breaks my heart.

344
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,376
Just get me some pain patches later. Okay?

345
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:48,836
Hop on, Jin-woo.

346
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay. One, two!

347
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,756
Okay! Good!

348
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,800
-Let's go!
-Jin-woo.

349
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,677
Jin-woo, focus.

350
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,470
Yes. That's it!

351
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,388
Go, Jin-woo.

352
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,974
-That's it! Here!
-You can do it!

353
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,103
Are you okay?

354
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,647
Oh, no. Are you okay?

355
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,898
My ear…

356
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,234
-Are you okay?
-There's a hole.

357
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,696
What are you doing?
That's so childish. Jeez.

358
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,780
-Wasn't that funny?
-Yes.

359
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,490
You have a good sense of humor.

360
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,741
High five! Okay!

361
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,869
Okay, go back to your side.

362
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,539
Jin-woo, aim at the circle on the monster.

363
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,957
Aim at the red.

364
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,168
You're doing so well. Nice.

365
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,797
Hong-ran, don't hold it with both hands.

366
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,300
Place one hand here.

367
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,640
By the way, are you two dating?

368
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,186
Are you Mom's boyfriend?

369
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,646
What? No, he's not.

370
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,481
He's not my boyfriend.

371
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,108
No way, Jin-woo.

372
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,157
EMERGENCY REPAIR

373
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,659
-Okay, it's all done.
-Thank you.

374
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,453
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

375
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,581
Let's buy Jeong-woo clothes first.
There's an outlet nearby.

376
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,834
We should hurry then.
We should see your dad before sundown.

377
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
Her dad?

378
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,173
This was my dad's favorite season.

379
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,008
So around this time of the year,

380
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,220
our family goes to Busan to see him

381
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,180
and the beach
where we used to walk together.

382
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,516
We can't be laughing
during his death anniversary,

383
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,314
so we just visit on another day
to reminisce about him.

384
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,398
I see.

385
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,696
I'm glad the sun's still up.

386
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,781
Me too.

387
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,407
Let's quickly greet him and go.

388
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,034
I'll wait here.

389
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,619
I don't want to be in the way.

390
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,037
Goodness, you're not.

391
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,248
You can come if you want.

392
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,250
He probably doesn't want to.

393
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,961
Who knows if they'll get married?
I bet he's uncomfortable.

394
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,003
No, that's not why.

395
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,257
I'm not sure if it's right
for me to be there.

396
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,176
Then, can you wait here for a bit?

397
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,137
I forgot to tell you
about this visit. I'm sorry.

398
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,099
Don't be. Go on then. You can go.

399
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,976
Okay. Just wait a little bit.

400
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,102
All right.

401
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,019
Let's go.

402
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,568
It's been a while, Dad.

403
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,989
You must be so surprised to see me.

404
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,783
He's probably surprised
to see how much you've aged.

405
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,701
You little…

406
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,496
He's probably more shocked
to see that you're still unemployed.

407
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,497
-Exactly.
-What?

408
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,834
I'm working hard
to make milmyeon these days.

409
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,043
Right, Uncle Tae-seon?

410
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,128
He does work hard.

411
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,465
I told you. I prayed all night
when Ha-neul was in surgery.

412
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,720
I promised to work hard
like people my age if surgery went well.

413
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,346
I prayed with all my heart.

414
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,932
Maybe my prayers were answered.

415
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,726
Thankfully, she recovered.

416
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,645
I almost flew to Greece to say thank you.

417
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,315
Why Greece?

418
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,152
Jesus.

419
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,362
He was Greek. He was born in Greece.

420
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,328
What? Am I wrong?

421
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,081
Of course, it's wrong. You fool.

422
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,042
Just go to Greece already.

423
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,501
Yes, please leave.

424
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,880
Come on. Don't be so harsh on him.

425
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,549
Gosh, you're so optimistic and kind.

426
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,593
So when are you leaving?

427
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,261
When are you-- Let go.

428
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,680
When should we send him off?

429
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,432
-Should we book the ticket?
-Should we?

430
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,683
Greece does sound good.

431
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,101
I'd love to visit.

432
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,735
SECOND GENERATION
SIXTY YEARS OF TRADITION

433
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,156
Gosh, long time no see.

434
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,116
-Goodness.
-This is on the house.

435
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,534
Eat up.

436
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,161
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

437
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,121
Gosh, she gave us too much.

438
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,623
Unbelievable.

439
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,002
This place hasn't changed one bit.
It's the same.

440
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,588
-Did you come here often?
-Yeah.

441
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,466
Our dad enjoyed drinking soju here,
so we came often.

442
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,135
She drank soda
while solving math problems.

443
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,057
I remember we were drinking one time,
and he suddenly disappeared.

444
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,558
I looked everywhere for him,

445
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,519
and he was sprawled out on the beach.

446
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,521
Don't get me started.

447
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,773
He had sand in his ears for days.

448
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,822
To be honest, I resented him recently.

449
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,200
These two were in pain,
and he wasn't doing anything.

450
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,451
Come on.

451
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,786
What?

452
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,954
I did resent him.

453
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,791
But I mean now that I'm here,
it was good to see him.

454
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,378
It would've been nice
if you greeted him too.

455
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,963
You're right.

456
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:47,717
I thought you weren't supposed to,
but you were more cheerful than expected.

457
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,888
What I mean is

458
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,432
I've never lost a family member before,

459
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,103
so I thought the visit
would be very sad and gloomy.

460
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,897
That's why I thought
I should've stayed out.

461
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,192
There are many ways to miss someone.

462
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,781
A lot of time has passed for us,
so we only think of the good memories.

463
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,785
We still miss him, but we're not sad.

464
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,637
-Is Jin-woo asleep?
-Yes.

465
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,057
He played so much today
he was out as soon as he lied down.

466
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm sorry you had to come all the way here
just because he wanted to play more.

467
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,106
Don't worry about it.

468
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,401
I agreed to play with him,
so I might as well use the whole day.

469
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,695
Right. Here.

470
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:55,076
You taught him some sports
and took him to the sauna.

471
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,745
Thank you.

472
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,540
I've used up all my SOS stickers now.

473
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,708
What a bummer.

474
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,885
Right. I should get going.

475
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,306
How about a cup of tea before you go?

476
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,141
We have tons of tea bags.

477
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,518
Really?

478
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,396
Well, having too many tea bags
is a huge problem.

479
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,857
Allow me to use some for you.

480
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,320
MOM

481
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,863
We're departing now.

482
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,792
Are you okay, Ms. Kong?

483
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,836
Of course, I am. I'm not drunk one bit.

484
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,590
Jeong-woo,

485
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,176
want to eat some ice cream?

486
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,446
You used to eat ice cream
after drinking with your husband, right?

487
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,782
How did you know?

488
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,034
I had a hunch.

489
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,746
Just as I thought, you're so smart.

490
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,919
I'm sorry you had to tag along
and have such a hard time.

491
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,629
Not at all.

492
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,925
I actually feel bad for tagging along.
I didn't know you were visiting him.

493
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,136
Gosh, it's nothing serious.

494
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,555
It's like I just told you.

495
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,349
We're no longer sad now.

496
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,518
We only remember the good times.

497
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,894
We're totally fine now,

498
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,189
aside from missing him at times.

499
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,820
How much time needs to pass

500
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,698
for things to feel okay like that?

501
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,078
I guess I'm not strong enough.

502
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,538
It's still really tough for me.

503
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,916
What's so tough?

504
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,296
Forget that bastard
and the pain he caused you.

505
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,216
It's hard to forget.

506
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,971
I'm such an idiot.

507
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,682
I can't forget how good he was to me.

508
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,228
I keep thinking about
how he was the only one

509
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,316
who showed up for my graduation.

510
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,295
I was never a priority to my parents.

511
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,257
And my graduation was no different.

512
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,767
Hey, Jeong-woo!

513
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,939
Kyung-min was the first person
who didn't forget about me.

514
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,856
Kyung-min!

515
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,819
Sorry for being so late. Congratulations.

516
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,487
Thanks.

517
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:18,905
Here.

518
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,993
Take it.

519
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,121
Is this the black suit?

520
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,205
Yes, take it.

521
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,164
Yes!

522
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,628
Thank you so much!

523
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,505
-You're the best!
-Are you that happy?

524
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,423
Yes.

525
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,467
-Congratulations.
-Let's go eat some tteokbokki.

526
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,385
Okay, let's go.

527
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,012
-Are you buying?
-Of course. Let's go.

528
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,390
I didn't know back then

529
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,353
that it had only been days
since his father had passed away.

530
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,233
I can't fathom how he must've felt

531
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,736
as he came to see me
with the suit he promised.

532
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,517
Ms. Kong.

533
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,729
I'm having a pretty tough time.

534
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,651
Yesterday, I was willing to forgive him.

535
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,237
But today, I don't want to.

536
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,366
I can't resent him.

537
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,703
But I can't understand him either.

538
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,539
It's too painful.

539
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,251
I don't know what to do.

540
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,045
Oh, dear.

541
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,423
You poor, sweet child.

542
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,844
You're too kind-hearted for this world.

543
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,808
Jeong-woo.

544
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,186
Someone once said

545
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,733
you forgive someone not for their sake

546
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,861
but for yours.

547
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,866
Hating someone is so exhausting.

548
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,955
It's painful, miserable, and upsetting.

549
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,959
Feeling that way towards someone

550
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,170
is hurting you too much.

551
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:45,760
But it would be too cruel
to tell you to forgive him.

552
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,848
After everything you've been through?

553
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,814
So for now,

554
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,691
let's wait.

555
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,443
Let's not try to forget anything.

556
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,445
Let's just wait.

557
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:11,119
Then, those memories
will become less painful and sad.

558
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,914
Let time heal us.

559
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:18,960
Goodness.

560
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,132
It's okay. You can cry.

561
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,888
It must've been so painful.

562
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,589
Why are you alone?
You couldn't find your mom and Jeong-woo?

563
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,300
I think they're getting some air.

564
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,261
It seemed like they need it,
so I just came back.

565
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,515
Is Jeong-woo going to dump you today?

566
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,392
Why would he?

567
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,812
Because we were such an embarrassment.

568
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,357
You sure were.

569
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:27,111
Yeah, this was a rough trip.

570
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,449
But in any case, what matters is
we got here safe and sound.

571
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,203
You got a text from Hong-ran.

572
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,623
She said you should accept
the assistant professor position.

573
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,542
Why did you look at my phone?

574
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,671
I wasn't meaning to.
Your phone was vibrating so much.

575
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:48,049
It was shaking the table,
and I ended up seeing it.

576
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,095
I saw the news.

577
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,348
All those bastards
who were connected to that guy were fired.

578
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,477
-Yeah.
-Is that why you got the offer?

579
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,813
But I don't know what to do.

580
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,857
It all happened because of me,

581
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,985
so I feel bad.

582
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,406
Ha-neul, I never thought
you'd study anesthesiology.

583
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,452
You know those doctors
who conduct surgeries in medical dramas?

584
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,746
I thought you'd do that instead.

585
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,373
But anesthesiology?

586
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,501
Well, it was really unexpected.

587
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,753
Really?

588
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,923
That's why I asked you
why you picked that department.

589
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,884
Do you remember what you said?

590
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,013
What did I say?

591
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:40,560
Your dad underwent countless surgeries
while he was sick those eight years.

592
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,729
When he had his final surgery,

593
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,566
you were crying outside
and didn't know what to do.

594
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,818
Then, a doctor approached you

595
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,653
and told you not to worry.

596
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,490
He said he'd do his best
to have your dad sleep peacefully

597
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,825
and have a nice dream.

598
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,953
You're right.

599
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,458
I didn't want to send him
into the OR by himself.

600
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,544
And I was worried
he'd be in a lot of pain.

601
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,756
But that's what
the anesthesiologist told me.

602
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,634
Right. You said that was
the reason why you chose that field.

603
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:20,433
That's when I realized
your dad's death hurt you deeply,

604
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,143
and it broke my heart.

605
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,189
But I also realized
you chose the perfect field.

606
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,818
Right, I did.

607
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:37,784
I wanted to comfort my patients
just like that anesthesiologist did.

608
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,632
Don't worry.

609
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:56,344
Once you wake up
from a nice nap, everything will be fine.

610
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,556
Pain is the worst feeling
a human could experience.

611
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,768
By administering strong analgesics
before they could feel pain,

612
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,604
so I enjoyed relieving their pain.

613
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,068
Some patients think anesthesiologists
leave the operating room afterwards.

614
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,154
But we change their blood bags
and administer more drugs.

615
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,824
We also maintain
their blood pressure and breathing.

616
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:23,830
We stay alert throughout surgery
and protect our unconscious patients.

617
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,958
Due to ruptured aortas,
falls, or car accidents,

618
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,669
we sometimes get patients
who are bleeding profusely.

619
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,672
At times, I'd worry those cases
would be challenging.

620
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:37,426
But when they would recover,
I'd simply be grateful they pulled through

621
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,721
and quietly cheered them on.

622
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,432
And I liked that.

623
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,023
You should go back to where you belong.

624
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,820
Go do your job before it's too late.

625
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,500
What in the world?

626
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,883
What's with this vibe?

627
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,679
Stop being so serious and let's have fun!

628
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,890
Okay. Three, six, nine!

629
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,183
Three, six, nine! One!

630
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,950
I'm glad I tagged along.

631
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,286
After all that you went through?

632
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,997
It was nothing.

633
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,255
Actually, I need to tell you something.

634
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,345
I know your parents are in Seoul.

635
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,266
-How?
-I heard you talking to them this morning.

636
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,644
I see.

637
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,732
That's why you wanted to leave, right?
You didn't want to see them yet.

638
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,776
Well…

639
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,784
Finding out my parents
hurt someone so deeply

640
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,787
was hard for me to accept.

641
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,962
Should I resent them
for driving him over the edge?

642
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:41,259
Or should I resent him
for doing the unthinkable?

643
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,636
I didn't know what to do.

644
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,809
But now, I think
I've sorted out my thoughts somewhat.

645
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,732
Whether it's resentment or understanding,
I'll do as my heart says.

646
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,070
I decided to let time pass.

647
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,490
Then after some time,

648
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,451
maybe I'll become okay one day

649
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,454
like your family.

650
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,168
So?

651
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,881
-Is that all you wanted to tell me?
-What?

652
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,134
You seemed concerned
about something lately.

653
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,977
Actually, I got an offer
to be an assistant professor.

654
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,605
Seriously? Why didn't you tell me?

655
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:43,154
You had a lot on your plate already,
so I couldn't tell you.

656
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,489
You shouldn't think that way.

657
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,700
You were in pain because of what happened,

658
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,412
but I was given
this position because of it.

659
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,583
I felt guilty
about being happy with the offer.

660
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,251
This is just

661
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,963
the result of all your hard work.

662
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,091
So don't feel guilty.

663
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,387
I'm truly happy for you.

664
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,056
Also,

665
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,600
I hope you accept the offer.

666
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,602
Okay?

667
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,781
My goodness!

668
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,702
Congratulations.

669
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,747
Thanks.

670
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,043
I'm so proud of you.

671
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,005
I can't believe this.

672
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:43,923
You're the best!

673
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,563
It's so pretty.

674
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,362
It really is.

675
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,451
The fireworks disappeared quickly.

676
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,328
But the display

677
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,581
continued to live in my memory.

678
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,795
The lights soared, shined, and dispersed.

679
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,547
They're shining so brightly.

680
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,429
And we realized
everything was bound to disappear

681
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,182
and the only things
that last are the memories.

682
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,561
We could let go
of things we wanted to forget

683
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,648
and hold on to memories we wanted to keep.

684
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,818
Just like the fireworks.

685
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,699
HANYANG HWARO

686
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,576
Cheers to Dr. Nam!

687
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,952
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

688
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,245
Thank you.

689
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,539
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

690
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,667
Dr. Nam.

691
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,254
We just met but I can't believe
you're leaving us already.

692
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,256
I'm so happy for you.

693
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,301
Congratulations. You should hurry and go.

694
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,471
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon.

695
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,931
It was only going to be temporary anyway.

696
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,894
He's right. Don't feel bad and focus
on climbing the ladder, Professor Nam.

697
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,105
Eat up, Professor Nam.

698
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,524
I came here with Jeong-woo once,
and it was so good.

699
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,444
-That's why I booked this place.
-Thank you for the meal.

700
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,362
The restaurant is packed.

701
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,116
I wish our clinic was half as full.

702
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,328
Hey, you little…
Why would you bring that up?

703
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,165
I'll be back.

704
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,752
Hong-ran got a cake for our goodbye party
and wants me to pick it up.

705
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,963
She's my friend who works
at the OBGYN clinic across the hall.

706
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,299
We know her. Dr. Lee Hong-ran.

707
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,052
We're close with her nurses.

708
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,846
Right. I heard you two were best friends.

709
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,265
She should join us
if she hasn't eaten yet.

710
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,684
That's okay.
I'm already embarrassed about the cake,

711
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,853
but I'm accepting it for her sake.

712
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,940
But still, she came all the way here.

713
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,900
Wouldn't it be too cruel

714
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,069
to not invite her?

715
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,536
He's right. She should join us
if she's okay with it.

716
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,372
She'd probably feel too awkward to join.

717
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,416
Hello, I'm Ha-neul's friend.

718
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,419
-Do you mind if I join?
-You already have.

719
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,172
-We're glad you're here.
-Welcome.

720
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,891
-Have some.
-Thanks.

721
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,436
Dr. Yeo, you're so kind.

722
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,689
People might think you two were dating.

723
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,817
Since you're naturally so considerate,

724
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,027
you must be nice to everyone.

725
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,237
Could I have some too?

726
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,700
You don't have to pretend.
We all know they're dating.

727
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,617
Seriously?

728
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,287
You said it was a secret.

729
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,039
I thought it was, but they all caught on.

730
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,793
I never imagined
there would be a couple in our clinic.

731
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,838
-I was so surprised.
-Me too.

732
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,089
Hold on.

733
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,133
Maybe there's another couple in hiding.

734
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:18,679
To be honest, I've had my suspicions
about Dr. Bin and Nurse Do.

735
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,058
That's ridiculous.

736
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,020
We're like siblings.

737
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,275
She was my colleague at my previous job.

738
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,901
Then, I quit along with him.

739
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,240
That was only because I said
I'd pay you more.

740
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:42,369
Let's be honest.
Let's say we were on a deserted island.

741
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,872
We still wouldn't have
feelings for each other.

742
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,961
Why won't you answer me? It's true.

743
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,004
Who knows?

744
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,757
If it's only us two,
maybe we'd develop feelings then.

745
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,017
You're so mischievous today.

746
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,561
The meat's burning. Eat up, everyone.

747
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,438
That's still raw.

748
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,149
-What are you doing?
-What?

749
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,484
He's flustered.

750
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,320
There really must be something
going on between them.

751
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,530
Just be honest.

752
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,783
Come to think of it,
you look good together!

753
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,003
Hong-ran.

754
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,839
Why didn't you wait for me?

755
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:41,095
Jeez. My colleagues love to tease me.

756
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,848
Nurse Do and I really are like siblings,

757
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,892
so I don't know why
they'd say such things.

758
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,435
Who knows?

759
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,647
They must've based it
on things they've seen before.

760
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,943
And you two do seem pretty close.

761
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,488
Even on the rooftop last time, you were--

762
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,739
Wait.

763
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,617
Have you been keeping
an eye on me since then?

764
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,662
"Keeping an eye on you"?
I'm not a CCTV camera.

765
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,330
I'm just saying.

766
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,666
But…

767
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,587
You're the only one
I make time for on the weekends.

768
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,760
You're the only one
I'm curious and worried about.

769
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,765
And I didn't feel uncomfortable
when we shared that umbrella.

770
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,187
"I wish the rain won't stop."

771
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,650
You're the only one
who made me think like that.

772
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,735
What?

773
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,076
Take these.

774
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:47,911
Why?

775
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,668
Even without those,
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

776
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,879
I don't think I'm seeing you

777
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,091
solely for the purpose
of helping each other out.

778
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,219
To be honest,

779
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,723
I was hurt when you told Jin-woo
I wasn't your boyfriend.

780
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,268
But I get that you had to lie to your son.

781
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,854
Now that he's not here,
let's have an honest talk.

782
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:16,607
Am I really…

783
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,027
not your boyfriend?

784
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,115
Well…

785
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,411
Because I…

786
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,044
Dr. Bin!

787
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,255
You forgot this.

788
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,985
What is this love triangle?

789
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,490
It seemed like Nurse Do
might have been interested too.

790
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,326
-Don't you think it's a love triangle?
-Perhaps.

791
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,872
I've never been this uninterested
in a relationship before.

792
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,083
Why not? I'm curious.

793
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,960
Hong-ran is interested in him too.

794
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,254
I wonder who'll end up with him.

795
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,214
But why him?

796
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,717
By the way,

797
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,221
aren't you tired after the party?
Your new job starts tomorrow.

798
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,722
I'm okay.

799
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,601
How does it feel to return
after a long time away?

800
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,312
Well…

801
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:43,402
I feel nervous, afraid,

802
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:48,407
and… excited as well.

803
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,202
Then, let me take
your nervousness and fear.

804
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,371
You can keep the excitement.

805
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,040
Okay.

806
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,625
Okay.

807
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,131
-But I'm a bit sad too.
-Why?

808
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,385
We can't hold hands or have ice cream
after work like this anymore.

809
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,554
It's the end of our little happiness.

810
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,976
Your schedule will become hectic.
We won't be able to call each other often.

811
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,353
It'll be hard to meet up.

812
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,565
I'll be miserable missing you so much.

813
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,317
Then, I'll end up being lovesick.

814
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,819
You're so silly.

815
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:26,778
Gosh.

816
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,323
Don't worry.

817
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,950
I'm not going to
exhaust myself like I used to.

818
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:37,205
I'll still do my best,
but I'll take care of myself

819
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,458
and you.

820
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,919
Do you promise? You better keep your word.

821
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,464
-Okay.
-All right, then.

822
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:47,924
You got a text.

823
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,010
MS. KONG WOL-SEON

824
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,303
Ha-neul.

825
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,264
Tomorrow's your first day at work.
Hurry on home and rest.

826
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,349
Where are you?

827
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,184
What is this?

828
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,145
ANESTHESIOLOGIST NAM HA-NEUL

829
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,438
No way.

830
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,273
I should make that my profile picture too.

831
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,733
Don't.

832
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,151
Why not? You look so good.

833
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,944
I said don't.

834
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:08,862
Hold on.

835
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,989
-"Daehan National University Hospital."
-Stop.

836
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:15,494
-I'm going to hate it so much. Stop it!
-"Professor Nam Ha-neul!"

837
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,579
Where are you?

838
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,666
Give me your phone.

839
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,958
-Hold on.
-Give it to me.

840
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,126
Stop it.

841
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,087
Stay back. I'm warning you.

842
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,110
I'm leaving now.

843
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,279
Look at you.
All dressed up like a professor.

844
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,533
Have a good day, Professor Nam.

845
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,868
What's wrong with you guys? Bye.

846
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,332
Delete your profile picture.

847
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,670
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

848
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,965
Ha-neul, your shoe.

849
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,427
-Bye, Uncle Tae-seon.
-Bye.

850
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,263
Gosh, here we go again.

851
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:36,950
After many ups and downs,
Ha-neul finally returned to her place.

852
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,461
Hello, I'll be her anesthesiologist today.

853
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,378
Hi, Se-mi.

854
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,255
Hello.

855
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:54,509
You're so energetic.
Which kindergarten do you go to?

856
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,220
Haenim Kindergarten.

857
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,389
What a pretty name.

858
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,434
You've run around
in kindergarten before, right?

859
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,229
Can you take deep breaths
like you were running?

860
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,564
Yes.

861
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,610
Then, can you come with me
and show me how to do it?

862
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,530
Okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.

863
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,990
I'll be by your side.

864
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,617
Okay.

865
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,494
Let's do our best.

866
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,538
-She tried so hard to come this far.
-You're so pretty.

867
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,499
So I hope she'll shine brightly.

868
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,501
The case we'll talk about today

869
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,295
is when anaphylactic shock
occurs during anesthesia.

870
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,258
Dr. Kim Seon-cheol
previously introduced this patient.

871
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,012
They had never undergone surgery before
and had no history of allergies.

872
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,139
I earnestly prayed

873
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,268
she would have big dreams and soar high

874
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,898
after all the pain and loss she suffered…

875
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,445
as I made dumplings.

876
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,407
Gosh, you're doing pretty well now.

877
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,325
You bet.

878
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,243
All right.

879
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,665
Since you're good with your hands,
you make good dumplings too.

880
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:10,168
Exactly. He's been making dumplings
every day while waiting for Ha-neul.

881
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,920
And now, he's become an expert.

882
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,422
Ha-neul said she'll be home early today.

883
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,049
Lucky you.

884
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,305
Ha-neul, are you on your way?

885
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,394
I see. It's an emergency.

886
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,022
No, it's okay.

887
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,693
Okay. Hang in there.

888
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,141
What's with the rage?

889
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,226
Don't take it out on the poor dough.

890
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,192
I'm okay.

891
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,528
I'm fine.

892
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,878
Darn it.

893
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:38,465
I thought I'd see her today,
so it makes me even sadder.

894
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,928
She promised to take care of me,

895
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,889
but she didn't keep her word.

896
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,274
No!

897
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,612
Don't be waiting for her, Jeong-woo.

898
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,406
Just take care of your own business.

899
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,201
Then, you won't feel so sad.

900
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:05,927
All right.

901
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,948
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

902
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,872
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

903
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:39,479
I wanted to have coffee with you
this morning, but I have a meeting.

904
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,981
You must be tired,
so have some. I miss you.

905
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:42,899
Me too.

906
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,154
Darn it.

907
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,281
I was awake until 3:00 a.m.

908
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,826
What time did she come home then?

909
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,120
Gosh.

910
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,313
Ha-neul…

911
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,485
Ha-neul?

912
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,654
ATTORNEY HAN JIN

913
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,834
Why do you look so down this morning?
Are you worried about something?

914
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,589
I'm sure you want me to ask you that,
but forget it. I can't be bothered.

915
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,467
You little brat.
Do you know how much pain I'm in?

916
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,052
In front of the woman I like,
I kissed another--

917
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,808
Never mind. I'm upset,
so let's get a drink later.

918
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,769
Okay. It'll be my treat.

919
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,105
I have some money now.

920
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,899
Money? From where?

921
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,860
Remember the penalties I paid
for the medical accident?

922
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,153
I got some of that back.

923
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,822
How much?

924
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,449
You don't have to know.

925
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,533
How much is it?

926
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,160
Why would you ask about that?

927
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,745
Tell me. I'm curious.

928
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,830
Jeez.

929
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,626
Two hundred million?

930
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,548
Two billion won?

931
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,509
Keep it down, will you?

932
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,677
I'm so jealous.

933
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,181
You got that money back
because you were proven innocent.

934
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,474
That is true.

935
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,435
In any case,

936
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:47,482
the incident hurt my reputation
and made me close down my clinic.

937
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:51,402
I didn't nitpick about who's fault it was.
I just settled and took the compensation.

938
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:52,987
Hey, let's go.

939
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,406
Let's go and spend that money.

940
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,449
Buy me a car.

941
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,076
What? Even I don't have one.

942
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,536
Then, let's go get you one.

943
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,081
Let's buy you a wallet and a belt.
And leave the 300,000-won-a-month rooftop.

944
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,666
It's actually 500,000 won.

945
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,546
I'm so jealous.
What will you do with that money?

946
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,799
I did give it some thought.

947
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,512
I'll spend it on something
to help Ha-neul and I be together.

948
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,430
Something to help you be together?

949
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,185
Do you mean…

950
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,636
Come in.

951
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,142
Jeong-woo. What are you doing here?

952
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,477
I've missed you.

953
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,895
Me too.

954
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:11,566
It was so hard to see you, so I came here.

955
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,736
I hope I'm not interrupting though.

956
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,529
No, not at all.

957
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,116
I was upset I couldn't see you
since I had so little free time.

958
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,870
Seeing you has made
all my fatigue disappear.

959
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,414
I'm the best energizer there is.

960
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,083
This room looks nice.

961
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,378
Gosh, you look so professional
in your own office.

962
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,007
Do you want some coffee?
Or should we go out to eat?

963
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,969
You see… I actually came by
to tell you something.

964
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,721
What is it?

965
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,724
Lately,

966
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,393
it's been really tough
since I haven't seen you.

967
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,981
So to be by your side,

968
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,027
I made a huge decision.

969
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,907
What kind of decision?

970
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,721
Who is this?

971
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,642
She's seven
and has microtia of the right ear.

972
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,188
I'm still in touch
with my old volunteer organization.

973
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,566
I asked if there was anyone
who needed my help.

974
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,363
I'd like to perform surgery on her.

975
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:46,411
But my clinic isn't fit
for this type of surgery.

976
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,913
So I just met
with a doctor from your hospital.

977
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,835
They're going to do
her reconstructive surgery here,

978
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,503
and I'll be helping them.

979
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,214
-Really?
-Yeah.

980
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:02,719
At first, I was only going to pay
for the surgery and do the checkup.

981
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,264
But since it meant I could be with you,

982
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,058
Dr. Nam, I wanted to…

983
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,228
I mean, Professor Nam.

984
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,231
I wanted to do
something meaningful together.

985
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:20,403
Would you be willing to join me?

986
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,331
If you look here…

987
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,293
Hello, I'll get right into the case.

988
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,632
This is seven-year-old Rhea.
She's set to receive surgery for microtia.

989
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,553
If you look at her right ear,

990
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:50,433
she has Grade 2A auricular hypoplasia
and aural atresia as well.

991
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,643
The pediatric genetic testing

992
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,104
showed no signs
of additional syndromes or deformities.

993
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,482
We plan to have a two-stage operation.

994
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,408
For the first operation,

995
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,495
we plan to do a rib cartilage harvest
from the left side

996
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,747
for reconstructive surgery of the auricle.

997
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,302
-Jeong-woo.
-Yes?

998
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,639
I'm really impressed by you.

999
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,726
In that case,

1000
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:39,232
we should have a detailed discussion
regarding that topic.

1001
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,820
How exactly do I impress you?

1002
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,113
Explain it to me in detail.

1003
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,328
You see…

1004
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:56,499
A lot of people want to do
good things in life.

1005
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,711
But it's not easy
to actually carry it out.

1006
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:06,300
I respect you a lot for actually deciding
to do something like this.

1007
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,807
It wasn't easy to get this money back.

1008
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,685
So I wanted to use it
in a more meaningful way.

1009
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:17,854
I see.

1010
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:23,276
So I get that you're amazing.

1011
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,153
But you should've just cut to the chase.

1012
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:29,615
Why did you say you wanted to spend it
on something to help us be together?

1013
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,159
You made me tense for no reason.

1014
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:34,996
Tense?

1015
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,582
Why?

1016
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,335
Well…

1017
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,213
I tend to get tense easily.

1018
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,756
I see.

1019
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:52,305
I'm a bit tired. Do you want some coffee?
I'm going to make some for myself.

1020
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,648
Why did we both get texts?

1021
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,527
Here are the photos
from our trip to Busan.

1022
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,113
They're photos from Busan.

1023
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,703
You don't have to look at the last photo.

1024
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,538
-Why not?
-You don't have to know.

1025
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,669
Holy cow!
This will be a great profile picture.

1026
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,005
-I'm setting it as mine.
-No. Don't do that!

1027
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,882
-You can't!
-Why not? It's my phone.

1028
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,800
We don't have time for this.

1029
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,385
I have a gift for--

1030
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,387
Please don't do that!

1031
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,173
Go back to work.

1032
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,442
DOCTOR SLUMP

1033
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,569
Should I give it to her like this?
Or like this?

1034
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,862
Like this… Oh, no!

1035
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,655
Forget her job. She's been single forever.

1036
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,449
I need to be somewhere right now.

1037
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,659
Could I see some bracelets?

1038
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:22,329
From Ha-neul's standpoint,
she might still have doubts about you.

1039
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,248
Necklaces. Can I see your necklaces?

1040
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,751
Jeong-woo would be insane
to date that horrible Ha-neul.

1041
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,668
You're so pretty.

1042
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,170
Do you want to join my family?

1043
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,422
This was the most touching proposal ever.

1044
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,718
Tell her you have the night shift today.

1045
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:44,643
