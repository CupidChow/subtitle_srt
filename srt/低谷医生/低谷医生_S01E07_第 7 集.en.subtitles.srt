2
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,621
Isn't it really tall?

3
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,998
-It grew so much.
-It's so tall.

4
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,500
-Yours grew a lot, Seo-yeon.
-What about yours?

5
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,837
Everyone, how does it feel
to grow kidney beans by yourselves?

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,673
-It's great!
-It's so cool!

7
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,175
Ji-an, how big is yours?

8
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,718
But ma'am,

9
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,929
why didn't his bean sprout yet?

10
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,055
Is it a bad bean?

11
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,141
One minute.

12
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,186
YEO JEONG-WOO

13
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,855
Jeong-woo.

14
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,442
Your kidney bean will sprout soon too.

15
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,069
Let's be patient.

16
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,947
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,622
Out of the dozens of seedlings,
mine was the only one that didn't sprout.

18
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,207
It was the "kidney bean incident."

19
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,710
This is what I remember as

20
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,129
the first time I failed in my life.

21
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,131
YEO JEONG-WOO

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,388
I tried putting the pot in a sunny area.

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,356
I was more diligent than others
in watering my plant.

24
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,568
Book.

25
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,697
Student.

26
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,615
Pretty.

27
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,117
-But my kidney bean…
-Pretty.

28
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,120
…still refused to sprout.

29
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,122
-Let's take a break.
-Okay.

30
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,339
-I think it'll grow.
-Right.

31
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,549
Jeong-woo.

32
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,259
I feel bad for you.

33
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,344
Your kidney bean won't sprout.

34
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,762
You must be upset.

35
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,431
No, I'm not. I'm okay.

36
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,643
To be honest,
I don't like growing kidney beans.

37
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,645
-Really?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,731
Kidney beans are my least favorite beans.

39
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,942
And if they're in my rice, I don't eat it.

40
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,154
I don't need kidney beans in my life.

41
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,615
I won't cry because of those stupid beans.

42
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,541
Because of those stupid beans,

43
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,043
I bawled my eyes out that day.

44
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,922
I felt lonely and sad.

45
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,052
I went home crying tears
the size of those beans.

REPORT CARD

47
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,785
Jeez.

48
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,581
Goodness.

49
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,333
What do I say?

50
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,293
Gosh.

51
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,343
Mom, going somewhere?

52
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,429
I'm going to LA with your father
for his conference.

53
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,848
We'll be gone for a week,
so stay with the housekeeper.

54
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,766
Okay.

55
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,187
What's that?

56
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,024
It's my report card.

57
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,615
But… I went down in rankings.

58
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,701
I never thought
I could get such a low grade.

59
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,913
Is it that hard to keep up
what you've been doing?

60
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,040
What's the point of living in failure?

61
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,460
-Go upstairs and study.
-Okay.

62
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,882
Have a good trip.

63
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,888
This is all because of Nam Ha-neul.

DAILY LOG OF KIDNEY BEAN
OBSERVATION

65
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,074
That's when I realized.

66
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,247
Life was like a kidney bean.

67
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,669
There were some things
that happen out of my control.

68
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,256
We're heading out.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,093
Could you log us out?

70
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,977
Unlike happiness,
which felt vague at times,

71
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,604
misfortune always made its presence known.

72
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,315
You bastard.

73
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,484
I hit rock bottom in the blink of an eye.

74
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:24,157
And failure always went
hand in hand with loneliness.

75
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,074
MOM

76
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,661
To save face, I pretended
I was fine and bearing it.

77
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,330
Hi, Mom.

78
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,291
Your father's a chairman candidate
for the American Heart Association.

79
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,711
So make sure all of his hard work
doesn't go to waste.

80
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,673
To be honest, I longed
for a family who cared about me.

81
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,260
I really didn't do it, Kyung-min!

82
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,429
I yearned for someone who believed in me.

83
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,306
However,

84
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,059
as one misfortune led to another,

85
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:56,147
my days never got better
and were surrounded in darkness.

86
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,416
Will I ever be okay again?

87
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,423
Will I ever get to enjoy
a normal evening again?

88
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,972
DOCTOR SLUMP

89
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,347
It's a pen.

90
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,435
What? Why isn't it working?

91
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,859
-What are you doing?
-My goodness!

92
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,444
You startled me.

93
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,572
Why are you up here?
You two are this close now?

94
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,449
That's not it.

95
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,368
Then, why are you here?

96
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,662
I came to take our blanket
and saw you here.

97
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,081
I came up to get some air.

98
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,333
The door was open, so I came to close it.

99
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,127
Then, you should've done just that.

100
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,212
Why were you staring at that pen?

101
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,130
What is it?

102
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,674
"I wanted to see you,
but you weren't home."

103
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,594
-Were you going to leave a memo?
-You little--

104
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,974
-Isn't this a spy camera?
-What?

105
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,727
I'm right. This is a lens.

106
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,607
Why do some people take photos like that?

107
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,734
To be honest,

108
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,363
at my clinic,
someone was secretly recording…

109
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,165
Jeong-woo, where are you?

110
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:30,426
CRIME PREVENTION
DASAN-DONG THREE-WAY INTERSECTION

111
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,262
The suspect ran down
that alleyway after getting hit.

112
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,932
But the CCTV camera
in that alleyway was broken,

113
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,184
so we couldn't find out
exactly where he went.

114
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:39,936
Also,

115
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,358
the police substation in your area
just sent us this dashcam footage.

116
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,486
You had a break-in last month, right?

117
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,405
I did.

118
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,493
The suspect was caught on the dashcam
of a motorcycle passing by at that time.

119
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,994
Well…

120
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,498
It's not completely clear, but…

121
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,836
They're the same person, right?

122
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,299
Yes, their builds, heights,
and gaits are similar.

123
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,260
We think they're the same person.

124
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,638
Also, the suspect dropped
this at the scene.

125
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,476
It's the same model
as the one from your clinic.

126
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,688
Detective Kim.

127
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,606
-Yes?
-Can you take a look at this?

128
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,857
Excuse me.

129
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,206
Jeong-woo.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,377
Hey, Ha-neul. What are you doing here?

131
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,422
I heard you were here.
This is good timing.

132
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,049
I stumbled across this
under your desk and…

133
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,009
What could this be about?

134
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,939
He must've left the camera
at my house that day.

135
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,275
Was he trying to record me?

136
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,194
I'm not sure.

137
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,529
We're looking into it,
so we'll find out soon.

138
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,241
Detective Kim.

139
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,910
Hey, how did it go?

140
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,162
Well…

141
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,915
The spy camera was slightly damaged.

142
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,752
It seems some water got inside,
so they can't restore the data.

143
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,174
Then, there's no way?

144
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,223
Who in the world did this?
Hidden cameras and stalking?

145
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,893
Hey, what's all this blood?

146
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,689
-I just scraped myself a bit.
-It's not a bit. It's a lot.

147
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,694
It looks like a scalp laceration.
You should've gone to the ER.

148
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,364
-It's okay. I stopped the bleeding.
-It's not okay.

149
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,324
Let's go to the hospital now.

150
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,826
Hey!

151
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,040
-Mr. Yeo Jeong-woo?
-Yes?

152
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,836
You had a 1.5 cm cut,
so we sealed it with staples.

153
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,338
-Does he have a concussion?
-No, you don't have to worry.

154
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,132
-Does he need a brain CT scan--
-No.

155
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,425
It's not that bad.

156
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,677
I understand. Thank you.

157
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,350
Let's go.

158
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,604
Why are you crying?

159
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,190
Because I feel bad for you.

160
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,486
What are you going to do?

161
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,533
Were you drinking?

162
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,036
What's gotten into you?

163
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,331
Sit down. What's wrong?

164
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,628
I thought your surgery
just went wrong that day.

165
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,925
I thought you were just unlucky.
I thought it was a bad coincidence.

166
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,720
But someone may have targeted you…

167
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,057
How did you bear it all this whole time?

168
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
Don't cry.

169
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,069
-If you cry, I'll feel--
-What about how I feel?

170
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,989
I feel worse, you know?

171
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,950
You've been through so much.

172
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,678
What do we do?

173
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,141
Have you finally calmed down?

174
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,188
Maybe it's my depression,
but I suddenly burst into tears at times.

175
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,191
I should go home and take more medicine.

176
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,157
Do you have any idea who it could've been?

177
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,455
The one who set up the cameras
in your clinic and left them in your room.

178
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,958
Is there anyone you suspect?

179
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,545
There is.

180
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,257
The anesthesiologist
who was also in the OR…

181
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,385
keeps bothering me.

182
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,598
Right. He was supposed to testify
but backed out two days before.

183
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,063
That's right. It would've been easy
to set up the cameras if he worked there.

184
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,816
But why did he do it?

185
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,902
Beats me.

186
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
Don't worry too much.

187
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,283
It'll all work out.

188
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,495
Truth will always reveal itself.
Slowly but surely.

189
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,748
Where did you get that great line from?

190
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,417
A movie?

191
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,629
-You think I ever had time to watch one?
-Right.

192
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,925
Let's go watch a movie
once things are settled.

193
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:51,015
I'd like to have some popcorn
while sitting next to someone I like.

194
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,353
Let's go.

195
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,691
Jeez.

196
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,075
The third hearing over the death

197
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,704
of a casino heiress from Macau
will begin this morning.

198
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,499
The author of a dissertation
will appear as a witness today

199
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,128
-to prove Yeo's claims of innocence.
-Okay. Bye, Mom.

200
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,926
Hello.

201
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,305
Thank you so much for the other day.

202
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,222
Sure.

203
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,308
I could catch the dragonfly thanks to you.

204
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,811
I was so excited that I went
to Yangpyeong to give it to my son.

205
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,941
You went all the way there just for that?

206
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:42,858
Yes.

207
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,486
He stays there with my mom
during the weekdays.

208
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,491
My mom's been living there with my aunts
ever since my dad passed away.

209
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,660
He's a five-year-old boy
brimming with energy,

210
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,829
so imagine how bored he must be
living with three old ladies.

211
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,375
I always felt bad
that he had no one to play with.

212
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,169
Anyway, thank you.

213
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,882
If you come across any insects,
please catch them and let me know.

214
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,176
Have a nice day.

215
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,723
What was that?

216
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,394
Is she giving me homework or something?
Why would she ask me to do that?

217
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,354
-You two.
-My goodness.

218
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,272
Since when have you been so close?

219
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,733
We're not close.

220
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,736
We were just talking about a dragonfly.
We had an incident.

221
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,655
"An incident"?

222
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,949
Was it a one-night stand?

223
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,826
What are you talking about?

224
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,537
No, I said it was about a dragonfly.

225
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,914
Why would you interpret it like that?

226
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,208
Your mind is in the gutter.

227
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,127
No, it's not. You were being vague.

228
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,838
If this is mine, give it to me already.
Did you add syrup?

229
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,506
No.

230
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,966
Then this one's mine, right?

231
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,467
Give it to me.

232
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,058
Mom.

233
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,310
-I'm hungry.
-Hang on.

234
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,730
What do you mean? I'm hungry.

235
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,481
Jeez, just wait.

236
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,400
I want some nice and sticky rice.

237
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,402
Let go of me while I'm being nice.

238
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,946
Not until you make me some sticky rice.

239
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,072
For crying out loud.

240
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,490
Just make it yourself!

241
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,908
But I can't cook.

242
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,369
If you can't, you should learn.

243
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,788
I had to learn how to cook too, you know.

244
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,004
-What are you looking for?
-My iron.

245
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,965
I swear I put it somewhere here.

246
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,343
Did you take it?

247
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,012
Why would I take your iron?

248
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,391
You sold once sold our air fryer
to go on a date with your girlfriend.

249
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,518
We broke up.

250
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,355
Your beating hurt for three hours,
so I vowed to never sell our stuff again.

251
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,275
Give it thorough search.

252
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,989
Where did it go?

253
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,116
Did it grow legs and run away?

254
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,419
-Take it off.
-Sorry?

255
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,671
I said take it off. I'll iron your shirt.

256
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,632
Why all of a sudden?

257
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,261
When I saw the news, your shirt
was crumpled at the last hearing.

258
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,763
You looked pretty shabby.

259
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,015
I'll iron it nicely, so take it off.

260
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,143
Goodness, that's okay. Hold on.

261
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,022
May I take it off myself?

262
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,982
Sure. Hurry up.

263
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,028
Okay.

264
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,624
This is so strange.

265
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,583
Goodness.

266
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,085
Where did they go?

267
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,131
What are you looking for? Your iron?

268
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,925
Why would it be in the fridge?

269
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,052
No, not my iron.

270
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,595
Last night, I swear I put

271
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,015
some stir-fried anchovies,
soy sauce braised beef,

272
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,434
and stuffed cucumber kimchi in here.

273
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,478
But they vanished into thin air.

274
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,273
No way. Do you have dementia?

275
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:12,860
What do I do?

276
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,736
I think I'm about to cry!

277
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,658
You little brat!

278
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,622
You sure it wasn't you?

279
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,374
You once stole my marinated pork ribs,

280
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,253
leaf mustard kimchi, and abalone
to give to your girlfriend.

281
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,672
I'm right. It was you.

282
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,716
It wasn't me.

283
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,342
I told you we broke up!

284
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,969
You little punk!

285
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,804
That hurts!

286
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,139
-You little…
-That hurts.

287
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,307
-You…
-I said it hurts.

288
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,349
Where are they?

289
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,185
Whoops!

290
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,728
What did you say?

291
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,021
-What did you say?
-Mom!

292
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,149
You little punk.

293
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,584
See? You look more confident and better.

294
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,295
Really?

295
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,385
It's crooked.

296
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,160
Hurry up and eat.

297
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,456
Eat? I wasn't planning on eating.

298
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,124
You should still eat.

299
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,086
If you're satiated, it activates
the parasympathetic nerves,

300
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,546
which in turn makes you calmer
and more composed.

301
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,425
You'd feel sadder if you were
backed into a corner and hungry.

302
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,344
So hurry up.

303
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,804
I'm really okay.

304
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,818
Finish your meal and come downstairs
in 30 minutes. I'm coming with you.

305
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,403
To where?

306
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,781
No.

307
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,118
What if that guy follows you
and beats you up again?

308
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,786
I never got beaten up.

309
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,664
I'm okay only because I'm athletic.

310
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:34,793
If it were you,
you wouldn't be alive right now.

311
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,794
I'm different.

312
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,505
-Anyway, I'm tagging along.
-I said no.

313
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,174
-Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
-This is a serious matter.

314
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,175
Rock, paper, scissors!

315
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,719
Okay. I'll see you in a bit.

316
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,263
Hey, Ha-neul!

317
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,934
Gosh. Just had to go with rock…

318
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,065
I swear I didn't steal them!

319
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,567
I'm home.

320
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,569
Hi, where did you go this morning?

321
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,653
Somewhere.

322
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,238
What did he steal?

323
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,910
My iron and my side dishes
from last night are missing.

324
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,580
And he's the only person
under this roof who'd do that.

325
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,706
Was it you?

326
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,458
What?

327
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,127
My goodness, as if Ha-neul
would do such a thing.

328
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,255
Your sister was
the top student in this country.

329
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,883
Then, she passed
that difficult medical license exam.

330
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:27,763
She also worked and saved lives at one
of the top three hospitals in the nation.

331
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,474
She would never steal such trivial things.

332
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,309
Why not?

333
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,895
It's possible if she's blinded by love.

334
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,191
Today is Mr. Rooftop's hearing.

335
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,694
She could've taken the iron
to iron his clothes

336
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,864
and the side dishes to feed him.
You never know.

337
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,706
Is this true, Ha-neul?

338
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,293
Did you really…

339
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,587
Don't be ridiculous.

340
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,005
-It wasn't me.
-Right?

341
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,131
-Yeah.
-Right?

342
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,049
It wasn't me.

343
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,427
Move aside. It wasn't me.

344
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,099
See?

345
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,892
It wasn't her.

346
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,227
Then, it was you.

347
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,394
It wasn't me.

348
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,479
It's not me.

349
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,772
It wasn't me.

350
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,315
-It wasn't me!
-Yes, it was.

351
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,901
-It wasn't me!
-Don't lie, you punk.

352
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,575
My goodness! What in the world?

353
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,121
-Don't tell me Mom gave you a bloody nose.
-It wasn't because I was hit.

354
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,541
I slipped and fell while dodging.

355
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,543
Anyway, it really wasn't you?

356
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,087
What's with you? I said I didn't.

357
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,756
Fine.

358
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,008
I'll go upstairs and see for myself.

359
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,183
Fifty thousand won. Will that be enough?

360
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,435
Fifty thousand for a bloody nose?

361
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,396
Double it.

362
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,732
I'll just come clean to Mom.

363
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,568
I just didn't want to hear her nag.

364
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,862
-I'm actually not embarrassed.
-Fine.

365
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,407
I'll take just 50,000 won
since you're my sister.

366
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,741
Consider yourself lucky.

367
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,207
What happened to that spy camera?
What did they say?

368
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,045
Not sure. I think someone
put it there during the break-in.

369
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,465
-Who could have done that?
-Beats me.

370
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,719
Hey, did you see anyone?

371
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,679
-Anyone suspicious around here?
-What?

372
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,266
Someone was following Jeong-woo.
So I wondered if you saw.

373
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,228
Forget it.

374
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,146
Right.

375
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,524
I remember seeing a guy
follow Mr. Rooftop upstairs.

376
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,693
What? When?

377
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,446
I think it was the day
Mr. Rooftop moved in.

378
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,240
Gosh, the owner of this noodle shop
has quite a temper.

379
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,575
He's my uncle.

380
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,702
Have a nice day.

381
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,663
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

382
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,875
Hey, Su-beom. A blind date?

383
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,461
I'm free for the entire month.

384
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,671
Is she cute?

385
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,882
Okay, let me know.

386
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,139
But wait. Who is he to bad-mouth
Ha-neul and Uncle Tae-seon like that?

387
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,144
That's someone else.

388
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,314
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

389
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,316
You just asked me now.

390
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,693
I thought maybe he was lost

391
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,112
or just a visitor,
so I didn't think much about it.

392
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,656
Why would anyone follow him?

393
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,037
What if those Macau guys
hired thugs to quietly get rid of him?

394
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,415
What are you talking about? Just zip it.

395
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,583
-Get out.
-What?

396
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,836
Maybe they want to settle things
outside of the justice system.

397
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,963
Enough nonsense.

398
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,648
Jeong-woo, where are you?

399
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,942
I'm waiting for you.

400
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,777
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

401
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,861
Ha-neul.

402
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,531
I don't think you should come with me.

403
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,116
Jeong-woo.

404
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,911
I don't think I should tell you this
prior to your hearing.

405
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,747
What? What is it?

406
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,791
On the day you moved in,

407
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,962
my brother said he saw a man
follow you to the rooftop.

408
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,132
-What?
-I'll be down soon.

409
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,717
Let's talk in person.

410
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,229
KANG JIN-SEOK

411
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,880
Jeong-woo.

412
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:15,842
Where is he?

413
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,529
WITNESS STAND

414
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,284
DEFENDANT

415
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:47,582
ATTORNEY

416
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,880
He's still not picking up.

417
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,007
It's almost time. Why isn't he answering?

418
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,761
All rise.

419
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,142
The third hearing over the death

420
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,771
of a casino heiress from Macau
began at 10:00 a.m. this morning.

421
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,816
Thirty minutes have passed, however,

422
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,653
and Yeo has yet to arrive at court.

423
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,489
The main focus of today's hearing
will be to see whether or not

424
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,658
the medical dissertation
submitted by the defense

425
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,661
at a previous hearing
will be accepted as evidence.

426
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,789
The author of the dissertation
is slated to appear as a witness,

427
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,874
so this hearing has drawn
a lot of attention.

428
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,918
There's still no word from the defendant?

429
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,057
Where did he go?

430
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,437
My apologies, Your Honor.

431
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,023
We can't reach the defendant.
Could you postpone the hearing by a day?

432
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,250
I apologize.

433
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,173
I brought the evidence.

434
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,145
We'd like to submit this evidence.

435
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,830
No secret can be kept hidden forever.

436
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,294
KANG JIN-SEOK

437
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,357
Kang Jin-seok.

438
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,401
Dr. Kang.

439
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,280
I need to speak with you.
Roll down your window.

440
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,532
It won't take long.

441
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,367
What? Hey, Jin-seok!

442
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,745
Jin-seok! It was you, wasn't it?

443
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,835
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

444
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,752
I'm sorry!

445
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,688
What's with you?

446
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,981
Why would you…

447
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,024
Why?

448
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,575
HEPARIN

449
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,468
Arrest him.

450
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,552
Yes, Your Honor.

451
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,517
Also…

452
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,314
the truth that we had been
desperately waiting for

453
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,734
finally revealed itself.

454
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,180
There he is!

455
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,521
This is News Time. Here's our top story.

456
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,983
We begin with the murder case
of a casino heiress from Macau.

457
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,693
Chang Bing's father, James Chang,

458
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,238
passed away after dominating
the casino industry in Macau for 30 years,

459
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:56,075
and his daughter inherited
his entire fortune.

460
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,619
It was revealed
that James Chang's younger brother

461
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,039
committed the murder out of anger.

462
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,291
The suspects secretly added anticoagulants

463
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,960
to the victim's IV,
causing excessive bleeding.

464
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,715
To do this, they bribed a nurse
named Park at Yeo's clinic.

465
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,801
He was a witness, not a suspect.

466
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,554
So you followed Yeo around
because you didn't know

467
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,973
whether to tell him the truth or not?

468
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,684
But you see…

469
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,937
You couldn't have foreseen this incident.

470
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,690
So why did you set up
so many cameras in the OR

471
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,276
and throughout the clinic?

472
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,655
He said it was an old habit of his.

473
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,659
A habit he formed after that incident.

474
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,704
Protamine, please.

475
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,790
-Protamine.
-Yes, doctor.

476
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,346
I'll administer the protamine.

477
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,189
What? What's wrong with the EKG?

478
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,525
We'll need the defibrillator.

479
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,692
Get it ready.

480
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,613
What? Who administered potassium?

481
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,826
Are you out of your mind?

482
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,162
It wasn't me, sir.

483
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,039
-It was you--
-Focus, will you?

484
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,125
Move. Give me the calcium.

485
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,709
Charge to 200 joules.

486
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,002
-It's ready.
-Damn it.

487
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,087
Clear!

488
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,308
He ended up as the scapegoat
of a medical accident.

489
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,489
He decided to look
for a way to defend himself.

490
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,087
KOREA CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION

491
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:30,146
His old habit ultimately saved Jeong-woo.

492
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,627
However, he was too afraid
to tell the truth.

493
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,722
He couldn't muster up
the courage to reveal it himself.

494
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,710
Mr. Rooftop!

495
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:46,055
Unfortunately, he failed to deliver
the truth like he had planned to.

496
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,186
And so, the truth remained hidden.

497
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,187
-It's him!
-Mr. Yeo.

498
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,694
Mr. Yeo, is the dissertation
you tried to submit as evidence…

499
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,948
He couldn't understand why things were
still the same despite providing evidence.

500
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,748
Until the very end,

501
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:18,004
he was stuck in contemplation
between justice and fear.

502
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,860
It took some time
for Jeong-woo to recover.

503
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,038
He unnecessarily suffered too many losses.

504
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,960
He needlessly had to experience
failure and disappointment.

505
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:04,008
He didn't know who to blame
and felt lost for some time.

506
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,600
Once again, another ordinary day began.

507
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,938
And people didn't seem
to care about his pain.

508
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,025
The Yeo Jeong-woo case.
I think it'd be an great story to cover.

509
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,610
Should we give him a call?

510
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,322
That's great!
He once appeared on Doctor's Choice,

511
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,908
so I have his number!

512
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,952
Hey, he might've changed his number.
Call him right now.

513
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,289
This would be a total hit.

514
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:36,791
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

515
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,085
Remember those sheet masks
we made with Jeong-woo?

516
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,545
-Yes.
-We didn't destroy all of them, did we?

517
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,882
-No, we have plenty.
-The public is sympathizing with him.

518
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,427
If we use this opportunity well,
we might be able to sell off our stock!

519
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,263
Yes, that's great!
Let me read through the contract again.

520
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,264
-Okay.
-This way.

521
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,308
This crisis turned into an opportunity!

522
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,229
Good morning, everyone!

523
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,108
FAMOUS DOCTOR YEO PROVEN INNOCENT

524
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,110
See? I told you Jeong-woo was innocent.

525
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,156
Should we give him a call?

526
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,909
Now? After the fight you two had?

527
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,746
I mean, now would be
a good time to patch things up.

528
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,832
And we're still unemployed.

529
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,387
Jeong-woo, I heard the news.

530
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,763
I'm glad it worked out.

531
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,015
Do you want to grab a drink?

532
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,185
HWAYU PHARMACEUTICALS SALES TEAM LEAD
LEE HYO-SANG

533
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,603
PRESIDENT OH
WRITER HWANG

534
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,651
MOM

535
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,371
Hi, Mom.

536
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,747
I'm proud of you.

537
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,125
I always knew you were innocent.

538
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,046
Talk to the media wisely
and put an end to this.

539
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,008
Inside, what his secrets left behind…

540
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,219
was pain.

541
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,433
There's one question though.

542
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,978
Why didn't Kang, the anesthesiologist
who was in the OR with him,

543
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:25,316
call the police
despite having definite proof?

544
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:29,820
He was probably hesitant
because someone had died.

545
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,574
Also, he must've been afraid
of retaliation after finding out

546
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,285
it was intentional homicide,
not a medical accident.

547
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,457
Mom, have you seen my purple shirt?

548
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,959
Oh, that?

549
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,503
It's at the dry cleaner's.

550
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,130
Okay.

551
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,381
By the way,

552
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,300
how's the rooftop fellow doing?

553
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,138
I think he's stayed inside
for three days after his trial ended.

554
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,892
He must be exhausted
after everything he went through.

555
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,855
Gosh. I hate him for rejecting you.

556
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,067
But I feel bad about what happened.

557
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,405
I wasn't rejected.

558
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,830
Yes, you were. I witnessed it happen.

559
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,501
YEO JEONG-WOO

560
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,513
Jeong-woo, are you okay?

561
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,933
Of course, he's not.

562
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,980
Have you eaten yet?

563
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,693
I doubt he has an appetite.

564
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,450
I haven't heard from you in a while…

565
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,412
No.

566
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,133
Right.

567
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:18,470
We planted cabbages on the rooftop
but haven't watered them in a while.

568
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,390
Oh, dear!

569
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,643
I just happen to have
a reason to go upstairs now.

570
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,860
What are you doing here?

571
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,323
You see…

572
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,617
We're grilling up some pork belly.

573
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,577
We haven't had any in a while.

574
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,455
Invite your friend if he hasn't eaten yet.

575
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,831
But…

576
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,708
Don't bother him and go downstairs.

577
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,251
Just cook it in a frying pan.

578
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,461
No.

579
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:54,548
Meat grilled outside
and meat grilled on a stovetop

580
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,050
don't taste the same.

581
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,761
Gosh, it smells lovely.

582
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,304
I bet it'll be so delicious!

583
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,891
-What's the matter with you?
-Why are you here though?

584
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,976
-What?
-Why do you have a watering can?

585
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,687
I just thought

586
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,815
I'd water the cabbages.

587
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,067
Is that so?

588
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,486
You've never been interested in them.

589
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,947
Don't be absurd.
I've been watching them very carefully.

590
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,826
Gosh, Ha-neul's here too.
Wol-seon, let's also drink this.

591
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,578
-It's fermented well.
-Sounds good.

592
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,331
If anyone's craving a drink, over here!

593
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,416
-Me.
-Come on.

594
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,211
Just admit you came here
because you were worried about him.

595
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,755
Don't pretend to grill meat,
bring ginseng wine,

596
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,173
or water the cabbages.

597
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,966
Quit all this nonsense.

598
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,596
Jeong-woo!

599
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,431
-Come have some meat!
-Hey!

600
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,433
It's all over, so let's have a drink.

601
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,604
Gosh. He's honest
and confident since he's Gen Z.

602
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,855
Come on.

603
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,232
-But I--
-Have a drink.

604
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,276
I'm okay though.

605
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,277
It's not okay.

606
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,696
We have so much meat.
What if we can't finish it?

607
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,323
It's a sin to waste food.

608
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,659
Hurry up and eat the rest
of the meat, will you?

609
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,953
I have plenty of ginseng wine.
Can you open this?

610
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,204
Okay.

611
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,880
-Can you grab the bottom?
-Sure.

612
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,385
Goodness! Well done!

613
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,970
-Good job.
-All right.

614
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,805
Have a drink.

615
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,765
Goodness. He's strong too.

616
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,517
-Thank you.
-Goodness.

617
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,601
I…

618
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,568
Sit down.

619
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,654
Please excuse me then.

620
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,239
-Sure.
-Sit down.

621
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,616
Okay.

622
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,534
All right.

623
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,246
Wait for me!

624
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,581
-Hurry up then.
-Cheers!

625
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,291
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

626
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,339
Gosh, you're a good drinker.

627
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,925
Tilt the jar.

628
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,761
All right.

629
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,972
-Here.
-Thank you.

630
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,140
You went through so much.

631
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:12,978
You must feel relieved yet awful

632
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,898
and vice versa.

633
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,734
I'm sure you have mixed feelings.

634
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:22,654
I know what you suffered was unfair,
but the truth's out now so it's a relief.

635
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,907
Drink that and let it all go.

636
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,575
Okay.

637
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,377
Why didn't you pick that up?

638
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,088
Well, no reason.

639
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,049
Come on. It's obvious.

640
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,344
The people who abandoned you
when you were ruined are reaching out now.

641
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,721
-Right?
-How despicable.

642
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:51,058
They should just
dislike him all the time like we do.

643
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,060
Don't say that. You don't dislike him.

644
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,395
There's no reason to like him.

645
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,439
I witnessed him

646
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:02,736
cold-heartedly and cruelly reject
my daughter right here.

647
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,321
I said it wasn't like that.

648
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,616
Also, why would you prepare
all this if you disliked him?

649
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,202
This was made for us.

650
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,371
We just let him join us.

651
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,207
Here. Eat up.

652
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,169
You were in your room for days,
so you must've not had a proper meal.

653
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,714
What? How did you know that?

654
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,883
As his landlady,

655
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,719
I need to know whether he's alive or dead.

656
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,847
He needs to pay rent.
And I need the money to prepare this food.

657
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,392
That's quite an excuse.

658
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,728
What are you talking about?
I'm not a friendly person to begin with.

659
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,439
Look! We invited you,
because there's leftover meat.

660
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,816
Look at him smile.

661
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,823
Eun-jeong, are you done
with your academy classes?

662
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,575
How about some rosé tteokbokki with me?

663
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,078
What? I thought
you said you didn't like it.

664
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,205
Do you have to leave?

665
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,250
I'm eating burgers with my friend. Bye.

666
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,960
Don't worry about it. Let's eat.

667
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,473
Could you ring me up?

668
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,894
It's on me as a thank you.

669
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,937
Please use my card.

670
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,106
Gosh, you don't have to do this.

671
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,733
It's my treat.

672
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,570
Then, can I buy a bag of jerky too?

673
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,281
Don't you make enough money?

674
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,994
Or bring a can
of honey roasted peanuts too.

675
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,292
He's so happy about it.

676
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,306
Weren't you going to
drink your beer at home?

677
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:55,932
No.

678
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,894
I was planning to drink it at the park.

679
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,898
I live with just my daughter.

680
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,651
She hates it when I drink at home.

681
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,613
That's puberty for you.

682
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,992
She says I just don't get it
because I don't like rosé tteokbokki.

683
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,161
If I remember what she liked as a kid

684
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,246
and buy her taiyaki and egg bread,

685
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,499
she says it's for old people
and doesn't eat them.

686
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:24,127
Also, she's embarrassed
by my NeoTube channel.

687
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,505
-So I'm thinking about ending it.
-Why?

688
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,799
You said you created it
because you were bored.

689
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,842
I'll resubscribe
and like your videos again.

690
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,511
Gosh, that's okay.

691
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,640
To be honest, I only started it
after watching Jeong-woo succeed.

692
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,433
I thought it'd be easy.

693
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:43,480
You said you two weren't close,
but you got upset when I bad-mouthed him.

694
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,315
We used to be close.

695
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,860
But we had a falling-out.

696
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,071
Anyway,

697
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,907
I used to care about him a lot.

698
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,159
So it hurt me to see his life fall apart.

699
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,538
Give him a call if you're worried.

700
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,998
I'm sure your words of comfort
would help him a lot.

701
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,127
Do you think it'd be all right?

702
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,003
Of course. Call him.

703
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,011
I mean,

704
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:20,642
who's going to help you relieve
all that bitterness you feel inside?

705
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,270
My poor little Rooftop.

706
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,191
You were an innocent victim.

707
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,026
And you rejected my daughter!

708
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,653
You Rooftop!

709
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,240
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-You must be so distraught.

710
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,703
So do you like him or not? Pick one.

711
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,414
I said I don't like him.

712
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,916
She's been so depressed,
always staying home,

713
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,502
and he rejected her,
so why would I like him?

714
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:53,759
But as a mother of a child his age,

715
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,011
I feel so bad for him.

716
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,350
"Bin Dae-yeong"?

717
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:09,483
Did this jerk ever call you
when you had hit rock bottom?

718
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,693
No, but…

719
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,154
Why are you…

720
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,032
Hey. Listen up.

721
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,660
You didn't bother to call him
when he was struggling.

722
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,955
So how dare you call him now?

723
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,292
You call yourself a human being?

724
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,879
No, it's not like that.
I called because I was worried--

725
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,840
Then, you should've called sooner.

726
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,342
Just get lost

727
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,136
before I throw a bucket
of freezing water on you.

728
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,683
What is it? What did he say?

729
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,354
I told you I didn't want to call him!

730
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,481
Why are you getting mad at me?

731
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,775
Are you drunk after that one can?
You're so weird.

732
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,401
Darn it! I'm so upset!

733
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,694
You're so weird.

734
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,866
If you dislike me,
then don't eat what I bought. Give it.

735
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,451
When did I ever say I disliked you?

736
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,702
I never said that.

737
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,247
Then, give back the dragonfly
that was on my head.

738
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,165
-Give it back.
-It's in Yangpyeong.

739
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,042
Give it back.

740
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:11,878
Ms. Lee.

741
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,047
Give back the dragonfly.

742
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,423
Take me to Yangpyeong.

743
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,895
From now on in your life,

744
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:35,193
if these good-for-nothings continue
to mess around and pester you,

745
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:40,115
curse them out like I just did. Got that?

746
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,745
Mom, that's enough.

747
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,747
Okay?

748
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,584
This is so unfair!

749
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,045
I was the first one to spot that witness.

750
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:58,133
I could've been recruited by the police
if they caught him then!

751
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,928
To be honest,
I'm embarrassed to be unemployed.

752
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,724
I steal money from Ha-neul, Mom,

753
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,018
and Uncle Tae-seon.

754
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,352
I'm ashamed about it now.

755
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,606
You stole money from me too?

756
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,817
How much did you take?

757
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,612
-Fifty thousand won?
-Higher.

758
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,156
-Hundred and seventy thousand?
-Jeong-woo.

759
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,490
-What do you say?
-Lower.

760
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,117
How about we get out of here?

761
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,535
Why?

762
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,413
We still have some ginseng wine left.

763
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,457
Forget it.
It's too humiliating to stay here!

764
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,666
One hundred thousand?

765
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,126
-Higher!
-Let's go.

766
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,546
-Don't forget your clothes.
-Okay.

767
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,506
Two hundred thousand?

768
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,258
Lower.

769
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,760
Good night.

770
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,303
This is tricky.

771
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,264
Can't guess, can you?

772
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,186
Sorry. My family was acting
like fools, weren't they?

773
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,772
It's okay.

774
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,650
I was actually grateful.

775
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,234
I didn't want to be alone.

776
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,403
Really?

777
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,155
Then, you should've called me.

778
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,782
I waited so long for you…

779
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,913
I'm sorry I didn't call for days.

780
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,414
No, it's okay.

781
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,584
I purposely didn't call
so you could sort out your thoughts.

782
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,842
Those who could've called
didn't for my sake.

783
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:27,013
And those who didn't have to call
did call me.

784
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,102
Ha-neul, want to grab a drink?

785
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,105
Just us two?

786
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,400
Yeah, just us two.

787
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,112
Sure.

788
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,280
Let's go.

789
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,454
To be honest,

790
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,667
I thought I took things in stride.

791
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,548
I've experienced failures in life too.

792
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,759
And I've never had
a good family like yours.

793
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,804
Anyway,

794
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,473
I went through some rough patches too.

795
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,687
But everyone has their own misfortunes,

796
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,774
so I told myself to be grateful

797
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,235
for what I had.

798
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,530
And…

799
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,284
I was proud of myself
for having endured it pretty well.

800
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,748
But looking back,

801
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:40,462
I didn't endure it because I was strong.

802
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:47,719
It was because I had never hit
rock bottom before.

803
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,020
I don't even know what I'm saying.

804
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,376
Why are you staring at me?

805
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,088
It's just…

806
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,340
It breaks my heart.

807
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,637
You've lost so much.

808
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,643
But I gained something precious too.

809
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,609
I really like you.

810
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,907
That was so sudden.

811
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,827
Remember what I said?

812
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:59,040
I said you were like a drug
someone prescribed for me.

813
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,586
I said I didn't see a doctor
despite having PTSD

814
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,549
because of you.

815
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,138
To me, you're like my anxiety medication.

816
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,810
My life is so bitter and salty.

817
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,272
But you're so sweet.

818
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,863
It felt like I was eating
candy in a salt pond.

819
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,244
"Candy in a salt pond"?

820
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,038
My life was bitter,

821
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,460
but the moments we shared were so sweet.

822
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,049
It was like eating bracken
and chocolate together.

823
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,178
I see.

824
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,644
Let's play that claw machine.

825
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,814
I'm sure you've never tried one before.

826
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,441
That's right.

827
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,737
Let's do it. I'll win you a stuffed doll.

828
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,617
All right.

829
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,076
Just you wait.

830
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,003
-What are you doing?
-Right.

831
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,923
I just got so excited.

832
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,551
Hey, you wait right there!

833
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,310
You're so good.
How did you do it in one go--

834
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,687
Right, have I told you that I liked you?

835
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,481
What?

836
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,565
I understand.

837
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,567
You probably didn't know.

838
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,570
But I really like you.

839
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,241
No, I knew but--

840
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,202
And so, I'll make sure to get you a doll.

841
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,413
Okay.

842
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,792
Let's do that.

843
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,631
Hey!

844
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,760
You know ice cream's the best
when you're drunk.

845
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:16,719
Of course.

846
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:18,888
Right.

847
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,767
I haven't told you
that I liked you, right?

848
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,314
You did. Multiple times.

849
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,567
Yeah.

850
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,528
I like you.

851
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,827
-I get it, so pick your ice cream.
-Okay.

852
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,624
Gosh, the moon is so bright.

853
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,543
You're right.

854
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:53,006
It's so round and yellow
that I want to make a wish.

855
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,430
My problem is somewhat solved now,

856
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,224
so please help Ha-neul become happy!

857
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,936
Why are you shouting your wish?

858
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,147
That way, the moon can hear us.

859
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,525
Right, you probably don't know.

860
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,402
-But I--
-I do know.

861
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,903
You like me, right?

862
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,239
How did you know?

863
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,410
Is he confessing his love
or just teasing me?

864
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,203
You are

865
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,664
the kidney bean that I planted.

866
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,463
I was anxiety medication,
candy in a salt pond,

867
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,757
and bracken and chocolate.

868
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,842
-And now, I'm a kidney bean?
-Yeah.

869
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,886
Because…

870
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:45,516
I can't wait to watch you sprout.

871
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:52,940
You see, I was so desperate
for someone who'd believe in me.

872
01:00:54,984 --> 01:01:00,698
I just wanted
one person like that in my life.

873
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,876
Then, you appeared.

874
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,103
Can I

875
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,939
hold your hand?

876
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:38,945
Yes.

877
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:41,906
Totally.

878
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,148
Gosh, the moon is so bright.

879
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:16,858
I agree.

880
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,735
It's pretty.

881
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,948
Did I told you yet?

882
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,491
Yes, you did.

883
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,080
Really?

884
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,584
I think you're pretty.

885
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:41,340
I don't think you told me that before.

886
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,425
I didn't?

887
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,470
Then, have I told you this?

888
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,387
What?

889
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,599
I like you.

890
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,602
That night, Jeong-woo

891
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,439
confessed his love several times more.

892
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,524
And his words

893
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:03,362
made my heart break because it told me
how lonely he had been.

894
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,953
I told you, right?

895
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,831
I like you.

896
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,376
I like you too.

897
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,110
DOCTOR SLUMP

898
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,655
He definitely said he liked me.

899
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:46,948
We even held hands.

900
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,116
If you hold hands, you're dating.

901
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,243
That's definitely dating.

902
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,248
Ha-neul's dying to go out with you,
so she's asking around like crazy.

903
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,501
You damn lunatic!

904
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,087
What's your definition
of an exciting date?

905
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,715
It's going to be super romantic,
so better be excited.

906
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,761
By the way, you do know
what "sweet" means. Right?

907
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,681
I've always wanted to read
and debate over dissertations.

908
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,646
