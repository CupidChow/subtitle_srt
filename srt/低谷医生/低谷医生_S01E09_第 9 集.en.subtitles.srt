DOCTOR SLUMP

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,915
DAEHAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,835
INTERN PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FORM 2016

00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,795
INTERVIEW EVALUATION FORM
NAM HA-NEUL

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,839
Why did you choose Anesthesiology?

6
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:53,261
I chose this field because I was moved
by how anesthesiologists plan

7
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:57,056
according to each patient's condition
and monitor rapidly changing vital signs

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,309
so they can react quickly
to various situations

9
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,854
and take great care of their patients.

10
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,857
And not only do they care
for their patients

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,319
but they also assess the overall situation
in the OR and arrange--

12
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,904
I'm not so sure.

13
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,531
I wonder if you'll be right
for our department.

14
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,785
Teamwork is crucial in our field.

15
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,205
You won't succeed if you think
you're better than everyone else.

16
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,414
You know that, right?

17
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,916
Yes, I'm aware of that.

18
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,876
Then, explain your reputation.

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,754
From what we've heard, you're an outsider

20
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,007
who can't communicate well
with your colleagues.

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,051
We also heard
you prefer to do your own thing.

22
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,762
Well, I…

23
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,389
Dr. Nam.

24
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,727
You're not interested in dating, are you?

25
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,063
-Sorry?
-Hey.

26
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,023
What kind of question is that?

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:52,320
Look. I heard she'd rejected
a few guys who had asked her out.

28
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,489
So they spread false rumors,

29
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,408
and her female colleagues
avoided her because of that.

30
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,453
If she truly was selfish
or preferred to work alone,

31
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,373
she would've never applied
to our department.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,874
And this shows

33
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,377
she was the head of the class
when she graduated

34
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,964
and received straight As
on her internship assignment.

35
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,008
If she really wasn't reliable,
she wouldn't have earned such marks.

36
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,726
In that dog-eat-dog world,

37
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,688
he was the first person to believe in me.

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,314
Ha-neul.

39
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,317
I heard you chose Anesthesiology.

40
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,528
-Yeah.
-Me too.

41
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,530
I hope we get along.

42
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,493
By the way,
is Dr. Min Kyung-min your relative?

43
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,619
No.

44
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,747
Really? Then, why did he defend you
during your interview?

45
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,291
Everyone's talking about it.

46
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,086
He's had a girlfriend for seven years,
so he doesn't have an ulterior motive.

47
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,838
"Does she have something on him?"

48
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,424
"Does he owe her money?"
People are wondering that.

49
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,634
-Really?
-Did you hear?

50
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,053
He'll be the next chief resident.

51
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,389
All the professors
are giving their support.

52
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,309
He's bound to become a fellow
and eventually a professor.

53
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,020
And he likes you,
so he paved the way for you too.

54
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,439
Hey.

55
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,983
How about drinks on you to celebrate?

56
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,569
No, thanks.

57
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,447
And he just picked me.
He didn't pave the way for me.

58
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,409
Let's grab a drink.

59
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,878
There. That's the problem.

60
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,797
There's already a bias
in the patient pool.

61
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,634
That's why it says
there's no meaningful correlation.

62
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,635
I see.

63
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,349
Thank you again. The materials
you gave last time helped a bunch too.

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,518
I'm glad I could help. See you later.

65
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,481
Kyung-min.

66
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,236
Are you free tomorrow?

67
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,118
Why did you offer to treat me?

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,246
Just as a thank you.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
You're always helpful and kind to me.

70
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,962
By the way, I have a question.

71
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,380
Sure.

72
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,007
Why do you treat me so well?

73
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,927
Well…

74
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,139
I mean I'm not social or friendly.

75
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,185
I even struggle
to get along with my colleagues.

76
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,690
So I was curious
as to why you're so good to me.

77
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,360
Because I know you.

78
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,324
I can see how sincere
and hard-working you are.

79
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,871
I don't know if I should say this.

80
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,083
But I don't think
others know you that well.

81
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,504
That's why I wanted to
understand and help you.

82
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,676
Those words won me over.

83
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,261
This is good.

84
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,513
So…

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,766
I never had a doubt
that he was on my side.

86
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,397
About that government subsidy budget…
I'll tell the professor I planned it.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,773
But I did it.

88
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,608
Of course, I know that.

89
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,569
Well, to be honest,

90
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,071
the professor doesn't have
a good opinion of you.

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,491
So if I tell him you did it,
he might turn the proposal down.

92
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,036
For now, I'll say that I did it.

93
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,788
Then, I'll tell the truth
once it's approved.

94
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,791
I'll clear up the misunderstanding then.
This proposal's crucial.

95
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,753
You know I'm doing this for you, right?

96
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,047
But still--

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,799
They're calling me in. So that's it.

98
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,595
I still wanted to believe him.

99
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,056
I tried with all my might.

100
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,682
-However…
-Right.

101
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,560
What do you think about Dr. Nam?

102
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,020
-Dr. Nam Ha-neul?
-Yeah.

103
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,147
I'm not too sure.

104
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,317
She's not the easygoing type, you see.

105
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,862
Some patients have complained
about her being unfriendly and arrogant.

106
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,073
She doesn't get along
with her colleagues either.

107
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,075
Teamwork is crucial in our field.

108
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,952
I don't think she's cut out
for a group environment.

109
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,163
-You think so too?
-Yes.

110
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,420
Good work. Have a drink.

111
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,173
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

112
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,387
By the way, is everything okay?

113
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,184
What is it?

114
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,693
I'm a bit reluctant to tell you this.

115
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,611
Yes?

116
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,573
I think Dr. Nam is manipulating the data.

117
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,784
What? The data?

118
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,786
That's truly inexcusable.

119
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,579
Right. I was shocked too.

120
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,706
It was the p-value of all things.

121
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,708
She changed the p-value?

122
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,002
How will she deal with the consequences?

123
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,254
I don't know either.

124
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,006
Credibility is crucial with data.

125
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,342
I don't know how
she'll deal with the mess.

126
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,594
Kyung-min.

127
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,390
What did you just say?

128
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,891
-When did I--
-Dr. Nam.

129
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,769
How dare you raise
your voice in front of me?

130
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,814
Sir, I never did such a thing.

131
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,357
I've had many unfair things happen--

132
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,860
Life isn't always fair.

133
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,194
Why are you whining about it?

134
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,114
Hurry up, Dr. Woo.

135
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,782
Give Dr. Nam her bag.

136
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,828
No one was on my side,

137
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,038
so there was nothing I could even do.

138
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,418
I became sick and tired of it all.

139
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,797
I told myself to never trust anyone again.

140
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,299
But then…

141
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,888
I met you.

142
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,306
No, over here!

143
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,769
You kept me on my feet when my life
was on the verge of collapsing.

144
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,316
And I completely fell for you.

145
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,448
That's when I'd suddenly become anxious.

146
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,493
I was afraid

147
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
that you'd hurt me too.

148
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,833
If I'm this unstable,

149
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,002
could we ever be happy?

150
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,537
We'll both suffer in this relationship.

151
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,087
This is why I'm breaking up with you.

152
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,507
I'm not strong enough.

153
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,176
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,107
DOCTOR SLUMP

155
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,321
Goodness.

156
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,000
Why did you pack so much
when you're not moving out for good?

157
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,840
There's a studio apartment near the clinic
where I can stay if needed.

158
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,259
I'll have to stay there
if work's too busy.

159
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,304
And not because seeing Ha-neul is awkward?

160
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,683
Jeong-woo.

161
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,519
-These are dumplings.
-Goodness.

162
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,606
Put them in the freezer right away
and eat them when you're hungry.

163
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,316
-This is kimchi.
-Okay.

164
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,735
These are seasoned garlic stems
and marinated crabs.

165
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,403
Thank you so much for the food.

166
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,113
-Have some with him.
-I will.

167
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,906
You didn't have to do all this.

168
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,659
Thank you for the food.

169
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,704
You should go back in now.

170
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,122
I'm not leaving for good.

171
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,417
Right. I hope you do well.

172
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,711
-Don't skip your meals.
-Yes, ma'am.

173
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,714
I'm off. You should go in.

174
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,757
Goodbye. Thank you.

175
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,050
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

176
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,551
Have a safe trip.

177
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,686
By the way, Mom.

178
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,939
Why do you think he's leaving so abruptly?

179
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,360
He'll be working
at his friend's clinic starting tomorrow.

180
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,488
But still, it's so sudden.
And Ha-neul didn't even come out.

181
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,579
He definitely told me last week
he'd go out with her.

182
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:08,250
Then, he looked gloomy the next day
and stayed in his room the following days.

183
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,711
And today, he left.

184
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,714
I think they broke up.

185
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,217
I wonder who dumped the other.

186
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,010
I'll dump you somewhere.

187
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,595
Quit talking!

188
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,638
That's enough!

189
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,057
What?

190
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,059
I thought you were asleep.

191
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,604
You should've said
goodbye to Jeong-woo then.

192
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,359
You heard, right?
He's starting work again tomorrow.

193
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,280
He'll be staying
at a place near the clinic.

194
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,410
He packed a bunch of stuff
and left as if he wasn't coming back.

195
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,328
That's enough.

196
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,249
No, it's not. Why do you want to
sweep everything under the rug?

197
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,919
Being open and candid
about these things is the trend nowadays.

198
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,173
Ha-neul, tell me.

199
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,883
Did you two fight?

200
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,177
Or did you get dumped?

201
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,018
Don't tell me
he still hasn't asked you out.

202
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,397
Jeez, he gave me his word
he'd go out with you.

203
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,775
We should've signed an agreement then.

204
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,486
Yeah, I get it now.

205
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,865
After playing around with you,
he dumped you as soon as he got a job.

206
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,033
Ha-neul, don't get discouraged.

207
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,828
Find a better job than him!

208
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,538
You should find a job, you punk!

209
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,352
Goodness.

210
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,230
You're sighing,
and your eyes are watering up.

211
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,815
People will think
I'm forcing you to come with me.

212
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,151
So tell me.

213
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,820
You rejected my offer
to stay by your girlfriend.

214
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,364
So why the change of heart?

215
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,371
-Dae-yeong.
-Yeah?

216
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,874
Want to have some soju?

217
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,594
You suddenly called me out,
so why are you just silently drinking?

218
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,806
Did you two have a fight?

219
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,142
Hey, give me your phone.

220
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
Why?

221
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,688
You know why. I'll tell him you're drunk.

222
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,273
You can make up when he comes.

223
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,608
This is how all couples do it.

224
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,443
It works like a magic. Look.

225
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,032
Pretend to be drunk when he comes.

226
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,870
We broke up.

227
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
What? What do you mean?

228
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,500
What do you mean?

229
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,128
I thought you two were doing well.

230
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,630
Your girlfriend

231
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,049
is Nam Ha-neul, right?

232
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,761
How did you know?

233
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,096
Jeez, I thought so.

234
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,932
Come to think of it,

235
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,935
I sensed something between you two
on the rooftop that day.

236
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,938
Did I do something wrong by any chance?

237
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,651
I only said that because I never thought
she was your girlfriend.

238
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,986
Do what wrong?

239
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,448
When you rejected my offer
while worried about your girlfriend,

240
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,784
I told Hong-ran about it.

241
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:16,624
I knew you and Ha-neul were close,
so I wanted Ha-neul to persuade you.

242
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,710
What?

243
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,795
Hey.

244
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,881
Can you please walk properly?

245
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,508
Why did you drink
more than you could handle?

246
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,261
-Hey, Hong-ran.
-What?

247
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,220
You heard, right?

248
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,140
Kyung-min was appointed
as a professor a few months ago.

249
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,642
Yeah, I did.

250
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,726
But what about him?

251
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,356
But he's leaving the position
because he's getting married.

252
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,357
Really?

253
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,109
What a waste.

254
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,736
Why are you suddenly telling me this?

255
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,113
Come on!

256
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,032
Come to your senses!

257
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,075
Jeez, Ha-neul.

258
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,826
Jeez.

259
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,120
Someone, help!

260
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,418
Jeong-woo, I'm really sorry.

261
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,754
I shouldn't have said that.

262
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,507
If this is all because of me--

263
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,635
No, it's not your fault.

264
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,553
Then, why did you two break up?

265
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,475
Damn it. I don't know.

266
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:22,231
Then, you should ask her!
Don't let her go if you still like her.

267
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,693
Tell her you'll wait
no matter how long it takes.

268
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,861
-You know what?
-What?

269
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,657
I'm scared saying such things
would make her uncomfortable.

270
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,742
-Oh, dear.
-Come on!

271
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,910
Jeez!

272
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,328
Here. Be careful.

273
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,998
Careful.

274
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,917
-Get a glass of cold water.
-I have a hangover drink in my room.

275
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,419
-I'll get that too.
-Okay.

276
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,504
Goodness.

277
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,673
My goodness.

278
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,091
What happened?

279
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,176
Why did she drink so much?

280
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,829
LA BEAUTE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

281
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,056
Hello.

282
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,558
-Hello.
-Hello.

283
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,559
Hello.

284
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,435
Hey.

285
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,605
I'm sure you all know Dr. Yeo Jeong-woo.

286
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,442
You must be disappointed
that he looked better on-screen.

287
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,902
But don't let it show.

288
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,489
This is our head consultant.

289
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,574
Hello.

290
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,784
They are our consultants.

291
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,702
-Hello.
-Hello.

292
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,245
And she's our PR manager.

293
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,622
Nurse Jeon, Nurse Na, Nurse Do.

294
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,082
And me, Dr. Bin.

295
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,836
Hello, I hope we get along.

296
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,922
Me too. I hope we get along.

297
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,340
Goodness.

298
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,095
It's so heartwarming
to see everyone being so friendly.

299
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,348
You can get to know each other
on your own time.

300
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,433
Hey, come with me.

301
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,767
Okay.

302
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,144
Excuse me.

303
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,567
He's so handsome.

304
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,485
Tell me about it.

305
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,406
But he looks a bit haggard,
maybe because of the ordeal he had.

306
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,657
I feel bad for him.

307
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,911
Still, Dr. Bin requested us in particular,

308
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,662
so please act as if nothing happened.

309
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,207
Okay.

310
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,838
Gosh, is she still asleep?

311
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,888
Jeez, why is she calling me?

312
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,643
Hello, Suk-ja. How are you?

313
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,061
You see,

314
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:34,233
there's this guy I've always had
my eye on for Ha-neul to marry.

315
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,651
He's visiting Seoul today.

316
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:41,615
So I thought he and Ha-neul
could meet up for some coffee.

317
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,326
He's totally up for it.

318
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,496
Goodness. Ha-neul is in
no state to meet anyone right now.

319
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,416
Jeez, you don't know
how important this is.

320
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,294
Do you even know who he is?

321
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,338
You know that hospital in Busan, right?

322
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,383
Suyeong Hospital at the intersection.

323
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,342
Yes, I do.

324
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,927
The massive building.

325
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,221
He's the hospital director's only son.

326
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,724
The director's only son?

327
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,642
Yeah.

328
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,561
He wanted to hand over
the hospital to his son.

329
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,731
But his son isn't
the sharpest tool in the shed,

330
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,609
so that went down the drain.

331
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,112
Now, he wants to hand it over
to a daughter-in-law.

332
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,655
So he's looking for a doctor.

333
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,448
I see. A doctor daughter-in-law.

334
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,743
So I said,
"My niece is a doctor in Seoul."

335
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:31,415
And he's been asking me
to set her up with his son ever since.

336
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:35,377
If things pan out,
he's going to buy me a foreign car.

337
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,423
But you see…

338
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,426
Today isn't a good day
because she's not feeling well.

339
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,845
That's not important right now.

340
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,638
Come up with an excuse

341
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,599
and make her
at least have coffee with him. Okay?

342
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,144
I have to go.

343
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,439
-Mom.
-Hey.

344
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,649
I think I'm going to die.

345
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,276
Jeez.

346
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,986
Goodness.

347
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,404
My stomach hurts.

348
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,512
Ha-neul broke up with Jeong-woo, right?

349
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,016
That's why she drank so much.

350
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,727
Why did they break up?

351
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,104
I'm not sure.

352
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:41,276
She's in so much pain right now.
I need to know what's going on to help.

353
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,529
Well…

354
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,866
She mentioned a colleague while drunk.

355
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,994
They're close, and he was appointed
as a professor recently.

356
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,621
She's always wanted to be one.

357
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,418
And on top of that, she heard
Jeong-woo was recruited by his friend.

358
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,378
So I guess it upset her.

359
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,672
She's been failing
at everything right now,

360
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,717
but those around her are doing just fine.

361
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:11,223
Yes. If that's why, then dating
a hospital director's son would be better.

362
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,350
It would comfort her,

363
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,770
and she'd be able to forget Jeong-woo
by meeting someone new.

364
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,067
Should I just push ahead with it?

365
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,488
Mom.

366
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,989
Do you have something to tell me?

367
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,497
Well…

368
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,169
Someone asked you for a favor.

369
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,214
You know Suyeong Hospital in Busan, right?

370
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,634
The director's son is in Seoul right now

371
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,470
and would like to have
some coffee with you.

372
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,931
With me? Why?

373
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,934
Well, because…

374
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,437
Since he's managing a hospital,

375
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,149
he has some questions
about the hospitals in Seoul.

376
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,861
He'd like to ask a few questions.

377
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,072
Will I be able to answer
any of his questions though?

378
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,075
He asked to see you, so probably.

379
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,996
All right, then.

380
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,623
-You'll meet him?
-Yes.

381
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,916
-What?
-What?

382
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,003
What's wrong? Isn't that what you wanted?

383
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,920
Yes.

384
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,548
Yes, it was.

385
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,718
But I didn't expect you to say yes.

386
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,805
You've never asked me
for such favors before.

387
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,227
I'll go then.

388
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,605
I should wash up.

389
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,111
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

390
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,864
How am I supposed to feel?

391
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,881
YEO JEONG-WOO
LA BEAUTE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

392
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,764
It's been a while.

393
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,867
Hello. Are you Mr. Kwak Jae-yeong?

394
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,786
Why ask if you already know?

395
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,334
Did you wait a long time?

396
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,463
I got you an iced Americano
since that's what most people drink.

397
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,303
So tell me. What were you
curious enough about to meet me?

398
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,598
Curious about what?

399
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,725
Didn't you want to meet
because you had questions

400
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,519
about the hospitals here in Seoul?

401
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,692
Does that hurt your pride less?

402
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,403
What did you say?

403
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:15,365
You know why you're here,
but you're playing dumb,

404
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,951
as if you're not superficial
and were forced to come out.

405
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,995
Does doing that help you save face?

406
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,207
I mean, I'm just asking.

407
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,503
Well-educated people always act
as if they're so refined.

408
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,339
What are you talking about?

409
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,508
To be honest, I couldn't care less.

410
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,386
Who I marry won't make a big difference.

411
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:40,932
But I don't like women
who play dumb like you do.

412
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,438
-"Marry"?
-You really don't hear?

413
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,942
To take over his hospital, my father
is looking for a doctor daughter-in-law.

414
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,778
Your aunt told me a bit about you.

415
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:58,408
After struggling for years to become
a professor, you failed and are jobless.

416
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,951
But you see…

417
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,330
The director of a rural hospital
is better than a professor.

418
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,877
Your aunt said
she told your mother everything.

419
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,050
Excuse me.

420
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,306
I'm fine.

421
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,735
There were more dishes to wash?

422
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,363
Mom, can I please stop?

423
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,699
Don't be absurd.
Do it while your uncle lets you.

424
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,618
If you work hard for a few months,

425
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,496
he said he'd teach you
how to make noodles.

426
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,625
Jeez, why are you sighing so much?

427
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,544
-It's because of Ha-neul, right?
-Yeah.

428
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,672
I think I made a mistake.

429
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,509
You shouldn't have lied
to make her go there.

430
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,178
No. I think Mom did the right thing.

431
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,514
Ha-neul wouldn't have gone
if she knew the truth.

432
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,350
And who knows?
The guy could be her soulmate.

433
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,646
She needs to quickly get over the guy
who dumped her after getting a job.

434
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,233
No, I should still tell her the truth.

435
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,660
Mom, we need to talk.

436
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,757
I can explain.

437
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,635
Do I embarrass you?

438
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,765
You're embarrassed
because you can't brag about me, right?

439
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,103
How could you say that?

440
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,647
Then, why do you want me
to get a job so badly?

441
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,777
I don't. It was just too great
of a position to pass up.

442
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,196
-I did what's best for you--
-And what's that?

443
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,159
Just living a successful life.

444
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,875
Do I have to be successful?
Can't I just live like this?

445
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,922
That guy said he knew I struggled
for years to become a professor

446
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,924
but failed and became jobless.

447
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,887
He said a director of a rural hospital
was better than a professor.

448
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,432
But what he said didn't faze me.

449
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,644
I've been ridiculed several times
like that after leaving the hospital.

450
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,815
I didn't care about what my aunts thought
or others making fun of me.

451
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,321
But this means you agreed with them.

452
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:46,493
You made me go on that blind date,
because you thought my life was pathetic!

453
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,416
That makes me feel worse.
Do you know that?

454
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,639
-The number you have dialed…
-Why isn't she picking up?

455
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:12,477
HOPE OBGYN CLINIC

456
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,270
Ba-da, are you busy? Can you talk?

457
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,731
I'm busy helping my uncle, but what is it?

458
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,485
I called Ha-neul because I was worried,
but she won't answer. Is something up?

459
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,570
Of course. Don't get me started.

460
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,365
Mom tricked her into going
on a blind date, so she's furious.

461
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,243
What? Ha-neul went on a blind date?

462
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,036
With who?

463
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,622
I'm too busy right now.
I'll call you back later.

464
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,623
Okay, bye.

465
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,256
-Hello.
-Hello.

466
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,681
Did he hear that or not?

467
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:58,064
Are these dishes reproducing?
Why are there even more?

468
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,816
There's no end to this.

469
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,192
Ba-da.

470
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,777
-Turn off the stove.
-Okay.

471
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,696
Gosh, that's hot!

472
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,823
What's wrong?

473
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,993
This is all your fault!
I said I didn't want to do this work!

474
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,204
But you forced me into this kitchen,
and look what you've done!

475
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,999
-Gosh.
-I'm sorry.

476
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,668
I was wrong.

477
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,131
I just wanted you to be happy.

478
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,094
I'm losing my judgment as I age.

479
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,847
I've become useless.

480
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,683
I'm to blame.

481
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,937
What's wrong, Mom?

482
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,649
What did I say?

483
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,931
Uncle Tae-seon.

484
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,562
Drink this.

485
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,648
Thanks.

486
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,025
Ha-neul.

487
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,070
What? You want me
to be understanding of Mom?

488
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,530
No, have some of this too.

489
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,166
Don't try to understand her.
It's not possible.

490
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,088
She made you go on a blind date
without telling you. Ridiculous.

491
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,549
-You were pretty flustered, right?
-Totally.

492
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,803
-And that guy wasn't your type?
-No, not one bit.

493
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,931
I heard his father
was a hospital director.

494
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,892
-Was he arrogant about being rich?
-Yes.

495
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,313
He said I came knowing I'd inherit
the director position by marrying him

496
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,190
and I was just playing dumb.

497
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,901
Then, he asked if doing so
hurt my pride less.

498
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,361
-Damn it.
-Unbelievable.

499
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,698
Which bus terminal did he go to?
I'm going to pluck him bald.

500
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:16,285
What do you mean "bus terminal"?
He probably flew back in business class.

501
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,205
He must already be back in Busan then.

502
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,417
That lucky punk.
I would've beaten him to a pulp.

503
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,879
Forget it. You don't need to do that.

504
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,507
You're bad-mouthing him and Mom on purpose

505
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,801
just to make me feel better.

506
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,053
I'm not a kid, you know?

507
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,264
Goodness, I wish you were.

508
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,641
I'd put you on my shoulders

509
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,061
and buy you some workbooks.
Then, you'd be smiling from ear to ear.

510
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,606
It was easy
to make you feel better back then.

511
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,110
But now, I don't know how to comfort you.

512
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,946
My heart aches
because there's nothing I can do for you.

513
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,454
I wanted to ask you many times
after you quit the hospital.

514
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,205
"Why did you quit?"

515
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,374
"What was so tough?"

516
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,836
I wanted to ask
if we could be of any help.

517
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,466
But I'm not well-educated
nor do I have much to offer.

518
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,596
All I can give you
is this shoulder to lean on.

519
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,892
But then again, you must have
much better people to lean on than me.

520
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,978
Uncle Tae-seon, that's not true.

521
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,063
Don't say that.

522
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,858
I'm just saying it hurts
because I can't do anything for you.

523
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,445
Gosh, the cabbages have grown a lot.

524
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,574
Did you know your mom
planted them to give to you?

525
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,576
-For me?
-Yeah.

526
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,537
She saw on the news
that they were… What was it again?

527
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,623
Full of calcium.

528
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,042
Apparently, they calm you down
when you're tense.

529
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,794
They're good for depression.

530
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,879
So she planted them
as soon as she heard that.

531
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,885
What else can she do for you
other than plant these cabbages?

532
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,852
Speaking of which, Ha-neul.

533
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,980
Could you grant me a wish I have?

534
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,067
A wish? What is it?

535
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,027
Here.

536
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:18,616
MIDANG PIG'S TROTTERS

537
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,786
What is this?
Your wish was to have some pig's trotters?

538
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,122
Yeah, you know I love pig's trotters.

539
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,206
Sit down.

540
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,420
Let's go.

541
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,673
Jeez, what's with you?

542
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,425
You think I have an appetite
for pig's trotters right now?

543
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,389
Let's go.

544
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,849
I got her.

545
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,433
I mean, I brought Mom.

546
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,476
Well done.

547
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,440
Could we get a large half-and-half
and two bottles of soju?

548
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,441
Okay.

549
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,487
I closed the restaurant
for the very first time ever today.

550
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,822
And do you know why?

551
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,283
For our family harmony.

552
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,953
I'm not working today.
So let's drink a bunch and make up.

553
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,956
-There's nothing to make up.
-Look at this.

554
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,292
You're trying to sweep it
under the run again.

555
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,836
People don't do that these days.
They're open about it.

556
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,173
They talk about what hurt them
and apologize if they need to.

557
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,883
Being honest is the trend these days.

558
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,925
That's it, Lambada.

559
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,637
Let's go out for some fresh air.
You two can talk.

560
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,640
Forget it. You're not going anywhere.

561
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,060
-She's right. Just stay.
-What is this?

562
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,646
Why are you suddenly awkward?

563
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,273
-This isn't a blind date.
-Hey…

564
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,734
That word's banned. Let's go.

565
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,236
-Hurry up!
-Tae-seon.

566
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,821
Ba-da.

567
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,256
Have a drink.

568
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,676
Okay.

569
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:27,536
I was wrong for what I did today.

570
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,248
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,673
I was meaning to call you
because I had something to give you.

572
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,557
BUSAN HOPE BANK

573
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,685
What's this?

574
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:56,732
Your dad wanted to give you
that bank account when you got married.

575
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,406
Ba-da told me recently

576
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,785
that you had insomnia
for a while after Dad passed away.

577
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,873
You felt guilty
about not picking up his last call,

578
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,418
because you were busy studying, right?

579
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,755
You must've hurt so much

580
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,010
about not letting him hear your voice
one last time before he passed.

581
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,014
But you know what?

582
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,101
Ha-neul, it's okay.

583
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,521
You can let go of your guilt.

584
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,985
Until his very last breath,

585
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,738
your dad was happy to be your dad.

586
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,158
He and I

587
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,161
were extremely happy to be your parents.

588
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,208
After becoming a parent,

589
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,670
I believed my children's grades

590
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,008
reflected my own grade in life.

591
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,677
REPORT CARD

592
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,054
Gosh!

593
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,889
How are these grades possible?

594
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,517
Jeez, Ha-neul.

595
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,810
You're truly incredible.

596
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,774
You know I love the number one.
You came in first place in everything.

597
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,567
-I did well, right?
-Very well.

598
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:27,198
Thanks to you, it felt like we got
the best grades on our report cards too.

599
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,783
You're truly amazing.

600
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,167
-Honey.
-Yes?

601
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,089
I just spoke
with Ha-neul's homeroom teacher.

602
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,549
Brace yourself now.

603
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:51,555
Ha-neul has a great chance
to get into a medical school in Seoul.

604
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,724
Can you believe that?

605
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,934
Is that true?

606
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,437
My goodness, Ha-neul.

607
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,648
She's incredible.

608
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,610
I'm so grateful for her.

609
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,861
Me too.

610
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,698
I can't believe
I gave birth to such an incredible girl.

611
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,037
We were happy to be your parents

612
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,125
in every single moment of our lives.

613
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,752
I have depression.

614
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,170
I pushed myself too hard

615
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,215
and couldn't rest when I was tired,

616
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,511
so it became an illness of the mind.

617
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,432
We were proud of raising you.

618
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,100
MEDICINE

619
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,769
But your life was so tough.

620
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,190
I was truly happy to be your mom.

621
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,193
But you were in so much pain.

622
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,490
I'm sorry

623
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:56,245
I couldn't give you
a better and happier life.

624
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,331
You don't have to feel guilty at all.

625
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:05,087
Never once in my life
did I think your life was pathetic.

626
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,636
So,

627
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,390
with this money,

628
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,145
go travel and eat all the foods
you've wanted to eat.

629
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,567
You can be unemployed forever if you want.

630
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,404
I just want you to be happy now.

631
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:36,494
I don't know
what happened at the hospital.

632
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,747
But I hope you can put it all behind you

633
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,375
and find peace.

634
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,592
Cheers.

635
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,059
Have you finished crying?

636
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,312
Then, smile now.

637
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,105
I will.

638
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,205
What? Ha-neul went on a blind date?

639
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,540
With who?

640
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,502
I'm sure she had her reasons.

641
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,564
NAM BA-DA
YOUR OCEAN

642
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,198
OUR DAY OF FAMILY HARMONY

643
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:57,825
What is this?

644
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,326
How are you doing so well?

645
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,871
You went on a blind date
and even enjoyed some pig's trotters.

646
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,583
How come? I'm in so much pain!

647
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,043
How can you eat
pig's trotters at a time like this?

648
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,049
Right.

649
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,594
I'm sure she had her reasons.

650
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,109
-Nice work today.
-Good job, Uncle Tae-seon.

651
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,491
Gosh, this ice cream
is sweet and delicious.

652
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,828
By the way, don't you miss Jeong-woo?

653
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,457
Weren't you just talking about ice cream?

654
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,210
I do. I miss him.

655
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,882
But I thought it was best to end it here.

656
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,967
Best, my foot.

657
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,802
He's a rare gem.

658
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,514
What? I thought you didn't like him.

659
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:07,186
It's impossible to not like him.

660
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,521
I told you before.

661
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,485
I can't forget how he looked
on the day he moved in.

662
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,154
MOVE STUDIO MOVING COMPANY

663
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,118
That handsome boy looked so devastated.

664
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,090
He didn't seem to be
eating proper meals either.

665
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,096
Hey.

666
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,682
Goodness.

667
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,517
That's your meal?

668
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,310
It's nice and convenient.

669
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,937
Even still,

670
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,730
your parents would be heartbroken.

671
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,903
Speaking of which,
are they visiting anytime?

672
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,446
Well…

673
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,615
They live far away.

674
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,075
I see.

675
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,621
But then again, you're all grown
so you don't need them.

676
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,832
You're doing so well on your own.

677
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,291
Not really.

678
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,629
That's why I envy Ha-neul.
She has a family who cares about her.

679
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,384
I didn't mean it that way.

680
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,302
She has a family who cares,

681
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,680
so I meant she'd get back
on her feet soon.

682
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,852
Right. Were you the one
who left the kimchi here?

683
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,395
Did you like it?

684
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,814
It's really delicious. Thank you.

685
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,607
I'll make you some more next time.

686
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,027
-I'll go inside now.
-Okay. Go on.

687
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,658
That's why I couldn't dislike him.

688
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,328
Goodness.

689
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,545
You broke my heart.

690
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,179
And so did he.

691
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,100
So…

692
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,647
I was grateful
that you two relied on each other.

693
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,194
I was relieved

694
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,074
that you had him to confide in.

695
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:33,624
I don't know what you went through.

696
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:40,506
But I hoped you could find solace in him.

697
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:48,639
I prayed that Jeong-woo
would help you live a life

698
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:53,393
where you didn't have to torment yourself.

699
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,440
Goodness, let's go.

700
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,146
Gosh, my head.

701
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,777
YEO JEONG-WOO

702
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,865
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

703
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,165
I must've been crazy.

704
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,708
You lunatic.

705
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,003
Ha-neul.

706
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,048
Mom needs chili peppers for hangover soup.

707
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,008
I need to use the bathroom.
Can you get them?

708
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,053
No!

709
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,804
Let's go!

710
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,563
I am out of my mind.

711
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,274
Why did I send that text?

712
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,156
Hey.

713
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,744
What are you doing here?

714
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,082
It's my place.
Am I not allowed to be here?

715
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,168
No, that's not what I meant.

716
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,928
-Hey, ex-girlfriend.
-"Ex-girlfriend"?

717
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,348
We may have dated
for only two days, but we're still exes.

718
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,769
You asked if I was asleep last night.
An ex would definitely do that.

719
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,229
Well, that was…

720
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,399
I drank a bit too much yesterday
when I sent that.

721
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,568
You seem to be doing well.

722
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,279
Drinking, eating pig's trotters,

723
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,533
and even going on blind dates.

724
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,659
How did you know?

725
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,244
Seriously? Hey!

726
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,831
-You really went on one?
-I had no idea it was a blind date.

727
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,750
And about the drinking--
No, the pig's trotters…

728
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,009
But then again, I'm in no position to ask.

729
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,428
Who do I think I am?

730
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,221
I'm just your ex, right?

731
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,313
Don't be too happy.

732
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,650
But don't be too sad either.

733
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,653
Bye.

734
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,033
I…

735
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,914
I came because I had something to say.

736
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,084
I wanted to ask you but didn't want
to make you uncomfortable.

737
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,669
Whether you knew or not,

738
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,881
you had a blind date, drank,
and ate pig's trotters. So you're fine.

739
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,967
So let me ask you this
since you're doing just fine.

740
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,803
What is it?

741
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,391
Can I wait for you?

742
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,688
Can I wait…

743
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,983
until you feel better?

744
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,992
What? What's wrong?

745
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,243
Am I being too clingy?

746
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,748
You were being pathetic too
when you sent me that text last night.

747
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,500
What? "Pathetic"?

748
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,960
Yes, you were being pathetic and clingy!

749
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,214
I mean, it wasn't that bad.

750
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,548
Forget it.

751
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,926
I'm going to pine
and wait for you like an ex should.

752
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,052
So…

753
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,972
come back whenever you're ready.

754
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,936
Don't skip your meals.

755
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,314
Take your medication on time
and go for walks every now and then.

756
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,610
You can come back after some time.

757
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,458
Bye.

758
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,053
I'm really leaving.

759
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,944
LA BEAUTE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

760
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,454
Hey, Jeong-woo.

761
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,124
Why are you coming from there?
Did you take the bus?

762
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,667
Did you go home last night?

763
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,420
-I just stopped by this morning.
-Why?

764
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,715
-To see Ha-neul?
-What?

765
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,802
What? Did you get back together?

766
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,512
-I said no.
-I beg to differ.

767
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,098
-Stop annoying me.
-What is it?

768
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,684
I told you this last time,
but it's really how I feel.

769
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,937
It's okay to hold onto her
if you still like her.

770
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,230
What are your knees for?

771
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,982
If you need to kneel, then do so.

772
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,026
What in the world?

773
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,822
Yes, Dr. Yeo
will be conducting the operation.

774
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,740
Yes.

775
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,492
Then, we'll see you next Tuesday.

776
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:25,952
Goodbye.

777
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,329
Hello.

778
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,874
This is insane. I advertised
that Dr. Yeo joined our clinic,

779
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,919
and we're teeming with patients
this morning. Look.

780
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,630
We're fully booked for next week as well.

781
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,548
Dr. Yeo.

782
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,051
Can you do non-incisions tomorrow?

783
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,636
Well…

784
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,515
Sure.

785
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,925
Local anesthesia!

786
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,139
Hurry!

787
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,267
What do we do? The bleeding won't stop!

788
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,657
Please…

789
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,025
How did the anesthesia go?

790
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:25,071
Good. The patient is sleeping.
You may begin now.

791
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,198
Let's begin.

792
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,667
Caliper and forceps.

793
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,560
Pen.

794
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,412
Local anesthesia.

795
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,192
Scalpel.

796
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,823
I'm not sure.

797
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,616
I think he has PTSD.

798
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,743
Seriously?

799
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,913
We're fully booked for next week though.

800
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,582
This would be bad if word gets out.

801
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,333
That too,

802
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,795
but I heard many doctors can't go back
to work after medical accidents.

803
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,717
Dr. Yeo and Dr. Bin are discussing it,
so I'll let you know.

804
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:23,082
If it's too much to handle,
let's cancel tomorrow's surgeries--

805
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,000
No.

806
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,046
It's just been a while.
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

807
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,924
I explained everything to the patient.

808
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,512
If something ever happens,
I'll take responsibility.

809
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,931
Hey, that's not the point right now.

810
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,518
To be honest, I was worried.

811
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,729
But I thought you were okay
since you looked fine.

812
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,732
-I think tomorrow's surgeries--
-I can do it.

813
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,944
I won't make any mistakes.

814
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,322
I'm sorry about today.

815
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,555
Hey, I have something to ask you.

816
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:40,118
YEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

817
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,042
Why is this…

818
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,799
Ha-neul. Care for some fried chicken?

819
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,342
No, thanks.

820
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,552
Thanks.

821
00:59:58,636 --> 00:59:59,637
Hey, Ba-da.

822
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,058
-Did you take this picture out?
-Who's that?

823
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:11,190
Seeing how it was hidden
inside a book, is he your ex?

824
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,734
Ex, my foot.

825
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,277
He's a colleague.

826
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,862
So was it you?

827
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:20,158
No. These bookshelves
make me nauseous, so I stay far away.

828
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,744
You weren't looking through them
for hidden money?

829
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,495
You never hide cash in books

830
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,998
since you're afraid
I'd rip them while looking.

831
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,334
"Never go near the bookshelves."

832
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,419
Wasn't that our unspoken rule?

833
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,880
Then, who was it?

834
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,632
Mom never touches my books.

835
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,429
Right. Jeong-woo
was briefly in here last week.

836
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,556
He looked at your yearbook.

837
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,934
Maybe he opened that book
while putting it back and saw the photo.

838
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,019
What?

839
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,173
Hey, what is it?

840
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,091
Well…

841
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,552
Did you know Jeong-woo
is working at Dr. Bin's clinic?

842
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,597
Yeah, somewhat.

843
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,807
How did you know?

844
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,101
I happened to run into him yesterday.

845
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,436
I'd been curious.

846
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,105
But that's not the issue right now.

847
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,066
Do you still have feelings for him?

848
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,568
Or are you going to forget
about him? What is it?

849
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,654
What are you talking about?

850
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:44,492
I'm just not sure if telling you this
will help you or not.

851
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:46,661
What is it?

852
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,624
Did you know that Jeong-woo
suffered from PTSD?

853
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,003
How did you know that?

854
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,852
He suffered a panic attack
during surgery today.

855
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,899
But then again, he had that ordeal,
so it would be hard to recover that fast.

856
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,403
It's impressive how he's still hanging on.

857
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,428
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

858
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,555
She just came in,
and we inserted the line.

859
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,057
Our anesthesiologist is here too.

860
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,392
We put her pre-surgery photo
on the monitor.

861
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,398
Were there any issues
during the induction of anesthesia?

862
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,275
No, there weren't.

863
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,944
Both her BP and pulse are stable.

864
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,424
Dr. Yeo, you may begin now.

865
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,133
DOCTOR SLUMP

866
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,678
You told me to come back.
You said I could come back whenever.

867
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,973
I think continuing to insist
that I'm fine is unfair to everyone.

868
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,392
Ha-neul hit rock bottom
because of Min Kyung-min?

869
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:57,351
What do you mean?

870
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,979
Damn it!

871
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,606
I still don't think you know

872
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,026
how much you mean to me.

873
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,030
If I need a reason
to overcome this trauma,

874
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,990
there's no better reason than you.

875
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,950
Let's do this together.

876
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:20,625
