DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,626
Okay, now let me tell you
why I started to hate

3
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,420
Nam Ha-neul.

4
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,468
With my gifted brain, I became
the top-ranked student in my school,

5
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,636
in my region, and in the country.

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,680
That's me. Yeo Jeong-woo.

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,104
Pass it!

8
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,565
Here!

9
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,456
I was good at sports too.

10
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,167
Here.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,669
-What's this?
-You know there's a quiz tomorrow, right?

12
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,587
What's this?

13
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,547
I wrote some notes down yesterday.

14
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,883
It'll count toward your grades,
so study hard.

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,885
You're the best, Jeong-woo!

16
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,553
Yeo Jeong-woo!

17
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,930
-Stop it.
-Yeo Jeong-woo!

18
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,556
Yeo Jeong-woo!

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,059
Stop. Don't be like that.

20
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,770
I also had
an unbelievably amazing personality.

21
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,355
Study!

22
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,317
Yeo Jeong-woo!

23
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,569
Jeong-woo.

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,739
I saw you buying
tteokbokki earlier but no sundae.

25
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,327
Simply put, I was extremely popular.

26
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,372
-Thanks.
-So I assumed.

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,706
Thanks.

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,834
I thought my life
would come up roses forever.

29
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,380
And then, one day…

30
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,010
a crazy girl appeared out of nowhere.

31
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,847
Nam Ha-neul.

32
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,434
She ran around just to solve
one more question.

33
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,566
She ate instant coffee without water
to save time and not go to the bathroom.

34
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,776
She was obsessed about studying.

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,319
REPORT CARD

36
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,240
Thanks to her, I was given the taste
of defeat for the first time in my life.

37
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,158
Hey!

38
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,203
I became faster.

39
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:43,872
I did more.

40
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,959
I worked quicker.

41
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,756
I even sacrificed my sleep.

42
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,722
Starting today, she's not eating
so she can study more.

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,812
No.

44
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,064
I even starved.

45
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:10,982
Damn it.

46
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,156
And so, I was on the road
to destruction when one day…

47
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,993
Okay, you get that?
We just did factorization.

48
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,745
Now, let's find the limit.

49
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,413
To do that…

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,084
Since we said X is minus 1,
this would end up being 0.

51
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,379
And if you substitute this
for minus 1, you get 0 here too.

52
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,715
Jeong-woo, are you okay?

53
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,808
Okay, that's it for today's class.

54
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,477
Go home and study hard.

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,436
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

56
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,814
-Class dismissed.
-Thank you, sir.

57
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,823
Sir, Ha-neul fainted!

58
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,907
-What?
-Oh, my God!

59
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,492
-Hey!
-Hey, Ha-neul!

60
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,994
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

61
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,208
Jeong-woo fainted too!

62
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
Hey, what's wrong with you two? Jeong-woo!

63
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,087
And thus…

64
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,758
I came in second even when we fainted.

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,999
Are you okay?

66
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,679
That crazy…

67
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,979
Gosh.

68
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,731
Jeez.

69
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,270
Goodness! Jeong-woo, how are you?

70
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,564
Are you feeling a bit better?

71
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,691
-Yes, I am.
-Good.

72
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,736
By the way, where's Ha-neul?

73
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,531
Right. She went to her academy
for an intensive class.

74
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,282
What?

75
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,202
-An intensive class?
-Yeah.

76
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,413
She ran out because she said
she needed to sit in front.

77
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,958
Wow.

78
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,169
Despite ruining my once peaceful life,

79
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,256
that heartless girl
didn't even ask if I was okay.

80
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,842
She lacked manners and kindness,
and she was rude!

81
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,720
I couldn't hide my shock at her actions

82
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,849
and desperately hoped
we'd never cross paths ever again.

83
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,267
-What's wrong?
-Jeong-woo.

84
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:15,977
However…

85
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,978
-Okay!
-Jeong-woo!

86
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,814
Let's go all the way to the end then!

87
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,362
What do I do now?

88
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,295
You crazy fool.

89
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,091
I must be insane!

90
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,929
DOCTOR SLUMP

91
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,847
No.

BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

94
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,118
Hey.

95
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,120
Hey. Long time no see.

96
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,956
We had drinks together last night.

97
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,751
Right, we did.

98
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,173
-Hey, Ha-neul.
-Hey, Jeong-woo.

99
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,842
-I'll go first.
-No, let me go first.

100
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,595
I drank too much last night.

101
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,349
You know alcohol numbs the frontal lobe
and hinders rational decisions, right?

102
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,266
Of course, I do.

103
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,560
Our frontal lobes were
to blame last night, not us.

104
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,561
Of course.

105
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,855
From now on, let's keep
our frontal lobes in check.

106
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,107
Let's stay away
from alcohol and each other.

107
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,275
-Promise.
-Promise…

108
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,237
Right. We said we should stay away.

109
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,281
You're right. Okay.
Then, get lost already.

110
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,451
All right. You should get lost too. Bye.

111
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,953
-Hey.
-What?

112
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,454
Weren't you just leaving?

113
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,292
You're right. I'll get lost then.

114
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,210
Okay.

115
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,421
Sorry, I need to get lost that way.

116
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,174
This is driving me nuts.

117
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,436
Where have you been?

118
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,439
I just…

119
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,400
went out for some air.

120
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,529
Gosh, I'm so thirsty.

121
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,830
Ha-neul, I heard you have depression.

122
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,960
I also heard you fought with your superior
and quit. You fought with Mom too.

123
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,878
Are you a fighter or something?

124
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,547
So…

125
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,133
I never said it like that.

126
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,302
Come on. Don't be flustered.

127
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,347
Anyway, now that you're unemployed,
don't worry and just rest.

128
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,892
Look at me. I'm jobless and stress-free.

129
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,478
No reason for me to be depressed.
How nice is that?

130
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,563
That's enough.

131
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,356
What do you mean "That's enough"?

132
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,609
We shouldn't try to hide this.

133
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,571
We should be open, talk about it often,
and help her out as a family.

134
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,615
That will help her recover faster. Right?

135
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,662
Right. What's for dinner tonight?

136
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,957
What? Bean sprouts?

137
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,713
I want some jangjorim though.
Mom, can't you make me some?

138
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,049
-And with beef shank?
-Damn it.

139
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,009
What? Beef shank?

140
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,595
You're not grasping
the situation, you fool.

141
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,639
-I'll beat some sense into you.
-Help, Ha-neul!

142
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,808
Fine, use eye of round instead then!

143
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,393
-Use that.
-For goodness' sake!

144
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,604
No? Then, just quail eggs will do.

145
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,022
That sounds good, right?

146
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,107
Quail eggs are fine!

147
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,108
That's enough!

148
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,865
Jeez.

149
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,618
I can't have peace anywhere.

150
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,590
Hey, Ha-neul.

151
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,600
-Have this.
-What is it?

152
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,769
Your antidepressants.

153
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,939
Ba-da said he found them in your closet.

154
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,108
That little bastard.

155
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,821
From now on, you don't have to
hide your pills or take them in secret.

156
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,407
And yesterday…

157
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,578
I'm sorry about yesterday.

158
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:54,171
It must've been so hard
to have gone through this all by yourself.

159
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,928
From now on, I'll do everything I can

160
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,305
to help you overcome your depression.

161
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,268
So here. Take this.

162
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,480
Okay, I will. So you can go, Mom.

163
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,650
Okay. All right, I'll leave.

164
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,777
Make sure you take it.

165
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,572
Stay strong.

166
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:50,769
You are created
to receive the greatest love.

167
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,896
Hold on!

168
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,356
What are you doing?

169
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,817
You see…

170
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,613
We agreed that being all gloomy
wouldn't help you one bit.

171
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,574
So we decided to put
our sadness aside and cheer you up!

172
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,576
This was my idea.

173
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,455
People seemed to party nowadays when sad.
Goodbye parties, divorce parties…

174
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,124
And this is what I came up with.
A depression party!

175
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,292
Party!

176
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,335
Look over there.

177
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,795
Ha-neul, we'll always have your back.

178
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,796
So…

179
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,340
HANDSOME

180
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,966
Let's overcome this together.

181
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,301
Gosh, there you go again.

182
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,595
I'm not crying. We can do it!

183
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,472
All right! Follow me!

184
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,598
Let's eat.

185
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,809
-All right.
-Sit down.

186
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
Okay.

187
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,687
All right.

188
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:39,652
Ha-neul, fish with red flesh
is good for depression.

189
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,570
I heard cabbage is great for it too.

190
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,489
Try some. Here. That's it.

191
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,615
Chew thoroughly.

192
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,200
Eat up.

193
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,327
-Thoroughly. And swallow.
-She likes it.

194
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,705
You are created…

195
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,250
-Mom, eat. You should eat too.
-Okay.

196
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,501
Let's eat.

197
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,835
What else would you like?

198
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,469
What's the matter with them?
Why do they want me to recover so bad?

199
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,106
-What's up?
-Me? Preparing for surgery.

200
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,692
Are you bragging about work?

201
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,485
Let's drink later--

202
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,903
Sorry, I have the night shift.

203
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,198
-Then, tomorrow?
-It's Saturday.

204
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,658
Jin-woo visits on weekends.

205
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,287
That's perfect. He misses me too, right?

206
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,122
What is it? Are you that bored?

207
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,541
So why did you have to quit then?

208
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,502
-Why'd you beat your professor and quit--
-Damn it.

209
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,672
Jeez, she's so annoying.

210
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,268
You must be distraught.

211
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,105
The prosecution will probably

212
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,525
push forward with how your prints
were found on the heparin bottle.

213
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,946
But currently, that alone isn't enough
to convict you, so don't worry.

214
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,868
I just don't understand
how that bottle ended up in my clinic…

215
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,578
We don't understand it either.

216
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,414
We searched the trash
and the nearby CCTV several times.

217
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,543
We even interviewed your employees,
but nothing strange turned up.

218
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,838
Also, for the second hearing next week,

219
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,591
we'll be summoning
Dr. Kang Jin-seok as our witness.

220
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,053
-Sorry?
-He was with you during the surgery,

221
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,472
so he'll know best how innocent you are.

222
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,933
We also thought he could testify

223
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,853
about your surgery methods
and your clinic's system in detail.

224
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,105
We requested his presence,
and he said yes.

225
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,025
I see.

226
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,405
It's a relief
since his testimony will be of help.

227
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,368
To be frank, I was suspicious of him.

228
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,371
He was the only one
who had refused questioning.

229
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,289
It was strange for several reasons.

230
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,418
But seeing how he agreed to testify,
maybe I was wrong.

231
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,921
But the thing is…

232
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:10,094
Why did he suddenly agree to testify
after refusing to be questioned before?

233
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,268
What was that?

234
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,229
What? Did you hear something?

235
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,356
Or maybe not.

236
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,234
Hey, Mr. Unemployed.

237
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,737
Take this to fellow in the rooftop room.

238
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,948
I'm busy right now.
I'm texting this girl I'm interested in.

239
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,077
You've never done such a thing before,
so I'm sure you wouldn't know.

240
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,746
-But I need to give it my all.
-Okay.

241
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,790
You do that. And you'll have
no allowance this month.

242
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,793
Fine. I'll go.

243
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,592
-But what is this?
-I noticed he had a really thin blanket.

244
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,261
Mom. Don't be so nosy.

245
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,473
You said he was a doctor.
I'm sure he can buy his own blankets.

246
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,559
You fool. If he was well-off,
would he be living up there?

247
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,315
I don't know why, but I heard
he came here completely broke.

248
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,692
Go on then.

249
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,861
I'll be back.

250
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,159
Excuse me.

251
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,952
Mr. Rooftop.

252
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,706
Gosh.

253
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,003
Hey!

254
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,590
Hey.

255
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,183
What's going on?

256
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,119
What are you doing here?

257
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,871
Mr. Rooftop.

258
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,375
I came to give you a blanket.
But the door was open.

259
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,544
-And the window was broken.
-What?

260
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,770
So no items were missing?

261
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,688
No.

262
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,566
Someone broke in,
but they didn't take anything.

263
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,361
Failed attempts like these
aren't uncommon.

264
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,614
He either couldn't find what he wanted
or sensed someone coming.

265
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,782
-So he ran.
-What?

266
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,701
Did he run after hearing me come up?

267
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,413
We'll have to check CCTV cameras
and dashcams nearby for more details.

268
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,957
We'll let you know as soon as possible.

269
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,209
Yes, sir. I really hope you can catch him.

270
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,544
We'll get going then.

271
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,671
-Okay. Thank you.
-We'll be in touch.

272
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,090
Oh, dear.

273
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,885
I should've installed
some window guards sooner.

274
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,387
-I'm really sorry about this.
-It's okay.

275
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,764
You should come sleep
at our place tonight.

276
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,601
Goodness. No, that's okay.

277
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,770
But there's a huge hole there.
So much wind will come through.

278
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,191
Well, I can put up some newspaper.
I just have to endure one night.

279
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,609
-Newspaper?
-Yes.

280
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,526
Right.

281
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,739
-Good night.
-Good night. I feel so terrible though.

282
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,882
Damn it.

283
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,809
Damn it.

284
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,231
That's no way to treat a wound.

285
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,658
-What? Why are you here?
-I heard you had a break-in.

286
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,660
But you insisted on sleeping here.

287
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,331
You got it wrong.
I'm going to sleep at a friend's place.

288
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,208
Is that friend Kyung-min?

289
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,795
-He's doing emergency surgery.
-How do you know that?

290
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,007
I just spoke with him about handing over
my duties. Come down to our place.

291
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,637
It's okay. I can go
to another friend's house.

292
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,888
You cut ties with them.

293
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,561
-My acquaintances--
-They won't pick up your calls.

294
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:14,940
Well…

295
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,027
Look, it's awkward for me too
because of what happened yesterday.

296
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,531
But it's not enough to let
my former classmate sleep here.

297
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,617
So let's forget about what happened
and just go to our house.

298
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,164
Then, let me just clean this up first.

299
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
All right.

300
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,144
This break-in bothers you, right?

301
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,522
-You don't think this was a small matter.
-How did you know?

302
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,443
You said you were afraid of thugs
in black suits coming for revenge.

303
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,112
If it was really a thug,

304
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,614
he would've killed you
without anyone knowing.

305
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,825
He wouldn't wreck
a shabby room like this. Right?

306
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,204
I mean, a real thug
would've dragged you away.

307
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,041
He'd beat you up with a sack on you
in an abandoned building.

308
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,251
Then, he'd hang you upside down
and beat you more.

309
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,170
And he'd toss
your dead body into the river.

310
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,423
Are you some kind of robot?

311
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,260
Thanks for the realistic
and detailed explanation.

312
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,220
I…

313
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,265
I'm just saying you don't need to worry.

314
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,642
Our neighbors were robbed recently too.

315
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,229
I guess rooftops getting robbed
is our neighborhood's new trend.

316
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,400
So don't worry too much
and focus on your trial instead.

317
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,869
Things will work out.
It wasn't your fault.

318
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,009
You're so clumsy.

319
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,727
I'd like to apologize
for this inconvenience.

320
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,523
Goodness,
it's not an inconvenience at all.

321
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,608
Oh, dear.

322
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:26,905
I thought you were Hong-ran's friend
since she introduced you to us.

323
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,992
But I had no idea you and Ha-neul
used to go to the same school.

324
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,746
Exactly. No wonder you looked familiar.

325
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,458
Maybe I saw you from her yearbook.

326
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,752
Hey, just shut it and eat.

327
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,338
How prickly.

328
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,256
Hey.

329
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,509
Was she always like this?
How was she in high school?

330
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,762
-Well…
-Why are you so curious?

331
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,223
To be honest, I'm not too curious.

332
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,851
It's just something you ask
when you bring friends over.

333
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,894
Friend, my foot. We weren't that close.

334
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,814
I never said we were.

335
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,524
I wasn't close to you one bit.

336
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,361
Unbelievable.

337
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,038
Let me explain.

338
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,542
I had absolutely no opportunity
to become close with her.

339
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,424
She only put aside ten minutes a day
to chat and never talked outside of that.

340
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,217
When we invited her to eat tteokbokki,

341
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,846
she lied about how she was allergic
and all she did was study.

342
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,514
Hey.

343
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,141
You knew I was lying?

344
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,810
Of course.
No one's allergic to tteokbokki!

345
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,771
You should've used
a more believable allergy.

346
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,815
Jeez, you're really unbelievable.

347
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,525
Why did you go to such lengths?

348
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,278
I would've wanted
to go to the arcade afterward.

349
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,654
Then, I'd want to go to karaoke.

350
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,824
I knew I wouldn't want to study,
so I stopped myself.

351
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,369
I held back on eating
or doing what I wanted back then.

352
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,213
You worked so hard.

353
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:14,221
You must've been so lonely
and exhausted while living so intensely.

354
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,556
Mom.

355
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,476
Why are you acting like this?
We have a guest.

356
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,769
You promised not to cry.

357
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,315
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

358
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,442
I've become so emotional with age.

359
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,446
No, I shouldn't have mentioned that.
I'm sorry.

360
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,824
-Hey, your soup's getting cold. Eat up.
-Okay.

361
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,284
-You too, Mom.
-All right.

362
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,998
-Thank you for the meal.
-Eat up.

363
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,916
Okay.

364
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,751
This tastes good.

365
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,086
Really?

366
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,712
Is there anything you want more of?

367
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,340
No, this is more than enough.

368
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,008
-Take the big ones.
-Yes, ma'am.

369
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,219
There you go.

370
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,346
It's so good.

371
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,098
-Eat up.
-Yes, ma'am.

372
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,683
Here's your blanket.

373
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,810
And you can lie on this.

374
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,104
And here's your pillow.

375
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,315
By the way, she seemed pretty sad.

376
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,152
Don't mind her.

377
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,197
She'll start encouraging me
to recover soon.

378
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,991
Get some rest.

379
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,285
Want to go get some ice cream?

380
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,624
I mean, I'm grateful to you
for helping me clean my house.

381
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,336
And to be honest,
we're both in frustrating situations.

382
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,838
We could get some air too.

383
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,592
It's okay. It's late at night.

384
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,635
Rest up.

385
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,810
Ha-neul, I brought some jujube tea,
which is good for depression.

386
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,938
-Ha-neul?
-What in the world? Goodness!

387
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,524
-Ha-neul.
-Let's go get some ice cream.

388
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,692
-What?
-Ha-neul?

389
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,569
-Ice cream.
-Where are you?

390
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,617
All done.

391
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,748
Ha-neul seemed pretty bored
now that she's unemployed.

392
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,543
She never knew how to have fun anyway.

393
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,466
I can't be there
to hang with her every day.

394
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,387
Maybe I should teach her
how to have fun by herself.

395
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,765
HOW TO HAVE FUN BY YOURSELF

396
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,145
What? "Folding Cranes with Blankets"?

397
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,608
Today, we'll be folding a crane…

398
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,736
I'm not grabbing it by the neck.

399
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,197
Please don't report me for animal abuse.

400
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,909
-This crane…
-Who is this idiot?

401
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,160
Who would watch this?

402
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,870

THE MICHELANGELO OF SURGERY

407
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,176
My mom, dad, Eun-jeong,
Nurse Do, and Ms. Han

408
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,220
were my only five subscribers.

409
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,389
But I just got one more.

410
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,393
Goodness.
You weren't subscribed to Dr. Bin?

411
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,271
Have a good night.

412
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,360
Then, you have your first subscriber
who isn't family or someone you know.

413
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,197
Let's beat Yeo Jeong-woo.

414
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,077
My first subscriber.

415
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,540
Who could it be?

416
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,168
"Lee Hong-ran."

417
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,004
Lee Hong-ran.

418
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,552
"Red flower"?

419
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,518
It feels like a movie scene.

420
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,439
The stars are beautiful,
and the moon is glowing.

421
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,150
It could be a movie poster.

422
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,362
See?

423
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,657
Don't you feel better
after getting some air with your friend?

424
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,453
We're not friends. Just former classmates.

425
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,706
What's the difference?

426
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,334
Friends are people you willingly befriend.

427
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,964
Classmates are people who are placed
administratively in the same school.

428
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,424
Gosh.

429
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,886
Thanks for drawing that distinct line,
my fellow classmate.

430
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,476
FORTRESS TRAIL MART

431
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,403
Why are you staring at it?

432
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,989
It's just that…

433
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:48,286
That ambulance is likely headed to the ER.
Then, they'll head to surgery.

434
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,332
My colleagues would then intubate
the patient, insert a line,

435
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,919
administer medication and blood,
and then save them.

436
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,713
Meanwhile, I'm unemployed.

437
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,091
Hey, you've only been jobless for a day.

438
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,971
While you're at it,
you might as well have some fun instead.

439
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,682
-Fun?
-Yeah.

440
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,185
Is that possible in my current state?

441
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,270
Come on.

442
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,065
You've probably never rested
since kindergarten.

443
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,858
Isn't there anything you've wanted to do?

444
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,616
I did want to spend all night
reading dissertations like a maniac.

445
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,368
Yeah, you do seem like one.

446
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,914
There are tons of fun things to do.
Why would you want to read dissertations?

447
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,667
What? I love reading them.

448
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,920
From SCI-level to minor ones,
I read everything I come across.

449
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,674
When I read them,
I become stress-free and happy.

450
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,801
There was this one I read--

451
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,930
This won't do. I'll have to teach you.
Let's eat tteokbokki and go to the arcade.

452
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,181
-And karaoke too.
-What?

453
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,560
You said you wanted to do
all of those things in high school

454
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,104
but held back
because you would've stopped studying.

455
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,730
But you're free now,

456
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,900
which means you can have
all the fun you want.

457
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,569
But still--

458
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,320
Let's go get tteokbokki first!

459
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,947
What? Hey.

460
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,240
That was in high school.

461
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,743
-I'm not hungry. I don't want to go!
-Let's go, my fellow classmate.

462
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,960
You sure you're not hungry?

463
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,257
See? Isn't spicy food
a great stress reliever?

464
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,926
Of course.
The brain perceives spiciness as pain.

465
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,096
So it releases endorphins
and oxytocin to relieve the pain.

466
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,932
So it temporarily makes us happy
and relieves stress--

467
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,227
Just eat. Eat fast.
We have to go to the arcade.

468
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:40,148
Can we please skip that?
We're too old for the arcade.

469
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,400
Ta-da!

470
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,486
What do you think?
It's better than expected, right?

471
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,117
Well, these sounds and flashing lights
seem to stimulate my orbitofrontal cortex.

472
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,953
It feels like my brain
is releasing dopamine as well.

473
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,663
See? Aren't you glad we came?

474
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:00,084
We have all the time in the world,
so from there to all the way over there,

475
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,462
let's try every single game. Got it?

476
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,425
CHANGE MACHINE
INSERT BILLS

477
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,484
Tetris. I want to play Tetris first.

478
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,361
Tetris? Let's go!

479
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,535
Watch closely.

480
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,455
Fill the empty spaces with these blocks.

481
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,708
Hold on.

482
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,586
Is this really your first time?
How are you so good?

483
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:50,093
You just need to predict the spaces.
You see, the blocks move through pixels.

484
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,095
What?

485
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,099
Damn it. This is irritating.
I was supposed to get a long one.

486
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,726
You wait for the long ones
and that's how you lose.

487
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,311
Pixels, my foot.

488
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,191
In a cavern, in a canyon

489
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:09,362
Excavating for a mine

490
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:13,449
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner

491
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,495
And his daughter Clementine

492
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:21,666
Oh, my darling

493
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,378
Oh, my darling, Clementine

494
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,966
Thou art lost and gone forever

495
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,636
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

496
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,637
CANCEL

497
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,889
Gosh, I'm sorry.

498
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,933
I pressed it by accident.

499
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,312
Honestly, I was this close
to leaving you behind.

500
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,981
What is this? A singing test?

501
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,318
I did practice this a thousand times
in high school for the singing test.

502
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,612
Yeah, I get it.

503
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,948
But you have to sing
K-pop songs at karaoke.

504
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,702
I actually don't know any.

505
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,373
People get nostalgic
about songs they listened to in the past.

506
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,210
But I never listened to any then,
so I had nothing to be nostalgic about.

507
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,840
So…

508
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,470
how about we try Pump It Up
or whatever it's called?

509
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,769
But why do you have to
look so sad when you say that?

510
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,875
That's it. Stay with the beat.

511
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,211
-Right foot.
-Right foot?

512
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,754
There you go. Back and forth.

513
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,352
I had fun thanks to you.

514
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,020
Me too.

515
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:53,109
The trial had been stressing me out,
but I got rid of it all today.

516
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,736
Let's go to the arcade again next time.

517
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,656
Have a K-pop song memorized.
That's your homework.

518
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,123
You didn't have to sigh.
Fine, you don't need to memorize one.

519
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,750
That's not why.

520
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,837
I feel pathetic for not knowing
a single K-pop song at this age.

521
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,673
Why is that pathetic? It's not a big deal.

522
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,508
It is.

523
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,136
I missed out on a ton of other things.

524
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,470
It's not normal.

525
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,852
-Why did I live such a foolish life?
-You just worked hard.

526
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,562
No, I was just an idiot.

527
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,105
You did your utmost best.

528
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,108
I did my best for no reason and failed.

529
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,196
-Since you've hit rock bottom…
-I should stay strong?

530
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,157
No, just stay down.

531
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,915
Let's take a break
while we're at rock bottom.

532
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,907
Ha-neul isn't as terrible as I thought.

533
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,743
In my case, I'm guilty for my actions.

534
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,787
But you're being falsely accused.

535
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,373
Well, you're pretty childish.

536
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,125
But you'd never do something bad
and brazenly lie about it.

537
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,461
She's a good judge of character.

538
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,048
She's become kind now too.

539
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,095
She has a cute side too.

540
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,272
Goodness.

541
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,481
Cute, my foot.

542
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,403
Has all the shock I've experienced lately
messed with my head?

543
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,031
Getting some sleep should help.

544
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,158
Yeah, I'm a bit sick.

545
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,454
Goodness. Jeez.

546
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,971
When the life
I had worked so hard for fell apart,

547
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,390
I was expecting
something grand to comfort me.

548
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,183
However…

549
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,893
We should say cheers first.

550
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,061
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

551
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,441
Tteokbokki.

552
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,817
No, you're doing well.

553
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,736
That's it.

554
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,404
The arcade.

555
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,949
Since you've hit rock bottom…

556
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,788
Let's take a break
while we're at rock bottom.

557
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,500
His ridiculous words of comfort.

558
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,172
These three things
will bring me peace tonight.

559
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,556
I hope tomorrow will be just like today.

560
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,739
What the hell?

561
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,199
What was that?

562
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,284
-Hey!
-What's wrong?

563
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,410
Look at this.

564
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,662
What is it?

565
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,457
-Damn it.
-What is this?

566
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,127
-Why is your severance pay so low?
-I wasn't a full-time employee.

567
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,338
My professor was renewing
my contract yearly.

568
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,174
So he secretly listed you
as a contract worker?

569
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,675
That's ridiculous.

570
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,594
That way, he could reduce
my severance pay.

571
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,014
I won't stand for this.

572
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,183
Hey, what are you going to do?

573
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,102
Are you going to make a scene again?

574
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,563
I get that you're angry,
but if people hear you acted out again,

575
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,566
you won't be able to work again.

576
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,360
You know word spreads fast in our world.

577
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,741
Hey, they fixed the window.

578
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,118
Okay, thanks.

579
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,332
Go. Good job toughing it out.

580
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,341
I'll see you later then.

581
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,427
Bye.

582
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,724
Damn it.

583
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,310
Come on.

584
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,447
The second hearing over the death
of a casino heiress from Macau…

585
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,364
I'll get going.

586
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,991
-Bye.
-Thank you for everything.

587
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,118
Anticoagulants found in the victim's body

588
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,537
and their use in surgery
will be crucial in the trial…

589
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,206
-That guy…
-A person who conducted surgery with Yeo…

590
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,624
He seems familiar.

591
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,835
…will testify as a witness.

592
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,714
We heard the casino makes up a third
of the finances for Macau's government.

593
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,091
Did her family say anything?

594
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,307
DAEHAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

595
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,600
Hey, over here.

596
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,768
Did you check?

597
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,646
You two were also listed
as contract workers, right?

598
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,856
Yes.

599
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,400
-Then, let's hurry and confront--
-Dr. Nam.

600
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,612
We're just going to act
like there's nothing we can do.

601
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:31,989
What?

602
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,158
It's okay for you since you already quit.

603
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:39,538
But we're afraid that if we complain,
we might provoke the professor.

604
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,874
And I'm sorry to say this,

605
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,835
but please refrain from coming here.

606
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,089
Professor Kim wouldn't be happy
if he knew we were meeting you.

607
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,387
Right.

608
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,389
Okay.

609
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,355
I wonder if she's okay.

610
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,111
Maybe I should've asked for her number.

611
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,367
Number, my foot.

612
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,995
I hope she's not causing a scene.

613
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,956
Who cares?

614
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,668
What's wrong with me?

615
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,170
Jeez.

616
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,762
Jeong-woo, you ingrate.

617
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,723
If they fixed your window,
you should thank them

618
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,476
and at least buy them some fruit
like a decent human being.

619
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,852
Don't just sit here!

620
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,857
And if I run into Ha-neul…

621
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,737
Then what?

622
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,158
I remember now!

623
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,662
Mom!

624
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,498
I said Mr. Rooftop looked familiar.

625
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,625
He's Yeo Jeong-woo, the plastic surgeon.

626
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,544
What? Is he famous?

627
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:12,464
You bet. He was already famous,
but he's even more famous now.

628
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,390
His patient died during plastic surgery,
so he's on trial right now.

629
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:26,562
But the victim was the sole heiress
of the biggest casino running Macau.

630
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,189
Simply put, he's totally ruined.

631
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,567
Mom.

632
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,612
Can someone like that stay here?

633
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,072
What? Is there a reason they can't?

634
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,240
Of course.

635
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:39,908
Look at this article.

636
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,121
Anticoagulants were found
in the patient's body,

637
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,081
and she died from excessive bleeding.

638
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,667
He insisted his clinic
never had such medication,

639
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,378
but they found a bottle
of it at his clinic.

640
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,921
He totally lied.

641
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:56,008
Goodness. Why would he lie about that?

642
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,053
It's obvious.
Probably because he's guilty.

643
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,265
Mom, what about Ha-neul?

644
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,227
She's a nerd so she's naive.
What if he brings her down?

645
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,815
Hold on. What if we're questioned later

646
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,526
for providing a suspect
with a place to hide?

647
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,779
Jeez, we should've looked into him more.

648
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,738
SWEET JEJU TANGERINES

649
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,311
You're rich for a jobless person
if you can buy fruit.

650
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,854
Trying to take your vitamins?

651
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,318
I actually saw my former colleagues today.

652
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,238
They want to sweep this under the rug.

653
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,073
I understand them.

654
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,326
I wanted to do the same until recently.

655
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,082
What? What's wrong?

656
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,501
Nothing.

657
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,090
What is it? Is something wrong?

658
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,261
You should go.

659
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,725
I'd forgotten about my circumstances
for a moment.

660
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,494
He had a blast
at the arcade and at karaoke.

661
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,912
So what's gotten into him?

662
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:50,873
Ha-neul.

663
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,750
-Where have you been?
-What? Just out.

664
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,545
I just heard from Ba-da.

665
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:00,132
-He said the rooftop fellow is on trial.
-What?

666
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,469
He said his patient died during surgery,

667
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:07,723
but he's denying it despite being guilty.

668
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,559
Anyway, Ba-da's concerned
you'll get dragged into that mess.

669
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,394
So you better stay away from him.

670
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,672
Did you overhear them by any chance?

671
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,343
They don't know what they're…

672
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,266
What should I say?

673
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,565
Hold on. I don't have his number.

674
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,339
Hello, sir.

675
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,591
I'm sorry to tell you this.

676
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,010
Dr. Kang Jin-seok
suddenly refused to testify.

677
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,680
What? Why all of a sudden?

678
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,307
We don't know. We're confused too.

679
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,811
Suddenly refusing to show up like this
will only worsen public opinion.

680
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,939
And you'll be at a disadvantage
at trial. What is going on?

681
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,232
Let me try calling him.

682
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,895
TWO FACE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

683
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,496
I'm here to see Dr. Kang.

684
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,540
He resigned as of today.

685
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,626
What?

686
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,379
But he only started here
less than a month ago.

687
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,590
I don't know. I think he's emigrating.

688
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,258
Hold on. Let me check.

689
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,435
I think this bastard agreed
to testify just to screw me over.

690
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,982
I did find it odd he wanted to testify
suddenly after refusing to be questioned.

691
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,613
Can't we request a formal investigation?

692
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,033
I know he seems suspicious.

693
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,576
But refusing to be questioned

694
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,287
and not testifying in court
aren't enough to request one.

695
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:21,041
I think we should focus
on the upcoming trial for now.

696
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:32,344
For the second hearing over the death
of a casino heiress from Macau,

697
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,180
a fellow colleague of Yeo
who was going to testify as a witness

698
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,391
has suddenly backed out.

699
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,102
The CCTV camera in the OR malfunctioned…

700
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,521
I received only half
of my original severance pay.

701
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,273
But I wasn't upset anymore.

702
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,736
Getting a little less
of severance pay wasn't a big deal.

703
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,630
Things will work out.
It wasn't your fault.

704
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,613
Today, we'll discuss
the impending trial over the death

705
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,282
of a casino heiress from Macau.

706
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,325
The autopsy report showed

707
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,078
traces of anticoagulants
in the patient's body were found.

708
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,915
Could you explain what kind
of medication anticoagulants exactly are?

709
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,460
Simply put, they prevent
blood from clotting.

710
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,879
Since it could lead to excessive bleeding,

711
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,797
its use prior to surgery is forbidden.

712
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,258
They tell you not to take
aspirin prior to surgery.

713
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,218
Aspirin is a type of anticoagulant.

714
00:50:55,302 --> 00:51:01,475
Then, how did this forbidden substance
end up in the victim's body?

715
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,560
Well, the police's investigation showed

716
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,605
the victim had suffered from arrhythmia.

717
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,815
It's normal for such patients

718
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,402
to have long-term use
of the anticoagulant, warfarin.

719
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,990
That's why the defendant also claims
that this was the cause of death.

720
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:20,285
But even if there was
long-term use of warfarin,

721
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,579
it wouldn't cause such excessive bleeding…

722
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,956
-What?
-…to lead to death.

723
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,041
That's not right.

724
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,711
That's…

725
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,267
Plastic surgeon Yeo's second hearing

726
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,187
for the death
of a casino heiress from Macau

727
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,190
will take place here
at Seoul Central District Court.

728
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,527
Today, the main focus
is whether or not Yeo

729
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,695
will be charged
with occupational negligence.

730
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,990
The prosecution is confident
they'll be able to prove Yeo was at fault…

731
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,455
I found it!

732
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,625
I found it.

733
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,004
What are you talking about? Found what?

734
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,466
There was a case in India
where a patient on warfarin

735
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,094
died from excessive bleeding
during surgery.

736
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,014
I remember reading
about this in a case report.

737
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,433
Case… What did she say?

738
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,395
Beats me. I could only make out "India."

739
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:32,107
I found a case where the patient died
in the same way Jeong-woo's patient did.

740
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:39,155
We will now begin the trial
of criminal case number 2023-54958

741
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,325
for the defendant, Yeo Jeong-woo.

742
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:49,583
The defendant, Yeo, is a plastic surgeon
at the clinic he runs,

743
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,711
and while performing contouring surgery
on his patient, Chang Bing,

744
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,714
he caused her to die
from excessive bleeding.

745
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,180
Your Honor, as you already know,

746
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,309
our witness suddenly refused
to testify in court today.

747
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,644
I'm afraid questioning
won't be possible today.

748
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,105
Could we request the court to summon him?

749
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:18,737
Your Honor, it is explicitly clear
the witness refuses to testify in court.

750
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,822
Despite having to incur fines

751
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,742
and penalties for refusing
to appear in court,

752
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,827
this shows he had a reason for not coming.

753
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,745
For example,

754
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,791
if he tried to testify today
and cover up the defendant's crimes,

755
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,294
perhaps he was afraid
of being punished for perjury.

756
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,130
Your Honor, the prosecution
is making wild speculations.

757
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:40,592
The witness has simply refused
to appear in court today.

758
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,178
He never blatantly stated
a refusal to testify.

759
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,306
Gentlemen, since the witness
isn't here today,

760
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:50,226
we have no choice
but to resume the trial on a later date.

761
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,105
Both sides may make
your necessary requests before then.

762
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,441
Excuse me. I brought some evidence.

763
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,903
This patient also died
despite having an INR of 2 to 3.

764
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,796
We'd like to submit this evidence.

765
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,429
I won't accept this evidence today.

766
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:30,558
The defendant can follow
proper procedures before the next trial

767
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,227
and submit the evidence again.

768
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,604
Today's hearing will end here.

769
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,239
Reality was different from the movies.

770
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,494
We wanted to turn the tide
of the trial with crucial evidence,

771
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,081
but that was nothing but a pipe dream.

772
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,422
There's Yeo Jeong-woo!

773
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,506
-It's him!
-Mr. Yeo.

774
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,426
COURT

775
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,304
Anything you want to say
to the victim's family?

776
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,559
Mr. Yeo, is the dissertation
you tried to submit as evidence credible?

777
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,563
You put yourself at a disadvantage
by failing to summon your witness.

778
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,566
Did he have second thoughts?
Please say something.

779
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,070
Anything to say about the CCTV cameras?

780
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,236
Please say something.

781
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,073
Ha-neul!

782
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,200
How do you feel right now?

783
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,287
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

784
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,838
Let's go.

785
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:25,882
Mr. Yeo!

786
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,519
Why did you come here?

787
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,937
To help you, of course.

788
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,190
I told you I liked reading
minor dissertations too.

789
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:45,902
I looked up your case and remembered
reading about a similar one.

790
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,321
That's why I hurried over with it.

791
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,906
But I wish I found it quicker.

792
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,783
Gosh.

793
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,410
Hey.

794
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,579
What happened?

795
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,165
I think it was when I fell.

796
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,545
I'm okay. I can buy some bandages later.

797
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,296
This cut's too deep for that.

798
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,844
Want to go to my clinic?

799
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,568
THE CLINIC IS CLOSED

800
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,111
Security system disabled.

801
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,288
SEOUL WESTERN DISTRICT COURT

802
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,468
Where was my office again?

803
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,637
Was it over there? I think it was.

804
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,099
Follow me.

805
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,152
All right.

806
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,261
Are you okay?

807
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,597
It stings, but I'm all right.

808
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,724
Not this.

809
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,560
Your severance pay.

810
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,231
You were upset.

811
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,692
Oh, that?

812
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,031
Well, I'm over that too.

813
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,505
Thanks.

814
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,635
I know it wasn't easy to come today.

815
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,891
I just wanted to repay you
for consoling me.

816
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,936
I hate being indebted to others.

817
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,356
What?

818
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,526
So what do you want to do?

819
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,278
I got my severance pay,

820
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,531
so on top of this treatment,
it's my treat. Just say the word.

821
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:40,076
Arcades? Tteokbokki? Or beef?

822
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,289
Or should we drink a bunch
of alcohol and cry like last time?

823
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,126
Let's have all the fun we can tonight.

824
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,252
Until sunrise.

825
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,797
Then, how about we go see the sunrise?

826
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,216
What?

827
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,176
I mean,

828
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,138
we're going to stay up until then.

829
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,849
So let's go see the sunrise.

830
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,770
I saw the sun rise a lot
while pulling all-nighters.

831
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,314
That's not the same.

832
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,734
Let's go to the East Sea. What do you say?

833
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,196
All right, then.

834
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,858
How strange. Why isn't the sun rising?

835
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,611
It clearly says it would rise at 6:45 a.m.

836
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:57,528
Let me see.

837
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,034
This is the sunrise time for Seoul.

838
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,203
You should've searched for Sokcho.

839
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,704
Right.

840
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,498
Look. You click this.

841
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,125
No way.

842
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,003
There's an 80% chance of rain.

843
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,424
It was too cloudy to see the sunrise.

844
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,718
I've never been on a trip,

845
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,262
so I didn't know you had to
search the current location.

846
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,598
I'm sorry.

847
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,767
It's okay.

848
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,645
We're still making memories. Right?

849
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,987
Having no sunrise reminds me of our lives.

850
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,866
Jeez, you're right.

851
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,290
Give me your number.

852
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,378
Mine? What for?

853
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,630
Let's hang out sometimes.

854
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,007
Let's…

855
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:05,096
be friends, not classmates.

856
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,727
And not the kind who are placed
administratively together.

857
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,522
Let's willingly befriend each other

858
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,108
and become friends.

859
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:20,820
Ha-neul.

860
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,489
Let's be friends.

861
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,705
You're smiling.

862
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,125
Sure, if you want.

863
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,210
You seem to be enduring it.

864
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,923
But I know you're actually struggling.

865
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,844
But during these hard times,

866
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,807
if you had someone who could comfort you…

867
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,145
would it help you get a little better?

868
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,152
DR. YEO JEONG-WOO

869
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,271
The sun didn't rise today.

870
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,441
But it will tomorrow.

871
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,372
Despite not knowing our futures…

872
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:02,380
we still waited for the sun to rise.

873
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,147
EPILOGUE

874
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,946
Jeong-woo, let's not exhaust ourselves.

875
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,906
I'll stay strong.

876
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,618
You should stay strong too.
Everything will be okay.

877
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,080
Sir.

878
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,875
I heard he's just anemic.

879
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,960
Fainting while studying isn't uncommon.

880
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,129
And you made me come here for this?

881
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,130
But still--

882
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,216
Not only are his grades falling
but he also ended up like that.

883
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,177
How could he not come
in first even in high school?

884
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,262
How embarrassing.

885
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,390
Goodness. Ms. Kim.

886
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,063
-Goodness, Ha-neul!
-Mom.

887
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,774
Are you okay? What happened?

888
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,526
I was just dizzy. I'm okay.

889
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,654
Let's go to a hospital.
Get a checkup and an IV drip.

890
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,615
I'm okay. Let's just go home.

891
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,325
Shouldn't you lie down longer?

892
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,242
I'm okay.

893
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,785
-Should we take a taxi?
-It's fine.

894
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,705
Goodness, I was so startled.

895
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,207
Let's go.

896
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,834
I said I'm fine.

897
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,794
Gosh, don't scare me like that again.

898
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,233
DOCTOR SLUMP

899
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,985
What are you writing on the sand?

900
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,112
-Stop it.
-These will be memories too.

901
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,283
Is this your first love
who moved into the rooftop room?

902
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,702
-What?
-No, I just…

903
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,287
What? Why are you being shy?

904
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,623
What do you think? Does it look nice?

905
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,334
Am I really Ha-neul's first love?

906
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,877
Gosh, how blinding. What's that?

907
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,337
Wait, it's just me.

908
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,422
You see, I…

909
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,885
She's a habitual offender.

910
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,179
Hey, Jeong-woo.

911
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,598
I have something to tell you.

912
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,850
I came here to tell you this.

913
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:27,566
