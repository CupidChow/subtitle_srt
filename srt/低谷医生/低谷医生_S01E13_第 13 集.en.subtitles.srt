DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,724
All of our previous tutors
were from Hanguk National University,

3
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,894
so I began to have serious second thoughts

4
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,021
about hiring you.

5
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,775
-I see.
-But Professor Jang recommended you.

6
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,903
He said all your former students
got into HNU's med school.

7
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,114
It still wasn't an easy decision,
so please do your best.

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,824
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,286
You know the credentials
my husband and I have, don't you?

10
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,455
Yes, I'm aware.

11
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,625
Getting into HNU's med school is expected…

12
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,419
No, it's the least
one can do in our family.

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,088
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,758
Jeong-woo will be here soon,
so wait for him inside.

15
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,967
His room is that way.

16
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,679
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,767
Right, here.

18
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,897
I doubled your original pay.

19
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,691
That's okay.
You can pay me the regular fee.

20
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,610
Then, you won't try as hard.

21
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,614
I heard your family
has it tough, so just take it.

22
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,909
And prove your worth.

CSAT WORKBOOK FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS

HONOR ROLL AWARD
EXCELLENCE AWARD

25
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,562
I pitied the kid before I even met him.

26
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,899
I thought he'd be miserable in this house.

27
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,906
Hello, sir. Did you wait a long time?

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,159
I had to stay behind and clean. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,745
-It's nice to meet you. I'm Min Kyung-min.
-Hello.

30
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,165
I'm the top-ranked student
at Yeongwon High School.

31
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,458
I'm Yeo Jeong-woo, and I ace all my tests.

32
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,585
I hope we get along.

33
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,880
Right. Likewise.

34
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,964
Mr. Min.

35
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,425
Please help me become the god of calculus.

36
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,385
-It's too hard.
-Sure.

37
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,596
-Should we start?
-Let's do it!

38
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,348
-Right. Let's do it.
-Let's do it!

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,391
Let's go!

40
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,352
Okay. Let's do this.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,316
So 1K minus BK is--

42
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,525
Hold on.

43
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,193
We need to solve this first.

44
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,236
-Right.
-Yeah.

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,489
What you're doing
will complicate it and make it harder.

46
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,909
-I see.
-Dividing them up is much simpler. Try it.

47
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,035
-Then…
-Okay.

48
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,703
-Sigma…
-Yes.

49
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,914
-K is from one to five.
-That's it.

50
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,790
Why are they so stiff?

51
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,334
-Goodness.
-They're so stiff.

52
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,752
-That's much better.
-Here?

53
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,003
-I can see now.
-Really?

54
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,840
Sigma K is AK's minimum
and maximum from one to ten.

55
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,677
Now, look at these two conditions
and find the suitable sequences.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,809
Yeo Jeong-woo!

57
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,103
I wasn't sleeping. I was just thinking.

58
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,027
You really startled me.
I thought I had dozed off at school.

59
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,278
We're almost done.

60
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,072
You can sleep once you solve this.

61
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,616
-Where were we again?
-Where were we?

62
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,037
Should I start all over again?
Jeez. Come here.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,413
-For this question…
-Yes?

64
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,212
Kyung-min!

65
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,838
Jeong-woo.

66
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,259
Isn't our session at 8:00 p.m.?
You're early.

67
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,011
I wanted to drop by a bookstore,
but it was closed.

68
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,556
That's great.
Buy me some ramyeon. I'm hungry.

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,934
I can't believe
you've never treated me to a meal.

70
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,145
I've wanted to, but I never could.
I was afraid of your mother.

71
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,689
-She'd think we were slacking.
-Jeez.

72
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,609
Let's go. I'll buy you some ramyeon.
And some cheese kimbap too.

73
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,361
-Seriously?
-Yeah. Let's go.

74
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,571
I eat a lot since I'm still growing.
Is that okay?

75
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,948
Gosh, this looks good.

76
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,117
-Thanks for the meal.
-Eat up.

77
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,204
-The kimbap is here.
-Thank you, ma'am.

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,706
Thank you.

79
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,334
Dipping kimbap in the soup is the best.

80
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,259
Right. Never call me
Kyung-min in front of your mother.

81
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,261
-She warned me.
-I know.

82
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,973
"Being friends will make you chat,
and it'll hinder your studies."

83
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,642
"Don't make me fire him
because he grew on you."

84
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,311
"Consider him a stranger."

85
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,439
That's what my mother told me as well.

86
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,275
Are you okay?

87
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,986
-Yes.
-I didn't even say about what.

88
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,780
Whatever it is, I'm okay.

89
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,740
Jeez.

90
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,285
I don't know
if I should pity you or feel proud.

91
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,205
-I feel resentful sometimes.
-Of what?

92
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,082
Of my situation.

93
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,292
My parents.

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,254
My thoughts.
I'm sometimes put off by them.

95
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,093
But seeing you makes me realize
that I need to work on myself.

96
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,775
Why did Haesung's vice president
attend Jeong-woo's hearing?

97
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,985
I ran into him at court that day.

98
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,820
You must've seen the wrong person.

99
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,323
We'll soon find out if that's true or not.

100
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,409
There will be tons
of CCTV and dashcam footage.

101
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,997
Haesung has something to do
with that medical accident, right?

102
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,418
Are you…

103
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,173
involved in Jeong-woo's medical accident?

104
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,093
You…

105
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,512
What did Jeong-woo ever do to you?

106
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:57,125
He didn't do anything to me at all.

107
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,586
Would it be an excuse if I said…

108
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,799
that tormented me more?

109
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,222
DOCTOR SLUMP

110
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,351
Why aren't you making any dumplings?

111
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,937
The wrappers are stuck together.

112
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,983
-Then, use another one.
-Hold on.

113
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,235
I did it.

114
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,489
Jeong-woo?
What brings you here at this hour?

115
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,533
-Come on in.
-Hello.

116
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,617
-Hey.
-The lights were on.

117
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,244
So I came to see if you were here.

118
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,163
-You're making dumplings.
-Yeah.

119
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,748
-Gosh, what a surprise.
-By any chance…

120
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,669
Ha-neul hasn't come home yet, has she?

121
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,921
No, not yet.

122
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,839
Give her a call.

123
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,466
I did, but she didn't pick up.

124
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,593
I see. Here.

125
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,511
Yes, ma'am.

126
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,475
EMERGENCY ROOM

127
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,689
EMERGENCY 911

128
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,695
How are they?

129
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,199
Nam Ha-neul, 33-year-old female.
She was barely conscious when we arrived.

130
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,702
Blood pressure is 80 over 40.
Pulse is 120 and respiration is at 35.

131
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,829
She has hypotension
and she's hyperventilating.

132
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,122
Let's start with FAST.

133
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,290
-This way.
-Okay.

134
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,878
What do you mean?

135
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,506
Are you telling me

136
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,052
Ha-neul was in a car accident
and is unconscious?

137
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,849
Yes, we suspect
severe bleeding in her chest

138
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,809
that requires immediate surgery.

139
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,479
We'll begin surgery
once we have your consent.

140
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,357
What is he talking about?

141
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,817
Any other signs besides than hemothorax?

142
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,278
Only the surgery
will tell us more details,

143
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,614
but the heart could've been ruptured too.

144
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,825
Her heart could've been ruptured?
Isn't that dangerous?

145
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,206
Yes, in such cases,
it could be fatal to the patient.

146
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,250
Ms. Kong, you need to consent to surgery.

147
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,669
We should hurry over
and see what's going on.

148
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,711
Okay.

149
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,672
-Okay.
-Please.

150
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,132
Perform the surgery!

151
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,635
Please save my daughter!

152
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,857
She has multiple rib fractures
from a traffic accident.

153
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,860
The sonogram shows signs
of hemothorax and lung injury.

154
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,989
Cardiac injury was difficult to assess
based on the ultrasound,

155
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,448
so we need to open her up.

156
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm maintaining her BP at 90 over 60
with the IV drip and blood transfusion.

157
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,370
May I begin?

158
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,746
Yes, you may.

159
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,415
Scalpel.

160
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,301
PATIENT NAME
NAM HA-NEUL

161
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,936
It's been a while,
but I'm sorry we had to meet like this.

162
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,314
So what exactly happened?

163
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,945
I asked around.

164
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,572
To put it simply,

165
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,824
she hurt her chest badly in the accident.

166
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,868
She broke her ribs,

167
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,203
and the bones have pierced her lungs.

168
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,541
It's dangerous if we don't stop
the bleeding in her lungs,

169
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,543
so she needed immediate surgery.

170
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,589
If her lungs aren't too damaged,
they'll just remove a part of them

171
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,007
and mend her broken ribs.

172
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,553
I know her ribs will heal, but will she
be okay with parts of her lungs removed?

173
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,764
It's okay to remove parts of them.

174
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,684
The lungs are divided into many sections,
and they'll soon grow back in size.

175
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,646
It won't affect her
when exercising or in everyday life.

176
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,315
She won't need to take
medication her entire life either.

177
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,694
Mom, where's Ha-neul?

178
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,946
-Is she in surgery?
-Yes.

179
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,823
I'm sure Ha-neul will pull through,

180
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,451
but we need to stay strong
to be by her side.

181
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,080
I used to train at this hospital.
They have great cardiac surgeons,

182
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,375
so let's trust them and be patient.

183
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,504
Sit down, Ba-da.

184
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,176
You must've been startled.

185
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,469
It's okay.

186
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,653
Scissors.

187
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,312
How did it go?

188
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,275
It took longer than we expected.
But luckily, there was no heart rupture.

189
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,570
Her broken ribs pierced her pleurae
and punctured her lungs.

190
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,405
But we removed that section.

191
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,658
How are her vital signs?

192
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,827
Was there coagulation in her heart cavity?

193
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,663
Could there be complications
such as pyothorax or fibrothorax?

194
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,416
Thankfully, there was
barely any coagulation.

195
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,627
We drained it out, so you won't need to
worry about complications.

196
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,796
She's still unconscious,

197
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,257
but she has no additional injuries.

198
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,719
As long as she recovers
from her concussion, she'll be all right.

199
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,387
Thank you.

200
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,055
Thank you for your work.

201
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,140
Goodness.

202
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,644
-The surgery went well.
-Right.

203
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,271
-So don't worry.
-Okay.

204
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,712
What? The morning visitation hours
are already over.

205
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,507
How can we wait until evening?

206
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,426
She's all alone in that room.

207
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,805
She must've been frightened
and in pain all night.

208
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,226
It's not too bad though,

209
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,437
and she'll be okay
as long as she recovers, so don't worry.

210
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,901
There's still a lot of time
before the next visitation hours.

211
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,446
How about one person stays
and the rest goes home?

212
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,114
I think we should take shifts.

213
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,951
Then, I'll stay.

214
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,161
She might want to see me
when she wakes up.

215
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,371
I'm staying too.

216
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,456
She might ask for me.

217
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,583
She actually could ask for me.

218
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,631
Then, it'll be better
for the elders to stay,

219
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,591
so you two can remain here.

220
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,968
Ba-da and I will go home

221
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,054
and pack some things
she might need for the general ward.

222
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,138
You're leaving too?

223
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,724
I have surgery at 9:00 a.m.

224
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,768
Right, you have to work. Go on then.

225
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,272
Don't worry.
We'll call you if anything happens.

226
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,690
Okay.

227
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,317
Please take good care of her.

228
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,446
Go. Go do your job.

229
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,573
Okay.

230
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,075
You too.

231
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,968
Jeong-woo, I brought some towels.

232
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,886
Thanks.

233
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,894
Hey, you know what?

234
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,521
I think I've been the worst brother.

235
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,986
She must've felt more pressure
since I was a good-for-nothing.

236
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,448
She had to work even harder
to be a good child and do my share.

237
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,493
But all I did was ask her for money.
I never listened to her.

238
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,958
I think I was five.

239
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,467
PERFECT SCORE STUDIES

240
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,357
The very first word I learned
in school was "sweet potatoes."

241
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,901
But it turned out

242
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,903
the question was asking

243
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,905
who had created the Korean alphabet.

244
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,378
She was scolded so much that day.

245
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,131
She cried and said
she hadn't written that.

246
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,258
But our dad thought
I didn't know how to write,

247
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,302
so he scolded her even more for lying.

248
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,430
I was too scared to tell the truth.

249
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,935
When I thought about
what I had done wrong to her yesterday,

250
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,645
I remembered that day.

251
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,774
I'm afraid she might be gone
before I can ask her to forgive me.

252
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,694
Hey, she's not going anywhere.

253
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,404
Jeong-woo.

254
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,866
You know what? I'm going to
work hard in life once she recovers.

255
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,744
I'm not religious, but I prayed all night.

256
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,497
I promised to work, donate,
and live a righteous life

257
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,249
as long as she pulled through.

258
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,418
All right.

259
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,129
She'll recover, so don't worry.

260
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,259
You should get some sleep.

261
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,512
Take a taxi back.

262
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,264
I'm okay.

263
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,142
It's unlike you to say no to 50,000 won.

264
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,020
Take it.

265
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:05,024
Take a taxi and eat something good.

266
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,150
Right.

267
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,030
Buy some porridge on your way there,
so your mother and uncle can eat too.

268
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,284
Let me know once she wakes up.

269
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,076
Ha-neul, your mom is here.

270
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,120
Uncle Tae-seon and Ba-da are here too.

271
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,498
Ha-neul.

272
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,583
Open your eyes.

273
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,960
Ha-neul.

274
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,380
Goodness, my poor baby.

275
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,179
No, it's okay. I'm okay.

276
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,430
Ha-neul.

277
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,766
Let's wake up after your nap.

278
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,312
-Hey, Jeong-woo.
-Hey.

279
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,362
Will she be okay?

280
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,657
Of course.

281
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,370
The surgery went well.
Let's put our trust in her and wait.

282
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,413
Okay.

283
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,293
Ha-neul, Jeong-woo is here.

284
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,382
You said it was just a concussion.

285
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,925
Why is she still unconscious?

286
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,344
The CT scan showed
no bleeding in her brain.

287
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,682
Often, there are cases when the patient
has a brain hemorrhage later on.

288
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,893
They'll monitor her a bit more
and then do another CT scan.

289
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,938
Let's be patient.

290
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,659
The incision has healed well,
and there's barely a scar.

291
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,035
You don't need to worry.

292
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,454
-Thanks for toughing it out.
-Not at all.

293
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,874
You're the one who did all the hard work.

294
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,251
Let's grab a meal with Ha-neul sometime.

295
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,088
I'll treat you to something
more delicious than tteokbokki.

296
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,302
By the way, I heard she's not here today.

297
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,261
Is she sick?

298
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,346
Well…

299
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,099
I'm not sure.

300
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,518
Come on. You're her friend,
so you should know.

301
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,438
Seeing how you're working together,

302
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,524
it seems you don't despise each other
like you used to.

303
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,276
I hope you two get along.

304
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,946
Hey, do you know what I found yesterday?

305
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,615
Here. Take a look.

306
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,265
It was the day you both fainted
and went to the nurse's office.

307
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,850
I picked it up in the hallway.

308
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,645
Goodness.

309
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,148
What's this?

310
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,235
She must've written it for you

311
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,861
but never got to give it.

312
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,823
She must've hesitated
about giving it to you and kept it.

313
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,201
And I had it with me all along.

314
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,790
Jeong-woo, let's not exhaust ourselves.

315
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,959
I'll stay strong.

316
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,418
You should stay strong too.

317
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,588
Everything will be okay. From Ha-neul.

318
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,474
Looking back,

319
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,311
we were always together
during those hard times.

320
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,113
Darn it!

321
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,157
We always ran together.

322
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,075
Wait--

323
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,204
Sir, Ha-neul fainted!

324
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,002
Jeong-woo fainted too!

325
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,587
We were in pain together.

326
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,510
Even when we needed comfort…

327
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,971
-Unbelievable.
-We were together.

328
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,684
It felt like the words
you wrote in the past…

329
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,606
were trying to comfort me
in the present as well.

330
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,860
I couldn't stop crying.

331
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,014
PATIENT NAME
NAM HA-NEUL

332
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,939
I don't know exactly

333
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,735
what it means to love someone.

334
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,528
But nevertheless…

335
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,204
I knew for certain that this was love.

336
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,667
She was more than just a friend
or a romantic partner.

337
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,171
It was just love.

338
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,846
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,265
You must've been so worried.

340
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,576
I love you, Ha-neul.

341
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,186
DAEHAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

342
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,064
Gosh, you went through so much.

343
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,983
Thank you for waking up.

344
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,027
But it breaks my heart to know

345
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,780
that they removed a fourth of your lungs.

346
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,868
I'm okay. It isn't that serious.

347
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,828
It won't affect my daily life either.

348
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,622
Is that so? Does that mean
you can still drink and run?

349
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,791
Yes, it won't be a problem.

350
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,796
I heard you didn't get any sleep.
You must be tired. Go home and rest.

351
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,341
We're not going anywhere.
We need to take care of you.

352
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,719
One person will be enough.

353
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,929
It'll make me uncomfortable
if you're all here.

354
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,850
Then, I'll stay. You guys can go.

355
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,603
Forget it. I have more stamina than you.

356
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,980
You're in your fifties,
and you're in your forties.

357
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,398
I have the best stamina here.

358
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,651
-Rock, paper, scissors then.
-Forget it. Let's not be childish.

359
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,736
Shoot!

360
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,738
Jeong-woo, you too?

361
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,366
It felt awkward to not participate.

362
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,367
Rock, paper, scissors.

363
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,829
Gosh, I guess I won. Oh, no.

364
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,414
You cheated!

365
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,958
No, I didn't. I'm not dirty like that.

366
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,378
But since we're on the topic,
I say I have better stamina than you.

367
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,840
You're young, but you don't work out.
I jog every morning, ride horses,

368
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,300
and scuba dive. I do everything.

369
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,719
What does nursing
have to do with scuba diving?

370
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,933
I know exactly how to react
during an emergency.

371
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,644
In fact, I was trained at this hospital.

372
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,020
It's practically my turf.

373
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,065
So let me take care of her
while you guys rest up. Okay?

374
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,276
You need good sleep
if you want to take over tomorrow morning.

375
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,988
You also need to eat well
to have good stamina.

376
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,491
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.

377
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,244
Just focus on resting up. Goodbye.

378
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,252
Were you disappointed to see me cheat?

379
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,545
I had no choice.
I had to stay by your side.

380
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,635
You should sleep more.
You must be exhausted.

381
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,930
No, I've slept enough. I want to be awake.

382
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:00,976
Then, should we get some fresh air?
There's an outdoor garden I used to go to.

383
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,144
Okay.

384
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,606
What just happened?
I was in the room just a moment ago.

385
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,607
I know.

386
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,485
He'd be a great salesman.

387
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,861
I feel bewitched.

388
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,405
Isn't he ridiculous?

389
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,449
He was so mature
when Ha-neul was unconscious.

390
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,910
But now that she's awake,
he's become childish again.

391
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,829
How could he cheat
at rock, paper, scissors?

392
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,707
He must've really wanted
to stay by her side.

393
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,418
Imagine how worried he must've been.

394
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:30,338
He had to take care of us
and look into what was going on.

395
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,798
He worked so hard.

396
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,718
Right, and he probably knows best
since he's a doctor.

397
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,345
It's better that he stays. Let's go home.

398
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,394
Ta-da!

399
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,771
It's steaming hot.

400
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,441
Isn't it warm?

401
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,276
I asked the head nurse for a favor,

402
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,236
and she got this
from the director's office.

403
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,613
Don't they give these out
if we just ask for one?

404
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,698
Jeez.

405
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,617
She gave me the warmest one.

406
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,910
Because it was me.

407
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,580
If it wasn't for me,
you'd have a lukewarm--

408
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,290
No, a cooling sheet.

409
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,253
And this wheelchair. I brought it
since it seemed like a new design.

410
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,048
I think they recently
replaced them. It's new.

411
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,883
-Really?
-Yeah.

412
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,388
My family must've been so shocked.
Thank you for comforting them.

413
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,809
I'm more thankful to you
for pulling through that tough surgery.

414
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,605
Right.

415
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,191
The detective working
your accident stopped by yesterday.

416
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,443
He suspects it was
sudden unintended acceleration.

417
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,736
As for the other passenger…

418
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,784
He's recovering in the ICU.

419
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,745
He'll stop by again to explain more.

420
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,997
Okay.

421
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,379
I know you have many questions right now.

422
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,385
But can I explain after clearing my head?

423
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,178
-I'm not ready yet.
-Sure.

424
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,516
Recovering should be
your top priority right now.

425
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,649
A thought crossed my mind yesterday.

426
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,276
I had never known

427
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,779
what love really was.

428
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,198
But I thought

429
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,660
it could be something similar to praying.

430
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,124
I always pray that you'll be happy

431
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,167
and successful.

432
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,336
Last night,

433
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,173
I desperately prayed you'd wake up soon.

434
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,761
And…

435
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,058
I love you with all my heart, Ha-neul.

436
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,324
Ha-neul!

437
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,827
Gosh, are these footrests all right?

438
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,121
Hey, are you okay?

439
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,457
What is all this?

440
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,001
Hello. Why are you here, Dae-yeong?

441
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,587
Why do we keep gathering?
Are we the Power Rangers?

442
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,130
Of course, I should be here.

443
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,506
She's our colleague.

444
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,509
Ha-neul, how are you feeling?

445
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,802
I'm okay.

446
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,847
I'm sorry that I had to
suddenly be away from work.

447
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,849
Goodness, please don't say that.

448
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,269
I was worried sick
after hearing about what happened.

449
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,730
-I almost cried.
-Jeez.

450
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:38,276
But of course, not as much as Jeong-woo,
who loves you with all his heart.

451
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,112
You heard that?

452
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,781
Yes, I did.

453
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,867
You prayed that she would be happy

454
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,827
and wake up soon.

455
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,162
All right, that's enough.

456
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,998
-Love is something similar to praying--
-Stop it.

457
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,919
Are you studying literature these days?
You're suddenly a poet.

458
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,463
-Can you come with me?
-Me?

459
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,506
-Yeah.
-Why?

460
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,007
I think you can leave now.

461
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,842
Already? It hasn't even been a minute.

462
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,011
That's enough. It's more than enough.

463
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,262
Hey.

464
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,180
Come here.

465
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,474
-Come on, I want to stay.
-There they go again.

466
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,143
-People shouldn't change so abruptly.
-Jeez.

467
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,189
-You must've been so startled. I'm sorry.
-Yeah, I was worried about you.

468
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,987
They must still be talking.

469
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,489
I guess so.

470
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,368
There must be a lot to discuss.
Should I tell Hong-ran to stay?

471
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,829
What are you talking about?
You should leave soon.

472
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,665
Why? Do you want
some alone time with Ha-neul?

473
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,959
No, she needs to rest.

474
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,754
Anyways, you did a great job.

475
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,216
By the way,
was Ha-neul driving by herself?

476
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,886
I think she was with someone,
but I don't know the details.

477
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,389
Why not? Didn't you talk to her?

478
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,641
She needs to recover first.

479
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,809
Then, we can talk.

480
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,245
To be honest, I had so many questions.

481
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,548
MIN KYUNG-MIN

482
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,386
CARDIAC SURGERY
MALE, IN SURGERY

483
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,893
NAM HA-NEUL

484
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,315
Why was she with him?

485
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,692
Had she been in danger?

486
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,069
I was worried.

487
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,908
But most of all, it broke my heart
to think of how scared she must've been.

488
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,335
Let's hurry. Ha-neul must be waiting.

489
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,462
Jeong-woo must be so tired too.

490
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,297
Goodness.

491
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,884
Why are you sighing?
Her surgery went well. Everything's fine.

492
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,930
It's just that she's been through
so much this year.

493
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,724
I just feel uneasy. That's all.

494
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,226
But good things happened to her too.

495
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,394
She met Jeong-woo.

496
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,564
I now see him in a different light.

497
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,318
He seemed so reliable
when he took care of us all.

498
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,070
I thought he'd get mad at her.

499
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:27,987
Why?

500
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,532
She was with some other guy
during the accident.

501
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,159
"Some other guy"?

502
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,869
Don't say it like that.

503
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,454
He was just her senior colleague.

504
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,290
Exactly. Senior colleague. A guy friend.

505
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,541
Guys hate people like that.

506
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,545
Plus, the accident happened at night.
You think he'd be happy?

507
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,299
You think he stayed behind
to put the screws to her?

508
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,219
Don't be absurd. He wouldn't do that
to someone who's hurt.

509
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,596
She's lost a gall bladder
and a fourth of her lungs.

510
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,806
Who knows?

511
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,018
Hell no. This won't do.
I need to protect her.

512
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,020
There you go running wild again.

513
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,355
Jeez.

514
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,823
It's hot. Be careful.

515
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,707
What are you doing? Come on.

516
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,750
I told you not to exhaust yourself.

517
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,128
Let me do all the dangerous stuff.

518
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,339
To be honest, it was a bit much.

519
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,340
Right?

520
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,885
You're like an affectionate puppy.

521
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,431
And you're a mischievous squirrel.

522
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,141
What are you saying?

523
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,268
You're so silly!

524
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,352
You're so adorable.

525
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,026
-Hello, Ms. Kong.
-Hey, you two.

526
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,112
Jeez, you are so lovey-dovey.

527
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,321
Were things okay last night?

528
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,825
Yes, her doctor came by in the morning.

529
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,660
They said she's doing well.

530
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,246
But she needs to get an X-ray later today.

531
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,873
All right.

532
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,418
Leave this mischievous squirrel
to us and go to work.

533
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,295
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,173
Goodbye, then.

535
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,090
Bye.

536
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,135
Gosh, it's hot.

537
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,308
Right. I packed Jeong-woo's lunch.

538
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,476
Jeong-woo!

539
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,563
Ha-neul.

540
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,566
I'm sorry for everything.

541
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,780
For stealing money from you
and for not looking for work.

542
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,659
And I'm really sorry
for the sweet potato incident.

543
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,704
"The sweet potato incident"?

544
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,916
Jeong-woo.

545
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,962
Here. Take this.
I packed you some rice and side dishes.

546
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,507
-Have them for lunch.
-Thank you.

547
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,592
But you didn't have to.

548
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,303
Of course, I had to.
You've helped out so much.

549
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:03,518
And as for that guy who was
in the car with Ha-neul yesterday,

550
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,562
he was just a senior colleague,
so don't worry about it.

551
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,650
-I know who him as well.
-Is that so?

552
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,279
Thank goodness. I was worried
that you'd get the wrong idea.

553
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,451
By the way, how is he doing?

554
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,578
I'm not sure.

555
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,289
I heard he went to the ICU after surgery.

556
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,291
But that was it.

557
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,637
His vitals are weakening and his HB
and platelet levels are dropping.

558
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,223
His liver and kidneys are failing too.

559
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,975
He's suffering from multi-organ failure

560
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,435
since he lost a lot of blood
before and during surgery.

561
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,312
I'm afraid DIC is in progress.

562
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,232
I don't know if he'll make it.

563
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,196
I heard their part-timers are handsome.

564
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,866
It's cold and cloudy today,
so I'm craving some hot soup.

565
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,450
How about some kalguksu?

566
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,703
Yes. Pasta sounds good.

567
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,038
I didn't say "pasta." I said kalguksu.

568
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,957
Okay. Let's have pasta.

569
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,959
I said kalguksu, not pasta!

570
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,879
Jeong-woo, do you want pasta…

571
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,132
How about kalguksu for lunch?

572
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,510
I brought my own lunch.
And I have to go somewhere.

573
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,636
I see.

574
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,763
Are you visiting Dr. Nam?

575
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,806
Can we come?

576
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,224
Of course not.

577
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,311
-She needs rest. You shouldn't visit.
-Right.

578
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:32,064
Please tell her
we're thinking a lot about her.

579
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,483
And we'll delay your schedule
as much as possible,

580
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,736
so don't worry and focus
on nursing your girlfriend.

581
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,029
Thank you…

582
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,991
How did you know?

583
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,328
What? Do you all know?

584
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,626
It wasn't me. I never told you!

585
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,462
Be honest. How did you all know?

586
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,381
How could we not know?
He kept dropping hints.

587
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:01,260
I caught on when they kept going
to the stairwell.

588
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,430
I caught on when we ate
those rolled omelettes.

589
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,894
I saw you getting an earful from her
after you said she needed some work done.

590
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,313
I witnessed it.

591
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,817
You told me to keep it a secret,

592
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,527
but you let it show to everyone.

593
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,154
This won't do.

594
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,907
You're paying
our electric bill from now on.

595
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,869
Why do you keep telling me to pay
your utility bills? Are you short on cash?

596
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,746
It's a trendy joke.

597
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,956
Gosh.

598
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,165
Dr. Bin.

599
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,167
Isn't the joke, "Pay double in tax"?

600
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,462
He remembered it incorrectly.

601
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,632
I feel sorry for you.

602
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,052
-Can we have pizza?
-I'm down for both pasta and pizza.

603
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,645
I'm a bit flustered
to suddenly see you here.

604
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,399
But thank you for coming.

605
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,654
I called you several times,
but you never called back.

606
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,239
It made me feel uneasy.

607
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,744
You mustered the courage to step forward,
and I couldn't even thank you--

608
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,371
Are you really thankful?

609
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,624
I set up all those cameras in your clinic.

610
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,877
Well…

611
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,547
you had your reasons.

612
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,673
I'll be honest.

613
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:26,178
I told the detective I hid six,
but I hid seven cameras in your clinic.

614
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,310
I have the last one.

615
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,063
Do you know what it recorded?

616
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,232
Hold on.

617
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,776
Why are you bringing this up now?

618
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,991
You should've told the detective
about it instead of telling me.

619
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,492
Where is it?

620
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,536
Exactly.

621
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,165
This is how one would normally react.

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,252
I said the same thing

623
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,004
to Min Kyung-min as a test.

624
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,422
"As a test"?

625
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,633
Are you saying that was a lie?

626
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,968
Yes.

627
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:11,015
The whole incident seemed too odd.
I wanted to get to the bottom of it.

628
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,353
But he reacted differently.

629
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,149
He said it wasn't his fault
no matter what was recorded.

630
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,612
So doesn't that mean

631
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,656
someone is to blame?

632
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:33,162
I think he knows something
about the medical accident.

633
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,879
GANGNAM POLICE STATION, DETECTIVE KIM

634
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,227
So…

635
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,855
-The man who stalked me was--
-Correct.

636
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:05,236
They're the same black jacket and pants
Mr. Nam Ba-da mentioned in his statement.

637
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,408
To plan to have that murder
take place at your clinic,

638
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,326
there were many things he needed to check.

639
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,455
For example, the layout of the OR
and the location of CCTV cameras.

640
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,749
But after searching through
the CCTV footage,

641
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,753
the only people we saw visiting the clinic
were your employees and patients.

642
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,297
Except for Min Kyung-min.

643
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,509
But he came with you once
when you visited me.

644
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:32,346
You two seemed very close,

645
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,181
so I never suspected him.

646
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,685
But maybe that's exactly why
he decided to come with you.

647
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,020
So we looked into the footage again

648
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,440
and found this.

649
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,819
This was the day before the incident.

650
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,201
He acted brazenly since he knew
there were no CCTV cameras there.

651
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,121
But Kang Jin-seok's spy camera caught him.

652
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,249
We should've detected this sooner.

653
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,710
In any case, Ms. Nam played a key role.

654
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,380
Ha-neul?

655
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:11,385
Mr. Nam came two days ago to give
his statement, and she came with him.

656
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,306
She was also the one who realized
Min followed you on the day you moved in.

657
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,976
I don't know how, but she knew
Haesung wanted to manipulate stocks

658
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,394
with a false dissertation.

659
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,189
She also said it could be connected
to a gang in Macau.

660
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,443
She saw this footage afterwards.
I think that's why she went to him.

661
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:32,114
We restored a part of the dashcam footage
that was damaged in the accident.

662
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,034
This was their conversation
right before the accident.

663
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,748
Why did Haesung's vice president
attend Jeong-woo's hearing?

664
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:46,003
Haesung has something to do
with that medical accident, right?

665
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,508
Are you

666
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,344
involved in Jeong-woo's medical accident?

667
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,971
You…

668
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,516
What did Jeong-woo ever do to you?

669
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,173
Hey.

670
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,389
Meeting Kyung-min was because of me?

671
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,809
Jeong-woo.

672
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,893
Is it true?

673
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,479
This happened because of me?

674
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,774
How did you know?

675
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,238
Why did you go alone
when you knew how dangerous he was?

676
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,701
You should've told me.
Why did you go and get hurt instead?

677
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,622
You were on the verge of death.

678
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,333
When I had to send you into surgery

679
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,170
without getting to see your face,
how do you think I felt?

680
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,466
It was scarier because I knew
what the surgery was.

681
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,220
I could clearly see you
lying on that cold table.

682
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,723
That made it more painful
and it was driving me insane!

683
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,685
And it was all because of me?

684
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,731
Why would you put yourself in danger?

685
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,474
A car crash allegedly due
to sudden unintended acceleration

686
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,185
occurred in Yeoksam-dong,
Gangnam-gu last Wednesday night.

687
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,437
The police are investigating the cause

688
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,315
using eyewitness testimony
and dashcam footage.

689
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:15,611
According to reports, the driver
of the vehicle is still unconscious.

690
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,218
Excuse me.

691
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,430
I'm sorry, but is Mr. Yeo Jeong-woo here?

692
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,642
He's not here right now.
May I ask who you are?

693
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:50,270
He came and ordered
this flower basket earlier today.

694
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,190
He asked me to call him
when I arrived, but he hasn't picked up.

695
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,234
I'm sorry, but is it okay
to leave this here?

696
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,111
Sure.

697
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,572
Have a nice day.

698
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,336
Ha-neul, I'll stay strong.

699
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,047
So you should stay strong too.

700
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,883
We will be okay.

701
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,700
Here you are.

702
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,008
I'm sorry for putting myself in danger.

703
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,843
But in that moment,

704
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,762
I couldn't think rationally.

705
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,644
I desperately hoped I was mistaken.

706
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,147
I wanted to meet him
and hear him say it wasn't true.

707
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,151
I didn't expect

708
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,695
it would turn out this way.

709
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,326
But even if I went back in time,

710
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,454
I still wouldn't tell you.

711
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,792
You're just starting to heal.

712
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,837
You're finally good enough to do surgery

713
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,797
and carry on with daily life.

714
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,260
So I couldn't hurt you again.

715
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,681
How could I possibly tell you?

716
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,559
Jeong-woo.

717
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,605
Before we met…

718
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,610
when I collapsed
and almost died in front of the hospital,

719
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,737
do you know what I was thinking?

720
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,698
"Sure, let's just die."

721
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,369
I thought that would be the better option.

722
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,332
But this time,
all I could think of was one thing.

723
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,045
And it was you.

724
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,511
I could've died then and there,
but all I thought about was you.

725
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,889
I wanted to tell you that I loved you.

726
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,604
This is my love.

727
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,024
For even a day or a few hours,

728
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,903
I wanted to postpone
telling you for as long as I could.

729
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,866
For as long as possible…

730
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,210
I wanted you to be free of pain.

731
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,256
I'm sorry.

732
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,751
Are you going home now?

733
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,463
-Don't you have an umbrella?
-No, I do.

734
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,214
Then, why are you still here?

735
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,216
I was just watching the rain.

736
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:54,723
This is the perfect weather
for some seafood kalguksu and soju.

737
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,560
Right? Kalguksu and rainy days
go hand in hand, right?

738
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:02,564
That's what I said, but my colleagues said
pasta suited this weather better.

739
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,066
So we had pasta for lunch.

740
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,194
I understand.

741
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,864
Let's have some kalguksu
and soju like you suggested.

742
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,618
I never said we should.
It was just a thought.

743
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,787
Then, you should act on your thought.

744
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,039
All right.

745
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,132
Let's go.

746
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,513
I know a good place.

747
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,899
I feel a little bad for Ha-neul.

748
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,152
She was at the brink of death last night,

749
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,613
but I'm sitting here drinking.

750
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,033
She asked me to look into Kyung-min

751
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,995
and then got into that accident.
I don't know what's going on.

752
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,457
Didn't I say we should talk about us
the next time we met?

753
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,336
Well, is there anything
you'd like to talk about?

754
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,967
I divorced my husband because he cheated.

755
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,261
Excuse me.

756
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,181
We met each other in college.

757
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,602
I suffered so much as an intern
and needed someone to lean on.

758
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,314
So I asked him to marry me,
and he said, "Sure."

759
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,359
We got our parents' blessing,

760
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,903
and he went alone
to register our marriage.

761
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,282
Then, he proposed
while I was still in my scrubs.

762
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,576
That's how we got married.

763
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,871
That's quite romantic.

764
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,665
At first, yes.

765
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,210
But later, it all fell apart.

766
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,256
He started coming home late
after expanding his business.

767
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,134
And he started staying out all night.

768
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,053
-Then, he cheated on me with his employee.
-What?

769
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,682
-But I was pregnant back then.
-That crazy bastard!

770
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,436
You did the right thing!
I'm glad you divorced him.

771
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,442
Why are you so loud?
Are you holding a microphone?

772
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:11,818
I'm sorry.

773
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,155
I just got worked up.

774
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:19,326
You mentioned your divorce in the past.

775
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,580
I only told you since I thought
it was unfair of me to not share mine.

776
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,710
It's raining today,

777
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,796
and I'm feeling down, so…

778
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,715
Why are you feeling down?

779
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,177
No reason.

780
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:42,307
I feel like life is difficult.

781
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,103
I know this is about Ha-neul again,
but look at what happened.

782
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:50,816
I thought she was doing fine
at her hospital,

783
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,026
but she quit.

784
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:56,112
Then, as she was getting back on her feet,

785
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,074
another bad thing happened.

786
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,785
Things will look up for her again.

787
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,333
Like this.

788
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,802
Anyway, that's why.

789
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,763
We're done with our drinks, so let's go.

790
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,349
Ma'am, we'd like to pay now.

791
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,267
Okay.

792
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,480
-Here's my card.
-Okay.

793
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,775
-Let me treat you next time.
-Sounds great.

794
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,990
-What? Where did it go?
-What's wrong?

795
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:43,285
This is the same color, but it's not mine.

796
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,413
Oh, no. I think the customer
who just left took yours.

797
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,333
I'll call and ask them to return it.
Could you take that one for today?

798
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,003
It's okay. We can share mine.

799
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,047
-Would that be okay?
-Sure.

800
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,097
It started pouring
even heavier that night.

801
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,062
That rain

802
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,982
marked a new beginning for some.

803
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,824
BEST FOODS FOR CAR ACCIDENT RECOVERY

804
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,581
For others,

805
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,169
they hoped the rain
would wash away their pain.

806
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:39,507
Gosh, you just had to pick the time
when we were out of ingredients.

807
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,052
Why did you buy groceries
in this rain to make milmyeon?

808
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,345
I'll teach you tomorrow.

809
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,430
No, it has to be today.

810
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,141
I promised to work hard
once Ha-neul woke up.

811
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,893
But why do I need to be a part of that?

812
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,479
Come on, Uncle Tae-seon!

813
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,441
What should I start with?

814
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,985
Prepare the ingredients.

815
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,657
And for others,

816
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,744
they kept their promise despite the rain.

817
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,248
And for us,

818
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,336
we desperately hoped the rain
meant this suffering would end.

819
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,256
Just like how
the rain would eventually stop,

820
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:25,178
we wanted to stop thinking
that this sadness would last forever.

821
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,014
Jeong-woo.

822
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,726
I heard you listened
to the dashcam recording.

823
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,314
Yeah.

824
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,444
But the most important part
came after that.

825
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,909
I was still conscious
before the ambulance came.

826
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,160
And that's when I heard him.

827
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,791
He must've thought

828
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,711
he couldn't hide it anymore.

829
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:06,928
Ha-neul.

830
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,435
Ha-neul.

831
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,356
Ha-neul.

832
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,836
Why did you already shower?

833
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,964
I was too sleepy,
so I thought it would help me wake up.

834
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,843
I'm sorry. It must be tough
to stay awake because of me.

835
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,095
It's okay. We only have three weeks left.

836
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,513
You're right.

837
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,891
Three more weeks, and you can escape.

838
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,351
It's stifling to live here, isn't it?

839
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:56,895
Just a bit.

840
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,733
I'm kidding. I like your house.

841
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,485
I'm making tons of money thanks to you.

842
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,944
Really?

843
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,615
Then, will you buy me ramyeon
and kimbap again after exams?

844
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,910
Just ramyeon? I'll buy you some clothes.

845
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,373
A suit for graduation
and your first day of med school.

846
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,503
Are you talking about those black suits?
Men should wear black.

847
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,837
So you know a little bit.

848
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,091
Okay, I'll get you a black suit,
so study. I'll check in ten.

849
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,759
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it.

850
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,344
-Let's do it.
-All right.

851
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,054
Where was I again?

852
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,106
Hello, ma'am.

853
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,028
It's medicine for my indigestion.

854
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:49,989
Good night.

855
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,536
FATHER

856
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:06,923
Ma'am.

857
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,926
I'm sorry to tell you this.

858
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:13,304
But the bar called and said
my father was very drunk.

859
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:18,184
I'm the only one who can pick him up.
Could you give me two hours to go--

860
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,644
The CSAT is in three weeks.

861
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,647
Yes, I'm aware of that.

862
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:27,318
Actually, my father has been asking me
to have a meal with him.

863
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,695
It's unlike him to do so.

864
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:33,408
-I'm worried something is up--
-I said the CSAT is in three weeks.

865
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,370
Don't you get it?

866
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,541
Yes, ma'am.

867
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:53,052
Like he said, Jeong-woo
didn't do anything to him at all.

868
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,056
However…

869
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,226
According to the bar owner,

870
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,939
your father kept lying down
and said he wanted to sleep.

871
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,986
He must've thought he was home
and took the sleeping pills.

872
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,822
But perhaps since he was drunk,

873
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,492
he took eight pills at once.

874
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,997
He drove drunk
after taking too much Ambien.

875
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,293
His truck crashed into a guardrail

876
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,712
and died instantly at the scene.

877
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,968
I'm sorry for asking,

878
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:37,889
but I heard he called you
many times to come pick him up.

879
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,142
May I ask why you couldn't?

880
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,396
Foolishly enough, his resentment

881
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,316
was dreadful and brutal
like his circumstances.

882
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:06,167
What? There's more alcohol.

883
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,128
Cheers, Kyung-min.

884
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,466
He wanted Jeong-woo's family
to suffer the same way his family did.

885
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,426
But that was just self-justification.

886
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:19,806
Jeong-woo…

887
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,850
He claimed to have been torn
between affection and hate.

888
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,394
But that was just an excuse.

889
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,995
He claimed Jeong-woo's kindness
made him feel pathetic.

890
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,247
But that was just wretched self-pity.

891
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,457
That's impossible.

892
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,168
I know nothing of this.

893
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,881
And committing the unthinkable

894
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,550
was of his own doing.

895
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:08,938
So I hope

896
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,108
Jeong-woo will never forgive him.

897
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,531
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

898
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,394
Jeong-woo…

899
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,611
What is this?

900
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,661
Did you deliberately cause
that incident at my clinic?

901
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,539
I didn't know at first

902
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,959
that it was your clinic.

903
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,339
How can I believe you?

904
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:29,185
I know the situation I'm in right now.

905
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:38,444
If I was going to lie…

906
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:42,073
I wouldn't have asked you to come.

907
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,749
I found out the day before.

908
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,211
And I tried my best…

909
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,258
to dissuade them.

910
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:06,222
But I'd already come too far.

911
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,058
So I had no choice.

912
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,518
What do you mean?

913
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,314
What do you mean by "too far"?
The stock manipulation? For what?

914
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,069
I purposely didn't visit you
because of this.

915
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,074
I didn't want to see you in pain
and feel sorry for you.

916
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,996
I was afraid I'd hurt for you
when you didn't deserve it.

917
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,875
Jeong-woo.

918
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,252
I'm sorry.

919
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:37,962
I know…

920
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,716
I hurt you.

921
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,721
When you needed help,

922
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,056
I was sincere

923
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,018
about helping you out.

924
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,687
Your sincerity means nothing now!

925
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,566
Don't waste your time…

926
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:04,280
resenting me.

927
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:06,616
Damn it.

928
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,371
Even if I die…

929
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,918
please forget everything…

930
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,132
and move on.

931
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,635
Jeong-woo.

932
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:29,931
Goodbye.

933
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,504
What happened?
Why did he suddenly want to see you?

934
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,841
He apologized.

935
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:12,014
So? What did you say?

936
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,477
I couldn't say anything.

937
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,232
He might not make it.

938
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,696
-Maybe I should've forgiven him.
-What for?

939
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,323
Fine.

940
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,493
Let's say he was hurt because of you.

941
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,705
But that doesn't justify
his cruel actions.

942
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,000
Does he deserve forgiveness
because of that?

943
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,961
Give yourself time to process…

944
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,673
and don't suppress your feelings.

945
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,051
If you forgive him now,

946
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,680
then the tears you shed
will be meaningless.

947
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,351
I can't do it just yet.

948
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,899
I can't forgive him.

949
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,454
You don't have to.

950
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:27,006
It's okay.

951
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,143
I refused to forgive him in the end…

952
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,522
for the sake of my own pain.

953
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,998
DOCTOR SLUMP

954
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,250
It's been a while, Dad.

955
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,463
How much time needs to pass
for things to feel okay like that?

956
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,465
-Hey, Jeong-woo!
-Kyung-min!

957
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,008
I'm such an idiot.

958
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,093
I can't forget how good he was to me.

959
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,762
I'm having a pretty tough time.

960
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:41,599
You forgive someone not for their sake

961
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,059
but for yours.

962
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:44,977
You should go back

963
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,229
before it's too late.

964
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,439
-Bye, Uncle Tae-seon.
-Bye.

965
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:49,440
Go do your job.

966
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,443
Actually, I got an offer
to be an assistant professor.

967
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:53,360
You're the best!

968
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:58,032
To be by your side,
I made a huge decision.

969
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:05,623
