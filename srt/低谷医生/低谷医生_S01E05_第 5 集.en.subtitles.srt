2
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,789
Pass! Over here!

3
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:41,916
Over here!

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,054
Yeo Jeong-woo!

5
00:00:55,138 --> 00:01:01,436
-Yeo Jeong-woo!
-Yeo Jeong-woo!

6
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:07,067
Back then, I thought girls in Seoul
had strange tastes in guys.

7
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,319
"They think he's cool?"

8
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,029
"They think he's kind?"

9
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,365
I couldn't understand
the girls who fell for him.

10
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,160
The same went for me too.

11
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,172
Gosh.

12
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,383
Ha-neul sure is pretty.

13
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,761
Honestly, solely based on looks,

14
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,348
she's the prettiest girl in our class.
No, in our school.

15
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,642
Fight me.

16
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,228
Don't hold me back. Hey.

17
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,354
You see,

18
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,649
I really didn't get guys
who said Ha-neul was pretty.

19
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
But now,

20
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,488
why am I happy to have you by my side?

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,207
When I see you,

22
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,334
why do I feel relieved?

PIG'S TROTTERS RESTAURANT

24
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,007
Why do you come to mind first
whenever I'm upset?

25
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,636
No matter where you go, you'll do great.

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,430
Why do your words comfort me?

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,977
The date was a flop.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:25,979
What?

29
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,897
I'm telling you this now.

30
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,695
But I was happy to hear that.

31
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,578
To be honest…

32
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,458
My heart raced a bit.

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,629
Lately,

34
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,008
what's been wrong with us?

DOCTOR SLUMP

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,526
What? Why are you here?

37
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,486
Well…

38
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,532
I thought you'd come back crying,
so I came to pick you up.

39
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,078
How did you know I'd cry?

40
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,582
-What?
-My failed interview.

41
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,667
You knew, didn't you?

42
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,588
You see…

43
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,468
So you're telling me it was Kyung-min
who told the hospital director about me?

44
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,472
I didn't even get a chance to interview
because of a few words of his.

45
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,769
But you see, he didn't do it out of spite.

46
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,231
Word spreads fast,
so everyone will eventually find out.

47
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,193
And if they find out later and it becomes
an issue, you'll suffer more.

48
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,030
Well, that's true.

49
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,533
By the way…

50
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,787
Why did you come pick me up?

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,456
What?

52
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,793
I mean, even friends
wouldn't come out this far.

53
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,088
Who'd come out all the way to Hwabon?

54
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,509
Well…

TRAVEL FOCUS

56
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,223
-I came to sightsee. So what?
-What?

57
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,976
It's true that I was worried about you.

58
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,271
So at first, I was going to wait
at Seoul Station. But then, I thought,

59
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,023
"Have I been to Hwabon before?"
And I realized I hadn't.

60
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,025
Since you'd already be in a bad mood,

61
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,487
I thought we could get some fresh air
and eat lots of good food. You know?

62
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,781
So, yes. I'm here to sightsee.

63
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,784
I see. Sightseeing.

64
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,327
Next, please.

65
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,245
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,832
-What?
-I thought you came to sightsee.

67
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,874
What?

68
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,795
There's a travel guide. I'll grab one.

69
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,173
No, I…

70
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,925
That's okay…

71
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,469
You're serious?

72
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,695
I didn't know he came to sightsee.
I almost swooned.

73
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,614
Why in the world did I come
all the way here?

74
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,366
Jeez.

75
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,493
Come on. Hurry up.

76
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,245
I'm coming!

77
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:46,012
Hey, the last person to reach that point
gets flicked on the forehead. Deal?

78
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,682
Sure, it's not like we have
anything to do. Let's do that.

79
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,352
Get ready. Get set…

80
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,270
Set…

81
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,899
Hey, I haven't said "go" yet.
You're cheating!

82
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,358
I'm not cheating!

83
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,446
I gave myself a head start
since you're faster than me!

84
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,739
Head start, my foot.

85
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,412
Hey!

86
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,584
What?

87
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,717
Hey!

88
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,304
Gosh.

89
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,569
What's taking you so long?

90
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,447
My pants were getting in the way.

91
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,828
Come here. Give me your forehead.

92
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,332
Fine, go ahead and flick me.

93
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,431
Want me to take your photo?

94
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,768
-Not really.
-Why not?

95
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,606
You didn't go on trips,
so you probably don't have many photos.

96
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,860
Go stand over there. Come on.

97
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,904
-Fine then.
-All right. Over there.

98
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,699
Nice. Okay.

99
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,369
Hey, that's perfect.
Even the sheep are posing.

100
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,247
Okay. One, two, three.

101
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,044
Smile.

102
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,713
Okay. One, two, three.

103
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,050
That's it. Nice. One, two, three.

104
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,760
Great! One, two, three!

105
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,095
That was nice.

106
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,141
Look. They came out nice, right?

107
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,602
I'll text them to you later. Let's go.

108
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,067
Group shots are a must.
Shouldn't we take one?

109
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,402
Us two?

110
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,366
Okay, I'll take it now.

111
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:58,162
Okay. One, two, three.

112
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,836
-We look like strangers.
-We are.

113
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,755
No, we look worse than that.

114
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,590
Why don't we smile?

115
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,716
-Okay.
-All right.

116
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,302
One, two, three.

117
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,817
These group photos… aren't bad.

118
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,489
What is it? What are you looking at?

119
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,157
-What?
-Hold on.

120
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,869
-Why did you zoom into my face?
-Because I…

121
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,874
-I calculated how much work you needed.
-What?

122
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,752
Hey, get some Botox done.

123
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,462
What do you say? Want me to do it?

124
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,714
Forget it.

125
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,258
Get some Botox for your life
to straighten it out.

126
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,141
Thanks for today.

127
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,727
What?

128
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,981
I would've been bawling
if it hadn't been for you.

129
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,898
Thanks for coming.

130
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,778
So tell me. Do you feel better now?

131
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,075
A part of me thinks this is for the best.

132
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,664
I didn't know if I really wanted this
or if I was embarrassed for being jobless

133
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,375
so I rushed to get any kind of job.

134
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:33,424
I'm in no state to work right now.
It worked out for the best.

135
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,469
Okay.

136
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,806
Just wait a bit more and find
a better job once you are fully ready.

137
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,685
-Okay.
-Good.

138
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,816
-The last train's at 9:00 p.m.?
-Hey, we have ten minutes.

139
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,859
We have plenty of time.

140
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,491
-Are you okay, Dad?
-I'm fine.

141
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,121
-Dad!
-Excuse me.

142
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,000
Sir, are you all right?

143
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,503
-I'm a doctor. What happened?
-Well…

144
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,882
My dad once had surgery
for a heart attack.

145
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,386
He's wearing a pacemaker,
but it's a bit old.

146
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,721
-I think that's why.
-It's a heart attack. Call 911.

147
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,806
Okay.

148
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,744
Jeong-woo.

149
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,163
What's wrong?

150
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,046
-Jeong-woo, get the defibrillator.
-What?

151
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,464
Okay.

152
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,010
Dad. Please get up.

153
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,401
-It's ready.
-Stand back.

154
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,904
Again.

155
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,491
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

156
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,244
Goodness, what a relief.

157
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,998
You should be careful too.

158
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,751
We applied emergency first aid,
and he's breathing again. He'll be fine.

159
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,130
Thank you. Thank you so much.

I hope he'll be okay.

Hey, Jeong-woo.

164
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,696
Yeah?

165
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,907
What's on your mind?

166
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,868
It's nothing.

167
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,078
Hey.

168
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,331
We missed the last train. What do we do?

169
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,044
-You're right.
-Should we wait and take the first train?

170
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,295
That's at 5:00 a.m.

171
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,089
-We can't wait for seven hours.
-Then what?

172
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,593
Let's sleep here.

173
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,515
Let's spend the night here.

174
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,934
Let's go.

175
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,191
What?

176
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,612
How can she be so blunt?

177
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,078
Ha-neul's not home yet?

178
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,204
No.

179
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,164
I wonder how the interview went.

180
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,751
She hasn't come home nor has she called.

181
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,545
It probably went well. That's why.

182
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,339
She said it was just a formality
and she'd likely get the job.

183
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,386
She wanted to rest, but I embarrassed her
in front of her aunts.

184
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,347
I feel terrible
for forcing her to go there.

185
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,850
Come on. She's too smart
to do something out of pressure.

186
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,895
-She chose to go.
-But still.

187
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,273
I hope she's not upset
and crying somewhere.

188
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,858
Come on, now. Let's go upstairs.

189
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,111
Cheer up, will you?

190
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,948
WELCOME

191
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,079
Thank you.

192
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,330
Goodbye.

193
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,423
-Do you have any rooms?
-Yes.

194
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,966
Two. We want to book two.

195
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,470
I see.
We actually have just two rooms left.

196
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,932
But we're cleaning one of them
since our guests just left.

197
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,851
You need to wait an hour.

198
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,644
One hour?

199
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,857
Let's stay together for an hour.
Is that okay?

200
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,152
Sure.

201
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,709
Is this the bathroom?

202
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,344
Hey, a fridge.

203
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,560
Gosh, there's a lot of beer.

204
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,855
Should we have some beer while we wait?

205
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,607
Should we?

206
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,744
Gosh, I'm tired. My legs are sore.

207
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,001
-You should sit too.
-What?

208
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,963
-Make yourself at home.
-All right.

209
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,015
-Gosh!
-Jeez!

210
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,600
-Where was--
-Damn it.

211
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,185
Hey.

212
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,480
Hey, look. This is what I think of you.

213
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,023
Instead of being attracted to you,

214
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,861
I just see you as a body. An organism.
Protein. Something like that.

215
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,738
I'm nothing but protein to you?

216
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,324
Then what?
You want me to find you attractive?

217
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,325
Are you insane?

218
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,537
You do that, and I'll cut ties with you.

219
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,665
The same goes for me.
I'll end our friendship right there.

220
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,792
Jeez, we're finally seeing eye to eye.

221
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,255
Exactly. So let's not be awkward.
Let's sit down and drink.

222
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,757
All right.

223
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,349
Goodness.

224
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,103
What a hectic day.

225
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,522
I came for an interview
I couldn't even do,

226
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,315
but I saved someone's life.

227
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,192
And we're spending the night here.

228
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,531
It felt strange back there though.

229
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,158
I finally felt like I earned my keep.

230
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,287
Maybe the real reason
why we came here was to save that man.

231
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,584
-Hey.
-What?

232
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,587
You dare yawn
when I'm saying something moving?

233
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,464
I couldn't help it.

234
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,883
Your words make me drowsy.

235
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,845
That's rich coming from someone
who doesn't sleep much.

236
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,598
-I don't sleep much?
-Am I wrong?

237
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,642
I saw you jogging every morning,
so I thought so.

238
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,853
I see.

239
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,273
I used to sleep a lot, but…

240
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,151
But what?

241
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,780
Do you have trouble sleeping now?
Is it insomnia?

242
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,699
Never mind.

243
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,286
What? Why aren't you telling me?

244
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,370
Jeez.

245
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,916
MS. KONG WOL-SEON

246
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,461
I forgot to call her.

247
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,671
-Let me take this call outside.
-Okay.

248
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,257
Be quick, or I'll drink all of this.

249
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,052
Do as you please.

250
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,351
Hey, Mom.

251
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,063
I'm going to spend the night here.

252
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,523
The air is nice and clear.

253
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,359
The interview?

254
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,736
I'll tell you more about it at home.

255
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,197
Okay. Good night.

256
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,752
What? Why are they all calling me?

257
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,131
Hey, what is it?

258
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,175
What do you think?
I was curious about the interview.

259
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,718
Did it go well?

260
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,055
Not at all. I came but didn't get to see
the hospital director.

261
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,059
Seriously? Kyung-min really said that?

262
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,271
What did he say
for them to cancel the interview?

263
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,564
Jeong-woo was wrong too.

264
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,107
Why would he tattle on him?

265
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,067
Why not? I have the right to know.

266
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,570
And he wasn't trying to tattle.

267
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,240
He was explaining
why he came to Hwabon and…

268
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,242
What?

269
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,952
He's in Hwabon?

270
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,538
He just happened to come to sightsee.

271
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,664
That's an excuse.

272
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,125
It's obvious that he likes you.

273
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,836
he was worried you were alone,
so he went to comfort you.

274
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,296
Don't be absurd.

275
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,213
I'm not!

276
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,300
He invited you to see the sunrise.

277
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,552
Then, he went to Hwabon to comfort you.

278
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,179
He's totally into you.

279
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,388
It's a 100% true.

280
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,681
No, he doesn't.

281
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,224
No, make that 200% or 300%.

282
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,393
I'm hanging up
if you have nothing else to say.

283
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,525
Why does she keep talking nonsense?

284
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,320
Why is it so hot?

285
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,285
What do we do? The bleeding won't stop!

286
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,953
Gauze and a six-inch EB!

287
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,030
I'm back.

288
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,449
Hey. Welcome back.

289
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,911
They finished cleaning next door,
so I'll go. Rest up and see you tomorrow.

290
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,218
Can you…

291
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,513
stay with me tonight?

292
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,391
What?

293
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,060
Stay with me.

294
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,985
Stay for a bit longer.

295
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,364
Should we…

296
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,451
play Go-Stop?

297
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,831
What? Go-Stop?

298
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,792
I mean, I found these cards here.

299
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,836
You've probably never played before.

300
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,629
I'll teach you.

301
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,966
Sure then.

302
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,012
Let me just put my bag in my room.

303
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,431
Okay.

304
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,502
What's the matter with him?

305
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,505
Why would he grab my wrist?

306
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,841
Why would he ask me
to play cards so seductively?

307
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,728
-Hey, Jeong-woo.
-Hey.

308
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,070
Thanks.

309
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,030
What? For what?

310
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,742
I suddenly didn't want to be alone.

311
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,953
So thanks.

312
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,668
-Okay, should we begin then?
-Sure.

313
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,254
Loser gets hit on the wrist. Deal?

314
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,465
Hey, the skin on your wrists will die.

315
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,175
And you'll break yours.

316
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,635
I'm a quick learner.

317
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,430
Hey, bring it on.

318
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,265
-Come here.
-Okay.

319
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,892
All right.

320
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,645
Ta-da!

321
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,190
All right. I'll teach you the basics.

322
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,526
You just need to match the drawings.

323
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,486
-Do you see this gwang?
-Yeah.

324
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,988
Collect three of them,
and you get three points.

325
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,533
Collect four, and you get four points.

326
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,867
-Collect five?
-Five points.

327
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,411
No, 15 points.

328
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,873
And if you collect three birds,
and you get a godori.

329
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,542
-Five points.
-Godori.

330
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,836
Then, these ribbons.
Cheongdan, hongdan, and chodan.

331
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,380
Collect them for three points.

332
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,465
Let's begin.

333
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,931
Jeez, I keep drawing bad cards.

334
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,102
Yes, that's it.

335
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,689
Hey! I got three birds. Godori.

336
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,483
-One, two, three, four points.
-You sure those are birds?

337
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,903
Godori. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve points.

338
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,113
One go.

339
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,823
One go?

340
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:12,993
Clean sweep!

341
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,204
That's a dud.

342
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:18,957
This and…

343
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,004
I did it! One more! Okay.

344
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,839
Go. Two go.

345
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,550
-Okay.
-Be honest. You've played before, right?

346
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,677
No, this is my first time playing.

347
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,313
-Jeong-woo.
-Yeah?

348
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,275
I've really wanted to try this.

349
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:46,902
Try what?

350
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,368
All right! That was a practice round!

351
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,286
All right.

352
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,580
Should we begin the real game now?
You're so good!

353
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,334
Broken wrists.

354
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,880
You think you'll be all right?

355
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,635
Hitting me 30 times
will be too much for you.

356
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,013
Okay. Just three then.

357
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,098
Three?

358
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,141
What?

359
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,772
-This is really fun.
-Let's play again.

360
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,440
I went easy on you, okay?

361
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,736
-Please shuffle them well.
-You better not regret this.

362
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,615
It was strange.

363
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:40,455
Why did he have trouble sleeping?
Why did he keep grabbing my wrist?

364
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,250
Why did he ask me to stay with him?

365
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,711
I had a lot of questions
I wanted to ask him.

366
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,130
But I couldn't ask him
anything that night.

367
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,983
Eun-jeong, breakfast is ready!

368
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,278
What? Where are you going?
Aren't you spending Sunday with me?

369
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,571
I'm eating rosé tteokbokki
with my friends.

370
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,241
Why are rosé dishes so popular these days?

371
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,158
Kids like it.

372
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,619
Right.

373
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,496
-Dad.
-Yes?

374
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,540
Can I have some money for the hair salon?

375
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,792
Okay.

376
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,130
Your wish is my command, my daughter.

377
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,924
Here. This is for the food.

378
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,134
And this is for your hair.

379
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,721
-This isn't enough for my hair.
-Aren't you going to cut it?

380
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,390
Ten thousand won is plenty
for a kid's haircut.

381
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,559
You don't know anything.

382
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,812
-It was a joke--
-Forget it!

383
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,647
Eun-jeong!

384
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,232
Hey, Bin Eun-jeong…

385
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
Gosh, that little…

386
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,822
I can't even joke around now.

387
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,782
Frog food.

388
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,576
Frog food?

389
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,203
I think we can find insects
here and there.

390
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,455
Look over there.

391
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,958
Wait for me, Jin-woo.

392
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,877
Where are you going?

393
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,632
Mom, I see a grasshopper.

394
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,051
Hurry and catch it for me.

395
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,511
Okay. I'll catch it for you.

396
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,180
Hold on. Stand back.

397
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,765
There it is.

398
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,934
Darn it.

399
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,896
Mom, use your hands to catch it.

400
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,064
My hands?

401
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,192
Ju-won said his dad uses his hands.

402
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,238
But I'm afraid of insects, Jin-woo.
I'll try to catch it with this net.

403
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,076
There it is.

404
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:46,748
Got it!

405
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,668
Mom, it ran away because of you.

406
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,170
Darn it.

407
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,088
Jeez.

408
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,894
It's not like we did something wrong.
Do we have to go separately here?

409
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,979
I understand.

410
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,024
But your mother was concerned
about our trip to Sokcho.

411
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,527
Imagine if she knew
we spent the night in Hwabon.

412
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,155
Still, I think it's weirder
to go home separately like this.

413
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,491
Just do as I say
and stop making her worry.

414
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,326
-Go on, now.
-Fine.

415
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,454
-Rest up.
-You too.

416
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,382
Mom. Is Ha-neul home?

417
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,968
I'm not sure. She hasn't called.

418
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,886
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

419
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
By the way,
aren't you getting a bad feeling?

420
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,640
Why? Bad about what?

421
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,602
It just feels
like her interview didn't go well.

422
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,563
Why? Did she call you?

423
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,647
No, she didn't.

424
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,733
You said she'd tell you at home.

425
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,486
When she left, she made it seem
like she was about to move out right away.

426
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,530
So what's there to discuss at home?

427
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,284
No matter how much we ask,
she won't tell us how it went.

428
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,954
It's like how I didn't come home
when I failed my civil service exam.

429
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,082
I think she bombed her interview.

430
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,085
Be quiet. We can ask her when she comes.

431
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,588
We'll find out soon enough
when she tells us.

432
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,839
Go and throw this away.

433
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,759
Plastics.

434
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,595
These are cans.

435
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,562
Hello, ma'am.

436
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,273
Hey.

437
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,192
Can I hang some laundry here?

438
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,736
Of course. This is your rooftop.

439
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,113
Right.

440
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,532
Thanks for dealing
with my in-laws last time.

441
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,203
Once you open your practice again,
I'll visit to get some work done.

442
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,580
No, ma'am. You don't need anything done.

443
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,998
Come on, don't lie.

444
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,249
I'm serious.

445
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,503
Your features are in perfect harmony.
They're natural and beautiful.

446
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,049
Goodness, you sure know
how to sweet talk to a lady.

447
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,638
If Ha-neul was home,
I'd invite you downstairs for some fruit.

448
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,641
But since she's not,
you'd probably feel awkward alone.

449
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,142
Did she go somewhere?

450
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,521
She went to Hwabon yesterday
but hasn't come back yet.

451
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,232
Maybe she's spending another night there.

452
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,235
Anyway, let's have
some barbecue here sometime.

453
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,528
-Okay.
-Go on your way then.

454
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,375
Hey, Ha-neul. Where are you?

455
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,335
Me? I'm home.

456
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,253
You're home?

457
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,382
It's so noisy though.

458
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,801
It's the TV.

459
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,474
Okay, then.

460
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,693
You little brat!

461
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,736
Why are you at the arcade instead of home?

462
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,905
Jeez, that hurts.

463
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,200
Is this home? Is it?

464
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,995
Why didn't you go home?

465
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,455
I did and came back outside.

466
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,624
Is that so?

467
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,671
All right, then.

468
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,508
Okay. Let's go.

469
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,801
Sure, bring it on.

470
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,740
So? Are you done?

471
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,950
If so, let's go home then.

472
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,827
What?

473
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,415
What's wrong? Why are you surprised?

474
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,002
You see…

475
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,048
I guess I really enjoyed
hanging out with you.

476
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,593
The arcade, karaoke, Go-Stop.
I didn't realize how much fun they were.

477
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,304
So?

478
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:17,226
So… I'm thinking about having
a bit more fun before I go home.

479
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,153
Hey. Do you want to go there then?

480
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,746
This place hasn't changed one bit.

481
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,959
Do you remember? We used to
always race down this path to be first.

482
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,460
How could I ever forget that?

483
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,546
Hey, let's visit our classroom.

484
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,841
Our classroom too? Are we allowed to?

485
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,179
Who cares? We can leave right away
if we get caught. And you run well.

486
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,263
-Jeez.
-Let's go.

487
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,685
I'll beat you there!

488
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,742
No way.

489
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,329
Doesn't coming here
make you feel nostalgic?

490
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,998
It does.

491
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,167
Right. This was my seat.

492
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,378
And this was mine.

493
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,716
I was always studying like this.

494
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,969
Don't be ridiculous.
You were always like this.

495
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,764
"I need to study! Stay strong!"

496
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,266
Hey, I was never like that.

497
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,729
Goodness.

498
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,148
Gosh.

499
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,110
-Jeong-woo.
-Yeah?

500
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,113
What do you want to do
if you can go back to being a student?

501
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,574
I'm not sure.

502
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,326
I've never thought of that before.

503
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:58,995
What about you?

504
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,330
I would…

505
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,544
retake the college entrance exams.
The results didn't reflect my skills.

506
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,007
I was always curious about that.

507
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,303
Why did you bomb it?

508
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,513
You aced the mock test
and that was harder.

509
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,309
I was really sick that day.

510
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,437
My entire body was in pain.

511
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,568
After the test, I did have a feeling
that I wouldn't get into my dream school.

512
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,164
LOADING RESULTS

513
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,169
HANGUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
MEDICAL SCHOOL ADMISSIONS

514
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,171
NAM HA-NEUL
NAME IS NOT ON THE LIST

515
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:58,805
Still, I was totally devastated
when I saw I didn't get in.

516
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,274
Everyone's always had high expectations
for me since I was young.

517
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,654
I always felt pressure
to satisfy those expectations.

518
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,115
And that pressure

519
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,827
continued into my adulthood.

520
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,793
Of course, it did.

521
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,503
You sacrificed so much.

522
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,131
Your childhood,
spending time with friends,

523
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:37,176
relationships, small hobbies. Everything.

524
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,471
You gave it all up and studied so hard,
so it must've been devastating.

525
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,892
Goodness.

526
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,354
What are you thinking so hard about?

527
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,775
It's nothing. Let's go.

528
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,821
You think you can go home now?

529
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,411
You were avoiding going home on purpose.

530
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,955
What?

531
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:10,334
You didn't know how to tell your family
that you couldn't do the interview.

532
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,920
Isn't that why you stayed out?

533
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,465
How did you know?

534
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,804
I think I'm finally understanding you.

535
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,893
I think you're too harsh on yourself.

536
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,149
Don't worry about what others think
and take care of yourself first.

537
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,655
You need to be okay today
to help yourself make it through tomorrow.

538
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,161
You asked me earlier what I'd want to do
if I could go back to being a student.

539
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,831
Right. I did.

540
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,626
If I could go back in time,

541
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,712
since I feel so bad for the younger you,

542
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,341
I'd like to give you a hug.

543
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,911
Hey!

544
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,540
Is someone here?

545
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,455
Jeez.

546
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,674
What's going on?

547
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:25,386
He's just protein,
so why does my heart keep…

548
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,846
-"Protein"?
-My goodness.

549
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,055
"Heart"?

550
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,224
What is it? Is protein good for the heart?

551
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,727
No, that's not why.

552
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,271
Are you back, Ha-neul?
How did the interview go?

553
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,148
You see…

554
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,322
I'm not going to Hwabon.

555
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,699
Why not? Did you fail the interview?

556
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,537
Yes, the interview didn't go
as well as I thought it would.

557
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,372
And I'm not ready yet.

558
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,041
I want to rest a bit more. Can I?

559
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,334
Of course, you can.

560
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,502
I didn't want you to go there anyway.

561
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,297
Me too. Who'll give me
pocket money if you leave?

562
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,632
Just get a job in Seoul.
There are tons of hospitals.

563
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,844
Okay. I'll go to my room then.

564
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,762
Okay.

565
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,481
What? That was easier than I thought.

566
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,787
I shouldn't have stayed out.

567
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,705
They were up and waiting for me.

568
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,874
What? So how did it go?

569
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,752
I just told them the truth.

570
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:44,048
Good job. I guess since you're smart,
you understood me right away.

571
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,093
Have a good night.

572
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,637
You too.

573
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,899
KYUNG-MIN

574
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,869
Hey. What's up?

575
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,163
Hey, Jeong-woo. Are you busy tomorrow?

576
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,960
-Tomorrow?
-I just have something to tell you.

577
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:26,257
I'll see you at the coffee shop
near the hospital. Bye.

578
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,944
Hey.

579
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,750
What's this?

580
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,170
A hidden camera from your clinic.

581
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,466
What do you mean?

582
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,302
I went there two days ago
to get some files for you.

583
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,612
That's when I found it.

584
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,882
Who would do this?

585
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,515
A HOPEFUL FUTURE ALONGSIDE THE PEOPLE

586
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,904
If there were cameras planted everywhere,

587
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,532
that means they were watching
my every move.

588
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,201
Who would do such a thing?

589
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,745
Did you find any fingerprints?

590
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,416
We'll ask the NFS
to assess them right away.

591
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:10,254
Could you also check my clinic
to see if there were any cameras I missed?

592
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,463
Okay.

593
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,806
I can't believe this.

594
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,561
I'm actually glad this happened.

595
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,607
I felt so hopeless
when nothing was going right.

596
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,693
But we now have something to investigate.

597
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,488
They're going to
look into all the workers.

598
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,198
I'm sure they'll find something.

599
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,203
So you think these cameras
had something to do with that incident?

600
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,581
I guess.

601
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,833
By the way,

602
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,170
why did you wait until now
to tell me about the camera?

603
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,466
I went to your place yesterday
to tell you, but you got up and left.

604
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,842
No, not yesterday.

605
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,804
Why didn't you tell me
as soon as you found the camera?

606
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:02,973
I see.

607
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,727
I had no idea the camera would have
anything to do with the incident.

608
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,729
I thought it was just someone's prank.

609
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,523
That's why I wasn't in a rush to tell you.

610
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:21,116
Well, I wouldn't have known
if it wasn't for you, so thanks.

611
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,619
-Don't mention it.
-Right.

612
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,247
-You should give Ha-neul a call.
-What?

613
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,917
You unintentionally ruined her interview.

614
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,127
It'd be best to apologize.

615
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,548
Jeong-woo.

616
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,470
Do you like Ha-neul?

617
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,853
Do you? Because it seems like you do.

618
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,858
I'm not sure.

619
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,820
I don't see why I need to tell you though.

620
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,407
Right. You don't have to.

621
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,454
But I might be disappointed
if you do have feelings for her.

622
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,084
You shouldn't be happy right now.

623
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,176
BRAVO MY LIFE
DRAFT BEER

624
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,766
So tell me. Did you have fun in Hwabon?

625
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,145
Well, we rode bicycles.

626
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,271
Bicycles?

627
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:33,939
We ate some food.

628
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,107
You ate food.

629
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,359
And we drank some beer.

630
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,986
Then, you did it.

631
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,822
My goodness. Do what?

632
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,658
Confess your feelings.
Why are you so surprised?

633
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,080
Don't be ridiculous. Confess, my foot.

634
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,708
-I told you we were friends.
-Really?

635
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,960
Are you sure that you won't feel a thing

636
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,962
even if you spent the night
at a hotel together?

637
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,424
-What's going on?
-What?

638
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,259
Did you two really go to a hotel?

639
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,887
Did you spend the night in Hwabon?

640
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,015
No, we didn't.
We took the last train back.

641
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,850
Ha-neul, you're crazy!

642
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,980
It doesn't matter if you spent the night
or took the last train home.

643
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:18,692
What's for certain is
he totally has feelings for you.

644
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,111
-It's not like that.
-Yes, it is.

645
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:26,950
Men don't invest their time and attention
into someone they don't like.

646
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:31,038
But given his situation,
I don't know if I should root for you two.

647
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,665
Anyway, I'm positive that he likes you.

648
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,794
-Do you get what I'm saying?
-Whatever.

649
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,087
Jeez.

650
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,007
Gosh, you're being so ridiculous.

651
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,593
Ha-neul!

652
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:48,222
Tell me more! How did you two get there?

653
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,057
Hey.

654
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,938
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

655
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,941
To be honest,

656
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,902
I was curious.

657
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,244
Why did he come to see me?

658
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,330
Can you…

659
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,833
stay with me tonight?

660
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,627
What could he have meant?

661
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,673
Since I feel so bad for the younger you,

662
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,385
I'd like to give you a hug.

663
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,805
With those words,
why does he keep making me feel…

664
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,991
Jeong-woo!

665
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,702
Ha-neul.

666
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,495
What is it?

667
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,415
You see, I need to talk to you
about something.

668
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,168
Catch your breath first. I can wait.

669
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:05,924
You…

670
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,013
Why are you being so caring?

671
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:13,932
What?

672
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,269
You used to be really childish
and mean in high school.

673
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:23,400
So why did you take me to the arcade,
Sokcho, and our school?

674
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,860
Why are you caring for me?

675
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,615
I mean, why do you keep…

676
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,035
randomly grabbing my hand?

677
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,079
Why did you ask me to stay with you?

678
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,831
Why did you come to Hwabon?

679
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,462
You care about me, right?

680
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,300
It's true,

681
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,803
isn't it?

682
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,481
To be honest…

683
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,274
You shouldn't be happy right now.

684
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,697
To be honest what?

685
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,788
To be honest…

686
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,959
I don't have feelings for you.

687
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,757
I was just being nice as a friend.

688
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,300
I'm sorry if I confused you.

689
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,222
I'll be more careful.

690
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,037
Well, you see…

691
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,039
So…

692
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,457
We heard everything…

693
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,793
I mean nothing.

694
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,477
So you were eating pork belly.

695
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,158
Why would you grill meat
on the rooftop? Why?

696
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,163
We've always grilled meat
over charcoal on the rooftop.

697
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,790
Even still.

698
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,042
You shouldn't
if someone's living there now.

699
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:46,960
So why…

700
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,712
You see…

701
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,215
Jeong-woo agreed to have
some barbecue with us.

702
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,925
That's why we went upstairs.

703
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,521
This is bad.

704
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,732
We saw her getting rejected.
What do we do?

705
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,233
What are you talking about?

706
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,110
Don't make things up!

707
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,236
She wasn't rejected.

708
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,280
She never confessed her feelings.

709
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,825
What was it she said?
She said he took her to Sokcho

710
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,202
and grabbed her wrist.

711
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,497
So she just asked him why he did that.

712
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,582
Come on. Why do you think she asked him?

713
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,292
She asked because she liked him.

714
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,460
I can clearly see it.

715
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,879
She's totally into him.

716
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,548
So she pretty much got rejected.

717
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,051
You're right.
And she was brutally rejected.

718
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,052
It's game over.

719
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,054
I bet she's crying in there right now.

720
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,722
You're wrong!

721
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,432
She wasn't rejected!

722
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,433
Damn it.

723
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,061
I can't believe him though.

724
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:50,190
Why did he treat her so well
and go to Hwabon if he didn't like her?

725
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,484
Hold on.

726
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,237
Did they spend another night together?

727
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,657
Didn't they go to Sokcho last time too?

728
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,909
I'm right. They went on another trip.

729
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,247
We booked two rooms. Two.

730
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,667
And I don't have feelings for him.

731
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,002
I just asked out of pure boredom.

732
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,548
So everyone, mind your own business.

733
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,882
-Okay.
-Okay.

734
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,185
This is so mortifying.

735
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,192
This isn't right.

736
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,863
This is wrong.

737
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,242
What do I…

738
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,856
Hello.

739
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,403
You mentioned having a barbecue sometime.

740
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,822
Gosh, there's a lot of dust over there.

741
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,287
-There's a lot of dust.
-Yes, there is.

742
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,707
There's a lot over there too.

743
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,876
I'll get going then.

744
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,419
There's a lot of dust there too.

745
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,962
Goodness, I'm leaving!

746
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,641
My goodness.

747
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,855
I ran out of ingredients,
so I have no food for you.

748
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,691
I'm going to the library.

749
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,276
Anyways, we're closed.

750
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,868
HAEBYEOL FARM
HOPE VEGETABLE STORE

751
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,537
I see. He ran out of ingredients.

752
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

753
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,340
What should I eat?

754
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,384
BACON TUNA MAYO

755
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,969
Gosh, lucky me.

756
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,483
Should I move?

757
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,372
Wait.

758
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,294
I must've been crazy yesterday.
No, I definitely was.

759
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,631
As you already know,
I'm not all there these days.

760
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,717
I haven't been thinking straight, so…

761
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,346
Anyway, I don't want you to misunderstand.

762
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,432
Bye.

763
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,019
I hope this won't make things
awkward between us.

764
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,356
Of course not. That won't happen.

765
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,735
Bye.

766
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,954
How can I catch these?

767
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,897
What's that?

768
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,190
Go away!

769
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,112
-Excuse me.
-There's a bug!

770
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,908
-Hold on.
-It's a bug!

771
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,993
Hold on.

772
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,181
You're good at catching insects.

773
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,182
Thank you.

774
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,145
LEE HONG-RAN
HOPE OBGYN CLINIC

775
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,980
"Lee Hong-ran"?

776
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,273
Do you know me?

777
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,290
What's wrong with me?

778
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,626
I was delusional and made things awkward.

779
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,004
Right. I can't avoid him forever.

780
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,966
Next time we meet,
I'll greet him as usual.

781
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,884
Okay. I can do it.

782
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:10,802
I can--

783
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,304
No, I can't.

784
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,775
Gosh, I'm late.

785
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,403
Hey, Ha-neul.

786
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,745
Why won't you keep your word?
You said things wouldn't get awkward.

787
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,956
Well, you see…

788
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,963
I want to act like everything's fine,
but I can't help but feel humiliated.

789
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:54,053
I don't have many friends,
so I don't know where the line is.

790
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,765
I can't tell what friendship is from love.

791
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,645
So I'm mortified that I misunderstood you
and made a fool of myself.

792
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,818
Ha-neul.

793
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,572
The reason why

794
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,117
I can't be totally open right now…

795
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,248
is because I have no right to do so.

796
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,128
So you shouldn't be mortified.

797
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,175
Make way! It's an emergency!

798
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,260
Excuse me! Passing through!

799
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,566
He fell down the stairs.

800
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,902
He hurt his head pretty badly. Oh, no.

801
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,279
I hope he's okay.

802
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:37,031
We haven't seen
much improvement since last time.

803
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,078
It won't happen overnight,
so let's take the treatments slowly.

804
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,330
You're doing great so far.

805
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:46,874
Okay.

806
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,376
Right.

807
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:54,382
After that truck incident, have there been
any notable changes in your life?

808
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,510
For example, you keep dreaming
about the accident.

809
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,388
Or you're on high alert
and feel tense every day.

810
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,974
Thankfully, I don't have such symptoms.

811
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:04,642
That's a relief.

812
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:10,732
Developing PTSD after going through
a big accident is quite common.

813
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,817
For example, a car accident or a fall.

814
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,445
I'm sure you're familiar
as a doctor yourself,

815
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,572
but a medical accident could--

816
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,073
-A medical accident?
-Yes.

817
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:24,996
Many doctors who've been involved
in medical accidents often develop PTSD.

818
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:29,626
They have trouble breathing
or turn pale when they step into the OR.

819
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,378
Their hands tremble
when holding surgical instruments.

820
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,963
And seeing blood bothers them.

821
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,925
They still can't move on
from those incidents.

822
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,344
I see.

823
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:02,075
The reason why
I can't be totally open right now…

824
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,371
is because I have no right to do so.

825
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,979
I have nightmares every now and then.

826
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,898
In those nightmares,

827
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,527
I try everything I can
to save the patient.

828
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,405
But in my dreams,

829
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,741
she always dies.

830
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:30,121
I would go back
to that incident every time.

831
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:36,043
And I'd resent and blame myself
for failing to save the patient.

832
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,381
You shouldn't be happy right now.

833
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,512
Perhaps I've felt
the same way deep down inside…

834
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,726
so that's why his words hurt even more.

835
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,111
So…

836
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,619
HWABON

837
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:15,082
How could I possibly
be of any comfort to anyone?

838
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,545
Is it right for me…

839
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,758
to worry about someone else?

840
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,810
How could I…

841
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,279
Ha-neul, what's wrong?

842
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,503
What's the matter?

843
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,548
It must've been so hard.

844
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,804
It's okay.

845
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,015
It'll all be okay.

846
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,482
I felt his pain…

847
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,153
as if it was my own.

848
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,447
And I felt his sadness…

849
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:33,244
come over both of us in that moment.

850
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:38,666
Ha-neul.

851
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,718
I have no right to be happy.

852
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,471
But just a moment ago…

853
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,809
I missed you.

854
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,723
DOCTOR SLUMP

855
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,517
I'm only able to
stay strong thanks to you.

856
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,937
It's much stronger than just friendship.

857
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,482
But it's too early to say
I have feelings for you.

858
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,069
You're like a drug
someone prescribed for me.

859
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,782
What in the world? Did you think
that would make me swoon?

860
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,327
We also searched your entire clinic,
but we didn't find any other cameras.

861
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,079
Jeong-woo. How have you been?

862
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:02,124
My brother said he saw a man
follow you to the rooftop.

863
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,835
Who are you?
Why have you been following me?

864
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:15,680
