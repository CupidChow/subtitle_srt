00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,036
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,474
-Hey, Dae-yeong.
-Hey, what's up?

3
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,975
Nothing much.

4
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,394
I just saw I got paid.

5
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,565
What's wrong? Were you underpaid?
I'm sure the right amount was deposited.

6
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,067
That's not why I called.

7
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,528
I just wanted to buy you a drink
with my first paycheck.

8
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,198
Come on out. Let's grab a drink.

9
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,242
Hey, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,453
I just ate, so I'm really full.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,582
I'm at my parents' house,
and their braised short ribs were so good.

12
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,502
So I had two bowls of rice.

13
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,004
So you can't come out right now?

14
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,423
No, I have a few things to read up on.

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,425
I'm a bit busy right now.

16
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,345
I was looking forward to spending
my first paycheck in a while.

17
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,806
-How could you?
-Hey, I'm sadder than you are.

18
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,891
Are you free this weekend?

19
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,852
My mom and Jin-woo will visit
my aunt on Geoje Island.

20
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,939
I'll be free all weekend.
How about we drink all night?

21
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,441
I'm not sure.
I think I'll be seeing Jeong-woo.

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,278
But you see him at home
and are always together at work.

23
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,988
We have to avoid each other at work.

24
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,157
Our colleagues don't know we're dating.

25
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,243
Oh, my. Are you dating in secret?

26
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,203
That sounds so fun.

27
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,998
Rather than fun, I just feel happy.

28
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,417
I don't ever want to leave her side.

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,920
We see each other
in the office and the OR.

30
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:13,299
We go to work and come home together.
This must be why people date.

31
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,261
I have reasons to live. I'm full of life.

32
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:20,181
Pay my gas and water bills then
if you're going to continue to bore me.

33
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,685
Right.

34
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,980
I should keep playing dumb
about you two at work, right?

35
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,107
Ha-neul wants it that way.

36
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,860
She does?

37
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,486
Why?

38
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,822
Is she embarrassed by you?

39
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,657
I'm just being careful.

40
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,870
People might feel uncomfortable
because of us.

41
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,914
Right. It's better to be careful.

42
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,210
Anyway, good luck
with your secret relationship.

43
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,628
It must be nice.

44
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,464
If you're jealous, start dating.

45
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,758
-With who?
-That's for you to find out.

46
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,094
Forget it. Let's drink this weekend.

47
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,972
-I'll think about it.
-See you tomorrow at the clinic.

48
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,814
I was on the phone for so long
that the tea went cold.

49
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,024
That's okay.

50
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,901
I love it.

51
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,197
I meant I like cold tea.

52
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,659
Okay. I didn't say anything.

53
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,995
Why are you trembling?

54
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,711
Let me pour you a cup.

55
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,629
Okay.

56
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:46,100
DOCTOR SLUMP

57
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,954
What are you up to, Ha-neul?

58
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,499
I'm on my way home
after withdrawing some money.

59
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,126
Yeah. I want to give your mother
some pocket money.

60
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,171
What? Why would you give her money?

61
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,715
I've received so much from her already.

62
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,511
I wanted to repay her
with my first paycheck.

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,595
But you know what?

64
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,847
It feels a bit strange.

65
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,060
-What does?
-I've always made money.

66
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,437
But this time, it feels special.

67
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,816
Right. The same goes for me.

68
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,487
By the way, do you have
anything to give me?

69
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,322
For you…

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,034
-I want you to give me something instead.
-What?

71
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,955
You were probably paid too.
Buy me something.

72
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,834
Hey, I didn't get much
since I got paid per surgery.

73
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,586
You make much more than I do.
So you buy it.

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,090
No, you buy me something first.

75
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,216
Why--

76
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,554
All right.

77
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,181
Let's play rock, paper, scissors
and decide tomorrow.

78
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,933
Okay.

79
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,060
Okay, good night. See you tomorrow.

80
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,812
Bye.

81
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,655
Damn it!

82
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,870
You startled me. I thought…

83
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,290
Did you just close up?
Were you helping him?

84
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,877
That's none of your business.
You need to come with us.

85
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,504
To where?

86
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,132
-You'll see.
-Wait, what's wrong?

87
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,133
What's this about?

88
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,302
I want to go home!

89
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,262
Wait! What is it?

90
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,353
Why did you suddenly bring me here though?

91
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,940
There's something important to discuss.

92
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,860
Jeong-woo, I heard
you and Ha-neul are official now.

93
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:05,031
Right. That's right, Uncle Tae-seon.

94
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,784
I'm not just an uncle.

95
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,661
After my brother-in-law died,
my one and only sister

96
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,914
decided to sell her factory
and move to Seoul.

97
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,583
I immediately closed my restaurant
and followed her here.

98
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,709
Do you know why?

99
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,630
I knew what a dangerous place
Seoul could be,

100
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,466
so I couldn't let
the three of them go alone.

101
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,259
-I see.
-Really?

102
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,554
Wasn't it because milmyeon would be
more unique here than in Busan--

103
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,142
Anyway, I care deeply about my family.

104
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,271
I may be her uncle,
but I'm also a father figure to Ha-neul.

105
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,272
I'm aware of that.

106
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,526
Then, as her father figure,
can I ask you a few things?

107
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,111
Of course.

108
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,073
-What's your height and weight?
-I'm 183 cm tall and weigh 68 kg.

109
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,492
We're pretty similar.

110
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,744
You're not battling any diseases, are you?

111
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,498
-No, not at all.
-What does your father do?

112
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,126
He's a cardiothoracic surgeon,
and so is my mother.

113
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,254
-They're both doctors?
-Yes.

114
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,590
You better not look down
on Ha-neul because of that.

115
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,425
That will never happen.

116
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,344
-And--
-Did you pay off all your debts?

117
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,014
Ba-da, that's a rude question.

118
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,725
Only someone ignorant like me can ask it.

119
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,310
I know you were dying to know.

120
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,814
Jeong-woo, it's true that we like you.

121
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,151
But we don't want Ha-neul to suffer,
so I'll step up and ask.

122
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,404
Does she need
to help you out with your debt?

123
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,573
Not at all.

124
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,200
That won't happen.

125
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,163
I have a bit left, but if I keep working,
I think I can pay it all off by next year.

126
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,247
I see.

127
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,206
Yes.

128
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,710
But you're innocent, so can't they
give you back the penalties you paid?

129
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,797
Well, I'll only know
once I file a lawsuit.

130
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,383
But I'm too exhausted to do that.

131
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,304
I understand. It must be so draining
to file lawsuits and attend hearings.

132
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,513
Have a drink first.

133
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,939
Anyway, we brought you here

134
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,735
to ask you to take care of Ha-neul.

135
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,614
You two should get along,
and you should find peace again.

136
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,240
Thank you.

137
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,658
Cheers.

138
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,629
Drink up.

139
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,967
Don't you dare stop drinking. Cheers!

140
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,434
Gosh, the ground is like gelatin.
I'm dying here.

141
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,103
Are you okay, Jeong-woo?

142
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,271
Yes, I am.

143
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,815
Jeong-woo.

144
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,901
Please treat Ha-neul well.

145
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,529
Yes, sir. I'll treat her well!

146
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,614
Don't just treat her well.

147
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,617
You have to treat her super well.

148
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,079
Right. I'll treat her super well!

149
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,872
Then,

150
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,667
can you buy her a squirrel plushie?

151
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,210
What?

152
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,253
That's right.

153
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,339
She had this plushie,
but its head ripped open. It was brown.

154
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,052
-It looked like this. Like this.
-Like this?

155
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,513
Can you buy her something similar?

156
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,515
Of course!

157
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,103
I will buy it right now.

158
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,187
All right.

159
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,438
Oh, dear.

160
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,442
Goodness, you're a go-getter.

161
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,069
You bought one immediately.

162
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,283
I've never been a procrastinator.

163
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,742
Then,

164
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,704
can you buy Ha-neul some hotteok?

165
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,540
Stop asking him to buy things.

166
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,709
She loves hotteok.

167
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,335
Hey.

168
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,005
I have enough money to buy those.

169
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,006
Gosh.

170
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,217
Three thousand won. No.

171
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,303
I can even spend 5,000 won.

172
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,515
All right.

173
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,684
Hello.

174
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,060
Hello, ma'am.

175
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,771
-I'd like 5,000 won worth of hotteok.
-Sure.

176
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,608
What about you guys?

177
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,568
Care to have some?

178
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:11,986
-Sure.
-I'm down.

179
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,070
All right.

180
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,656
We'll each have one too.

181
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,868
Okay. You can use those cups.

182
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,785
I see.

183
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,830
It's nice and warm.

184
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,168
It tastes best when it's still hot.

185
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,127
Gosh, that's hot.

186
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,212
-You too, Ba-da.
-It's hot.

187
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,715
Eat it while it's still hot.

188
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,758
Thank you.

189
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:47,063
By the way, what if Ha-neul
gets mad at me for being drunk?

190
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,648
I think she'll scold me a lot.

191
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,149
Don't worry about it.

192
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,735
Men can get drunk every now and then.

193
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,445
Don't be scared of her.

194
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,156
She better not yell at you.

195
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,824
I won't sit still if she does.

196
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,911
I knew it.

197
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,912
Jeong-woo.

198
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,539
The three of us are one.

199
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,500
-One!
-Yes.

200
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,002
Here's your food.

201
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,754
-Thank you.
-No problem.

202
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,297
I need to pay.

203
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,757
Hold this for a second.

204
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,967
-You ate three as well.
-Can you hold this?

205
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:17,927
That'll be 8,000.

206
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,053
-Eight thousand?
-Yes.

207
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,846
All right. Let's see.

208
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,643
Here you go.

209
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,271
Here's your change.

210
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,148
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

211
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,943
Let's go.

212
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,736
Okay, let's go.

213
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,571
-Let's go, buddy!
-Good night.

214
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,156
Good night.

215
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,282
I…

216
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,370
No!

217
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,080
I saved the hotteok.

218
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,090
FAMOUS FATHER AND SONS' DRIED SEAWEED

219
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,519
Morning, Jeong-woo.

220
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,693
You should've ate more quietly
so he could sleep.

221
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,319
What do you mean. He has work today.

222
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,281
Why did you drink so much?

223
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,741
-I didn't want to drink so much.
-Was it you?

224
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,327
Did you bully my future son-in-law?

225
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,287
Then, was it you?

226
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,997
Did you force him to drink?

227
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,249
No, he chose to drink.

228
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,294
I really tried to stop him.

229
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,422
Exactly. Once he drank, he got on a roll.

230
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,383
He was so determined to drink,
and we couldn't stop him.

231
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,678
-But yesterday, we said--
-Right! I almost forgot.

232
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,181
He withdrew some money for you, Wol-seon.

233
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,725
Look at how thick this is.

234
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,685
He's so loyal. You want to give it to her?

235
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,978
Let me explain--

236
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,688
Jeong-woo, try this.

237
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,816
It's really delicious.
It's so good with rice.

238
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,943
This dried seaweed's really good.

239
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,320
It really is.

240
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,696
Come and eat.

241
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,448
Hurry up and eat.

242
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,492
But…

243
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,545
It's not like you to drive to work.

244
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,591
I'm only doing this for your sake.
You must have a hangover.

245
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,136
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,516
I'll just confess everything.

247
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,521
Usually, men stay quiet to protect
their brotherhood in these situations.

248
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,189
But I'll just tell you.

249
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,317
And what matters the most to me
is how you think of me.

250
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,527
What?

251
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,488
Ba-da and your uncle
dragged me away to the bar yesterday.

252
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,406
I was pretty much kidnapped.

253
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,325
Then, they kept forcing me
to chug alcohol.

254
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,993
I really didn't want to drink a lot,

255
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,288
but I couldn't
because they kept making me drink.

256
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,582
They filled my glass
every time I finished.

257
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,043
Even in that situation,

258
00:13:56,126 --> 00:14:00,589
I was worried you'd be upset
with me for being drunk.

259
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,007
But guess what they said?

260
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,219
They said they wouldn't sit still
if you scolded me.

261
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,472
They said we were one.
But did you see them? They betrayed me.

262
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,849
What did you say?

263
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,685
-Damn it.
-Hey!

264
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,814
Hey.

265
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,023
What are you doing?

266
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,901
Don't tell me we're going back home.

267
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,862
Because of me?
Gosh, why would you do that?

268
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,281
What are you going say to them?

269
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,783
What do you mean? I'm taking a shortcut.

270
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,827
And there's no point in blaming them.

271
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,289
You were the one who drank
and failed to be responsible.

272
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,208
You should take care
of yourself from now on, okay?

273
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,462
Why are you smiling?

274
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,840
Your gaze is full of love,

275
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,675
but your words are so cold.

276
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,469
It makes me swoon
even when you're scolding me.

277
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,099
What are you saying? You must be crazy.

278
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,020
You do look like a squirrel
when you smile.

279
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,521
So that's why you liked it.

280
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,480
What do you mean?

281
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,566
They told me the story yesterday

282
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,818
about that squirrel plushie you adored.

283
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,614
You cried for days because your mom
threw it away without telling you.

284
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,408
You must've really loved it
if you cried in middle school.

285
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,828
-Is that how they remember it?
-Yes.

286
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,081
-I didn't cry because of the plushie.
-Then?

287
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,834
Actually, it was the day
of a field trip back then.

288
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,046
But I didn't want
to waste my time on that trip,

289
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,590
so I lied about being sick
and stayed home to study.

290
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,010
But I suddenly felt sad
and used the plushie as an excuse.

291
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,473
You should've just gone
on that field trip.

292
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,516
I know.

293
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,060
I regret it now.

294
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,272
I should've taken the chance
to enjoy such things, but I never went.

295
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,902
You've never gone on a field trip?

296
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,612
Not even once?

297
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,324
Well…

298
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,203
What?

299
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,465
-Did you wait long?
-No.

300
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,258
Thanks.

301
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,304
Did you get home safe yesterday?

302
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:17,935
Yes. Thank you for the meal
and the tea. Thank you for everything.

303
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,730
I should be thanking you. You built
a mini playground in our living room.

304
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm all done.

305
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,160
Thank you so much.

306
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,914
You brought it all the way here
and even assembled it.

307
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,957
I really owe you.

308
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,544
It was my pleasure. I remembered
my sister wanted to throw this away.

309
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,797
I spared her the trouble
and also got Jin-woo a gift.

310
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,257
Everyone's happy now.

311
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,384
And I got to have a delicious meal.

312
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,555
My mom just happened
to send me some side dishes.

313
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,933
I haven't had a decent meal
like that in a while.

314
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,935
Call me over again
when she sends you more.

315
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,521
Why are you so intent
on coming to my house?

316
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,357
That's not what I meant.

317
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,110
I should get going then.

318
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,239
That's mine!

319
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,033
Goodness.

320
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,994
This is a name brand.
No wonder why it felt nice.

321
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,620
Gosh, you're so silly.

322
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,289
Good night.

323
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,874
Gosh.

324
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,712
You didn't have to walk me out.

325
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,174
I had something to buy
at the convenience store anyway.

326
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,261
Right. Did you raise
Eun-jeong's allowance?

327
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,848
Yes, I'm giving her 50,000 won more
just like you advised.

328
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,850
Well done.

329
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,936
She probably has many things to buy
but can't tell you about,

330
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,648
such as underwear, makeup,
and feminine care products.

331
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,649
You're right.

332
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,359
I had no idea.

333
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,029
By the way,

334
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,281
I'd like to see Jin-woo again.

335
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,702
Let's meet up at a park
on a weekend and catch some insects.

336
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,497
-Is he good at soccer?
-I'm not sure.

337
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,706
We've never really tried.

338
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,793
We haven't spent much time playing sports.

339
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,630
I haven't taught him how to ride
a bicycle yet since I can't either.

340
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,299
Then, would you like me to teach you?

341
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,258
What?

342
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,761
I could just teach Jin-woo.

343
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,640
But if you want to ride with him,
I think you should learn too.

344
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:25,062
And it'd be better for him emotionally
if his mother taught him.

345
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,483
How about we give each other
three SOS stickers then?

346
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,401
"SOS stickers"?

347
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,445
Here they are.

348
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,073
Okay.

349
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,991
We'll each get three.

350
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,620
We'll use them
when we need each other's help.

351
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,540
For example?

352
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,584
I'll need them when I learn how to ride
a bicycle or catch insects.

353
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,962
You'll need them
when you buy Eun-jeong gifts

354
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,297
or if she needs to see an OBGYN.

355
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,966
There are many things to help with.

356
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:54,883
I see.

357
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,011
I'll put them to good use then.

358
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,472
Oh, my gosh! I have butterflies.

359
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,561
So this is why people
like waiting for deliveries.

360
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,104
They're excited to open them.

361
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,150
You had them sent to the clinic?
What did you order?

362
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,277
They're for you. You wanted a gift.

363
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,904
They're both for you.

364
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,700
You didn't have to get me two gifts.

365
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,786
I'll open the bigger one first!

366
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,454
All right.

367
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,461
Nice!

368
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,092
I wonder what's inside.

369
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,809
"History of Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgery"?

370
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,728
Yes, and it's the original copy.

371
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,273
I searched every used book site
and there was one left. Looks fun, right?

372
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,233
Yeah.

373
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,028
Open this one now.
You'll like this even more.

374
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,863
"Even more"?

375
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,823
Okay. I can't wait.

376
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,666
So? Do you like it?

377
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,220
Her nasal envelope looks good,
so let's just replace the silicone.

378
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,890
Open a D30 silicone.

379
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,017
Opening a D30 silicone.

380
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,689
Please hurry.

381
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:35,984
Let's focus.

382
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,778
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,908
It looked like a tricky procedure.
Good job.

384
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,370
See? It suits you.

385
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,163
You should always wear that from now on.

386
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,832
Also, finish that book
by the end of the week

387
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,709
and tell me your thoughts on it.

388
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,965
I have to tell you my thoughts
on the book and wear this puppy cap.

389
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,717
-Did I do something wrong?
-What?

390
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,220
You're not taking revenge
by disguising them as gifts, right?

391
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,180
They feel like punishments.

392
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,433
-Fine. Give it back. You're so ungrateful.
-I'm just joking.

393
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,643
I love them.

394
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,980
How did you know
they're just what I wanted?

395
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,233
That's rich coming from someone
who gave me a plushie and hotteok.

396
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:20,320
I was drunk when I bought those.
I have a separate gift for you.

397
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,156
-Really?
-Of course.

398
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,369
Where is it? Over there?

399
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,372
You'll never find it there.

400
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,165
Really? Then, is it over here?

401
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,211
Follow me.

402
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,550
What? A field trip?

403
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,011
Yeah. You've never gone on one.

404
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:44,970
Let me take you.

405
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,431
We're too old for field trips.

406
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,643
No, we're not. We can visit a museum
and go camping at night.

407
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,980
I'll show you that adults
can go on field trips too.

408
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,441
Well, it does sound like fun.

409
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,943
Right? Then, we'll leave tomorrow.

410
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,528
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

411
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,322
I promised to see Hong-ran this weekend.

412
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,575
You can see her next time though.

413
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,618
If you pass again on this opportunity,

414
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,788
you may never have
another chance to go on a field trip.

415
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,290
Isn't that terrifying?

416
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,251
First, let's go shopping.

417
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,753
What? Shopping?

418
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,881
Yeah. You usually wear
new clothes on a field trip.

419
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:21,798
Didn't you know?

420
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,800
I'm going to teach you everything.
Let's go.

421
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,928
Wait, hold on. Your bag.

422
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,598
-Don't you need your bag?
-I can take it later.

423
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,938
-What about these?
-Dresses?

424
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,068
-They look like beachwear.
-Then, we can go to the beach.

425
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,611
But it's a field trip.

426
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,532
You look good in both.

427
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,576
No, I want something more comfortable.

428
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,455
-Then, how about this one?
-Stop it!

429
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,541
What's wrong? I think it'll look nice.

430
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,126
No, it looks like a nightgown.

431
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,464
-We're going here.
-Gosh, it's pretty.

432
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,549
Right? There's this kind of stuff too.

433
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,384
-There's a show too.
-That's right.

434
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,303
It looks like fun.

435
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,639
Thank you for looking this up.

436
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,516
And…

437
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,688
-Have you been sleep well lately?
-Yeah.

438
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,857
I don't depend on sleeping pills anymore.

439
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,567
I'm glad.

440
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:28,115
Have you been taking sleeping pills
since high school too?

441
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,618
Yeah, since senior year.

442
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,662
Strangely enough,

443
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,249
and maybe it was due to anxiety,
but I couldn't sleep well.

444
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,549
Jeong-woo. I gave it some thought.

445
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,676
Okay.

446
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:53,682
I think it's possible that Kyung-min
spiked your drink with Ambien.

447
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,061
I've been reading
some dissertations lately.

448
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,482
And many cases showed
that mixing alcohol and Ambien

449
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,569
produced pretty serious
and dangerous results.

450
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,487
So…

451
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,409
Maybe that's what he was aiming for.

452
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,326
Ha-neul.

453
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,123
I like how things are right now.

454
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,420
When I got drunk
with your uncle and Ba-da yesterday,

455
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,424
my head was spinning
and my fingers were numb.

456
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:33,597
But that stroll at night I took
with your plushie and snack in hand

457
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,975
made me really happy.

458
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,731
And when I woke up the next day,
I had my own seat at your table.

459
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,317
Then, you scolded me on our way to work.

460
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,319
And now,

461
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,199
we're sitting here as we have
some refreshing coffee after work.

462
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,160
I love it.

463
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,164
So…

464
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,250
I hope this peace

465
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,213
will continue to last.

466
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,131
For now.

467
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:13,970
Okay.

468
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,644
I like drinking coffee with you too.

469
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,398
I like it even more.

470
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,179
-Jeong-woo, I'm here.
-Come on in.

471
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,432
All right.

472
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,018
What's with the kimbap?

473
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,064
All right. Field trips and kimbap

474
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,857
go hand in hand.

475
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,028
We could've just bought them.

476
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,029
Of course not.

477
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,533
They're not the same.
I put my heart into making these.

478
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,077
Have a bite.

479
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,001
It's really good.

480
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,752
You're a good cook.

481
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,965
Would I be hitting the jackpot
if I took you off the market?

482
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,175
You better do so before someone else does.

483
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,058
Gosh, we're wearing new clothes,

484
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,645
we made kimbap, and we're on a bus.
It really feels like a field trip.

485
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,481
And they say this is where
the popular kids sit.

486
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,191
It makes me feel special.

487
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,860
Hey, you already are special.

488
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,320
Right now,

489
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,448
you're the prettiest girl in this class.

490
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,534
"In this class"?

491
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,580
From now on, think of everyone here
as if they're our classmates.

492
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,249
Then, this field trip will feel
even more realistic.

493
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,667
I see. Okay.

494
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,585
That's it.

495
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,340
But our classmates seem pretty tired.
They all fell asleep right away.

496
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,052
You're right. They must be tired
from studying all night.

497
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,720
I guess so.

498
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,221
Sleep tight, guys.

499
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,059
-We're going to have some fun.
-I'm so excited.

500
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,979
I'm loving the view.

501
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,731
Me too.

502
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,815
It's beautiful.

503
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,984
Oh, no.

504
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,903
-My goodness.
-The road is so bumpy.

505
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,864
I'm so tired from studying last night.

506
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,199
Right? Take a nap.

507
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,088
It's the same here.
Do you see those students?

508
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,841
Think of them as our classmates.
It'll help you get into character.

509
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,763
I'm afraid it won't.
They're so young. I feel guilty about it.

510
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,015
It's okay. We look young.

511
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,311
Gosh, we're falling behind. Let's go.

512
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,656
We need to get to our next location
before sunset to take nice photos.

513
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,410
Right. You wanted to take photos.
But what kind of photos?

514
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,959
We didn't have to wear uniforms.

515
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,921
We're on a field trip. I thought
it'd be nice to take photos in them.

516
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,260
Doesn't it feel
like we've gone back in time?

517
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,554
Then, we need to be more in character.

518
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,471
What?

519
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,808
-Get lost.
-Are you talking to me?

520
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,477
Can't you see I'm studying?
I said get lost.

521
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,856
How could you say something so harsh?

522
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,441
I'll go on ahead.

523
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,402
VINTAGE SCHOOL UNIFORMS FOR RENT

524
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,903
What's with her?

525
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,405
Stop right there!

526
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,198
You know I hate coming in second!

527
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,283
Hey, Ha-neul!

528
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,750
Let me see.

529
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,334
Nice, right?

530
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,588
You're looking great.

531
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:42,197
I can't believe she's even studying
when we're taking our graduation photos.

532
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,156
-What?
-What?

533
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,949
Were you staring at Ha-neul again?

534
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,577
You just can't take
your eyes off of her, can you?

535
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,370
You might as well go out with her.

536
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,830
Yeah, since you've come this far…

537
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:55,418
-Date! We hope you go out with her!
-Date! We hope you go out with her!

538
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,879
Give it a rest.

539
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,632
Hey, why would I ever go out with her?

540
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,884
Let's be honest.
Who could put up with her temper?

541
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:08,556
I truly feel bad for whoever
her future boyfriend will be.

542
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,142
Okay, the second group can go.
The third group is next.

543
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,060
Hurry up.

544
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,814
Hurry up and sit down. Who's talking?

545
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,731
It's Jeong-woo!

546
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,108
-Jeong-woo, look handsome.
-Yes, sir.

547
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,443
-I'm sorry.
-Mu-geun.

548
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,947
Come forward. Standing in the back
won't make your face look smaller.

549
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,115
Relax your shoulders. That's good.

550
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,160
Ha-neul, put the book down and look here.

551
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,495
I want you all to smile.

552
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,496
-Smile.
-Smile.

553
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,748
Give me a big smile. That's nice!

554
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,835
YEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

555
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,008
We look so similar
to how we looked back then.

556
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:44,926
You're right.

557
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,887
I can't believe this.

558
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,641
I never thought I would end up
as your future boyfriend.

559
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,310
So? You don't want to?

560
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,813
What do you mean? I'm thrilled about it.

561
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,691
If I could go back in time,

562
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,110
I'd give myself a good beating
for being harsh on you.

563
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,194
Why was I like that?

564
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,822
When did you take this photo?

565
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,408
I was preparing for our trip yesterday

566
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,618
and thought of you
when you were a student.

567
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,121
So I looked at our yearbook.

568
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:18,501
When I saw you holding
your vocabulary book even in the picture,

569
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,962
you looked so cute.

570
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,423
But I also felt bad for you.

571
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,017
I feel bad for you even more right now.
Are you that hungry?

572
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,353
Yeah. Let's grill some meat.

573
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,856
Well…

574
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,902
-What should we do?
-What's wrong?

575
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,279
Did you forget to bring it?

576
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,280
No, that's not it.

577
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,408
Someone was supposed to bring it,
but they're not here yet.

578
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,368
They're not here yet? Who?

579
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,328
Hey, Ha-neul.

580
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,416
What? What are you two doing here?

581
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,710
Your boyfriend called yesterday.

582
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,838
He asked if I could see you here
instead this weekend.

583
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,257
-He wanted it to be a surprise.
-Really?

584
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,259
Oh, my gosh.

585
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,430
Field trips are more fun
when your friends are there.

586
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,224
But why are you here?

587
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,769
You think I wanted to
join your lovely trip?

588
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,938
But Hong-ran used an SOS sticker…

589
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:21,856
An SOS sticker?

590
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,526
We agreed to help each other out
as single parents.

591
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,404
I still haven't taught my son
how to ride a bicycle yet,

592
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,740
and I heard this was
a great spot for that.

593
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,825
Were you two always that close?

594
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,619
We recently went to buy bras together--

595
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,245
What? Buy what?

596
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,289
Well, what happened was…

597
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,916
I went to her house--

598
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,751
You went to her house?

599
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,087
It's a long story.

600
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,588
Aren't you hungry?

601
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,090
-Yes, I am!
-Let's have some meat!

602
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,633
Let's grill it.

603
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,010
-This is--
-That's lettuce. Hold on.

604
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,387
Let's go wash it.

605
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,888
Okay? Let's go wash the lettuce.

606
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,181
-This is strange.
-Hurry.

607
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,350
How did you guys get so close?

608
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,644
Why are you so close? What could it be?

609
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,656
A field trip for the two of you.

610
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,785
It's ridiculous yet sweet,
and sweet yet ridiculous.

611
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,705
Forget that. Explain it to me.
What's going on between you two?

612
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,124
I told you.
We're just helping each other out.

613
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,710
-He's teaching me how to ride a bike.
-Is that so?

614
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,463
You could ride bikes anywhere
in Seoul, but you came here?

615
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,174
I actually came to have
a drink with you. Okay?

616
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,718
It's so hard to see you these days.

617
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,721
I felt awkward about being a third wheel,

618
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,432
so I asked Dr. Bin to come with me. Okay?

619
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,477
It's not okay. I'll keep an eye on you two
and see if anything's going on.

620
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,690
Hey! You didn't wash all the lettuce.

621
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,776
You're acting strange.
You're being very suspicious!

622
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,446
Hong-ran, do you like oil or ssamjang?

623
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,406
-Meat goes best with ssamjang.
-Ssamjang?

624
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,825
That looks good.

625
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,660
We'd like some too.

626
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,245
Here's your meat.

627
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,124
Thank you. Here you go.

628
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,211
It's good.

629
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,713
It's delicious.

630
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,103
You have similar appetites
and drink alcohol the same way too.

631
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,772
You were in sync like a K-pop group.

632
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,191
-Totally.
-Who's the leader?

633
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,736
By the way,
how did you two become friends?

634
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,072
Ha-neul's not the type who makes friends.

635
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,532
I was the one who latched onto her.

636
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,953
We were surrounded by people
who enjoyed drama and gossiping.

637
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,582
So it was nice to see someone
work hard and mind their own business.

638
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,918
Right.

639
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,921
I am a person
who's calm and always the same.

640
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,339
Of course.

641
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,716
Simply put, you're the genuine type.

642
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,426
Come on.

643
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,476
Then, how did you two get so close?

644
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,435
What?

645
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,687
Right. You said
you once had a falling-out.

646
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,605
What was it?

647
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,899
That…

648
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,652
It wasn't anything serious.

649
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,947
Guys sometimes get into arguments.

650
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,989
That's right.

651
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,284
What is it? Why are you stuttering?

652
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,120
It must've been something significant.

653
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,747
Just say it.

654
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,085
To be honest,

655
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,296
we used to be best friends.

656
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:38,136
No one else was
more dear to us than each other.

657
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,727
SEPTEMBER 2013

658
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:51,357
Jeong-woo was like a younger brother,
a friend, and an older brother to me.

659
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,696
Do you remember the four criteria
for DKA I taught you yesterday?

660
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:00,408
And how do you categorize moderate DKA?

661
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,788
Hello?

662
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,331
Dae-yeong.

663
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,334
Come on.

664
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,589
Okay, how do you categorize moderate DKA?

665
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,800
I need to sleep before I categorize.

666
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,804
Don't be ridiculous.
The medical license exam is next week.

667
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,724
Dae-yeong. Wasn't it your dream
to make rounds

668
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,727
with a white lab coat on
and a bunch of interns around you?

669
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,646
-Yeah.
-Right?

670
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,524
Dae-yeong, you can do it.

671
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,442
-Right.
-Yeah.

672
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,237
If Jeong-woo hadn't comforted
and encouraged me,

673
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,031
I might've never become a doctor.

674
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,581
Jeong-woo!

675
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,834
What? Who are you?

676
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,170
I'm a doctor too now.

677
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,713
What?

678
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,131
I passed the exam!

679
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,217
-Seriously?
-Yes!

680
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,345
Good job!

681
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,013
Jeong-woo!

682
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,267
I loved Jeong-woo with all my heart.

683
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,728
I mean, I cared about him a lot.

684
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,843
Hang in there.

685
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,521
You can do it.

686
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,899
But bittersweet like coffee,
fate was cruel

687
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,944
and our happiness didn't last long.

688
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,197
The professor is here.

689
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,284
-Hello, sir.
-Take a seat, everyone.

690
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,868
Okay.

691
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,122
And we have good news.

692
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,417
For working hard
to study for and take the exam,

693
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,004
he's granted all of us
a one-week vacation!

694
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,963
A round of applause!

695
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,635
You can take turns
and go on your vacations.

696
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,553
Thank you, sir.

697
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:31,434
And you know the Voluntary Medical Service
is going to Africa next month, right?

698
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,435
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

699
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,938
The hospital director wanted
the PS Department to join in as well.

700
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,858
If you don't have any plans
for your vacation,

701
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,568
then why don't you help out?

702
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,362
What is it?

703
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,698
What's with this vibe?

704
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,534
What? No one?

705
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,620
I'll go, sir.

706
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,706
All right.

707
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,083
I've always wanted
to try medical volunteering.

708
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,044
I'll make sure to be well prepared.

709
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,921
All right. That's great.

710
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,842
Are you sure about this, Dae-yeong?

711
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,262
You wanted to go on trips
and sleep in before joining the military.

712
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,722
That was my original plan.

713
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,641
But this feels like my only chance
to volunteer overseas.

714
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,603
Gosh, you're the best.

715
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,190
Dae-yeong!

716
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,240
Oh, my gosh.

717
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,119
So you couldn't go volunteer
because you hurt your hand?

718
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,204
That's right.

719
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,665
So Jeong-woo ended up going instead of me.

720
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,877
CHEER UP, DAE-YEONG
I'M SORRY

721
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,350
It doesn't hurt?

722
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:00,314
The documentary they filmed was a hit,
and Jeong-woo became a star doctor.

723
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,734
So you were supposed to be
that star doctor.

724
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,902
Goodness.

725
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,696
What are you talking about?
Are you drunk after just one can?

726
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,241
It sounds like Jeong-woo didn't push him.

727
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,494
Dae-yeong stepped on the plastic bag
and fell. Jeong-woo's innocent.

728
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,207
Also, even if Dae-yeong
had gone overseas to volunteer,

729
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,793
who knows if he would've become
a success like Jeong-woo?

730
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,962
I do.

731
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,298
Let's be honest. Mr. Bin is more handsome.

732
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,849
My goodness.

733
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,601
You're a total lightweight now.
You're drunk.

734
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,644
Wake up.

735
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,688
Go wash your face with cold water.

736
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,274
Look who's talking.
I know he's your boyfriend,

737
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,650
but you shouldn't be biased.

738
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,527
Are you kidding me? "Biased"?

739
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,323
It's obvious that Jeong-woo
is more handsome.

740
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,369
Please don't fight. You'll end up
ripping each other's hair out like we did.

741
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,788
You shouldn't do that.

742
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,042
You two ripped each other's hair out?

743
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,335
What?

744
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,132
No, we didn't.

745
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,177
We didn't rip any hair out.

746
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,471
We touched it.

747
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,223
That's right. We just slightly touched it.

748
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,767
You did rip each other's hair out.

749
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:23,272
What would make two grown men
fight and rip each other's hair out?

750
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,527
Then, listen close
and tell me whose fault it was.

751
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,285
Goodness.

752
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,579
Dr. Yeo.

753
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,664
-Yes?
-A TV network called you.

754
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,210
Here's the memo.

755
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,127
Thank you.

756
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,381
A reporter called for an interview
and said they'll call again.

757
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,299
Okay.

758
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,843
-We need to make our rounds.
-Right.

759
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,055
We'll be back.

760
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,056
-Bye.
-Okay.

761
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,397
With how things have changed, it's a bit…

762
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:06,941
A bit what?

763
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,151
I mean, it's just…

764
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,570
It's a bit overwhelming

765
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,822
and scary.

766
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,328
If you're scared,
ask the people to embrace you.

767
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,788
You're the "nation's doctor" now.

768
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,583
Jeez.

769
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,752
Right. I have a favor to ask.

770
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,214
For my next lecture, I need to
talk about endoscopic forehead lifts.

771
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,092
Can you help me look into more cases?

772
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,929
You're the "nation's doctor,"
so ask the nation for help.

773
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,728
What's with you? What's the problem?

774
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,647
Did you just spin my chair around?

775
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,857
Does this feel good to you?

776
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,070
Damn it. I only did it,
because you kept being sarcastic!

777
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,156
I had my reasons for being sarcastic!

778
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,033
Fine, forget it then!

779
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,535
Keep spinning!

780
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,869
Whatever!

781
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,289
Let's break up!

782
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,668
Hey, stop right there.

783
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,007
Did you just grab my hair?

784
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,010
Yeah, I did. So what?

785
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,764
Let go. If I count to three
and you don't, I won't sit still.

786
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,391
What are you going to do then?

787
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,144
One, two,

788
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,187
three!

789
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,232
Did you just grab my hair? Damn it!

790
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,819
Both hands? Damn you!

791
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,655
Let go!

792
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,656
You let go first!

793
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,829
That stings!

794
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,498
Damn it. You're dead meat!

795
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,563
Damn it!

796
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,608
You're dead meat!

797
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:41,887
Just…

798
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,598
go away!

799
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,365
What did I just hear?

800
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,326
-Where are you going?
-You're so childish.

801
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,329
Even Jin-woo
wouldn't fight like that, right?

802
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,587
I thought you'd be
in an awkward situation,

803
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,965
so I gave up my vacation
and canceled my plans

804
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,133
to go in your place.

805
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:24,054
But you grumbled and never greeted
or thanked me when I returned. I was hurt.

806
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,557
I'm sorry.

807
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:32,187
I admit I was jealous
and immature in the past.

808
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,232
But back then,

809
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,903
I was in a rough place mentally
after filing for divorce.

810
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,948
You know what I went through.

811
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,742
My in-laws looked down on me
because they were wealthy.

812
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,789
I had to pick up my father-in-law's calls
even in the middle of surgery.

813
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,750
I had to go play golf
with my mother-in-law on my off days

814
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,628
and tell her friends
what they needed to get done.

815
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,300
I couldn't take it anymore,
so I filed for divorce.

816
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,678
So when you became famous, I thought,

817
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,638
"That should've been me."

818
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,350
"My in-laws should've seen me
become so successful."

819
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,395
That's how I felt.

820
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,689
It was really painful.

821
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,276
I'm really sorry.

822
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,362
I had no clue.

823
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,741
No, I'm sorry.

824
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,242
It was my fault.

825
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,453
-No, it was my fault.
-No, it was…

826
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,580
Where did they go?

827
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,208
Did we do something wrong?

828
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,631
In all my life, I've never heard
of doctors fighting in the office

829
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,341
with stethoscopes.

830
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,884
Me neither.

831
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,387
But after hearing Dr. Bin,
you can empathize, right?

832
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,974
You like him, don't you?

833
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,102
I don't dislike him.

834
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:55,979
What? Seriously?

835
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,942
I don't know
if it's camaraderie or pity that I feel.

836
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,529
But I'm drawn to him more
than to any other men.

837
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,030
I feel bad for him too.

838
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,660
He looks like a deer in headlights,
which is kind of cute.

839
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,078
He's my type.

840
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,955
Is that so?

841
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,417
All right.
Good luck with the deer in headlights.

842
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:22,422
The sound of crickets and a deer
in headlights. What a good match.

843
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:24,883
Sorry.

844
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,889
So what about work? Are you going to
stay at Dae-yeong's clinic?

845
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:32,933
I'm not sure.

846
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,270
I gave it some thought.

847
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,439
About that bastard, Min Kyung-min.

848
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,609
His in-laws may own
a pharmaceutical company,

849
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,903
but he still could've been
a professor on the side.

850
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,781
He could've been a consultant
or an outside director.

851
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,533
But why did he quit?

852
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,412
He walked all over you
to become a professor,

853
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,414
so why did he quit after a few months?

854
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,792
There's a medical reporter I know.
Should I ask for help?

855
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,045
They could look into his company
and see what he's doing.

856
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,217
Who knows? Maybe you can be reinstated
if we have something on him.

857
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:13,265
Better yet, we could tell everyone
about how he stole your dissertation--

858
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,517
I like how things are right now, Hong-ran.

859
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,563
Jeong-woo makes me laugh a lot these days.

860
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,189
He drank with my mom during the day.

861
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,359
He bought hotteok after getting drunk
with my uncle and Ba-da.

862
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,361
Today, he took me on a field trip.

863
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,656
And I got to spend time with you too.

864
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,909
Looking back,

865
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,497
I think I really missed having
this kind of ordinary life.

866
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,626
In the past,

867
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,795
family, love, or people around me

868
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,548
weren't all that important to me.

869
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,218
But when I was struggling,

870
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,722
I was comforted
by the most ordinary of things.

871
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,141
You're right.

872
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,520
Living an ordinary life is the hardest
and most amazing thing to do.

873
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,483
Things have finally gotten better,

874
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,194
so I don't want to relive
those miserable moments.

875
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:13,450
I just want to enjoy
this small happiness for the time being.

876
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,455
Let's go.

877
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,501
All right.

878
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,629
-One more can?
-Sure.

879
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,839
Here.

880
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,385
How's Ha-neul doing?

881
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,345
Ha-neul?

882
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,554
-Yes.
-What is it?

883
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,683
I happened to overhear you two
on the rooftop last time.

884
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,726
About what Kyung-min did to her.

885
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,478
Right.

886
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,021
I told you this before,

887
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,733
but I was really worried
when your incident happened.

888
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,653
But Kyung-min was always by your side,

889
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,073
so I thought he'd be able to comfort you.

890
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,742
But damn. I had no idea who he truly was.

891
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,786
By the way,

892
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,455
he's not dependent

893
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,125
on drugs or anything, is he?

894
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,545
Drugs? What kind? Illegal drugs?

895
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,298
-Come on.
-It's just that I saw something.

896
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,136
-He used to carry around powder.
-What?

897
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,389
He used to buy me food too
whenever he visited you on his off days.

898
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,141
I think it was our fourth year.

899
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,102
I once bumped into him.

900
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,231
-Gosh.
-I'm sorry.

901
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,774
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

902
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,323
Gosh. I haven't seen
powder medicine in a while.

903
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,077
I can't swallow pills,
so I ask for powder.

904
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,037
-I see.
-Go on in.

905
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,122
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

906
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,959
I didn't think much of it back then.

907
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,669
But now that I think about it,

908
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,088
people doing drugs is not uncommon now.

909
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,257
What if it was cocaine?

910
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,425
You're right.

911
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,929
I've never seen him take pills before.

912
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,058
Gosh, why did that thought
never cross my mind?

913
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,143
What thought?

914
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,938
-I once saw him put powder in my drink.
-What?

915
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,734
They found Ambien in my blood.
But I can't be sure because I was drunk.

916
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,154
And I used to take
sleeping pills back then,

917
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,489
so it could've been that.

918
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:19,034
I wasn't sure about anything,
so I just let it go.

919
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,660
Wait, that's not the issue right now.

920
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:25,999
If that's true, why did he do that to you?
Why does he have a grudge against you?

921
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:26,958
I don't know.

922
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,419
But in any case,
here's what I want to know.

923
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,422
-Ambien's only sold as pills.
-Right.

924
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,675
But he turned it into powder,
so that means it was premeditated.

925
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:40,472
If he wanted to kill me, he could've used
pesticides or something more lethal.

926
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:43,350
But why Ambien?
I've always been curious about that.

927
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,313
But it all makes sense
if he had been carrying it for himself.

928
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,735
He could've spiked my drink impulsively.

929
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,710
What brings you here?

930
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,256
You need to keep your promise.

931
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,807
You were the first to find my cameras.

932
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:30,522
But you kept them for two days
without reporting them.

933
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,024
I asked you why you did that.

934
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,072
Sorry.

935
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,535
I just don't see why
I owe you an explanation.

936
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,414
You took my property
for two days without my consent.

937
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,877
So can't I be curious
about what you did with them?

938
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,961
Mr. Kang!

939
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,464
Watch what you say.

940
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,974
So? How was the trip?

941
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,934
Of course, it was super fun.

942
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,021
I'll write a report on it,
so better be excited.

943
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,111
-What is it? Is something worrying you?
-What?

944
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,364
You've looked a bit down since yesterday.

945
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,075
It's nothing.

946
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,788
I have a therapy appointment today.

947
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,458
I'll be back early, so let's eat together.

948
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,045
But you can eat first if you're hungry.

949
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,963
I'm pretty good at waiting.

950
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,381
Take your time.

951
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,559
Thank you for coming
such a long way with me.

952
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,228
You used your SOS sticker, so I had to.

953
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,189
Right. I need to give it to you.

954
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,363
I used one to learn how to ride a bicycle.

955
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:06,326
When should I use the rest?
I want to make good use of them.

956
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,623
How about taking Jin-woo to a bathhouse?

957
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,541
Kids love playing in water.

958
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,627
but boys over five can't join their moms,

959
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,921
so he hasn't been to one in ages.

960
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,174
Or how about camping with Jin-woo?

961
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,512
When will you use your stickers?

962
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:30,225
Can we just talk about us?

963
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,852
What?

964
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,855
Not about our friends or kids.

965
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm curious about you.

966
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,573
Let's talk about us next time.

967
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,162
How have you been?

968
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,292
We lowered your dosage. Did you have
any side effects or difficulties?

969
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,838
Not really.

970
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,799
I don't think I experienced any.

971
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,717
That's good.

972
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,385
Right.

973
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:10,432
We have information on various activities
and hobbies on our website.

974
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,811
There are a lot
of helpful videos and lectures,

975
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,938
so you can take a look at them.

976
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:17,856
Okay.

977
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,276
Wait.

978
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,362
VOLUNTARY MEDICAL SERVICE IN MYANMAR

979
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,447
What is it?

980
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,242
He's a senior colleague of mine.

981
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,911
Yes, you're right.

982
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,664
Dr. Min used to work at Daehan too.

983
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:39,127
I didn't know he volunteered though.

984
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,463
It hasn't been that long.

985
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,549
It's only been two years
since he joined our organization.

986
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,675
I see.

987
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,135
WITH HAESUNG PHARMACEUTICAL

988
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,471
Is it sponsored by Haesung Pharmaceutical?

989
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:54,350
Didn't Kyung-min become
the director of that company?

990
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:55,810
Correct.

991
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,817
This must've been a fond memory
to have set this as your wallpaper.

992
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:08,323
Haesung is sponsoring
both our association and the one in Macau.

993
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,951
They sponsor an association in Macau too?

994
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,039
The wife of Haesung's president
is from Macau.

995
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,958
I see.

996
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:29,552
He would've been away for a few days
if he volunteered overseas,

997
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,805
so why didn't he say anything?

998
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,475
There was no need to have kept it secret.

999
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,018
So why?

1000
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,190
Hey, Hong-ran.

1001
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,567
You said you knew
a medical reporter, right?

1002
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,655
Hello, I'm Nam Ha-neul.

1003
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,115
I'm Kim Do-yun.

1004
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,577
I'm sorry for the short notice.

1005
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,704
Don't be.

1006
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,583
Dr. Lee told me you had questions
about Haesung Pharmaceutical.

1007
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,878
Yes, I heard a little bit about it.

1008
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:09,175
Haesung's new medicine was going to pass
phase two of the FDA's clinical trial.

1009
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,261
I wanted to know about the dissertation.

1010
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,513
I haven't read it yet,

1011
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:18,059
but I heard Director Min is developing
a drug that relieves acute pain.

1012
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,186
There are almost no side effects.

1013
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,731
The effects of the drug last
2.8 times longer than the existing ones.

1014
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,402
-And it reduces pain almost in half.
-What?

1015
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,699
But aren't most drugs rejected
during phase two?

1016
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:36,077
I heard the approval rate
was less than 5%.

1017
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,997
Rumor has it the drug
is likely to move onto phase three.

1018
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,334
But some say
the credibility of that source is…

1019
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,588
is pretty lousy.

1020
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:48,923
What do you mean?

1021
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,302
If such a groundbreaking drug
is in development

1022
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,180
and rumors say it'll head to phase three,

1023
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,848
Yeouido should be making their move.

1024
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,434
The stock prices should skyrocket.

1025
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,062
A few years ago, a reporter colluded
with a pharmaceutical company.

1026
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,982
He wrote a false article
and manipulated stock prices.

1027
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,400
He was the worst.

1028
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,735
And rumor has it

1029
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,238
this same reporter is the source
of these Haesung rumors.

1030
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,350
Also, Haesung doesn't seem
to be an honest company either.

1031
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,144
They say its president
has no interest in pharmaceuticals

1032
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,188
but only took over to profit illegally.

1033
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,649
Some say they're linked
to gangsters from Macau too.

1034
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,612
HAESUNG DONATES
300 MILLION TO CHILDREN'S WARD

1035
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,197
DONATION CEREMONY AT DAEHAN HOSPITAL

1036
00:58:56,658 --> 00:59:01,371
Mr. Yeo, is the dissertation
you tried to submit as evidence credible?

1037
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:05,833
Ha-neul!

1038
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,591
Why did Haesung's vice president
attend Jeong-woo's hearing?

1039
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,594
PRESIDENT JEONG JI-HYEOK
VP JEONG DAE-HYEON

1040
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,268
Hi, Mom.

1041
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,146
What? The police station?

1042
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,946
You said you saw the man
on the day Yeo Jeong-woo moved in.

1043
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,656
-He was following Mr. Yeo?
-Yes.

1044
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,785
Wasn't that the doctor Kang Jin-seok?
The person who followed Jeong-woo?

1045
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,792
The man who followed him
the day before the hearing

1046
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,919
and the man who broke into
his house was Kang.

1047
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,380
But he wasn't there
on the day Yeo moved in.

1048
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,424
At that time,
Kang Jin-seok wasn't in Korea.

1049
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,341
Really?

1050
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,011
Maybe he just lied about that.

1051
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,805
He admitted to everything else,
so why would he lie about that?

1052
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,850
We have a record of him
flying to LA that day for a conference.

1053
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,602
So…

1054
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,187
I sorted out the individuals
who were in the area

1055
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,356
around the time and date
you said you saw him.

1056
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,192
Do any of them look familiar?

1057
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,486
Take your time.

1058
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,283
Ba-da.

1059
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,995
What? Ha-neul.

1060
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,121
What are you doing here?

1061
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,332
Mom called. What's going on?

1062
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,230
Our misfortune came sooner
than we expected.

1063
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:00,740
The concerns we tried so hard to hide
to maintain our current happiness

1064
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,326
were slowly becoming real.

1065
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,090
Kyung-min.

1066
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,675
Jeong-woo, are you okay?

1067
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,009
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

1068
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,095
I'm all right.

1069
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,598
The sincere and concerned look in his eyes

1070
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,476
made it impossible to doubt him.

1071
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:31,938
Jeong-woo.

1072
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,066
Once the closest friend,
he became a stranger in an instant.

1073
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,609
Do you like Ha-neul?

1074
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,197
You shouldn't be happy right now.

1075
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,701
Once warm, but now ice-cold.

1076
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:46,869
I know him very well.

1077
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,166
All I can hope for now

1078
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,253
is that this isn't
as dangerous as it feels.

1079
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,964
I had set up seven spy cameras.

1080
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,466
One in the OR,

1081
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,636
two in the office,
and three in the hallway.

1082
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,556
Then, where do you think I put…

1083
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,476
the last camera?

1084
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,564
Even the police didn't know.

1085
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,110
Aren't you curious
to see what was recorded?

1086
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,046
We need to talk.

1087
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,049
I thought we were done talking.

1088
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,887
Why did you visit Jeong-woo
on the day he moved in and just leave?

1089
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,226
Seeing how silent you are,

1090
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,145
I guess Jeong-woo
shouldn't know about this.

1091
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,068
Where are you right now?

1092
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,916
Get in.

1093
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:16,000
Let's talk here.

1094
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,419
Aren't we discussing things
that are secret?

1095
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:25,676
Get in.

1096
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,105
BOYFRIEND

1097
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,357
Ha-neul, why can't I reach you?

1098
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:22,942
Is something wrong?

1099
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,573
I wondered why you wanted
to become a professor

1100
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,366
if you were going to quit so soon.

1101
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:34,203
I guess it was because they needed
at least one to develop a new drug.

1102
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,711
I read your dissertation.

1103
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,298
But I found many errors,
starting with your control group.

1104
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,176
So how could dissertation like this
pass phase two?

1105
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,598
I heard something interesting.

1106
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,684
With a false article
about this false dissertation,

1107
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,228
some believe you're trying
to manipulate stocks.

1108
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,772
That's what I heard.

1109
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,484
What are your thoughts on that?

1110
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,446
You're curious about many things.

1111
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,698
I haven't asked
what I'm really curious about yet.

1112
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,624
Why did Haesung's vice president
attend Jeong-woo's hearing?

1113
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,046
I ran into him at court that day.
I vividly remember this face.

1114
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:31,344
Haesung has something to do
with that medical accident, right?

1115
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,932
Are you…

1116
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,519
involved in Jeong-woo's medical accident?

1117
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,439
You…

1118
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,090
Taking a stroll at night
while drinking some warm tea

1119
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,926
without a care in the world.

1120
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:59,098
Was wishing for such a day
asking for too much?

1121
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,399
I shouldn't have told her
to take her time.

1122
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:15,489
Those words tormented me

1123
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,993
for a very long time.

1124
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,945
DOCTOR SLUMP

1125
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:59,617
Are you telling me Ha-neul is unconscious?

1126
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,910
Why is she still unconscious?

1127
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,162
The CT scan showed
no bleeding in her brain.

1128
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,583
I desperately prayed you'd wake up soon.

1129
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,461
I love you with all my heart, Ha-neul.

1130
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,422
Jeong-woo, let's not exhaust ourselves.

1131
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,592
I'll stay strong.
You should stay strong too.

1132
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,596
Meeting Kyung-min was because of me?

1133
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,724
This happened because of me?

1134
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:33,526
