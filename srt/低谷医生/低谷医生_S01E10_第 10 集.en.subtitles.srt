1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,036
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,791
I was the top-ranked student
at our school 47 times.

3
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,751
CLASS RANK

4
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,004
I was the top-ranked student
in the country after acing a mock test.

5
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,134
I graduated at the top of my class
from Seoul's most prestigious med school.

6
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,344
And I even received a Minister's Award.

7
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,935
But now,

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,396
I'm just the best Pump It Up player.

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,112
I authored articles in BJA,
the world's leading journal on anesthesia.

10
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,822
I won Best Dissertation of the Year

11
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,325
and Best Young Researcher
of the Year awards.

12
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,161
But now,

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,288
I just win at the arcade.

14
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,292
Let's begin.

15
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,251
Hold this.

16
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,838
This surgery won't be easy at all.

17
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,299
The blue scrubs
I used to wear for surgeries

18
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:35,678
became pajamas and work clothes
because they were comfortable.

19
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,307
Screw!

20
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,769
This patient has severe AS,
so prepare general anesthesia.

21
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,854
Let's start with the A-line and C-line.

22
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,357
Prepare norepinephrine
and phenylephrine as well.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,274
Yes, doctor.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,861
Isn't this for a hip fracture?
Do spinal anesthesia instead.

25
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,740
It used to be
an absolute contraindication.

26
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,867
But now, it's a relative contraindication.

27
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,413
But isn't general anesthesia easier
to control if the patient's BP drops?

28
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,999
Their BP will drop
with general anesthesia as well.

29
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,836
If we keep the dosage down,
it'll be easier to manage.

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,505
I used to challenge colleagues
about our patients.

31
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,424
-When are you going to be done?
-What in the world?

32
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,426
We've been waiting for ages.

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,138
Why? You should go home and study instead.

34
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,556
I already get good grades.

35
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,101
My teacher said I could become
a judge, a prosecutor, or a doctor.

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,565
I already grew up and became a doctor.

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,776
Now, I challenge kids.

38
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,864
Cheers.

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,288
My life is like soju.

40
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,624
It's so bitter.

41
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,376
Then, my life is like…

42
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,754
spicy chicken feet.

43
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,923
It makes me tear up.

44
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,722
Goodness. Here's your rolled omelette.

45
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,681
I'll clear this.

46
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,183
Okay. Thank you.

47
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,727
Should I reheat this for you?

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,728
Sure.

49
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,063
-Ma'am!
-Yes?

50
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,358
The wounds on your heels are pretty bad.

51
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,276
Me?

52
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,363
Didn't you say
you took medicine for your diabetes?

53
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,115
-Yes.
-That's it.

54
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:24,537
You see, diabetes patients
lose sensation in their feet.

55
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:29,208
You'll suffer a lot
from foot ulcers if you don't treat that.

56
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,545
Don't wear your shoes too tightly.

57
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,298
Next time you go for your prescription,

58
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,675
don't forget to show
the doctor your feet. Okay?

59
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,218
All right, I will.

60
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,554
People might think
he's a doctor or something.

61
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,306
How did you know?

62
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,850
I am a doctor.

63
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,856
Call me Dr. Yeo from now on.

64
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,150
-Dr. Yeo?
-What?

65
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,151
Not Mr. Yeo?

66
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,154
I'm Dr. Nam.

67
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm also a doctor.

68
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,284
So you two are doctors.

69
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:08,164
So they call you Dr. Yeo and Dr. Nam.

70
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,207
Is this correct?

71
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,208
-Yes.
-Yes.

72
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,974
Don't drink too much, okay?

73
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,518
Make sure you pay. We have cameras.

74
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,104
People like them always forget to pay.

75
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,982
But we are doctors.

76
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,609
No one believed our profession.

77
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,862
Even we had forgotten about it.

78
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,448
But we are doctors.

79
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,872
Were there any issues
during the induction of anesthesia?

80
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,000
No, there weren't.

81
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,668
Both her BP and pulse are stable.

82
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,022
We are…

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,441
starting again.

84
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:23,031
DOCTOR SLUMP

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,701
Dr. Yeo, you may begin now.

86
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,788
She's our anesthesiologist for the day.

87
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,082
-Her name is Dr. Nam Ha-neul.
-I see.

88
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,969
-My surgical gown.
-Yes, sir.

89
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,326
I'll begin now.

90
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,079
Headlight.

91
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,459
Have it focused.

92
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,587
Thank you.

93
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,509
I'll start with her nose. I need
local anesthesia with the dental syringe.

94
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,453
Number 15 scalpel.

95
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,856
Dr. Yeo, the patient
is bleeding quite a bit.

96
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,568
Her BP is 110 over 79. Should I lower it?

97
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446
Okay.

98
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,876
Number 15 scalpel.

99
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,188
We're done. Remove the headlight.

100
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,192
We can wrap up after irrigation.

101
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,986
I'll be done with dressing
the wound in 20 minutes.

102
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,779
Okay. Take your time.

103
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,926
Jeong-woo, how did it go?

104
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,595
I heard it was a tricky secondary case.

105
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,513
What's going on?

106
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,849
Oh, you mean Ha-neul?

107
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,018
You see…

108
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,778
I heard about how Jeong-woo
had a panic attack during surgery.

109
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,988
He did.

110
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,282
I think I made him
return to work too soon.

111
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,995
I knew he would be struggling,
but I had no idea it was that bad.

112
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,666
Were you aware of this?

113
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,464
To be honest, I was worried
when I heard he was going back to work.

114
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,842
"Will he be able to hold a scalpel?"

115
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,136
"Will he be okay with blood?"

116
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,722
"Will he be afraid of his colleagues?"

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,980
Did you know that a colleague he trusted
was also in on the medical accident?

118
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:29,026
Right. She helped secretly mix heparin
into the IV to cause excessive bleeding.

119
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,322
That's why he may still doubt

120
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,034
doing surgery in the OR

121
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,870
and those in the room with him.

122
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,373
So I was wondering…

123
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,962
if I could be in the OR with him.

124
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,175
I wanted to tell you in advance,

125
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,386
but she said you'd refuse.

126
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,055
She begged me not to tell you.

127
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,226
-Did I do something wrong again?
-No, you didn't.

128
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,481
I just don't think… I can do it anymore.

129
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,108
What do you mean?

130
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,112
I kept telling myself
it was okay and I could do it.

131
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,492
-But I don't think I'm ready yet.
-Come on.

132
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,953
The surgery went well. What's the problem?

133
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,038
Dae-yeong.

134
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,291
I get chills whenever I grab a scalpel.

135
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,336
Just like the first time as a med student,

136
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,756
it feels foreign and scary.

137
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,676
I think continuing to insist

138
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,139
that I'm fine is unfair to everyone.

139
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,641
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,439
-"Unfair"? Why would you say that?
-It's true.

141
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,692
And how could I possibly
receive your help?

142
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,069
Why not?

143
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,946
You told me to come back.
You said I could come back whenever.

144
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,407
I didn't mean in this way.

145
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,411
Dr. Yeo, you have a guest.

146
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,579
Jeong-woo.

147
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,667
How have you been?

148
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,377
-Remember me?
-Of course, sir.

149
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,628
What brings you here?

150
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,837
What do you think?

151
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:17,218
I heard you were back at work,
so I decided to get a consultation.

152
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,344
Goodness.

153
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,473
Hello, Mr. Han. Do you remember me?

154
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,475
Of course, I do.

155
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,352
-How have you been?
-Good.

156
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,022
Goodness, I can't believe
two of my former students are here.

157
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,023
Gosh.

158
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,650
I brought some tea for you.

159
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,609
Goodness, thank you.

160
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,486
You didn't have to, doctor.

161
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,487
It's my pleasure.

162
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,157
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

163
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,080
Are you also working here
as an anesthesiologist?

164
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,248
-No.
-Yes.

165
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,379
So you're not working here?

166
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,089
-No, she's not.
-Yes, I am.

167
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,511
What's with you two?
Why are your answers different?

168
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,054
You see…

169
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,224
We still haven't finalized it.

170
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,770
By the way, are you really here
to get some work done?

171
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,105
To be honest,

172
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,401
I've been watching the news
to see what you've been doing.

173
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,863
I knew you'd never do such a thing.

174
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,616
It shattered my heart. I hoped everything
would be quickly resolved.

175
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,703
So after hearing you were back at work,

176
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,080
I decided to visit
and help your business out.

177
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,248
Don't be absurd, sir.

178
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,375
So tell me. What do I need?

179
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,919
I heard people get facelifts these days.

180
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,130
Should I do that? Or maybe a nose job?

181
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,092
You look the nicest
and most natural right now. Or…

182
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,680
No, don't ruin your face.

183
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,974
Nice one, Jeong-woo.

184
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,480
It's lunchtime anyway.

185
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,356
Let's go grab some food.

186
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,489
I wanted to treat you
to something nice, but why tteokbokki?

187
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,034
Gosh, you both became successful doctors,

188
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,578
but you still look
like high school seniors to me.

189
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,205
What about me?

190
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,833
Do I look like one too?

191
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,544
Well…

192
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,297
You look like you'd have
a son who's a senior.

193
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,302
That's a bit harsh, Mr. Han.

194
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,596
-A son who's a senior?
-I mean…

195
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,433
-Well--
-I have a daughter who's in seventh grade.

196
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,560
Gosh, you startled me.

197
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,938
He's a witty one.

198
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,857
By the way, why are you here?

199
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,360
Why not? I like tteokbokki too.

200
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,155
And I noticed all our nurses
had already gone out to eat.

201
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,032
You want me to eat alone then?

202
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,826
Mr. Han, should I eat lunch by myself?

203
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,036
No.

204
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,412
Eat up.

205
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,580
Thank you.

206
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,124
By the way, you must've really cared
about Jeong-woo

207
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,543
to have come all the way here.

208
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,545
Of course.

209
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,715
He was the perfect student
back in the day.

210
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,633
Please.

211
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:07,012
He was kind, studious, and mature.

212
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:12,184
Of course, that was until Ha-neul
joined our school. He was so mature.

213
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,563
What do you mean?
How did he change after she came?

214
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,064
Don't get me started.

215
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,652
These two were the only ones
in the country who aced their mock tests.

216
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,321
Imagine how things were
having both in the same class.

217
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,576
Ha-neul, do you remember packing
Cheongyang chili peppers to school?

218
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,536
What? I did?

219
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,998
You said it helped you
stay awake at school,

220
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:37,209
so you ate them for lunch
all the time while studying.

221
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,421
Goodness, you were
so strict with yourself.

222
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,797
She sure was.

223
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,015
Gosh.

224
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,058
Why does the air smell so spicy?

225
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,232
What is she eating?

226
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,236
Ttaengcho. That's what Busan natives
call Cheongyang chili peppers.

227
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,237
But why?

228
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,449
-Coffee doesn't cut it for her anymore.
-What?

229
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:12,328
To help her stay awake…
she's been bringing them lately.

230
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,180
Why would she go to such lengths?

231
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,065
My stomach hurts.

232
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,158
Ma'am, could I get some medicine?

233
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,743
For what?

234
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,912
I have a stomachache.

235
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,498
-A stomachache?
-Yes.

236
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,755
-Hey, our teacher told me to take this.
-Why?

237
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,673
It's obvious.

238
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,218
You said these kept you awake,
so I ate some and had to see the nurse.

239
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,636
My insides were in pain!

240
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,223
Guys, they said Cheongyang chili peppers
are banned from now on.

241
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,433
So don't bring any.

242
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,269
Let's go to the teachers' office.

243
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,478
You're dead meat now.

244
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,833
Jeong-woo was really something else too.

245
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,461
No wonder.

246
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,839
I saw them bickering earlier,
and they did it so naturally.

247
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,340
They still bicker?

248
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,508
All the time.

249
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,968
Do you really?

250
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,513
Gosh, the sauce has reduced down a lot.

251
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,765
Can I have this egg?

252
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,266
Hey, that's mine.

253
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,852
I've been rolling it
and cooking it in the sauce.

254
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,645
You can't say it's yours.

255
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,314
I was watching it get rolled too.

256
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,524
That's not the same as actually doing it.

257
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,902
It's always so hard
being stuck between these two.

258
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,278
I can totally relate.

259
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,529
You've been through so much.

260
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,239
I know I didn't call dibs, but--

261
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,866
You're such an evil boy!

262
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,078
Sure, I might as well be one! Okay.

263
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,788
-They are evil.
-Give it to me.

264
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,539
-Come on!
-Come on! Here it is.

265
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,333
Don't you dare touch it, you thug.

266
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,834
Stop it, you two.

267
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,505
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you.

268
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,715
I'll treat you to something
even better next time.

269
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,300
I appreciate the gesture.

270
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,843
By the way, sir.

271
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,514
You have lines when you smile.
Let me give you some Botox.

272
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,350
But Jeong-woo said
I looked natural and nice.

273
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,143
He's just saying that.

274
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,437
You really need some.

275
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,272
All right. Next time.

276
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,067
You must be busy. Go on then.

277
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,485
Okay.

278
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,278
-Take care, sir.
-Goodbye.

279
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,782
-I'll see you again.
-Bye, Mr. Han.

280
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,120
Sir, give me a call.
I'll get it done nicely for you.

281
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,333
And… you should get it done soon.

282
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,753
Thank you for your advice.

283
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,175
You should go home.

284
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,969
Come on.

285
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,097
Who are you to order me around?
I'm going to work.

286
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,307
Hey.

287
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,059
Just give in, will you?

288
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,855
I get that you guys have been rivals
for years and naturally bicker.

289
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,022
But she wants to help--

290
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,065
That little…

291
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,737
-We need to talk.
-What's wrong with you? Let me go.

292
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,614
What is it?

293
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:22,995
I lied.

294
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,957
I never ate chili peppers like you.

295
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,584
That was a lie.

296
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,838
-What?
-I had to stop you somehow.

297
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,428
I didn't even like you then,
but I couldn't bear to see you in pain.

298
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,055
So imagine how I feel right now.

299
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,185
Let me ask you one thing.

300
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,271
Have you ever thought about working
at a plastic surgery clinic?

301
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,858
-What?
-You never considered it before.

302
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,611
Plus, you were taking a break
because things were tough.

303
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,573
Did it cross your mind that it'd hurt me
to see you work just because of me?

304
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,951
It did. But…

305
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,455
I had no choice.
I couldn't let you be alone.

306
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,789
You're hurting, so how could I?

307
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,374
Then, what about you?

308
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,378
I didn't want to leave you alone
when you were in pain.

309
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,549
I asked you to struggle by my side
and go through it together.

310
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,509
I held onto you and begged.

311
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,263
But you just let go.

312
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,351
I still don't know why we broke up.

313
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,811
You never gave me a clear reason.

314
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,273
No matter how hard things got,

315
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,609
I was prepared to endure it and love you.

316
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,863
But you let go of my hand.

317
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,992
But you can't see how it hurts me?

318
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,411
You have to be by my side?

319
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,497
For your own sake?

320
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,750
-Jeong-woo--
-Just go.

321
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,087
To me right now,

322
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,507
you're just being selfish.

323
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,271
Ha-neul, I have big news!

324
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,399
Jeong-woo's on the rooftop.

325
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,486
I went to get our blankets
and the light was on.

326
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,613
I wonder why he's here.

327
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,282
Maybe because he missed you.

328
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,161
Ha-neul?

329
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,580
Walk, don't run. Ha-neul!

330
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,123
You have to play hard to get!

331
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,334
Looking so openly anxious
isn't attractive!

332
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,966
Hello, Ha-neul. What brings you here?

333
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,928
I came up and saw the light was on.

334
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,639
Why are you here?

335
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,684
Jeong-woo wanted me to pick up a book.

336
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,104
You left this behind,
so I was going to drop this off.

337
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,022
Here.

338
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,899
-Thank you.
-It's my pleasure.

339
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,403
I was going to call you anyway.
I'm glad I ran into you.

340
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,116
I'll get going then.

341
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,497
-Good night.
-Take care.

342
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,288
Hey, Mom.

343
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,960
What? She did?

344
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,465
Where are you now? The hospital?

345
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,301
Where's Jin-woo?

346
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,599
Okay, I'll pick him up. Wait for me. Bye.

347
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,858
Su-min, it's me.
Sorry for calling so early.

348
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,609
I have a favor to ask.

349
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,444
Hold on, please!

350
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,822
I'm sorry.

351
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,786
My aunt slipped and fell in the bathroom.

352
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,080
She has broken bones,
so she's in surgery right now.

353
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,418
My mom needs to be there,
so no one's available to watch Jin-woo.

354
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,171
I have to go into surgery right now.

355
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,756
You're on vacation? Jeju Island?

356
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,883
Lucky you.

357
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,051
Have fun then. Bye.

358
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,347
No. I told you not to
fool around in the elevator.

359
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,563
What do I do?

360
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,191
Right, Ha-neul.

361
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,234
Excuse me.

362
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,988
-Do you need my help?
-With what?

363
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,033
Well, I also raise a kid by myself.

364
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,535
I think I could look after him
for a few hours.

365
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,331
I'm right here, so I thought
I could babysit if it's okay with you.

366
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,583
I love you!

367
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,919
I mean, thank you.

368
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:07,923
Hi.

369
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,595
Was your name Jin-woo?

370
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:19,142
-Do you still wear diapers?
-I'm six. I stopped wearing them at four.

371
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,561
Really? I didn't know.

372
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,563
"Really? I didn't know."

373
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,566
-Why are you copying me?
-"Why are you copying me?"

374
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,155
Keep the Hemovac drain in place
and close the skin carefully.

375
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,575
Dress the wound well, and keep an eye
on the drainage color change.

376
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,328
Yes, I won!

377
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,290
I want to go to my mom.

378
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,336
Jin-woo, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

379
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,257
I won't be able to face your mom
if you leave like this.

380
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,676
Hey, how did the surgery go?

381
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,513
That's a relief.
Don't worry about Jin-woo.

382
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,516
A doctor I know's watching him.
I'm on the rooftop to pick him up.

383
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,644
-But why the rooftop--
-What's your favorite insect?

384
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,271
The praying mantis? Ants?

385
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,565
See? I told you the ant hill was here.
Wasn't I right?

386
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,401
Yes, there are tons of ants!

387
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,861
How many do we have?

388
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,949
Mom, let me call you back. Bye.

389
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,535
-Six.
-We caught six?

390
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,537
Jin-woo, did you have fun?

391
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,913
Mom!

392
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,126
It was tough, wasn't it?
He's such a rascal.

393
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,794
Not at all. He's very obedient.

394
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,630
Jin-woo, we had a lot of fun, right?

395
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,674
-Yes.
-When are you coming again?

396
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,259
You better play with me again.

397
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,719
-Okay.
-"Okay."

398
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,097
Wait.

399
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,141
-Why are you smiling so much?
-I am?

400
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,018
When?

401
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,145
Just now. You were smiling like this.

402
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,273
When did I ever smile like that?

403
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,899
When did I ever do that?

404
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,776
Jeez.

405
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,945
So where is he going to go?

406
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,116
My cousin in Ilsan will take care of him
until my aunt gets discharged.

407
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,827
I'm going to pick him up after work.

408
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,581
Excuse me.

409
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,167
Hey, Yeong-ok.

410
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,503
Yeah, I heard about Kyung-min's wedding.

411
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,341
Sure, we should meet up before then.
Let's pick a date.

412
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,717
I'll come with Ha-neul.

413
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,054
What do you mean?

414
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,139
She did what to Kyung-min?

415
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,809
Ha-neul hit rock bottom
because of Min Kyung-min?

416
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,019
What do you mean?

417
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,356
Okay.

418
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,820
Okay.

419
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,364
All right. Bye.

420
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,201
Excuse me.

421
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,704
May I ask
what you were just talking about?

422
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,873
Well, I…

423
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,918
I'm confused as well.

424
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,214
Ha-neul suddenly went
to his goodbye party not too long ago

425
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,383
and threw beer in his face.

426
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,134
They said it was a total mess.

427
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,888
It turns out he'd used her
by stealing her dissertation

428
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,973
and taking credit for her work.

429
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,726
Then, he spread rumors
and turned her into a laughingstock.

430
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,813
It was so bad
she can't go back there anymore.

431
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,404
Professor Min.

432
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,657
Are you going to start work
in Hannam-dong next week?

433
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,660
You could've taken today off
and let us do this work.

434
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,120
You didn't have to come.

435
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,621
I just wanted to.

436
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,458
I wanted to see the professor
and look around for one last time.

437
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,754
Come in.

438
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,845
What?

439
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,138
Jeong-woo.

440
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,890
What brings you here?

441
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,810
I did everything I could
to help with your case,

442
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,229
but you didn't pick up
my calls after it ended.

443
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,230
I've been waiting.

444
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,316
Can we talk for a minute?

445
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,738
Sure.

446
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,281
Can you give us some privacy?

447
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,741
I'll wrap up here.

448
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,658
Yes, Professor.

449
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,576
Thanks.

450
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,662
Sit down.

451
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,081
It's quite hectic. Goodness.

452
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,295
I'm not the type to beat around the bush,

453
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,463
so I'll just ask you.

454
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,802
What happened between you and Ha-neul?

455
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,014
To be exact…

456
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,893
What did you do to her?

457
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,270
What…

458
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:37,484
What did I do? Are you accusing me
after blindly believing what she said?

459
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,197
We were just fighting
for a position like we all do here.

460
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,949
It was a fierce competition
over one professor spot.

461
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,411
She ignored her own incompetence,
and now she's blaming me?

462
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,999
There are always people like her!

463
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,293
They always blame others.
She's one of them!

464
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,171
Gosh.

465
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,134
Gosh, Jeong-woo.

466
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,304
I told you not to like her.

467
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:12,310
It might been fine to rely on her
when struggling, but keep your distance.

468
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,104
She's useless.

469
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,612
You bastard!

470
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,535
Damn it!

471
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,040
Professor!

472
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,124
Doctor!

473
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,376
-Please stop.
-Are you okay?

474
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,460
Let go of me!

475
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,838
Damn it!

476
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,894
There so much cabbage.

477
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,896
I want beef bulgogi though.

478
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,481
Just eat.

479
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,860
Who are you, Hwang Jung-min?
All you do is eat and not contribute.

480
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,152
So stop complaining.

481
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,865
Who's Hwang Jung-min? Ba-da's friend?

482
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,826
Does he not earn his keep either?

483
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,121
He's selfish like someone else I know.

484
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,333
What are you talking about?
Don't you know his famous speech?

485
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,210
-What?
-Of course not.

486
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,254
Just eat.

487
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,891
I heard you planted
the cabbages on the rooftop garden

488
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,058
since they're good for me.

489
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:40,690
Well, I heard calcium helps
calm your nerves or something like that.

490
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,527
Thanks.

491
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,906
I'll make sure to eat them
and recover quickly.

492
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,909
What is this?

493
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,077
Why are you suddenly so kind?

494
00:31:54,913 --> 00:32:00,418
I'm just finally starting to understand
how it feels to want to help someone.

495
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,756
Gosh, you've become mature.

496
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,799
Yeah, Mom has tried really hard.

497
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,303
She heard looking at plants helped
with depression, so she bought some.

498
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,305
You noticed your curtains changed, right?

499
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,391
She bought them herself
to freshen up your room.

500
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,518
You did?

501
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,104
You should've told me.

502
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:26,778
I didn't know anything at first,
so all I did was pour out encouragement.

503
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,238
But I thought about it,

504
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,324
and if someone's exhausted
and on the floor,

505
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,743
holding out my hand
and always telling them to get up

506
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,079
wouldn't be of any help.

507
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,750
It felt like I was rushing
and forcing you.

508
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,170
It must've been so burdensome.

509
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,805
Have some cabbage.

510
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,722
Okay.

511
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,897
It's good.

512
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,857
Really? Isn't it spicy?

513
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,775
It's delicious.

514
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:37,015
At times, receiving quiet
and subtle comfort can be more helpful.

515
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,140
Hello?

516
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,641
Jeong-woo.

517
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,561
You see…

518
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,064
I have something to say.

519
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,649
Can we meet after work today?

520
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,611
I'm here.

521
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,197
What?

522
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,698
I came to see you.

523
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,872
It's still working hours for you.

524
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,168
Have you decided to quit?

525
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,008
-What happened?
-It's nothing.

526
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,677
Don't lie. You're hurt all over.

527
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,099
What happened?
Did you get in a fight? Tell me.

528
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,934
My goodness.

529
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,442
I'm sorry, Ha-neul.

530
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,865
I had no idea.

531
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,547
You're not going to tell me what happened?

532
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,641
It's okay. You don't have to
if you don't want to.

533
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,482
I really missed you a lot.

534
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,363
So…

535
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,534
when I first saw you in the OR,

536
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,246
I was so happy and grateful

537
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,374
that I got emotional.

538
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,299
On the day I dropped the scalpel
and messed up the surgery,

539
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,968
I actually had a nightmare.

540
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,555
In the early morning,

541
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,559
I woke up all alone
in that unfamiliar house.

542
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,607
And I missed you so much.

543
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,572
I almost texted
"Are you asleep?" like you did.

544
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,367
Why would you bring that up?

545
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,914
If you missed me that much,

546
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,209
why did you speak so coldly to me?

547
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,212
When you said

548
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,217
that you were in no position to date
and wanted to break up,

549
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,971
it was actually… extremely painful.

550
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,599
"I see."

551
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,144
"I'm of no help to her."

552
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,648
"She can't rely on me."
And I blamed myself a lot.

553
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,693
-Jeong-woo--
-So I tried to become stronger.

554
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,906
I wanted to become someone reliable
who you could lean on,

555
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,034
and I tried really hard.

556
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,456
But when my hands
trembled in front of you…

557
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,423
I really wanted to impress you.

558
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,014
I'm sorry I was so harsh yesterday.

559
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,814
Jeong-woo.

560
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,526
I've recovered a lot thanks to you.

561
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,656
When I first quit the hospital,
I thought my life was over.

562
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,162
But thanks to you,
I've had so many happy moments.

563
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,544
We ate tteokbokki, went to the arcade,

564
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,379
and watched movies together.

565
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,594
You showed me life existed
outside the hospital too.

566
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,767
The same goes for you.

567
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,231
You still exist outside the clinic.

568
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,234
Whether you're a doctor or not…

569
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,739
you'll always be incredible.

570
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,421
It must've hurt a lot.

571
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,161
Right, you wanted to tell me something.

572
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
What was it?

573
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,458
Oh, that…

574
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:42,254
I wanted you to check
my homework that was overdue.

575
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,758
Check your homework?

576
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,304
After hearing me sing
"Oh My Darling, Clementine",

577
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,931
you told me to memorize a K-pop song.

578
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,811
Don't tell me
you're going to sing right now.

579
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,689
No, I'm going to do something better.

580
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,191
Better?

581
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,697
What's your best outfit?

582
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,283
Let's get dressed up and go out.

583
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,206
Goodness.

584
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,417
Let's go!

585
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,812
Look at me. Aren't I so trendy?

586
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,774
Where did you get those clothes?
Did you steal them?

587
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,987
Of course not. I bought them after I got
my license to go clubbing with Hong-ran.

588
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,156
-But we never went.
-Why not?

589
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,491
When I was about to go,
it felt like a waste of time.

590
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,160
But I don't feel that way today.

591
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,494
Let's have a blast.

592
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,084
This is new.

593
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,190
Do you want some beer?

594
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,774
-I'll bring some over.
-Okay.

595
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,069
I'll come with--

596
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:29,987
I'm sorry.

597
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,114
Are you here alone?

598
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,909
-No, I--
-She's with me.

599
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,994
-Are you her boyfriend?
-What?

600
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,871
I can't hear you well.

601
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,206
Are you her boyfriend?

602
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,665
Me?

603
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,918
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

604
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,002
What?

605
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,046
I'm her ex… boyfriend.

606
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,223
The "ex" part was a little quiet.

607
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,229
I mean, there wasn't any need
to say I was your ex.

608
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,607
But I can't say "boyfriend" either
since you dumped me.

609
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,819
Anyway, I did my best.

610
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,407
Let's dance.

611
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,870
-You said you're getting beer.
-What?

612
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,581
I'll go get it.

613
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,042
Excuse me.

614
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,178
I had loads of fun at the club.
What should we do now?

615
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,222
We're not done?

616
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,682
Nope.

617
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,725
I want to have fun with you today.

618
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,605
Come to think of it,
when I was struggling,

619
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,275
you said it was okay to be how I was

620
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,778
and allowed me to enjoy the day.

621
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,740
But I only kept urging you to overcome it.

622
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,827
I felt bad.

623
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,207
At some point,
I think I started seeing myself in you.

624
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:11,714
We were both hurt by others
and our lives fell apart.

625
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,177
So I thought if you recovered,
I would too.

626
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,391
It's true that I wanted to help you,

627
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,771
but I mainly wanted us to get better
while working together.

628
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,610
If we were together,

629
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,237
I thought we could do it.

630
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,906
That's why I went to your clinic.

631
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,078
But I'll quit if you want.

632
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:09,772
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

633
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,441
-Take care.
-Bye.

634
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,450
-Jeong-woo.
-Yes?

635
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,079
I didn't want to ask
since you could feel uncomfortable.

636
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,667
But I thought maybe I could join in
on our teacher's surgery.

637
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,087
Our teacher?

638
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,797
Goodness.

639
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,215
My goodness!

640
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,508
-I'm okay. Sorry.
-Sorry.

641
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,009
Mr. Han, are you okay?

642
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,761
Yes, I'm fine.

643
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,889
There's something on your back though.

644
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:44,807
What?

645
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,642
It feels like a big lump.

646
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,977
It's nothing.

647
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,439
Dr. Bin. I felt a lump on Mr. Han's back.
Can you take a look?

648
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,316
-Sure.
-I'm okay.

649
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,652
Don't bother.
It's really nothing. Let's go.

650
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,820
Please, sir.

651
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,613
It won't take long. Where is it?

652
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,906
-Over here.
-But…

653
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,367
-I'm really fine.
-Excuse me.

654
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,912
Gosh, it's a big one.

655
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,164
Just a moment.

656
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,876
At first glance,
it doesn't seem malignant.

657
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,503
It just seems like a lipoma.

658
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,588
Does it hurt when I press down on it?

659
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:21,009
No, it's not painful at all.
It just bothers me a bit when I lie down.

660
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,430
Was this why you came by today?

661
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,640
Why didn't you tell us?

662
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,100
Well…

663
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,437
Thank you.

664
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,313
Would you like some tea?

665
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,481
Yes, thank you.

666
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,740
Do you think Dr. Yeo will be okay today?

667
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,035
His anesthesiologist friend
is here too, so probably.

668
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,707
I was so shocked when I heard
he dropped his scalpel and backed away.

669
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,916
Me too.

670
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,419
I guess the medical accident
traumatized him.

671
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,088
Even that once-successful doctor
had a panic attack.

672
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,425
I happened to overhear them.

673
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:07,222
Don't tell Jeong-woo, okay?
I'd appreciate it.

674
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,141
-Let's go and finish our food.
-Sir.

675
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:13,061
If you're okay with it,
may I do the surgery instead?

676
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,607
No, I don't want to burden Jeong-woo.

677
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,193
-But still.
-I'm okay.

678
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,032
To be honest,
he came by to ask for your help.

679
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,995
Dr. Bin and I will do his surgery.

680
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,289
He came for help,
so it's weighed on my mind.

681
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,170
Would that put you in a bind?

682
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,382
Let's just pretend you didn't hear.

683
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,467
I'll go in now.

684
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,220
I'll do it.

685
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,018
I'll do his surgery.

686
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,437
No, you don't have to push yourself.

687
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,772
I want to.

688
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,150
You told me

689
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,821
that you thought if I got better,
you could too.

690
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,119
If I need a reason
to overcome this trauma,

691
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,040
there's no better reason than you.

692
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,295
Let's do this together.

693
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,297
Help me.

694
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,448
Mr. Han.

695
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:52,911
That tube in your nose will provide you
with oxygen, so you can breathe freely.

696
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,455
This isn't a major surgery,

697
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,250
but we'll put you to sleep
for your convenience.

698
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,501
Okay.

699
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,170
I'm sure you'll do well.

700
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,465
Let's start with two liters of O2.

701
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,508
Yes, doctor.

702
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,719
I'll start the anesthesia now.

703
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,179
We'll keep an eye on your pulse,
BP, and breathing.

704
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,099
We'll give you more drugs
if you feel yourself waking up.

705
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,811
Even if you do wake up, it won't hurt
since you'll be under anesthesia.

706
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,231
Okay. I'll leave you to it.

707
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,443
-Administer the propofol.
-Yes, doctor.

708
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,070
Gosh, I'm so blessed.

709
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,740
You're putting me to sleep,

710
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,867
and Jeong-woo's doing the surgery.

711
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,996
Both of my former students are doctors.

712
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,249
You're both doctors.

713
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,252
Both of you…

714
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,979
NURSE JEON SU-YEONG
WE'RE READY FOR SURGERY

715
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:01,897
OKAY

716
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,736
SUNSHINE MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

717
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,563
Just remember
all the fun we had yesterday.

718
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:48,527
You'll forget your fears
one step at a time.

719
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,679
Dr. Nam, is the patient asleep?

720
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,098
Yes, he is.

721
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,933
I'll administer 0.5 mg of ketamine.

722
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,852
Okay. Thank you.

723
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,947
Scalpel.

724
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,213
Gauze and Bovie.

725
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,801
Hold it in place.

726
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,517
Senn retractor.

727
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,942
Tissue forceps and scissors.

728
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,779
Hold it in place.

729
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:37,093
Get the mosquito forceps ready
and keep wiping if he bleeds.

730
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,470
Yes, doctor.

731
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,683
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

732
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,435
Cheers!

733
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,067
Clap and focus!

734
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,319
Everyone, look at him.

735
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,822
Look at his cutting skills.

736
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,533
He finally overcame
his fear of scalpels. Give him a hand!

737
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,664
Don't be absurd. It's not something
that easy to overcome.

738
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,541
And this is different from a scalpel.

739
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,335
I don't care. I'm just proud of you.

740
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,546
Let's make this a lasting partnership!

741
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:58,633
This is their welcome party tonight,
so we're going barhopping. Okay?

742
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,260
-Okay!
-Sounds great!

743
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,889
What gives? Why are you all
looking at him and not me?

744
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,641
Hold on.

745
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,560
Dr. Yeo, have some of this.

746
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,644
It's really good.

747
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,729
Me?

748
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,022
-Yes.
-Thank you.

749
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,067
-Excuse me!
-Excuse me!

750
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,986
Another glass of beer, please!

751
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,904
Okay.

752
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,447
Dr. Yeo.

753
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,283
You were almost out,
so I ordered another beer for you.

754
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,243
I see. Thank you.

755
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,120
Come on, Nurse Do.

756
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,082
I was so touched since I thought
you were ordering it for me.

757
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,584
You're all so mean.

758
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,211
Hey, you. Get out.

759
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,297
If you're going to make me
look pathetic, then go.

760
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,593
Take me with you then.
I want to work at your clinic.

761
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,929
-Me too.
-Where's my letter of resignation?

762
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,891
You're all so mean.

763
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,812
Seeing everyone like Jeong-woo more is
like going back in time to my intern days.

764
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:57,442
Even back then, all our classmates,
senior doctors, and nurses liked him more.

765
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,526
And one time,

766
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:03,198
one patient of ours was an old lady,
and she gave me her favorite pastry.

767
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,909
So I happily ate it.
But she slapped my back. Why?

768
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,161
"It's for Jeong-woo.
Why'd you shove it in your mouth?"

769
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,704
Yeah, why did you shove it--

770
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,415
Why did you eat it?

771
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,125
Did you just say "shove it"?

772
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,002
You said it first.

773
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,545
When did I ever say that?

774
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,922
You just said it.

775
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,715
I did? I said that?

776
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,967
That's enough. Please.

777
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,551
Jeez.

778
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,761
I'm so upset.

779
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:29,849
Uncle Tae-seon.

780
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,102
You're really not going to hire anyone?

781
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,188
I'm not cut out for restaurant work.

782
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,692
-Then, what are you cut out for?
-Me?

783
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,986
Being a property owner.

784
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,280
You all think I'm not doing anything,

785
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,825
but I'm actually training
to take over this building.

786
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,662
I check for broken windows
and issues with the fuse box.

787
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,331
I'm doing my best
to become a great property owner.

788
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,334
You should become
a decent human being first.

789
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,753
Is Ha-neul still out?

790
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,214
Yeah, she's having a drink
before coming in.

791
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,845
Goodness, she probably needs
alcohol to get by right now.

792
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,266
She seems to have
really liked Jeong-woo, but he left.

793
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:15,186
It was so heartbreaking
to see her eat that cabbage.

794
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:20,567
I hope she's not drunk
and sobbing somewhere.

795
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,986
-Do you know how tough it was?
-So refreshing.

796
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,071
I worked so hard
to give you your paychecks.

797
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,489
Have some peanuts first.

798
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,869
-What's encouraging is Jeong-woo came and…
-Have some.

799
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,004
Hey.

800
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,298
Where is she?

801
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,637
-What was that for?
-How could you do this to me?

802
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,930
What did I do?

803
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,224
I know you don't talk
about what's troubling you.

804
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,811
It's true that I liked you
for not being loose-tongued like I am.

805
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,065
But still, how could you
not tell me anything?

806
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,318
I heard you're helping
Jeong-woo at the clinic.

807
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:06,488
And before that, I heard you had
a falling-out with Kyung-min.

808
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:10,867
I heard that bastard tormented you.
That's why you quit and need medication.

809
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,535
How did you know?

810
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:17,916
Does that matter? I wanted to
go find him and rip his hair out.

811
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,502
But I've had to watch Jin-woo,
so it's on the back burner.

812
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,545
Forget it. What are you, a cook?

813
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,092
It must've been tough.

814
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:34,891
You should just loosen up
and tell others how you feel. Okay?

815
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,227
It doesn't have to be me either.

816
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,395
Don't carry all that burden alone.

817
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,356
Okay.

818
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,777
At least Jeong-woo gave him
a good beating for me, so that felt good.

819
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:47,946
What?

820
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,989
Who gave a beating to who?

821
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,760
Who did you meet?

822
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,389
Hong-ran.

823
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,808
Are your wounds okay now?

824
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,732
Of course. Don't worry.

825
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:29,154
Tell me you hit him more than he hit you.

826
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,657
Of course, I did.

827
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,704
You better send it to us this time.

828
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,621
All right.

829
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,039
Why don't we try this?

830
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,584
They had a lot of fun board games,
so I brought one.

831
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,379
This is the one where you spin
and answer the question that pops out.

832
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,755
You're right.

833
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,175
If anyone refuses to answer,
they drink. Deal?

834
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,261
-Deal!
-All right. Then…

835
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,181
Whoever this lands on goes first.

836
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,891
-Okay.
-Here we go.

837
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,985
It's Dr. Nam! Congratulations!

838
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:09,903
Here.

839
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,321
This is really fun.

840
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,031
-Here.
-Pick one.

841
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,251
Well…

842
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,836
Why are you so flustered?

843
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,463
Well…

844
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,925
"Are you in a relationship right now?"

845
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,890
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

846
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,350
-Come on.
-Come on.

847
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,393
-I bet you do.
-No, I don't.

848
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,187
I spin for the next person, right?

849
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,198
-Jeong-woo!
-It's me?

850
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,324
Here.

851
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,201
I'll spin it.

852
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,664
I got it.

853
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,252
What is it?

854
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,753
-Is it a weird one?
-What is it?

855
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,505
-What?
-What's with that face?

856
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,007
"When was your most recent kiss?"

857
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,468
My goodness!

858
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,470
When was it?

859
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,432
-Just answer it.
-I'm not sure. About…

860
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,101
About ten years ago?

861
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,645
I'll just drink.

862
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,854
-You're no fun.
-Seriously.

863
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,314
When was that then?

864
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,566
-Come on.
-Seriously.

865
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,653
Was today's surgery tough on you?

866
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,198
It was fine thanks to you.

867
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,703
By the way,

868
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:46,291
aren't you curious
about why I really quit the hospital?

869
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,090
You saw the photo in my room.
The one Kyung-min and I took.

870
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:02,307
Don't you want to hear
about what happened?

871
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,144
Not anymore.

872
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,900
Seeing how you asked me
if I had hit him more,

873
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,528
it seemed like you knew
that I confronted him.

874
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,491
I got a rough idea of what happened.

875
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,329
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

876
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,790
No. I'm the one who's sorry.

877
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,335
Why would you be sorry?

878
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,881
No reason.
That's how I feel when I look at you.

879
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,560
-I have a question.
-What is it?

880
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,773
Why did you say earlier
that you didn't have a boyfriend?

881
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,567
Well…

882
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,319
Am I still

883
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,363
your ex?

884
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,701
You lied too.

885
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,507
The same goes for you.

886
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,637
You still exist outside the clinic.

887
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,807
Whether you're a doctor or not…

888
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,311
you'll always be incredible.

889
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,411
It must've hurt a lot.

890
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:29,847
So?

891
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,517
You don't have a boyfriend right now?

892
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,479
I do.

893
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,858
Don't go back on your word again.

894
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,362
You too.

895
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,658
Don't get hurt again.

896
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,045
DOCTOR SLUMP

897
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,423
You're the cutest person I've ever met.

898
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,632
Someone might see us!

899
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:48,718
You're so cute!

900
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,303
I'm so dumbfounded right now!

901
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,013
Jeong-woo finally visited again.

902
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,682
But he wasn't alone.
He was with some girl.

903
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:55,600
Was she pretty?

904
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,352
You don't have a girlfriend?

905
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,146
A girlfriend? That's ridiculous.

906
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,773
I thought you were the devoted type.

907
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,692
-Ms. Kong!
-Back then, I had no idea.

908
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:05,902
Ms. Kong!

909
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:10,031
All the most trivial things
feel so tremendous.

910
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,866
Where are you, Ha-neul?

911
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:15,453
Since I'm in love, even little things
in life shine as bright as stars.

912
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:23,169
