00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,036
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,414
Good work, everyone.

3
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,832
-Good work.
-Great work, doctor.

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,250
-Can you wrap up for me?
-Okay.

5
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,129
Good job, everyone.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,887
The ST levels are down. There must be
air in the coronary arteries.

7
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,221
Let's administer the NTG.

8
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,265
Let's begin.

9
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,183
Forceps.

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,852
Six years of college. A year as an intern.

11
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,104
Four years as a resident.
Three as a fellow.

12
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,026
I worked like a dog seven days a week.
In the end, I was left with…

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,569
You have depression.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,865
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to start you on some medication.

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,034
…an illness of the mind.

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,051
On some days, all I wanted to do
was just lie down like this.

17
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,807
On other days,
I was motivated to do something.

18
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,102
Goodness.

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,565
Why are you sighing
while folding my underwear?

20
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,275
This one is 75A.

21
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,320
This one is 75B.

22
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,738
This one is 75C.

23
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,202
You buy whatever's on the rack,
so they're all different sizes.

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,376
-Hello.
-Excuse me.

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,754
Could you show me
your most expensive underwear set?

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,548
Sure.

27
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,176
And on some days,

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,388
I think, "From now on,
let's live for myself."

29
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,266
What difference will wearing these make?

30
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:28,481
But on other days,
everything just seems futile.

31
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,193
Then, there were days

32
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,029
when I wanted to work again.

33
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,329
INSTANT NOODLES

34
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,791
There were also days

35
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,546
when I wanted to stay unemployed.

36
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,061
Damn it.

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,605
"Ambivalence."

38
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,816
AMBIVALENCE

39
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,614
"The state of having
contradictory feelings."

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,330
Depression forms a defense mechanism.

41
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,000
To squeeze out serotonin
and dopamine to make you happy,

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:33,463
you feel a desire to overcome depression
and to give up at the same time.

43
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,926
So even it feels
like you'll be in despair forever…

44
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,264
Ha-neul, what's wrong?

45
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,482
It must've been so hard.

46
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,110
It's okay.

47
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,197
It'll all be okay.

48
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,285
…within that despair,

49
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,997
hope can sometimes arise.

50
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,543
I don't know…

51
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,507
what to do with my mind and heart either.

52
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,387
DOCTOR SLUMP

53
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,932
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

54
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,232
-Going somewhere?
-I'm going out for a jog.

55
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,694
Good. They say moderate exercise
is great for depression.

56
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,612
I saw it on Live Info Show.

57
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,323
When you work out… What was it again?

58
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,829
It produces happy hormones called sergei--

59
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:48,871
Serotonin.

60
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,082
Right, serotonin.

61
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,043
-It also produces oxytoxy.
-Oxytocin.

62
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,087
Right, oxytocin.

63
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,299
Anyway, they help you feel
less depressed and…

64
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,470
But then again,
I'm sure you know better than me.

65
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,098
-Anyway, go on then.
-Okay.

66
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,474
Here's our next story.

67
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,228
The third hearing over the death
of a casino heiress from Macau

68
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,772
will commence in three days.

69
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,818
Yeo, the doctor who conducted the surgery,
says he didn't violate medical law.

70
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,570
-He maintains these claims.
-Goodness.

71
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,324
I hate that rooftop fellow so much
for rejecting you.

72
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,534
But seeing this makes me feel bad for him.

73
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,496
If he truly is innocent,
he must be suffering so much right now.

74
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,665
Goodness.

75
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,969
Hello, detective.
Did you identify the fingerprints?

76
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,388
We got the results, but you see…

77
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,392
They attempted
to lift the fingerprints twice.

78
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,729
But the fingerprints weren't clear enough.

79
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,691
We asked for a reexamination,
so please be patient.

80
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,862
We also searched your entire clinic,
but we didn't find any other cameras.

81
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,200
I wonder who installed
all of those hidden cameras.

82
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,035
Please call me when the results are out.

83
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,245
Okay. I'll let you know right away.

84
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,081
All right.

85
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,649
-Hi.
-Hey.

86
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,654
Look. About hugging you yesterday--

87
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,947
It's okay.

88
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,492
You already told me
how you weren't all there these days.

89
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,369
-I know that's why.
-It's not though.

90
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,916
I hugged you yesterday
because my heart told me to.

91
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,255
Let's talk.

92
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,810
I have so much I want to say.

93
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,188
But I'll put aside my feelings
and ask this first.

94
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,068
You're suffering from PTSD, aren't you?

95
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,993
You've had nightmares
and felt guilty ever since the incident.

96
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,078
You're afraid it'll happen again, right?

97
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,249
It wasn't your fault.

98
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,461
It was just an accident,
and it was likely the patient's mistake--

99
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,089
Still, I keep thinking about it.

100
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,678
You should've told me. I was the only one
always letting it out and being comforted.

101
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,346
I had no idea you were in pain.

102
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,850
I even asked like a fool
if you cared about me. Jeez.

103
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,146
You're free today, right?

104
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,648
I need you to come with me.

105
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,234
To where?

106
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,666
-This looks good.
-Why are you suddenly buying wine?

107
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,169
Having a glass before bed
helps you sleep better.

108
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,004
You probably have trouble sleeping.

109
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,178
I sleep fine though.

110
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,269
-What's that?
-This suits you well.

111
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,314
It's made of pure cotton,
so it'll feel nice too.

112
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,649
Why pajamas all of a sudden?

113
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,944
They say you sleep better
in more comfortable clothes.

114
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,571
I see.

115
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,871
If you don't wash your bedding often,
you'll breed dust mites

116
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,581
and it'll lower your sleep quality.

117
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,626
If you wash it thoroughly
and dry it under the sun,

118
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,836
it'll be nice and soft
to help you sleep better.

119
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,130
I see. Sure.

120
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,509
Also,

121
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,137
I think I've become interested in you.

122
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,223
-What?
-My goodness.

123
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,481
I mean, couldn't you have found
a better time to say something like that?

124
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,652
To be honest, I'm confused too.

125
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,155
Just like how we're prone to infections
when our immune system is weak,

126
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,575
my mind's in a weakened state.

127
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,369
Maybe that's why
I was easily infected by you.

128
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,124
Are you saying being interested in me
is like being "infected"?

129
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,379
I don't know. I'm not sure
if I'm interested or infected.

130
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,006
Anyway, it feels strange.

131
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,259
It's much stronger than just friendship.

132
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,512
But it's too early to say
I have feelings for you.

133
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,392
That's just how I feel.

134
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,356
But I should put that on hold, right?

135
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:08,941
What?

136
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,445
You have a lot of things
to take care of before my feelings.

137
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,199
Your hearing is in two days.
And you owe 3.8 billion won in debt.

138
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,660
It's 3.7 billion, not 3.8.

139
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,872
I paid some of it off
after selling my clinic,

140
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,665
so I only owe 560 million won now.

141
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,503
Anyways, you're suffering from PTSD too.

142
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,882
I think you should figure out
those issues first.

143
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,137
So let's discuss our feelings later.

144
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,016
Sure.

145
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,981
I think it's done.

146
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,027
-Let's rinse it.
-Okay.

147
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,154
Let's do that.

148
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,453
-Hold it tight. Don't let go.
-Okay.

149
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,832
About what I said yesterday…

150
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,460
About how I missed you…

151
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,128
I meant it.

152
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,923
Hey.

153
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,258
You told me to hold it tight.

154
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,929
Sorry. It slipped out of my hands.

155
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,016
Why is he telling me this right now?

156
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,062
To be honest, things are really tough.

157
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,606
But I'm hanging in there thanks to you.

158
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,736
So just wait for me a little bit.

159
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,907
Let's see if this is
just a strong friendship,

160
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,827
an infection due to a weak immune system,

161
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,205
or some other feeling.

162
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,585
Whatever it may be,
I want to be ready first.

163
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,932
Hold tight.
I'm going to wring it hard now.

164
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,565
All done.

165
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,527
Hong-ran!

166
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,279
Hello, ma'am. How are you?

167
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,951
At this age, nothing much goes on.
I'm just getting along.

168
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,327
What brings you here?

169
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,830
I stopped by to return a book to Ha-neul.

170
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,415
-I see.
-Where is she?

171
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,585
Right. She went out to exercise
and hasn't come back yet.

172
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,253
-Should I call her?
-Hey, Hong-ran.

173
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,172
I saw her go upstairs with Mr. Rooftop.

174
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,217
What? She went to the rooftop with him?

175
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,385
Unbelievable.

176
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,180
Why would she hang out
with him after getting rejected?

177
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,306
My goodness.

178
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,185
"Rejected"? Who was rejected?

179
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,438
Ha-neul. She was brutally rejected
by Mr. Rooftop.

180
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,106
What?

181
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,025
She asked him,

182
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,236
"You care about me, right?"

183
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,990
Then he replied, "To be honest,
I don't have feelings for you."

184
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,617
"I was just being nice as a friend."

185
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,785
"I'm sorry if I confused you.
I'll be more careful."

186
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,037
That's what he said.

187
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,872
And we happened to overhear them.

188
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,875
He really said he'd be more careful and…

189
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,295
He totally gave mixed signals,
and now he just wants to be friends?

190
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,548
That sly scumbag. He just wanted to flirt.

191
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,674
That's right!

192
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,065
Right. Hong-ran said she'd stop by.
I should go downstairs.

193
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,484
Okay. Thanks for today.

194
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,319
No problem.

195
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,702
Hey…

196
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,913
What is it?

197
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,623
You see…

198
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,212
Call me if you have nightmares.
We'll play Go-Stop all night.

199
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,880
I should put what I learned to use.

200
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,590
All right.

201
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,385
Bye.

202
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,636
Bye.

203
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,349
Right. Are preparations
for the hearing going well?

204
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,143
I guess.

205
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,645
Yeah, things will work out.

206
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,148
All right, then. I'm really leaving now.

207
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,406
-Hey--
-What do you want to say?

208
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,534
-What?
-Aren't you acting like this

209
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,119
because you have something to say?

210
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,333
Not only are you smart
but you also catch on quick.

211
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,337
Why are you beating around the bush?

212
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,256
You see…

213
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,261
Well…

214
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,808
Have you thought of
visiting a psychiatrist?

215
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,773
You can get a consultation
and some medicine.

216
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,108
I'm not that weak.

217
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,737
It's not that bad yet.

218
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:12,494
I think as time goes by,
things will just get better.

219
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,207
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,338
After I got treatment, I felt much better.
That's why I suggested it.

221
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,424
I crossed the line. I apologize.

222
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,511
-No, that's not what I meant--
-Ha-neul!

223
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,558
You're hiding up here
after calling me over?

224
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,477
When did you come?
And how did you find me?

225
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,978
-Come on.
-What?

226
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,733
All right.

227
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,652
Okay! Slow down!

228
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,241
Let go of me. What's wrong with you?

229
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,993
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

230
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,330
Why are you hanging out
with a guy who rejected you?

231
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,832
-Rejected me?
-I heard everything.

232
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,960
About how Jeong-woo totally rejected you.

233
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,212
-Ba-da, you bastard.
-I'm sorry.

234
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,673
I shouldn't have kept saying he liked you.

235
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,426
I only made you feel ashamed,
humiliated, and mortified.

236
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,971
-That's not it--
-Forget it.

237
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,808
Don't you ever talk
to that sly jerk again.

238
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:21,063
Naive bookworms like you
are easy targets for guys like him.

239
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,399
And when you're struggling mentally,

240
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,735
it's easy to have poor judgment,
so you need to be strong.

241
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,821
Are you taking your medication?

242
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,615
Are you okay?

243
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,285
I'm fine, and I'm taking my medication!

244
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,795
You didn't forget about us
grabbing some coffee, right?

245
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,091
What's with your face?

246
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,679
To be honest, I--

247
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,057
I'm not curious.
Just leave and give me peace.

248
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,901
Let's meet up soon.

249
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,029
I'll be in touch.

250
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,948
There's a bug!

251
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,243
-Hold on.
-It's a bug!

252
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,715
LEE HONG-RAN
HOPE OBGYN CLINIC

253
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,508
"Lee Hong-ran"?

254
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,427
Do you know me?

255
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,182
Hello. I run a plastic surgery clinic
across the hall.

256
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,892
My name is Bin Dae-yeong.

257
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,020
You went on that blind date,
thinking it was me.

258
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,313
-You're him, right?
-Yes.

259
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,982
But how do you know me?

260
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,776
Well, what happened was…

261
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,863
Excuse me.

262
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,254
If it's okay with you, let's…

263
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,341
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,738
Let's grab some coffee next time.

265
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,464
What are you so happy about?

266
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,468
Is it a woman? Another blind date?

267
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,471
What blind date? It's nothing like that.

268
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,726
Hear me out, Dad.

269
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,854
If you're going out on a blind date,

270
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,149
at least do it somewhere far away
from our neighborhood.

271
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,569
My friends tease me
about you going on dates.

272
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,821
Eun-jeong, look at my ears.

273
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,075
-They're about to bleed.
-Come on.

274
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,160
Give it a rest.

275
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,772
Do you want to play Go-Stop?

276
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,399
Out of nowhere?

277
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,576
What?

278
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,953
What is it? Are you okay?

279
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
-About what?
-Didn't you have a nightmare?

280
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,419
-No.
-Then, why ask me to play cards?

281
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,504
-I just wanted to hang out.
-What?

282
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,926
You little… Hey, I take it back.

283
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,011
I'm not interested in you anymore.

284
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,805
I'll go see a psychiatrist.

285
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:26,975
I'll go.

286
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,022
But…

287
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,026
It's not something
I should force you to do.

288
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,237
And you don't have to
if you don't want to.

289
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,534
To be honest,
I did once think about going.

290
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,913
But it wasn't easy
to admit that I needed help.

291
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:53,585
And given the publicity around my case,
opening up to someone didn't seem easy.

292
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,424
But…

293
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,511
I think I could go if you came with me.

294
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,014
What? You're old enough
to see a doctor by yourself.

295
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,432
Is that a no then?

296
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,061
-Fine.
-Then, let's grab some food afterward.

297
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,731
-Fine.
-Don't take back being interested in me.

298
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,318
We'll see about that.

299
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,071
You didn't have a nightmare,
so I won't play cards.

300
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,324
Jeez.

301
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,245
I shouldn't have rushed over.
How embarrassing.

302
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,920
I noticed earlier
that this light was broken.

303
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,172
I'll light your way, so go down safely.

304
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,717
Go ahead, then.

305
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,015
Be careful.

306
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,518
-Good night.
-Good night.

307
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,120
Mom, wake up. I'm hungry.

308
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,667
Jin-woo, sleep a bit more. It's 5:00 a.m.

309
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:22,299
Ultra knee kick!

310
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,929
Ultra power!

311
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,482
I don't know if this is
a late-night snack or breakfast.

312
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,651
Whatever it is, I hope you enjoy it.

313
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,322
Can't I just live with you, Mom?

314
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:46,948
What?

315
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,702
I want to live with you
all seven days of the week.

316
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,166
I wish you could too,

317
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,294
but I'm really busy from Monday to Friday.

318
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,507
I need to go to work even at night
if someone's about to have a baby.

319
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,510
Then, you'll be all alone in the dark.

320
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,554
I'd be worried, and you'd be scared.

321
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,643
Grandma has a big yard
with rabbits and chicks, right?

322
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,397
How about you have a blast there
and you can come live with me every day

323
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,275
once you enter elementary school?

324
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,405
Then, let's go catch
some insects next Saturday.

325
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,033
From ladybugs to dragonflies. All of them.

326
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,827
I'll catch all of them, okay?

327
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,620
I'll study how to catch them.

328
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,789
-You're the best!
-I'm the best.

329
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,633
There's instant coffee over there.

330
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,218
You can read those books too.

331
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,804
The toilet is outside to your right.

332
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,267
Are you a mental health clinic tour guide?

333
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,731
-That was a deadly blow.
-Don't be such a baby.

334
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,608
"Don't let anyone know of my death."

335
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,195
-Mr. Yeo Jeong-woo?
-Yes?

336
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,321
Please come inside.

337
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,871
SUNSHINE MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

338
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,851
SUNSHINE MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

339
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,945
What is this? A medicine eating show?

340
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,365
It feels nice to take it with someone.

341
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,661
Man, who would've known
the former top two students in Korea

342
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:01,875
would be taking mental health medication
in broad daylight at a park decades later?

343
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,691
Hey, it's okay. We're just going through
a rough patch. That's all.

344
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,486
Don't get discouraged.
Things will look up for us soon.

345
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,615
What? No way!

346
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,867
I found 500 won!

347
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,120
Hey, it's my first time
finding money in the street.

348
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,082
See? I told you things will look up!

349
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,503
It's 500 won! I found a 500-won coin!

350
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,922
-Isn't that Ms. Kong's daughter?
-It's 500 won!

351
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,216
-The anesthesiologist.
-A doctor?

352
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,135
What kind of doctor
gets that excited over finding 500 won?

353
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,513
I get it. You can stop now.

354
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,891
What's wrong? This is awesome.
Not everyone finds 500 won.

355
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,310
-What should we do with this?
-That's enough.

356
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,188
What's something fun we can do?

357
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,773
-I'm so excited!
-Please stop.

358
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,650
I'm so excited!

359
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,193
We shouldn't do this here.

360
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,903
-I found 500 won!
-Can you please stop?

361
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,447
I found 500 won. Hey, come on. Hey!

362
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,616
That's the first 500-won coin
I ever found.

363
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,576
-Don't take it.
-I'll give it to you later.

364
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,087
Look. We get to play
a free round with money we found.

365
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,672
Isn't life just great?

366
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,050
We may be struggling right now,
but we have potential.

367
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:38,096
Once we return to work later,
we'll gain recognition again.

368
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,641
No matter what people say,
we're doctors who save lives.

369
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,270
-When are you going to be done?
-What in the world?

370
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,063
We've been waiting for ages.

371
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,816
Why? You should go home and study instead.

372
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,234
I already get good grades.

373
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,071
My teacher said I could become
a judge, a prosecutor, or a doctor.

374
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:59,117
I already grew up and became a doctor.

375
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,788
Don't lie. What kind of doctor
plays arcade games?

376
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,915
Hey, why can't doctors play too?

377
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,710
We're both doctors.
An anesthesiologist and a plastic surgeon.

378
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,546
And until recently,
I worked at a huge hospital.

379
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,593
Let's stop and head to karaoke now.
You really enjoyed it last time.

380
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,512
I want to sing
a song for you. Let's go now.

381
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,431
-What?
-Let's go. Get up.

382
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,515
You can play now.

383
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,437
Hey, I was just about to break my record.

384
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,606
-I know.
-It was almost the highest score…

385
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,234
-Why do you want to sing for me?
-I mean…

386
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:38,198
You said you never listened back then
to songs and were curious about them.

387
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,369
So I'll sing you some of those songs
and make you feel nostalgic.

388
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,877
Listen carefully.
This song was popular back then.

389
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,843
I cried a lot after you left

390
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,346
I was all alone

391
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,393
Will I never be able to see you again?

392
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:15,026
I thought seeing someone else
would help me easily forget you

393
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:20,031
That foolish thought of mine was wrong.

394
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,909
You said

395
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,119
You only loved me…

396
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,286
What?

397
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,456
Is he talking about me?

398
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:34,087
Are you really okay after leaving me?

399
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,755
Hey!

400
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,676
Can you sing a different song?

401
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,303
You see, my ears were hurting.

402
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,347
Your ears were hurting?

403
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,224
All right.

404
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:53,398
If you know someone nice,
introduce me to them

405
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:58,236
Someone who can be
gentle and passionate

406
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,364
Someone who will

407
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,867
Genuinely love me…

408
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,495
What? Is he talking about me again?

409
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,621
My goodness.

410
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,706
I'd like that

411
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,377
If you know someone nice,
introduce me to them

412
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,297
I mean, what's the matter with him?

413
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,507
Gosh, it's hot.

414
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,343
Even about the little things…

415
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,730
Why are you suddenly being so awkward?

416
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,567
Well, you said you wanted
to sing some songs for me,

417
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,611
but I didn't know
you'd confess your feelings.

418
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,616
I mean, I get that it's difficult
for you to hide your feelings.

419
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,951
But you said you weren't ready.

420
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,038
I put my feelings aside
so you wouldn't feel uncomfortable.

421
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,582
But then you went and confessed.

422
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,376
"Confessed"? When did I do that?

423
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:00,048
Back there.
You kept mentioning me in each song.

424
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,841
When did I do that?

425
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,636
When you sang…

426
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,014
You said you only loved me

427
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,227
That wasn't about you.
Those are the lyrics.

428
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,686
So it's…

429
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:18,858
You said you only loved me

430
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,028
Then, what about that other one…

431
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,989
You'll genuinely love me

432
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,993
Someone who will

433
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,372
Genuinely love me

434
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,420
I was just kidding.

435
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,717
What could this be?

436
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,846
It seems like you mistook
my singing for confessing my love.

437
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,472
That's not true.

438
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,974
I was just joking.

439
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,310
I beg to differ.
I think you misunderstood.

440
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,062
Seriously. I said I didn't.

441
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,898
You're being so childish
teasing me right now.

442
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,985
I take it back.
I take back being interested in you.

443
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:06,072
You're always saying that.
Hey, how come your interest is so shallow?

444
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,156
Why is it so fickle?

445
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,410
What are you talking about?

446
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,039
-Hey, Ha-neul.
-What do you want?

447
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,625
Thanks.

448
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,338
You've been trying all day to cheer me up.

449
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,301
Thanks.

450
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,137
Well…

451
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:35,351
I know how awful it feels to be depressed.

452
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,730
But…

453
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,524
It really wasn't a confession.

454
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,276
What do you take me for?

455
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,071
Do you think I'd confess my love
at an arcade or at karaoke?

456
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,951
Maybe it's because you've been single
all your life, but you're so clueless.

457
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,289
Don't be ridiculous.
Single all my life? I've dated before.

458
00:31:56,372 --> 00:32:00,293
I've been in tragic, desperate,
and heartbreaking relationships before.

459
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,378
I see.

460
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,589
Yeo Jeong-woo?

461
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,969
It's you, right?
From Yeongwon High School?

462
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,848
Yes, but who…

463
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,354
-You're--
-Yes, the third-ranked student!

464
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,149
Gosh, it's so good to…

465
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:28,613
Aren't you that girl from Busan
who was obsessed with studying? Right?

466
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,656
Yeah.

467
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,074
Your name was Nam…

468
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,701
Nam… It had something to do with nature.

469
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,037
Nam Ba-da? Nam Na-mu? Anyways!

470
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,247
Anyway, I'm so happy to see you!

471
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,042
I never thought I'd see you here.
We were destined to meet.

472
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,377
Should we grab some coffee?

473
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,963
-Sure, let's do that.
-Sure.

474
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,422
Why are you two here together?

475
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,425
Are there any coffee shops nearby?
Let's go.

476
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,426
Okay.

477
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,930
Unbelievable.

478
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,474
I can't believe I ran into you two here.

479
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,185
I never imagined you two
would've stayed in touch.

480
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,271
We live in the same neighborhood,
and we ran into each other.

481
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,690
I see.

482
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,733
I was in the area for a meeting nearby.

483
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,276
How have you been?

484
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,195
I've been doing okay.

485
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,656
I was the second-best…

486
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:16,327
The third-best student
after you transferred to our school.

487
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,413
But the gap between us was pretty big.

488
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,623
What about you two?

489
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,545
Everything will work out.
I saw you on the news.

490
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,798
Of course, you did.
It's the talk of the town.

491
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,259
Is the third hearing in two days?

492
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,637
Gosh, you even know the date?

493
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,390
I was worried,
so I've been glued to the news.

494
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,102
Medication that thins the blood?

495
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,188
I heard the patient
had been taking it for a long time.

496
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,234
And you found a case with a similar cause
of death from similar medicine.

497
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,445
Then, won't you have
an advantage in this hearing?

498
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,572
You must've watched a lot news.

499
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,746
Right. Ha-neul was the one
who found that dissertation.

500
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,127
The truth would've been revealed
even without it.

501
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,047
Because truth always prevails.

502
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,760
Also, I never doubted you.

503
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,013
Thanks for believing in me.

504
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,807
Former classmates are the best.

505
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,602
We weren't just classmates.

506
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,521
What?

507
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,566
We used to be interested in each other.

508
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,821
"Interested"?

509
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,158
Us?

510
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,956
-Don't you remember?
-Seriously?

511
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,178
Enjoy your meal.

512
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,891
You always gave only me extra sausages
whenever you were on lunch serving duty.

513
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,563
And when the top 20 students
had their own study hall,

514
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,565
you treated me really well.

515
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,568
Jeong-woo. Can I borrow your eraser?

516
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,946
You can have it.

517
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,240
I can have it?

518
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,205
Don't you remember giving me
your eraser when I asked to borrow it?

519
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,333
I had a ton of sausages back then.

520
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,295
And using an eraser to flirt?

521
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,588
I mean, come on.

522
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,466
You kept showing interest in me,

523
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,552
so that made me
develop feelings for you too.

524
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,012
Gosh, I'm talking too much.

525
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,765
But it's all in the past, right?

526
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,356
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I thought it was the table leg.

527
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,113
-Hey, do you remember this too?
-I'm not sure.

528
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,323
I don't know what it is,
but don't tell me. Stop.

529
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,743
Remember punching and kicking
the students who harassed me?

530
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,163
Punching too?

531
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,914
What could this be about?

532
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,625
You went to the students who bullied me,

533
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,669
and then, you beat them all up.

534
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,633
Hurry up and take it.

535
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,312
What are you doing?

536
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,439
What?

537
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,857
Who the hell are you?

538
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,234
Hey.

539
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,820
I asked you a question.

540
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,206
Let go of me.

541
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,748
I felt like I was
the female lead in a novel.

542
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,917
He was so cool back then.

543
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,293
And he still is.

544
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,259
It's getting late. Should we go?

545
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,761
I have to prepare for the hearing.

546
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,513
All right.

547
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,224
I'd like to pay.

548
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,726
-All right.
-He hasn't changed his number, right?

549
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,979
Probably not.

550
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,232
Do you think if I text him,
he'll remember his past feelings?

551
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,567
We shared so many memories.

552
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,986
I see.

553
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,950
It was great seeing you two today.

554
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,868
Let's meet up again after the trial.

555
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,954
Sure. Okay.

556
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,709
Hang in there. I believe in you.

557
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,550
Thanks a lot. It was nice seeing you too.

558
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,845
-You should go.
-Bye.

559
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,929
Bye, Nam…

560
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,890
Bye.

561
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,862
You used to treat me so coldly

562
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,531
but acted like the male lead
of a novel for her.

563
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,117
I'm not sure.

564
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,661
-I can't quite remember.
-You can't?

565
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,707
You don't remember
despite showing all that interest in her?

566
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,918
It looks like your interest
is shallower and more fickle.

567
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,712
-You see--
-Hey.

568
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,715
Remember serving me
only bell peppers during lunch?

569
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,468
-What? I did?
-Yes. You did!

570
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,261
I have terrific memory.

571
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,139
But you gave her all the sausages?

572
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,725
You'll get punished
for discriminating people with food.

573
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,226
Shame on you!

574
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,239
What's her deal?

575
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,033
Wait…

576
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,209
It was strange.

577
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,463
I didn't care about being unemployed
in front of my former classmate.

578
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,133
I was consumed
by the childish feeling of jealousy…

579
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,011
Jealousy? Don't be absurd.

580
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,179
That's insane.

581
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,022
Jeez!

582
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,816
That hurts. My goodness!

583
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,994
When did I give her
all those sausages and erasers?

584
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,588
Stir-fried sausages and vegetables.

585
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,299
Don't give me any bell peppers
or onions, my friend.

586
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,052
Likewise. I just want the sausages.

587
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,681
Just take what I give you
and shove it in, my friends. Enjoy.

588
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,851
-Let me eat a lot to grow.
-Sorry, but you're done growing.

589
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,912
Enjoy your meal.

590
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:57,955
You can do it.

591
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,762
Enjoy your meal.

592
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,311
Enjoy your meal.

593
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,699
What's wrong?

594
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,368
You don't have an eraser?
Want to borrow mine?

595
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,122
Actually, I'll cut off a piece for you.

596
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,833
We need to study all day. One minute.

597
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,984
About this much?

598
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,116
Here you go.

599
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,119
What's wrong?

600
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,331
You rarely make anything mistakes,
so I doubt you'll need much.

601
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,917
Am I wrong?

602
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,378
Forget it.

603
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:28,837
Here.

604
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,631
Oh, no. It fell.

605
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,101
Jeong-woo.

606
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,271
Can I borrow your eraser?

607
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:46,981
You can have it.

608
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,649
I can have it?

609
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,114
Why did I do that to her?

610
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,200
I don't even look at people
I'm not interested in.

611
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,743
So why?

612
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,035
The third hearing over the death
of a casino heiress will begin tomorrow.

613
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:45,080
During the previous hearing,
the defense's witness refused to appear…

614
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,000
Gosh, what's with her? This is annoying.

615
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,131
Ha-neul, aren't you curious
about who's annoying me and why?

616
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,300
No, not at all.

617
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,470
You should still hear me out.

618
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,096
You need to be a good listener too.

619
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,353
The thing is

620
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,105
there's this girl I'm interested in.

621
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,193
-And the feelings are mutual.
-Then, go out with her.

622
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,779
I'm in no position
to date someone right now.

623
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,989
-I don't have a job.
-Then, find one.

624
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:23,452
That's not what's important.
Anyway, my situation's not that great,

625
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,996
so until I found a job
or inherited this building,

626
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,666
I was waiting to proudly ask her out.

627
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,834
But guess what?

628
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,546
She's best friends with the girl
I liked in high school.

629
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,300
What? A girl you liked in high school?

630
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,261
Yeah, so she's being
extremely jealous right now.

631
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,264
But it's a bit flustering for me.

632
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,227
Why would she be childish and jealous
over a girl I liked back in high school?

633
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,146
It's all in the past.

634
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,441
And it's not like we were
in a relationship.

635
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,568
And she's not even my girlfriend yet.

636
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,322
-Don't you agree?
-You're right.

637
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,282
Also,

638
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,410
I was about to rank up in my game.

639
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,995
I had one more match
to win before ranking up,

640
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,705
so I was totally focused.

641
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,876
It was such an important situation for me.

642
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,962
I'm so upset right now.

643
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,089
I was already stressed
with a bunch of stuff.

644
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,260
Being jealous over something
from high school is so immature.

645
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,179
Did he have second thoughts?
Please say something.

646
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,557
Yeah, now that you mention it,
it's a bit…

647
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,560
It's not a bit.
She's being totally obnoxious.

648
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,103
She's just garbage.

649
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,860
Don't be so harsh.
I'm sure she has her reasons.

650
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,074
-Uncle Tae-seon.
-Sir.

651
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,161
I've eaten here for a decade,
and I've never been this upset.

652
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,914
We won't ever come again
if you mistreat your regulars like this.

653
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,167
-Gosh!
-Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

654
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,878
-How annoying.
-Ma'am, you see…

655
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,881
We'll have better service
the next time you come.

656
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,924
Uncle Tae-seon, what's going on?

657
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:05,471
A social media influencer
came to our restaurant today.

658
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,891
But they don't bother me at all.
I treat my customers the same.

659
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,059
That stuff doesn't make you special.

660
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,853
Right.

661
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,355
But those customers said

662
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,275
I gave bigger dumplings
and more cucumbers to that influencer.

663
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,318
So they were upset.

664
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:24,865
The amount of cucumber we serve
can differ sometimes.

665
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,242
How can they be so upset over less food?

666
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,372
Hey. Remember serving me
only bell peppers during lunch?

667
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,500
-What? I did?
-Yes. You did!

668
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,627
But you gave her all the sausages?

669
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,755
You'll get punished
for discriminating people with food.

670
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,340
Shame on you!

671
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:48,388
But maybe they weren't upset
about getting less food.

672
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,391
Maybe they just felt
less important than that influencer

673
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,018
and felt hurt.

674
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,645
Still, they didn't need to hit him.

675
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,021
Exactly.

676
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,273
Decent human beings don't do that.

677
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,025
-You think so?
-Yes.

678
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,411
What brings you here?

679
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,541
I just came to help out
since your part-time worker quit.

680
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,377
Gosh, I'm fine.
Just go up and rest, Doctor.

681
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,504
Your mom is all I need here.

682
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,548
Okay.

683
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:27,803
Uncle Tae-seon,
can I take some dumplings to go?

684
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,017
I was insane. All that over nothing
so close to his hearing…

685
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,065
"Eat this. Sorry about yesterday."

686
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,780
"Do you want some?
My uncle made these dumplings."

687
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,323
I…

688
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,117
"Do you want some?"

689
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,868
-What are you doing?
-My goodness!

690
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,830
Do you want some?
My dumpling made these uncles. No.

691
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,416
My uncle made these dumplings.

692
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:01,878
Let's eat together.

693
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,470
It must be nice.

694
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,473
They probably think
their love will last forever.

695
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,103
-Hello.
-Over here.

696
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,396
Hello.

697
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,611
Did you wait a long time?

698
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,945
No, I just got here.

699
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,656
Should we order something?

700
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,499
So how exactly do you know me?

701
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,376
Right.

702
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:45,547
It's been about three months
since I started my own NeoTube channel.

703
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,467
I wasn't copying Yeo Jeong-woo at all.

704
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,677
Yeo Jeong-woo, the nation's-- No.

705
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,639
Do you know Yeo Jeong-woo,
formerly the "nation's doctor"?

706
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,349
Yes.

707
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,060
Anyways, I wasn't trying to copy anyone.

708
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:02,105
I only started it
because I was bored with life.

709
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,565
Then one day,

710
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,734
someone subscribed to me.

711
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,236
-Is that right?
-Yes.

712
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,449
And someone with the same name
as that subscriber asked for a blind date.

713
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,117
Is that so?

714
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,370
Yes. It was you, Ms. Lee Hong-ran.

715
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,915
-What?
-What?

716
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:20,999
"Lee Hong-ran"?

717
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,834
-Yes.
-Lee Hong-ran?

718
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,586
To be frank,

719
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,339
I didn't know if you were the same person.

720
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,841
So I wanted to meet up
to ask you that today.

721
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,843
It's not me.

722
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,763
As you know,
the blind date was a misunderstanding.

723
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,015
And I've never subscribed to your channel.

724
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,602
Really?

725
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,647
Yes, I rarely watch anything
on NeoTube to begin with.

726
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,401
-Look.
-You don't need to show me.

727
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,820
I haven't subscribed to anyone.

728
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,905
FOLDING CRANES WITH BLANKETS

729
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,159
-You did subscribe to me.
-What?

730
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,370
That can't be.

731
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,247
NEOTUBE
RECENTLY VIEWED

732
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,875
Today, we'll be folding a crane…

733
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,043
Who is this idiot?

734
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:06,837
Who would watch this?

735
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,463
THE MICHELANGELO OF SURGERY
SUBSCRIBE

736
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,805
I must be crazy.
Why did I subscribe to this?

737
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,598
Jeez, I must've been insane.

738
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,267
-I should unsubscribe.
-Hold on.

739
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,518
You don't have to do that.

740
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,019
Why did I subscribe to this?

741
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,363
I feel a bit bad.

742
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,573
You don't have to.

743
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:39,661
Your videos aren't my cup of tea,
but I'm sure you'll get many subscribers.

744
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,789
No, that's all right.
I'm not trying to be like Jeong-woo.

745
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,501
Why do you keep mentioning him?

746
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,505
Hey, you're both plastic surgeons.
Do you know each other?

747
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,840
Well,

748
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,675
we both went to HNU.

749
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,343
But we're not that close.

750
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,263
I'm glad that you're not friends
with that scumbag.

751
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,558
"Scumbag"?

752
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,146
Jeong-woo isn't a bad person.

753
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,482
He definitely is.

754
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,649
I beg to differ.

755
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,779
You must've seen the news,
but that was just a medical accident.

756
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,032
He's not the type to harm someone
and feign innocence.

757
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,575
This isn't about that.

758
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:23,330
It's because of how he's busy
seducing women amid controversy.

759
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,291
He never seduced anyone!

760
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,668
Did you witness it? Did you?

761
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,962
I thought you said you weren't close.

762
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,131
Forget it. I'm leaving.

763
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,133
Fine by me. How unbelievable.

764
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,261
What? It's a dragonfly.

765
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,846
-What?
-Hold on.

766
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,223
Stay still.

767
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,891
Why? What's the matter?

768
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,852
Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

769
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,562
-What is it?
-Stay still.

770
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,105
What? What is it?

771
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,984
-What are you doing?
-There's a dragonfly on your head.

772
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,363
-What?
-My son really loves insects.

773
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,948
-So?
-I'm sorry.

774
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,200
-But can we visit a stationery store?
-Why?

775
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,993
-To buy an insect container.
-What?

776
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,745
Are you serious right now?

777
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,831
Please! I was so lucky to find this.

778
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,874
-Let's go right now.
-Wait.

779
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,669
-Be careful.
-We're going like this?

780
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,672
-Where's the store?
-Nearby!

781
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,508
This is a nice combo.

782
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,803
Dumplings and beer
go pretty well together.

783
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,221
-Right?
-Yeah.

784
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,641
I always had beer and my uncle's dumplings
whenever I was stressed.

785
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,769
Are you stressed right now too?

786
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,064
You're angry
because of the classmate we met.

787
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,276
I mean, I wouldn't say I'm angry.

788
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,236
I was just jealous.

789
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,491
I'm interested in you,

790
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,035
but I heard you two liked each other.

791
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,621
I saw you holding hands, and I hated it.

792
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,711
This was my first time feeling jealous.

793
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,547
It wasn't beautiful at all.

794
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,591
I feel like a loser. I hate it.

795
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,468
So what'll you do?

796
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,013
You feel bad, so you'll take back
being interested again?

797
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,182
No, not really.

798
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,602
It's just difficult.

799
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,439
We learned about ambivalence.

800
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,859
It's when contradictory feelings coexist.

801
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,529
That's how I feel now.

802
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,036
I'm struggling so I'm taking medication
and a break from work.

803
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:30,415
But I keep thinking of you,
and I worry about you.

804
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,502
Plus, I was consumed by jealousy.

805
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,548
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

806
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,426
I'm not exactly sure.

807
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,181
I feel the same way.

808
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,892
I know I shouldn't feel this way,

809
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,896
but I can't control my feelings.

810
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,443
I have a ton of things I want to tell you,
but I'm holding myself back.

811
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,781
What are all the things
you want to tell me?

812
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,575
Just some things.

813
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,997
Come on, what are they?
Just tell me one of them.

814
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,293
I like you.

815
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,214
Hey, don't throw away that dumpling.

816
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,176
No, I didn't. I just swooned…
I mean, I was startled.

817
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,891
I mean it.

818
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,813
I'm only able to
stay strong thanks to you.

819
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:41,653
You're like a drug
someone prescribed for me.

820
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,492
I didn't see a doctor despite having PTSD.

821
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,245
Maybe it was because of you.

822
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:56,543
Maybe I didn't go because you'd help me
get back on my feet every time.

823
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,758
Once these troubles are resolved,

824
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,430
then I'll confess
my love for you properly.

825
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,100
Not at an arcade or at karaoke.

826
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,152
What in the world? Did you think
that would make me swoon?

827
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:34,998
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

828
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:39,836
I swear I never had a thing
with the third-ranked student. Never.

829
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,171
All right.

830
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,049
I was jealous,
but I'm proud of one thing you did.

831
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,385
Punishing the guys
who secretly took photos.

832
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,054
They deserve a beating.

833
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,850
Why do some people take photos like that?

834
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,645
I don't know.
I guess they want to see something.

835
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,273
"See something"?

836
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,863
To be honest,

837
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,493
at my clinic,
someone was secretly recording--

838
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,577
Jeong-woo.

839
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,174
Hey, what brings you here?

840
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,468
No reason. I came to see you.

841
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,640
How have you been?

842
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,059
Fine.

843
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,311
I'll let you guys talk.

844
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,658
Let's go there.

845
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,265
I was a bit harsh last time.

846
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,226
When?

847
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,979
When you said
I shouldn't be happy right now?

848
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,149
Yeah.

849
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,860
You're right, though.

850
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,863
But…

851
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,199
You've never been cold like that before,
so I was flustered.

852
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,704
But I knew better than anyone…

853
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,459
that I'm in no position to be happy.

854
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,043
So don't feel bad.

855
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,340
You know I only said that
because I was worried.

856
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,180
Of course.

857
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,486
What are you watching?

858
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,196
You see…

859
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:15,074
Remember the break-in at the rooftop
of that milmyeon restaurant?

860
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:19,287
Right. Someone broke in
but didn't take anything.

861
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,874
Yes. We searched all the cameras nearby
but couldn't find anything.

862
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,919
But we found a motorcycle
passing by the front at that time.

863
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,171
The driver just sent me
his dashcam footage.

864
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,090
Hey, someone's stepping out
of that building.

865
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,260
This person won't be easy to identify.

866
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,827
Jeong-woo, are you still out?

867
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,332
Are you still with Kyung-min?

868
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,416
My goodness.

869
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,130
He should lock his door.

870
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,807
Goodness, even the window's open.

871
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,727
He's awful at locking up
for someone who's had a break-in.

872
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:26,896
Excuse me.

873
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,405
What a mess.

874
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,412
Oh, dear.

875
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,633
What's that?

876
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,701
Who are you?
Why have you been following me?

877
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:09,916
Damn it.

878
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,434
I'm sorry.

879
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,186
Damn it.

880
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,629
Damn it.

881
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,814
It's a pen.

882
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,818
What? Why isn't it working?

883
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:24,949
What in the world?

884
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,003
Who are you?

885
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,046
I asked who you were!

886
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,142
DOCTOR SLUMP

887
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,603
How did you bear it all this whole time?

888
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,898
But I gained something precious too.

889
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,945
The anesthesiologist who was
also in the OR keeps bothering me.

890
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,782
What if those Macau guys
hired thugs to quietly get rid of him?

891
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:48,950
What's with you?

892
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,789
Unlike happiness,
which felt vague at times…

893
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,541
Jeong-woo, where are you?

894
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,294
…misfortune always
made its presence known.

895
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:07,718
