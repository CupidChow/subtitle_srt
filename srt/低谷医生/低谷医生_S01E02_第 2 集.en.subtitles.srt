00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,425
Sometimes, you suddenly lose
balance within your mind…

3
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,221
and you feel lethargic.

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,639
Hey!

5
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,018
Did you really think this trash
was good enough material?

6
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,897
You feel lonely and exhausted.

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,983
And you feel depressed…

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,696
during this time of emotional fatigue.

9
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,157
The defendant, Yeo Jeong-woo…

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,785
-Died from excessive bleeding.
-Video was paused…

11
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,037
And they found
his fingerprints on it as well.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,038
That's impossible.

13
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,791
As if someone was trying
to ruin your life on purpose,

14
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,710
life doesn't go your way
in times like this.

15
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,171
He hits the breaking ball.
They take the lead!

16
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,089
We call this a "slump."

17
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,802
He hangs his head. He's just unable
to pull himself out of this slump.

18
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,345
In his last game…

19
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,264
And this period of time,

20
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:43,019
no matter when, no matter who it is…

24
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,894
it will always come.

MOM

28
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,050
Hi, Mom. It's early morning over there.
Why are you awake?

29
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,718
I called because I was worried.

30
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,094
Are you okay?

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,804
Don't worry.

32
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,766
I'm innocent, so everything will work out.

33
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,059
Of course, it should.

34
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,312
Your father's a chairman candidate
for the American Heart Association.

35
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,897
He would be the first Asian.

36
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,984
So make sure all of his hard work
doesn't go to waste.

37
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,531
Sometimes,
it's at the lowest point in your life.

38
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,234
Such as now.

39
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,486
Who are you?

40
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,956
-You…
-Why are you…

41
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,803
Hey, I only wear sports bras.

42
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,887
This is my mom's--

43
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,098
I…

44
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,851
Anyway…

45
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,604
You're Yeo Jeong-woo, right?

46
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,817
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

47
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,528
If you knew, then why did you ask?

48
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,779
What brings you here?

49
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,365
Did you come here to see me?

50
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,659
-You wish.
-Then, why are you at my house?

51
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,246
You think I broke in or something?
This is my house too, you know.

52
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,291
This…

53
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,293
Here?

54
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,672
That's right. And where do you live--

55
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,552
No way.

56
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,888
No way.

57
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,098
No way!

58
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,687
Darn it!

59
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,273
DOCTOR SLUMP

60
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,067
Kyung-min, it's me.

61
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,112
Jeong-woo, I was going to call you.
Did the move go all right?

62
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,909
That's not important. Didn't you say
your mentee introduced you to this place?

63
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,368
-Was the mentee…
-Hong-ran.

64
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,995
Hey, Ha-neul.

65
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,499
After collapsing in the street,
you must be feeling good

66
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,334
since you called me out for drinks.

67
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,795
-How are you?
-I'm fine as you can see.

68
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,964
By the way, did you tell Kyung-min
our rooftop room was for rent?

69
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,382
Yeah, didn't I tell you?

70
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,635
-No.
-Really?

71
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,931
I ran into him recently,
and he was looking at a real estate app.

72
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,474
His friend needed to move.

73
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,103
Then, I remembered your mother was worried
about no one renting the rooftop.

74
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,437
So I told him about it.

75
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,482
You shouldn't have done that.

76
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,485
So that mentee of yours
is Ha-neul's friend,

77
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,571
and I ended up renting
a room at her house?

78
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,823
Right.

79
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,534
I didn't know it was Ha-neul's place.

80
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,869
You know each other,
so it does sound embarrassing.

81
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,955
I'm not embarrassed. I'm in despair.

82
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,458
It's the worst thing
that could've happened to my ruined life.

83
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,752
What kind of relationship
did you two have?

84
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,212
In high school, she was--

85
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,255
Your first love?

86
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,842
Didn't you hear me say "despair"?

87
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,594
She's not my first love. She's my nemesis.

88
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,597
And not just any nemesis.
She's my biggest nemesis.

89
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,976
What exactly happened
to make you say that?

90
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,729
Well…

91
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,025
There you go again.

92
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,360
You're bothering me.

93
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,071
Jeez, what's his deal?

94
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,459
She's at it again. She downed
five instant coffee sticks today.

95
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,795
I've been watching. She's gone through
five coffees and seven pencils.

96
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,047
She studies so much
she uses up all her pencils.

97
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,925
Jeez. Who cares about what she does?

98
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,343
No one does.

99
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,804
But after only seeing
this type of top student,

100
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,223
it's fascinating to see a different type.

101
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,850
-You two are total opposites.
-Right.

102
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,269
How are we different?

103
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,355
How do I put it?
This is how you actually study.

104
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,151
Exactly.

105
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,444
You're kind of laidback.

106
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,822
-Okay.
-But Ha-neul studies like a bulldozer.

107
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,991
Something like this.

108
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,286
"I'm studying!"

109
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,956
"Math, English, social studies, science!"

110
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,292
-"I'll solve them all!"
-Hey!

111
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,961
-Be quiet.
-Sorry.

112
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,842
Look at how scary she is.

113
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,930
What if she ends up beating you
in next the midterm exams? I'm worried.

114
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,057
For what? She'll never beat me.

115
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,809
What? Then, why are you shaking your leg?

116
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,397
Be honest. You're worried too, right?

117
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,442
Aren't you guys cold? I'm freezing.

118
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,194
The sun's blazing today.

119
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,820
Why are you biting your nails?

120
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,738
What?

121
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:57,245
They're checking our nails tomorrow.
Didn't you know? You fools are so filthy.

122
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,329
Jeez.

123
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,794
Jeez.

124
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,921
Who checks nails these days?

125
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,340
He's worried. He totally is.

126
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,176
Jeong-woo's going to get it for sure.

127
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,512
No way! It'll be Nam Ha-neul.

128
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,013
What are you doing?

129
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,017
We're just curious about who'll get
the top score on midterms.

130
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,978
So you're making bets on that?

131
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,647
Yeah, and it's pretty close.

132
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,066
Jeez.

133
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,986
Good luck, Jeong-woo.

134
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:37,076
Your midterm scores that you've been
dying to know are finally out.

135
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,913
Goodness, you're that happy?

136
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,665
-Kim Do-hyeon.
-Here.

137
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,208
-Joo Yeong-ha.
-Here.

138
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,711
-Kim Mu-geun.
-Here.

139
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,838
-Chan-yeong.
-Here.

140
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,881
Yeo Jeong-woo.

141
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,425
Here.

142
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,721
Goodness.

143
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,350
All right. Who's next?

144
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,852
Min-jun.

145
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,186
RANK

146
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,483
-Jeong-woo!
-Are you okay?

147
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,818
Hey!

148
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,153
What's the matter?

149
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,863
Breathe!

150
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,281
Hey!

151
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,366
-He's not breathing!
-The nurse's office!

152
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,785
-The nurse's office!
-The nurse's office!

153
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,953
That's it.

154
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,833
Watch his legs. Goodness.

155
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,335
What's going on?

156
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,878
Breathe, Jeong-woo!

157
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,548
-Make way!
-Where's the nurse's office?

158
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,716
To the right!

159
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,427
-Turn!
-Turn!

160
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,765
Jeong-woo got mad and fainted
after coming in second.

161
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,767
So that's why he went to the hospital.

162
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,684
There he is.

163
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,354
-But he looks fine.
-Right? What's going on?

164
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,648
I heard an ambulance came,
but he seems okay.

165
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,901
-You're right. He seems okay.
-I heard he fainted. He's fine.

166
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,362
He fainted because of midterms?
That's crazy.

167
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,076
That incident

168
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,120
provoked my dormant competitiveness.

169
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,962
After that incident,

170
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,465
he started to retaliate in childish ways.

171
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,355
I'll go on ahead. Take your time.

172
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,468
I'm going to eat two.

173
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,842
Goodness. Nice, Jeong-woo!

174
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,104
-He's really good.
-That's my friend.

175
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,588
Is he insane?

176
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,547
So?

177
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,882
What happened?

178
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,801
We were at each other's throats, and then…

179
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,221
Forget it.

180
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,598
Come on. You stopped
right when it got interesting.

181
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,016
Are you building the suspense?

182
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,893
That's not why.

183
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,563
It's because the gist of the story is
I'm not happy to see him again,

184
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,898
so let's end it there.

185
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,317
Why? I want to know more
about your first love.

186
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,111
-First love?
-It's what you've been talking about.

187
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,198
After arguing like enemies,
didn't you end up liking him?

188
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,366
That's not true.

189
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,660
Then, you could've just called.
Why bring me out?

190
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,245
Well…

191
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,832
-I'm actually worried about something.
-Worried?

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,001
What is it?

193
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,217
I'm a bit depressed.

194
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,969
What? Depressed?

195
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,431
That makes two of us.

196
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,642
Everyone in this day and age is depressed.

197
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,145
Seeing how you're making up stuff
to change the subject,

198
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,939
he must really be your first love.

199
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,232
So tell me.

200
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,568
Is he cute? Are you two going to date?

201
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,904
Don't be absurd.
Forget him. He'll be moving out soon.

202
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,739
Moving out? Why?

203
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,244
He fainted after losing to me,
so you really think he'd stay at my house?

204
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,537
With that pride of his?

205
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,208
I can't stay here. Absolutely not.

206
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:45,342
If I haven't violated anything
in the contract,

207
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,219
I'm moving out immediately.

208
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,388
Let's see.

209
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,390
Here it is.

210
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,897
"If the lessee chooses to violate
this contract, the lessor…"

211
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,899
KEEPS THE DEPOSIT

212
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,920
You startled me.

213
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,678
What is it?

214
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,431
Are you a thug? Why are you
in my way to pick a fight?

215
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,308
I'm not picking a fight.

216
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,145
I just have something to say.

217
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,232
-What is it?
-You see…

218
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,820
If you're uncomfortable
about me staying here,

219
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,700
just bear it.

220
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,494
What?

221
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,121
You've seen the news, right?
I'm being sued right now.

222
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,542
I'm not doing too well,

223
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,961
so I can't move out.

224
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,549
I won't get my deposit back
without a new tenant.

225
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,636
Real estate fees, moving fees,
and compensation for damages.

226
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,137
-I--
-Just stay here.

227
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,057
Nam Ha-neul.

228
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,436
I don't care if someone
like you stays here or not.

229
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,022
What? Someone like…

230
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,651
This is strangely more offensive
than telling me to move out.

231
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,652
Forget it.

232
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,655
We always argue like this,
so I'd rather just move out.

233
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,200
-Really?
-What?

234
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,453
Yes, really. So what?

235
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,124
I'm 3.7 billion won in debt anyway.
A bit more won't make a difference.

236
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,381
You're 3.7 billion won in debt?

237
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,175
Yes.

238
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,304
It was actually ten billion.
But I sold my house, car, and stocks.

239
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,265
So now, I'm 3.7 billion in debt.

240
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,642
I even put my precious clinic
on the market,

241
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,479
but no one wants it
because the incident happened there--

242
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,111
What was that?
I was telling a really sad story.

243
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,572
Goodness. I'm sorry.

244
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,615
I didn't know you'd go on for so long.

245
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,745
Anyway, I hope you move out soon.

246
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,414
What?

247
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,500
That thug!

248
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,390
Look.

249
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,601
I wasn't talking about you, sir.

250
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,437
I was talking
about that woman who just went in.

251
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,068
That woman is my niece.

252
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,528
Sorry?

253
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,034
I see.

254
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,501
Gosh, the owner of this noodle shop
has quite a temper.

255
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,088
He's my uncle.

256
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,424
I see.

257
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,636
Have a nice day.

258
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,307
It's nighttime though.

259
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,564
Gosh. Her uncle, her mother,
and her brother all live here.

260
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,108
What a full house.

261
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,528
It must be great
to have so many on your side.

262
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,334
-I bought the gochujang.
-Thanks.

263
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,841
Why make all this food
when Ha-neul's only going to eat nurungji?

264
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,220
By the way, Mom.

265
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,973
-He seems familiar.
-Who?

266
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,893
I met someone strange on the rooftop,
and he looked familiar.

267
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,022
-Maybe we know each other.
-The guy on the rooftop's a doctor.

268
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,983
I see. Then, I don't know him.

269
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,111
The only doctors I know
are Ha-neul, Hong-ran,

270
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,404
and Doctor Strange.

271
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,989
Goodness.

272
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,491
Right.

273
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,994
Can two guys fit up there though?

274
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,662
Two guys?

275
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,291
No, he's the only tenant.

276
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,792
Really?

277
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,295
I think I saw another guy go up.

278
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,406
I shouldn't have said I'd move out.

279
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,284
Whatever.

280
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,746
Gosh.

281
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,549
Gosh, Ha-neul.
At least dry your hair before you go.

282
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,259
I'm running late. Bye.

283
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,887
Come home early today.
I'll make you some milmyeon.

284
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,138
I'll have to see.

285
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:35,312
Right. I don't need to make myself
more distraught by running into her.

286
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,773
I mean, there are
other rooftop rooms out there.

287
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,526
There are semi-basements
and goshiwons as well.

288
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,944
It's not a problem at all.

289
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,113
Of course not.

290
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,785
What are you doing?

291
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,078
Did it get in your eyes?

292
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,080
-My eyes…
-Gosh.

293
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,540
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

294
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,085
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Gosh.

295
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,680
HOW LONG CAN YOU USE
A NEW PEN UNTIL IT RUNS OUT?

296
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,807
Come in.

297
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,064
What is it?

298
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,857
Why are you both here? It's scaring me.

299
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,360
We're here to tell you it's only noon,

300
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,655
but your schedule is completely empty
for the rest of the day.

301
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,948
I'm aware of that.

302
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,451
Dr. Bin, why don't we promote
our clinic more actively?

303
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,121
Come on.

304
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,332
The poster of me in Gangnam Station
is bigger than BTS's.

305
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,126
What more can we do?

306
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,462
Exactly. Who promotes their clinics
in Gangnam Station these days?

307
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,422
Every doctor has
their own NeoTube channel.

308
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,841
-So you should also--
-No.

309
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,302
I'll only do that as a hobby.

310
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,263
-It's to record my daily life.
-Look.

311
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,432
The name of your channel is
"The Michelangelo of Surgery."

312
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,227
But there's not a single thing
about surgeries here.

313
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,479
"The Temperature
at Which a Dog Feels Cold."

314
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,481
"What to Do With Leftover Tteokbokki."

315
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,693
That's all you upload.
So including us, no wonder you have

316
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,361
a total of five subscribers.

317
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,656
You already have a channel,
so why don't you upload videos

318
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,450
that help patients
like how Yeo Jeong-woo does?

319
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,535
Who knows?

320
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,663
You could take this chance
while he's gone and take his spot.

321
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,582
Ms. Han, what do you take me for?

322
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,837
I'm going to leave that spot open
until Jeong-woo returns.

323
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,756
-Yet he always bad-mouths him.
-Exactly.

324
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,051
I only did that out of love.

325
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,804
It's true that I talked behind his back,

326
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,348
but there's a story behind us
that no one knows.

327
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,976
-It was--
-We don't need to hear it, right?

328
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,687
But it's interesting…

329
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,110
Damn it.

330
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,904
I think it'll take a while.

331
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,907
We'll need to hang new wallpaper
due to the mold inside

332
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,575
and replace the broken windows.

333
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,036
Wouldn't the repairs take a while?

334
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,622
-I need to move in quickly.
-Don't worry.

335
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,956
It'll only take two days.

336
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,542
And you're not moving in today anyway.

337
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,920
By the way, what do you do for a living?

338
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,588
Teacher? Civil servant?

339
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,298
Well…

340
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,842
You're plastic surgeon,
Dr. Yeo Jeong-woo, right?

341
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,762
Yes, that's right.

342
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,600
Wait, is he someone famous?

343
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,603
Well… Ma'am, could I see you for a moment?

344
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,610
I think he's in the middle of a trial.

345
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,417
Hey.

346
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,129
Right now?

347
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,554
-Isn't he the guy on the news?
-You're right.

348
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,349
-Is that Yeo Jeong-woo?
-Yes.

349
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,893
Hey, Jeong-woo.

350
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,938
You're early. You seemed to be outside.

351
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,564
I'm busy, so let's cut to the chase.

352
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,024
-What did you hear?
-Well…

353
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:12,487
I did ask everyone around me,
but not many knew of him.

354
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,281
Really?

355
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,576
All I found out was
he doesn't like to socialize much

356
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,371
and he doesn't panic
no matter what situation it is.

357
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,011
Why did you want me to look into him?

358
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,223
Everyone in the OR that day
was asked to give their statement,

359
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,977
-but he was the only one who refused.
-What?

360
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,483
Didn't you hire him two months ago?

361
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,528
I mean, you didn't know him from before.

362
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,782
You can't really trust him,
and his reputation's not that good either.

363
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,409
So why did you hire him?

364
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,163
He brought me his resume in person.

365
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,382
RESUME

366
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:19,054
Usually, no one suddenly comes looking
for a job like that without calling.

367
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:24,184
So I thought he had his reasons
and didn't ask much more.

368
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,437
You're unbelievable too.

369
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,773
No matter what you thought,
that position's crucial.

370
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,691
You should've looked into him.

371
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,984
I know.

372
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,617
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE

373
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,951
I'm sorry, Mr. Yeo.

374
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,995
I spoke with the landlady.

375
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,124
Since the verdict hasn't come out yet,
she feels a bit uncomfortable.

376
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,209
There's Ha-neul.

377
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,466
So did you guys talk?

378
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:01,304
I told her I'd move out.
It's too uncomfortable running into her.

379
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,390
Why would it be uncomfortable?

380
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,267
You may have been rivals,
but you're all grown up now.

381
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,478
Moving out over that is so childish.

382
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,106
You're right.

383
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,983
Why was I so childish?

384
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,070
As if anyone's willing to take me in.

385
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,079
Send them the consultation
we just went over.

386
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,163
Yes, Doctor.

387
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,293
My, what a successful doctor.

388
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,588
You're as impressive
as the ones in medical dramas.

389
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,881
Why are you here?

390
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,592
Definitely not to see you.
I came to see Kyung-min.

391
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,262
By the way…

392
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,307
How do you know Kyung-min?

393
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,478
He tutored me
when I was a senior in high school. Why?

394
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,856
No reason.

395
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,236
-I guess he wasn't a competent tutor.
-And why is that?

396
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,364
I beat you on the first semester midterm.

397
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,241
Is that so?

398
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,951
I believe I beat you.

399
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,037
You fainted after getting mad at losing.
Don't play dumb.

400
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,206
I didn't faint. I just briefly sat down.

401
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,332
Those strange rumors--

402
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,461
I even beat you
on the first semester finals too.

403
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,337
Why do you keep saying that?

404
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,797
We each got one question wrong.

405
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,133
-Don't you remember we tied for first?
-I do.

406
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,302
-Exactly.
-But I got a math problem wrong.

407
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,137
They never taught me that in Busan.

408
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,140
And when I came to Seoul,
it had already been covered.

409
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,602
I had to study on my own,
so I was at a disadvantage.

410
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,104
Technically speaking, I basically won.

411
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,109
We both aced all our tests
during second semester, so it was a draw.

412
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,905
But I pretty much beat you twice
during first semester--

413
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,615
And the college entrance exams?

414
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,283
I got a higher score than you.

415
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,494
I only had one wrong and got into HNU.

416
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,121
You made so many mistakes
and got four wrong.

417
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,080
Aren't you busy?

418
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,374
Aren't you really busy house-hunting?

419
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,169
Right.

420
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,424
I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

421
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,342
Good luck then.

422
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,890
Okay, good for you.

423
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,893
You have a job,
and your family owns a building.

424
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,144
But guess what?

425
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,438
Those things won't last forever.

426
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,816
You could lose them at any moment like me!

427
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,074
Ms. Nam, your next appointment
is tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

428
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,869
Yeah, it must feel great to be happy.

429
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:30,870
I'll go on ahead.

430
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586
Right. Even guys like him are doing fine.

431
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,305
Everyone is a bit unhappy in life.

432
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,102
It's not just me.

433
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,605
So I should stay strong and--

434
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,690
Hey!

435
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,651
Damn it! Hey.

436
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,906
Our department has the lowest reviews
from students for practical training.

437
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,868
I have the lowest score
among all anesthesiologists.

438
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,910
Dr. Nam.

439
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,245
What have you been doing?

440
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,998
I'm sorry, sir.

441
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,545
Did you just sigh? Did you?

442
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,883
I asked if you just sighed. Well?

443
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,553
Professor Kim.

444
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,180
We got a call from the OBGYN.

445
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,267
The patient's 34 years old.
She's 36 weeks and four days pregnant.

446
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,687
She has placenta previa. She's bleeding
and needs an emergency C-section.

447
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,732
-Can you carry it out right away?
-Gosh.

448
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,777
-She's the chairman's daughter.
-You're telling me that now?

449
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,364
-You can come in too, right?
-Sorry?

450
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,951
It's surgery for a VVIP.
I can't bring in an intern or a resident.

451
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,994
Follow me.

452
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,584
He must be scared to do it alone.

453
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,757
Is the blood ready?

454
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,966
Yes, sir. We have two ready.

455
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,885
-I'll insert the line.
-Yes, sir.

456
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,357
Darn it. I broke a blood vessel.

457
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,735
I'll insert the P-line first
for transfusion.

458
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,168
Her blood vessels are too weak
and keep bursting.

459
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,630
Professor Kim, should I do it?

460
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,925
Insert the A-line. I'll do the P-line.

461
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,771
The line, please.

462
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,204
They're too weak.
Give me another angiocath.

463
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,748
We're in a time crunch. May we begin?

464
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,920
Sir, I'll give it a try on this arm.

465
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,132
Go on, then.

466
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,395
The line, please.

467
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,279
You may begin.

468
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,822
Okay.

469
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,375
Dr. Nam.

470
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,211
How did our VVIP's surgery go?

471
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,047
Good. Both the mother and baby are fine.

472
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,548
I'm glad to hear that.

473
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,718
Right. You didn't forget
about the lecture this week, right?

474
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:18,431
The lecture material we discussed before.
Update and send it to me by tonight.

475
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,433
-Bye.
-Bye, Professor.

476
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,608
By tonight?

477
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,752
Have you been okay this past week?

478
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,214
No, I haven't.

479
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,928
I actually wasn't going to come
since I wasn't that depressed.

480
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:02,266
But my heart was racing painfully,
and it felt suffocating.

481
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,185
So I was wondering why.

482
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,689
They're physical symptoms
caused by depression.

483
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,611
Many think depression
is solely an illness in the mind.

484
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,030
But it's not just an emotional state

485
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,658
where you simply feel sad and suicidal.

486
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,411
Some physical symptoms
of depression are insomnia,

487
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,998
changes in appetite, indigestion,
and even headaches.

488
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:31,629
Another symptom is when your chest
feels rock hard and as if it's tightening.

489
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,007
Then, what should I do?

490
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,762
The best thing
you can do right now is rest.

491
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,723
It's not an option. It's a must.

492
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,356
Is my condition that bad?

493
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,277
Some people have broken limbs.

494
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,571
For you, it's your mind.

495
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,492
If you break a bone,
you should stop running and rest, right?

496
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,954
"I can't stop now.
I can just use crutches."

497
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,290
"It'll feel better if I run faster."

498
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,001
You can't do that.

499
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:18,092
I think the best thing to do now is
to take care of yourself as you rest.

500
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,972
I see.

501
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,618
Hello, Dr. Lee.

502
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,663
What?

503
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:49,999
Sir.

504
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,792
Look at this.

505
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,218
I donate tens of billions to this hospital
and this is what you do to my daughter?

506
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,761
I apologize, ma'am.

507
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,764
What happened?

508
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
Well…

509
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,814
There she is.

510
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,692
Yesterday, I brought
my fellow into the OR,

511
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,653
and she kept messing up.

512
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:26,118
She must've been very nervous
since you're the chairman's daughter.

513
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:31,165
I thought I could depend on her.
I would've done it myself otherwise.

514
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,000
It's my fault, ma'am.

515
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,922
I'm sorry.

516
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,601
ANESTHESIOLOGIST
DAEHAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

517
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,562
PROFESSOR KIM SANG-GEUN

518
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,946
Given the situation,

519
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,407
you should just take the blame.

520
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,368
Sorry?

521
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,996
I'm a candidate
for Chief of Anesthesiology next year.

522
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,373
I can't let something like this
get in my way.

523
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,209
If I go down, it's over for you too.

524
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:19,672
They want a minute-by-minute record
of the surgery, so do what they want.

525
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,301
Give them a heartfelt apology.
Kneel if you must.

526
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,264
You want me to kneel?

527
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:32,935
They're taking this pretty seriously.
So just pretend like you care.

528
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,895
Just do as I say!

529
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,940
What? You can't do it?

530
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,068
Is kneeling too much for someone like you?

531
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,283
Does it hurt your pride?

532
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,077
And you can't even do your job right.

533
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,420
Am I incompetent?

534
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,761
I believe I never messed up
the patient's arm like you did.

535
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,474
Are you serious right now?

536
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,933
Please stop blaming others.

537
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,605
We got the lowest student reviews
because your classes are lousy.

538
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,316
The dissertation was rejected
because you planned it wrong.

539
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,943
You lost the grant
because that idea was five years old.

540
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,737
How could you expect it to pass?

541
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,032
It was embarrassing
how you always used me as an excuse.

542
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,117
And now you want me to kneel for you?

543
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,038
Have you gone insane?

544
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,749
Insane?

545
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,626
Are you crazy?

546
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,086
What?

547
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,257
You go and kneel. Just like this.

548
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,261
Is kneeling too much for someone like you?

549
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,309
Hey! Do you think
you'll get away with this?

550
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,729
I'll make sure you never set foot
in this field ever again!

551
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,981
Say goodbye to being a doctor!

552
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,611
Do as you please.

553
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,364
I won't sacrifice my health for this.

554
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,312
Nam Ha-neul quit.

555
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,440
-What? Really?
-Yes.

556
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,901
Dr. Nam confronted Professor Kim and quit.

557
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,197
I heard Dr. Nam
beat Professor Kim to a pulp.

558
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,284
Professor Kim needs
to recover for four weeks.

559
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,369
How badly was he beaten?

560
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,164
Someone saw him and said
he might need more than that.

561
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,583
BREAKING NEWS!

562
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,960
NAM HA-NEUL QUIT!

563
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,295
REALLY?
CONGRATULATIONS

564
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,588
SHE FOUGHT AND GOT FIRED

565
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,881
SHE BEAT HIM UP
HOW BAD?

566
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,924
Is she crazy?

567
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,760
What's going on?

568
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,970
HOPE OBGYN CLINIC

569
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,018
Come on.

570
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,148
I'm sorry!

571
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,317
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

572
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,282
Gosh, my rotator cuff.

573
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,869
One cold and one spicy noodles.

574
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,954
Okay.

575
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,581
All right.

576
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,375
Thank you.

577
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,417
This is so good.

578
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,296
One cold and one spicy noodles.

579
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,214
-Cold noodles?
-Here.

580
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,298
Here you go.

581
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,634
Enjoy.

582
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,096
You know what? You can have this.

583
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,307
Goodness.

584
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,565
Were you just talking about my daughter?

585
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,233
No, we weren't.

586
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,569
Come on. I heard everything.

587
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,072
I think I heard you mention her job.

588
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,200
Weren't you talking
about my anesthesiologist daughter?

589
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,159
Not at all.

590
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,911
She gave me the last dumpling,

591
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,414
so I said, "Thank you very much."

592
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,333
I see. So that's what you said.

593
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,545
I misunderstood what you said.

594
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,630
Have I told you?

595
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,718
My daughter might become
a college professor next year.

596
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,221
No one can hold a candle to her
when it comes to anesthesiology.

597
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,181
You must be so happy.

598
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,145
I should tranquilize you.

599
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,772
-Excuse me.
-Go take their order.

600
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,690
Yes, sir.

601
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,491
The number…

602
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,327
Why isn't she picking up?

603
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,622
Sir, I'll get out here.

604
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,419
Hey, what's going on?

605
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,004
I heard you quit.

606
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,964
Word travels fast.

607
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,050
I heard you beat up Professor Kim too.

608
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,180
If you hit your professor like that,
no hospital will take you in.

609
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,016
Why did you quit?

610
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,726
-Why?
-That hurts.

611
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,394
Be quiet. My mom will hear you.

612
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,812
Let's talk else…

613
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,523
You quit the hospital?

614
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,777
What does that mean?

615
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,696
Mom.

616
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,784
Mom.

617
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,452
Damn it.

618
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:24,870
Mom.

619
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,839
Mom.

620
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,594
I'm sorry I quit without telling you.

621
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,226
Let's at least hear the reason.
Why on earth did you quit?

622
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,480
I thought I needed a break.

623
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:55,067
Then, just take some time off.
Isn't this a waste of your hard work?

624
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,403
Of course, it is.

625
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,196
That's exactly what I'm saying.

626
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,949
I heard you hit your professor.

627
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,285
Dealing with others at work
isn't always easy or smooth.

628
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,538
You could've talked it out.
You had a great job--

629
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,040
-Great for who?
-What?

630
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,710
The humiliation I get at work
is more than you can imagine.

631
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,380
I studied 17 hours a day as a student.

632
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,258
And I work 17 hours a day now
but still get scolded.

633
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,593
I'm always insulted
and called a fool at work.

634
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,139
I get scolded all the time
for absolutely no reason.

635
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,892
Everyone gets scolded in life.

636
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,029
You're right. I was wrong.

637
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,577
I should've let them
keep insulting me so I was miserable

638
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,997
and let my body deteriorate.

639
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,584
-That's not what--
-I have depression.

640
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,008
I pushed myself too hard

641
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,886
and couldn't rest when I was tired,

642
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,098
so it became an illness of the mind.

643
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,396
That can't be.

644
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,818
That's just ridiculous.

645
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,782
I raised you the best I could!

646
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,036
I sacrificed everything for you.

647
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,287
That could…

648
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,915
never happen to my daughter.

649
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,668
I don't know who told you that nonsense,

650
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,005
but you of all people can't be depressed.

651
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,257
I can't even be sick?

652
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,304
I've lived my entire life
the way you wanted me to.

653
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,181
So can't I at least be sick?

654
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,728
Ha-neul!

655
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,974
The number you have dialed…

656
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,853
-She's not answering you either?
-No.

657
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,235
She's still not home?

658
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,281
-Something's up, right?
-Of course not.

659
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,618
Actually, I needed a facial cleanser

660
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,287
for my fair and beautiful skin.

661
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,330
So I went searched her room to get one.

662
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,589
Actually, I looked around to see
if she had any cash hidden.

663
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,049
But I found a bunch
of medicine in her closet.

664
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,134
Medicine?

665
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,051
Hold on.

666
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,767
Gosh, what's all this?

667
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,269
Right?

668
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,479
What kind of medicine would she hide?

669
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,523
Right.

670
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,360
There's an app that can tell us.
Should I look it up?

671
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,029
-Yes.
-Let's see.

672
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,492
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

673
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,041
Goodness.
I thought she was doing just fine.

674
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:57,934
Hey, Ha-neul.

675
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,070
So…

676
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,491
Want to have some soju?

677
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,327
No.

678
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,167
Okay.

679
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,005
MS. KONG WOL-SEON

680
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,195
Just have a drink with me.

681
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:55,158
I'm feeling pretty down today
and need someone to talk to.

682
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,039
One drink isn't enough.

683
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,667
-What?
-I'll go if it's at least three bottles.

684
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,502
Three bottles?

685
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,547
Let's go.

686
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,134
Hold on.

687
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,271
Jeez, what are you doing?

688
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,064
I just got chills down my spine.

689
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,984
I got chills too as I was doing it.

690
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,362
I'm just embarrassed
to drink with you in those scrubs.

691
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,575
Right.

692
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,370
I get that they're comfortable,
but you can't wear them outside.

693
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,374
Hurry and zip it up.

694
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,376
Okay.

695
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,297
Gosh, it's long.

696
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,597
Good. That's a bit better.

697
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:01,933
Let's go.

698
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:03,769
Okay.

699
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,486
Have some.

700
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,237
Welcome!

701
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,324
We'll take it easy
with three bottles and leave.

702
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,533
How is that taking it easy?

703
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,036
And don't pretend we're close
because we drank together.

704
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,246
Please. I'd like to say the same to you.

705
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,414
Hey, Jeong-woo!

706
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,625
It is him.

707
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,751
Holy cow.

708
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,169
He looks like a celebrity.

709
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,253
Do you remember Min-ho?

710
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,047
He opened a barbecue restaurant last week.

711
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,174
This year's reunion will be there.

712
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:36,968
Let's leave.

713
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,304
Wait, Jeong-woo.

714
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,224
You're here, so sit. Where are you going?

715
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,184
I wasn't planning to come here.

716
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,728
Come on, don't lie. Sit down.

717
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,438
-No.
-Come on.

718
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,232
You… What?

719
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,942
Aren't you Ha-neul?

720
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,736
-It is her. It's Ha-neul.
-Holy cow.

721
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,447
We wondered how you were doing.
Come sit with us.

722
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,699
Sit down.

723
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,414
What's with you two?

724
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,792
You used to be enemies.
You've been keeping in touch?

725
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,377
That's not it.

726
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,632
I'm staying at--

727
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,676
I had to discuss my dissertation with him.

728
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,761
I reached out to him.

729
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,474
That's so cool.

730
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,726
I heard you two are doctors.
You look the part.

731
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,438
Honestly, it's just one of them.
Jeong-woo's hit rock bottom.

732
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,192
What? You were all bad-mouthing him.

733
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,277
Hey.

734
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,281
Mu-geun and Chan-yeong quit their jobs

735
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,158
and started a NeoTube channel
because of him.

736
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,411
But thanks to him, no one watches anymore.

737
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,662
Hey, that's enough.

738
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:49,708
It's odd how only that part
of the CCTV footage disappeared.

739
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,003
Maybe he was involved
in the patient's death--

740
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,840
You can stay. I have to go.

741
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,967
Have fun.

742
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,468
Jeong-woo!

743
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,596
Watch what you say.

744
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,764
Hey, Jeong-woo!

745
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,932
Jeong-woo!

746
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,017
Jeong-woo.

747
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,562
-Let's talk.
-About what?

748
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,025
Aren't they the ones you need to talk to?
They had a lot to say.

749
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,736
-He's just drunk.
-Hey.

750
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,530
Why the hell are you upset?

751
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,157
It's the truth.

752
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,242
We were ruined too because of you.

753
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,327
Come on.

754
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,291
Really? Did you really
quit your jobs because of me?

755
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,170
Yours was going bankrupt
and was about to ask you to resign.

756
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,757
And you quit while drunk
because you hated your job.

757
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,177
I knew you were secretly taking
most of the ad revenue.

758
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,013
But I kept quiet
because I thought you needed it.

759
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,725
I didn't want you two to suffer
because of what happened to me,

760
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,936
so I paid off your penalties first.

761
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,228
But what did you say?

762
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,566
I guess only I thought we were friends.

763
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,986
Have a good life, you two.

764
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,832
Jeong-woo.

765
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,839
Why would you say that?

766
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,924
Damn it.

767
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,658
Why do you keep following me?

768
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,204
Why are you doing that? It's embarrassing.

769
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,624
We live in the same house.

770
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,545
Right.

771
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,250
Are you still up
for three bottles of soju?

772
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:40,795
Of course.

773
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,257
BRAVO MY LIFE
BAR

774
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,653
You're a good drinker.

775
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,364
Didn't you only study and work?
When did you learn to drink?

776
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,576
My best friend is a heavy drinker,
so drinking with her helped.

777
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,497
I'm competitive, so I didn't want
to lose at drinking either.

778
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:16,873
That's a shame.

779
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,667
You won't beat me tonight though.

780
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,336
I'm a bit of a drinker too.

781
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,378
Yeah, right.

782
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,173
Are you going to lose
and faint out of anger again?

783
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,884
Hey, I said I didn't faint that time.

784
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,803
I just briefly sat down.

785
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,429
You should know.

786
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,431
Well, I'm not too sure about that.

787
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,142
I'm just worried
I might have to call 911 again.

788
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,770
Hey, let's go.

789
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,606
All right. Bring it on.

790
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,280
See? I can drink more than you.

791
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,950
No, I'm a better drinker than you.

792
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,661
Look at how accurate my pronunciation is.

793
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,746
Look how clear my eyes are.

794
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,540
Mine are clearer.

795
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,416
Mine are the clearest.

796
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,838
Mine are the clearest
you've ever seen! Hold on.

797
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,422
Jeez. Forget it.

798
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,592
I'll let you win out of pity.

799
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,927
What the hell?

800
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,846
You're suddenly pitying me?

801
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,141
In my case, I'm guilty for my actions.

802
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,519
But you're being falsely accused.

803
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,566
Is that what you think?

804
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,360
Yeah.

805
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,029
Why?

806
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,742
Well, you're pretty childish.

807
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,204
But you'd never do something bad
and brazenly lie about it.

808
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,211
What's with that face?

809
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,840
No, it's nothing.

810
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,468
Don't lie. You look so sad.

811
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:52,969
You're about to bawl.

812
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,721
Damn it.

813
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,767
I must be insane.
Even the most trivial words these days

814
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,854
make me want to cry.

815
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,522
Do I have depression?

816
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,316
Damn it.

817
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,489
Sorry. You're the one with depression.

818
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,201
What did you say?

819
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,996
-How did you know?
-Let me explain.

820
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,708
Don't take it the wrong way.
I was coming down from the rooftop

821
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,085
and I heard you
and your mom talking by coincidence.

822
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,505
God, this hurts my pride.

823
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,425
I'm sorry.
I really wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

824
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,761
No, that's not why.

825
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:39,015
The fact that I'm depressed
hurts my pride so much.

826
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,726
You see…

827
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:46,481
I'm the type who saves
their most favorite food and eats it last.

828
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,024
Okay.

829
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,943
And that's what I did…

830
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,655
with my happiness as well.

831
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:00,453
"I bet food will taste better
once I become a professor."

832
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,457
"Trips abroad would be more fun
when I become a professor."

833
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,711
"Riding first class
would make it even more fun."

834
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:15,009
I kept postponing everything
and worked like a dog.

835
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,512
But look at me now.

836
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:22,100
I slaved away
and only ended up with depression.

837
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,815
I was the top student in Korea
and graduated med school with honors.

838
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,525
I was truly remarkable.

839
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,443
Of course, you were.

840
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,071
So how in the world do I have depression?

841
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,574
They said my mind has an illness.

842
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,784
Like panfacial fractures,

843
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,829
my mind has been shattered into pieces.

844
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,711
It's really rare
to have panfacial fractures.

845
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,422
You need to have been
either shot in the face

846
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:57,844
or hit by a piece of rebar falling on you
for such fractures to happen.

847
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,096
The skull

848
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:06,185
is very complex and has sturdy buttress.

849
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:11,816
Only parts like your cheekbone
or jawbone will separately break.

850
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,777
Damn it, that's not the point.

851
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,280
Are you acting out
Grey's Anatomy in this bar?

852
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,823
Right. Sorry.

853
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,076
You were using medical terms so…

854
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,995
Hey, we still got it.

855
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,539
No. It's "We got it."

856
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,249
Right. We got it.

857
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,203
Mom.

858
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,331
This is depression and anxiety medication.

859
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:15,421
As her mother, how could I have not known?

860
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,904
What? What was that?

861
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,283
You startled me.

862
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,872
This is a secret.

863
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,252
But I get scared
whenever I see people in black suits.

864
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:58,089
I'm worried someone
will hire thugs to go and punish me.

865
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,177
Hey, that's a bias
against black suits. Right?

866
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,972
Some good-hearted people wear black suits,

867
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,266
while some thugs wear colorful clothes.

868
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,183
Jeez.

869
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,020
So tell me. What's your plan?

870
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,565
Beats me.

871
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:18,234
I don't know what I should do from now on.

872
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,237
That's not what I'm asking.
When will you move out?

873
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,197
Damn it.

874
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,699
I'm not moving out.

875
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,451
I'm going to stay here.

876
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,494
Can't I?

877
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,164
Do whatever you want.

878
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,584
I told you before.
I couldn't care less if you stayed or not.

879
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,337
You and your words.

880
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,007
"I'll let you stay since I believe you."

881
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,550
Can't you say it nicely like that?

882
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,851
It's too cheesy.

883
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,687
Damn it.

884
01:02:55,563 --> 01:03:00,651
I've kept this one small wish
ever since senior year in high school.

885
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,490
I really wanted to flick you
once in the forehead.

886
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,117
Hey.

887
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,245
Then, should we
flick each other just once?

888
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,123
-What?
-You see,

889
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,834
I really wanted to do the same to you too.

890
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,088
Let's flick each other just once.

891
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:28,930
Gosh.

892
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,098
I can't hit a woman.

893
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,226
Hey, is that how you think of me?

894
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,270
-Fine, give me your head.
-No, me first. Show me your forehead.

895
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,897
All right. Hey.

896
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,984
Let's leave no regrets and show no mercy.

897
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,403
-Okay, deal.
-Okay, deal.

898
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,575
Me first? I don't know
why I'm listening to you, but okay!

899
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,248
Bring it on!

900
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,635
Come here. It's my turn.

901
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,679
You're dead meat.

902
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,599
-Hold on.
-Come here. Damn it.

903
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:20,940
Ha-neul, I want a healthy daughter
instead of a successful one.

904
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:27,905
No matter what you do,
I love you and care about you so much.

905
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,492
My turn. You better not regret this.

906
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,379
-Wait, why are you crying?
-No, I…

907
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,175
I don't know.
I just suddenly started to cry.

908
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,971
This isn't fair. It's my turn now.

909
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,141
That's not why.

910
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,518
What's going on?

911
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,273
Ha-neul.

912
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,404
Seeing you cry…

913
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,283
is making me want to cry too.

914
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,998
I was barely holding back my tears.

915
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,877
You're making me want to cry too!

916
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,345
Once I sober up the next day,

917
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,976
I know I'll regret hugging him.

918
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,985
But the warmth she gave me
that day was so comforting…

919
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,200
it helped me forget
all the pain in that moment.

920
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,703
DOCTOR SLUMP

921
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,830
I drank too much last night.

922
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,207
Let's stay away from alcohol
and each other.

923
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,459
Promise… Right.
We said we should stay away.

924
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,504
He's Yeo Jeong-woo, the plastic surgeon.

925
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,505
He totally lied.

926
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,298
What in the world?

927
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,384
Let's go get some ice cream.

928
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,636
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

929
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,556
She's a good judge of character.
She has a cute side too.

930
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,641
Let's have all the fun we can tonight.

931
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,060
-How about we go see the sunrise?
-What?

932
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,396
Let's go see the sunrise.

933
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:12,611
