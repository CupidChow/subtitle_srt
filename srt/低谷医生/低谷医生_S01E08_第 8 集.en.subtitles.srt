00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,036
DOCTOR SLUMP

2
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,914
Ha-neul, look here. Over here.

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,000
Hey!

4
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,169
-Where are you going?
-Come back!

5
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,087
Gosh, come here.

6
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,673
Ba-da, do a cool pose.

7
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,758
That's it.

8
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,469
All right. Stand over there.

9
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,763
Let's take one together.
Look at the camera.

10
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,473
That's nice.

11
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,932
-Cheese.
-Cheese.

12
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,060
-Okay.
-Okay, another one together.

13
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,398
-Ba-da, open your eyes wide!
-Ba-da, look at the camera.

14
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,109
On the day Ha-neul was born,

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,405
they say the sky over Busan
was especially clear and incredibly blue.

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,700
That's why they named her "Ha-neul."

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,411
And they named me
"Ba-da" just to match hers.

18
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,621
MY SON, LIVELY LIKE THE SEA

19
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,123
And we lived up to our names.

20
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,794
Her grades kept soaring
as high as the sky.

21
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,881
And my grades stayed at sea level.

22
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,176
She was sad even when she aced a test.

23
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,846
She said she got a question right
from a guess, not her knowledge.

24
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,601
-I was happy just to get 25%.
-Yes! We're having pizza!

25
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,854
Because Mom would buy us pizza
whenever Ha-neul aced a test.

26
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,317
And so, we lived different lives.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,486
Hey, Ba-da. Let's order jajangmyeon.

28
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,696
-Me too.
-I want jjamppong.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,741
Ba-da.

30
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,245
That's my sister.

31
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,288
I'm not hungry.

32
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,791
Hey.

33
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,502
I told you not to bring your friends over.

34
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,419
Hey.

35
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,755
See you later. I'll be back, Ha-neul.

36
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,757
I liked hanging out with friends,

37
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,676
but she liked studying more.

38
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,097
Mom makes the best short ribs.

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,895
I liked delicious food,

40
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,814
but she liked studying more.

41
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,864
I was especially romantic,

42
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,241
but she had no interest in love.

43
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,785
Are you okay?

44
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,871
Nam Ha-neul!

45
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,666
FALL, 2009

46
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,750
Hey.

47
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,463
You know me, right?
I'm our school's best fighter.

48
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,633
Okay. Let's say you do.

49
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,302
I like you.

50
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,386
How do I put it?

51
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,639
You pique my interest
because we're so different.

52
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,268
You're precious, and I don't want
anyone else to have you.

53
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,770
Like the last cigarette in a pack.

54
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,023
I don't understand.
Why am I a last cigarette?

55
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,152
An A is an A, and a B is a B.
Saying an A is a B is confusing.

56
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,279
Hey.

57
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,865
I wasn't finished.
Where are you going? I like you.

58
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,284
Sir.

59
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,536
-He's not letting me study.
-What?

60
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,038
You punks.

61
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,123
You brats.

62
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,958
How dare you interrupt her studies?

63
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,460
Get away from her.

64
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,465
Dating was just something
that got in the way of her studies.

65
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,217
SUMMER, 2011

66
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,806
The only thing that made her swoon

67
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,852
was the arrival of new textbooks.

68
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,022
The only time her heart raced

69
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,733
was when she ran out of breath
dashing up the stairs.

70
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,027
SPRING, 2023

71
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,863
But that very person…

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,407
started to resemble me.

73
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,538
She'd grin from ear to ear while texting.

74
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,168
ATTRACTION PRIVÉ, UIJEONGBU

75
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,589
MINE

76
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,635
What are you doing? Give it back.

77
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,054
-Hold on.
-What? Give it back!

78
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:23,972
Go away.

79
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,015
Why do you need to know
popular dating spots?

80
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,226
Come on. Mom!

81
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,604
She now has someone
who she wants to visit nice places with.

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,906
She seems to be in deep thought right now.

83
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,954
It must be
because of that special someone.

84
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,918
-Ha-neul.
-My goodness!

85
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,505
-Tell me if you ever need advice.
-What?

86
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,257
I'm just saying

87
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,759
that I'm here for you.

88
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,554
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,645
How dare you, you punk?

90
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,689
Where did you put it?

91
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,606
What?

92
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,733
Seriously!

93
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,401
Why would you steal my wallet?

94
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,237
I just wanted to split
50,000 won with you.

95
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,407
What's with you and 50,000 won?
Why is it always that amount?

96
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,326
It's because I need it to go on dates.

97
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,911
There's this girl I'm interested in.

98
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,998
Again? Why do you have
so many girls you're interested in?

99
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,459
Hold on.

100
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,045
-Wait. You steal anything else?
-What's with you?

101
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,046
-Did you?
-No.

102
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,505
I didn't.

103
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,299
I'm telling you I didn't.

104
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,259
How can I believe you?

105
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,846
Let me count how much money there is.

106
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,520
Ha-neul has a happy problem now.

107
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,981
DOCTOR SLUMP

108
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:57,982
I'm sure of it.

109
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,985
I LIKE YOU

110
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,198
Jeez, I should put a lock on my wallet.

111
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,631
What are you up to?

112
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,679
What could this be?

113
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,765
I really like you.

114
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,725
I like you.

115
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,769
But I really like you.

116
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,439
He definitely said he liked me.

117
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,949
We even held hands.

118
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,493
Then, that means we're dating.

119
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:56,207
But… we could still be friends
since he never said we were dating.

120
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,597
Why are you chopping up so much cabbage?

121
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,934
I'm going to make
some fresh kimchi and pickles.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,394
I see.

123
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,479
By the way, Mom…

124
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,275
How did you and Dad start dating?

125
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,734
Why all of a sudden?

126
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,653
Well…

127
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:30,783
I'm writing a dissertation on emotions.
When someone confesses their love to you,

128
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,995
the level of dopamine,
a neurotransmitter, rises in your brain.

129
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,622
Anyway, how did you begin dating?

130
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,086
Back then, your dad lived next door.

131
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,256
Then one day,
he offered to buy me some omurice.

132
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,594
It was an expensive dish back then,
so I said okay.

133
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,263
Then, he offered to buy me pork cutlets.

134
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,764
And after some time…

135
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,517
We had you.

136
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,105
Did he ever

137
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,316
ask you to be his girlfriend?

138
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,695
I was just suddenly curious.

139
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,364
Are you officially dating
if you know you like each other?

140
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,826
Or do you have to actually say it
and ask them out?

141
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,578
I'm just confused.

142
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,747
You don't have to say it out loud.

143
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,626
If you like each other, go on dates,
and hold hands, you're dating.

144
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,461
Really?

145
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,088
-Holding hands means you're dating?
-You bet!

146
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,840
That's how it was back then.

147
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,843
I see. Back then.

148
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,930
Tell me if I understood you correctly.

149
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,518
Your friend drank with this guy,
and he got drunk.

150
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,646
Then, he said he liked her
about five or six times.

151
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,064
-They held hands too.
-Yes.

152
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,400
-Then, that's definitely dating.
-Really?

153
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,861
-Is that how it works these days?
-"These days"?

154
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,034
Uncle Tae-seon,
when was your last relationship?

155
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,663
I broke up with Dan-bi
while on leave during my military duty.

156
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,959
-So about 20 years ago?
-What?

157
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,420
That means it was in the late '90s.
The end of the century.

158
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,341
There's not much difference
in dating between back then and now.

159
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,761
Of course, there is.
That was 20 years ago.

160
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,931
That's when you had pen pals
and had dates over the phone.

161
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,686
Is there anyone I know
who's had dates recently?

162
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,148
-You rang?
-My goodness!

163
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,194
Hey, when did you get here?

164
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,656
Uncle Tae-seon offered 50,000 won a day
to do dishes, so I'm helping out.

165
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,741
Jeez, 50,000 won again?

166
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,579
You might as well
just change your name to that.

167
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,205
So…

168
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,041
That story you just told
was about Mr. Rooftop, right?

169
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,714
I knew something smelled fishy.
You two held hands?

170
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,967
No, we didn't.

171
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,803
-I really was talking about my friend.
-Is that so?

172
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,308
It totally sounded like you
and Mr. Rooftop, but I'll let it slide.

173
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,562
Anyway, you can't count that as dating.

174
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,399
-Why not?
-It's called the flirting phase.

175
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,861
It's like they're going out,
but it's not official.

176
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,738
Even if they've held hands

177
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,448
or done something more,

178
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,200
if they didn't make it official,
it doesn't count.

179
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,202
Jeez, dating is tricky these days.

180
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,206
If they're not dating but held hands,
it still doesn't count?

181
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,249
Of course not.

182
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,461
It's like adding items
to your shopping cart every day.

183
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,630
They're not yours
until you pay for them, right?

184
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,548
Gosh, that's a wise saying.

185
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:34,925
Is that so?

186
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,262
What's wrong? It's not about you,
but why are you so serious?

187
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,805
Well…

188
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,685
I became sad thinking
about your future. So what?

189
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,397
Bye, Uncle Tae-seon.

190
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,941
That definitely wasn't about me.

191
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,859
Bye.

192
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,792
Jeong-woo, are you home?

193
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,420
Jeong-woo.

194
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,506
Can we talk for a minute?

195
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,049
-Yes, we can.
-My goodness!

196
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,929
-Why were you looking at my phone?
-I didn't mean to.

197
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,348
I can't help having 20-20 vision.

198
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,894
-What is it?
-What?

199
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,270
You wanted to chat.

200
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,689
You see…

201
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,652
Can you give me a glass of water?

202
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,572
Sure. Come on in.

203
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,710
-Here's the water you ordered, ma'am.
-Thanks.

204
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,135
What's making you so hesitant to talk?

205
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,345
You see…

206
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,389
So…

207
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,976
Jeong-woo, are you in there?

208
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,979
-Yeah.
-What? Why is he here?

209
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,440
-Hey, we need to talk!
-Hold on.

210
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,944
The bathroom. I'll be in there.

211
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,781
Why? Why are you hiding?
We can just say we were talking.

212
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,699
-No.
-Jeong-woo!

213
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,909
He's already suspicious, so if he sees us…

214
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,161
Anyway, no.

215
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,705
I'll be in the bathroom,
so make him leave quick.

216
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
-What?
-Jeong-woo!

217
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,380
-Coming.
-Jeong-woo!

218
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,344
Ba-da, what brings you here?

219
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,014
Why do you think so?
Because I need to talk to you.

220
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,434
Hey, what is it?
What business do you have here?

221
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,519
Jeong-woo, let's have a man-to-man talk.

222
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,397
What? To talk about what?

223
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,858
Sure.

224
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,027
Please go out with Ha-neul.

225
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,699
-What do you…
-Shut up!

226
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,702
I know it's shameless,
and I feel terrible for asking this.

227
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,537
-What?
-But I'll be honest.

228
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,998
I'm a bit annoyed
by how you're toying with her.

229
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,125
I never toyed with her.

230
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,379
Yes, you did. You took her to Sokcho
and went to her in Hwabon.

231
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,967
You confused her so much
and then said you were just friends.

232
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,052
Hey, that's--

233
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,179
I gave you the benefit of the doubt

234
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,098
and thought you pushed her away
due to your situation.

235
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,518
But everything's been resolved now.

236
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,269
So why are you playing around with her?

237
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,813
I never did that to her.

238
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,524
I know you guys held hands!

239
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,985
Unbelievable.

240
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,613
She asked me for advice,
saying it was for her friend.

241
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,822
But she has no friends.

242
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,283
It's definitely about her.

243
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,371
You damn lunatic!

244
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,832
I heard you confessed your love
to her yesterday and even held her hand.

245
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,380
You never officially said you're dating,
so imagine how agonizing it is for her.

246
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,468
Ha-neul's dying to go out with you,
so she's asking around like crazy.

247
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,890
So…

248
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,059
spare her the anxiety

249
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,769
and go out with her.

250
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,523
I'm done for.

251
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,818
I thought we already were.

252
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,614
-What?
-Her and I.

253
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,617
I thought we were dating since yesterday.

254
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,328
What?

255
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,957
That's cold!

256
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,345
-What was that sound?
-Nothing.

257
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,389
The pipes have been bursting lately.

258
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,601
I'll discuss this with Ha-neul,
so you can go now.

259
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,733
You could always back out,
so we should write a contract.

260
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,278
A man never takes his word back.
I would never do that.

261
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,905
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

262
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,740
Except for her depression…

263
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,951
Wait. And the way she dresses…

264
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,456
And her nasty temper,
she's pretty kind. Okay?

265
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,499
Treat her well.

266
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,169
All right, bye. Be safe.

267
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,838
Oh, dear.

268
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,882
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,139
Ha-neul.

270
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,390
He left.

271
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,683
Why did you turn on--

272
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,982
Hey, are you okay?

273
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,609
Let's first get out of here.

274
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,569
Why are you drenched?

275
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,529
Gosh.

276
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,952
I don't know what happened in there.

277
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,620
But did the pipes really burst?

278
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,081
Is it true?

279
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,416
What?

280
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,383
Are we really dating?

281
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,344
Then…

282
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,430
we weren't?

283
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,936
But we even held hands yesterday.

284
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,522
Did you do that
without intending to go out with me?

285
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,482
Were you toying with me?

286
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,651
-Are you playing around with me?
-No.

287
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,694
I'm not like that.

288
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,778
Me neither.

289
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,656
I like you.

290
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,201
I don't want to be friends anymore.

291
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,164
Me neither.

292
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,294
But I wasn't dying to go out with you.
It wasn't like that.

293
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,132
I was the one who was dying
to go out with you.

294
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,138
But you're all drenched.

295
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,723
It's okay.

296
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,267
I'll give you my clothes.
You'll catch a cold. Hang on.

297
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,729
What's there to wear? Not this one.

298
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,670
Have some warm tea.

299
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,089
-Okay.
-It's hot. Be careful.

300
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,140
-Is it okay?
-Yeah.

301
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,769
Right. Hold on.

302
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,232
Don't look.

303
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,365
What's this? Did you find these outside?

304
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,994
No, I carefully chose them
at the flower shop just for you.

305
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,040
How sweet of you.

306
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,131
All I could ever smell were alcohol swabs.

307
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,802
These flowers smell so nice.

308
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,060
Want to hang out with me tonight?

309
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,438
Let's go on a date.

310
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,817
Sure. Let's do that.

311
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,778
Okay.

312
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,367
-This is huge though.
-Right?

313
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,910
Look. You can't see my hands.

314
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,205
Yeah, I can't see them.

315
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,421
That was so sudden.

316
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,592
What? Was I supposed
to book an appointment?

317
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,097
No, not necessarily but…

318
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,520
Now that you're my girlfriend,
it feels so good.

319
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,569
Me too.

320
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,222
How pretty.

321
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,727
Ha-neul. Where have you been?

322
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,146
I've been waiting for you.

323
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,482
You should be excited today.

324
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,526
Gosh.

325
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,362
You're going to get a boyfriend.

326
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,659
To be honest, I know your story
was about Mr. Rooftop.

327
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,288
So I met with him,
and we had a man-to-man talk.

328
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,625
He'll ask you out soon.

329
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,544
Aren't you grateful?
That'll be 50,000 won.

330
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,629
Never mind.

331
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,380
This is worth 100,000 won, right?

332
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,715
One hundred thousand won.

333
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,427
One hundred thousand.

334
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,431
Let me just hit you 100,000 times.

335
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,476
-You'll be the death of me!
-But I was only helping you!

336
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,393
You punk!

337
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,356
Should I call him or not?

338
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,400
What are you mumbling about?

339
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,779
What? If I mumble to myself

340
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,739
or scream at a park,
what's it to you?

341
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,868
Well…

342
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,745
I just felt bad.

343
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,164
What?

344
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,962
Looking back on it, I think I did
encourage you to call Jeong-woo.

345
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,881
So I think I feel a little bad.

346
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,676
And I think I owe you an apology.

347
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,135
Jeez.

348
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,304
You think? What?

349
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,808
All you need to say is just "I'm sorry."

350
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,020
What's that? Why is his number on screen?

351
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,064
He cursed you out
and said to never call again.

352
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,483
There was a misunderstanding.

353
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,069
It wasn't Jeong-woo. It was some woman.

354
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,904
What woman?

355
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:25,492
She took his phone from him
and started cursing at me in an accent.

356
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:30,622
You didn't bother to call him
when he was struggling.

357
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,918
So how dare you call him now?

358
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,420
Just get lost

359
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,172
before I throw a bucket
of freezing water on you.

360
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,388
But her voice sounded
too mature to be his girlfriend.

361
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,392
And it couldn't have been his mother
since his family's originally from Seoul.

362
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,019
And she's in the US right now.

363
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,022
I wonder who that angry woman was.

364
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,900
I think I might know that woman.

365
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,736
How?

366
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,116
The truth is Jeong-woo
is living on my friend's rooftop.

367
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,160
What?

368
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,884
Did you wait long?

369
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,969
Even if I did, I didn't.

370
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,430
You're so silly.

371
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,891
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

372
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,934
Jeong-woo!

373
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,853
What in the world?

374
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,981
Jeong-woo!

375
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,317
Why didn't you tell me?

376
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,778
I would've called sooner
if I knew you were struggling!

377
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,237
Why didn't you tell me?

378
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,739
What's wrong with you?

379
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,240
How did you know I was here?

380
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,077
Weren't you my blind date?

381
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,245
Hong-ran explained everything.

382
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,498
She said Jeong-woo
was living at your place.

383
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,582
What is this?

384
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,252
So the plastic surgeon
on your blind date was you?

385
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,588
Yes, but that's not important.

386
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,384
I would've come and taken you home
had I known about this.

387
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,221
Here on this worn-out rooftop…

388
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,641
You wouldn't have stayed at a place
worth just 300,000 won a month!

389
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,477
-It's actually 500,000 won.
-Plus maintenance fees?

390
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,355
Why would you ask about that?

391
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,942
Gosh, I'm truly sorry.

392
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,946
Could you give us some privacy?
We have so much to catch up on.

393
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,824
Don't be absurd. Can you give us privacy?
It's our first date--

394
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,742
I have so much to tell you.

395
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,955
I was worried sick about you, Jeong-woo.

396
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,168
You probably think everyone
turned their backs on you.

397
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,796
But a lot of people were worried like me

398
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,799
and didn't call
because they didn't want to bother you.

399
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,801
You can't give up like this, okay?

400
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,636
You know what?

401
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,264
Why don't we talk over a meal?

402
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,808
-Look, I--
-He's right. I'm fine, so go ahead.

403
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,185
No. Dae-yeong, I--

404
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,311
Call me afterward.

405
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,815
Wait, Ha-neul. Let me go.

406
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,692
-Don't leave!
-I truly missed you.

407
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,985
Don't leave. Let me go.

408
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,528
-Gosh, I…
-Let me go.

409
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,113
I'm really sorry!

410
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,699
What are you doing at a place like this?

411
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,075
HANYANG HWARO

412
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,451
Hurry up.

413
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,661
I'm coming.

414
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,038
-Come on in.
-Hello.

415
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,039
Hello.

416
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,666
Can we sit over there?

417
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,626
Here.

418
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,464
-What are you doing?
-Why aren't you sitting here?

419
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,135
You used to sit right down
whenever I pulled out a chair for myself.

420
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,344
Jeez.

421
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,057
Why have you matured so much?
It's heartbreaking.

422
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,517
What are you talking about?

423
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,644
You hated how I used to act.

424
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,605
Yes, it annoyed me.

425
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,149
But I much prefer that over this.

426
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,027
Seeing you timid like this makes me feel…

427
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,823
Sir, could we get five servings of beef?

428
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,867
-Sure.
-Why so much?

429
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,994
Don't be intimidated by the beef.

430
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,330
It's not that expensive here. Eat up.

431
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,791
You're even intimidated by beef now.

432
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,214
-Here.
-Thanks.

433
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,929
-It's good.
-Eat up.

434
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,849
You must've missed eating meat.

435
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,644
Stop being so dramatic.

436
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,313
Ha-neul's mother grilled
some meat for me yesterday.

437
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,898
-Beef?
-Pork.

438
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,899
I see.

439
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,860
Why are you so curious
about such trivial things?

440
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,987
I want to know everything about you.

441
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,241
I want to know how you've been living
and if it's been tough.

442
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,160
What's gotten into you today?

443
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,247
You sulked so much after that incident.

444
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:46,670
You nitpicked everything about me
and twisted my words like a pretzel.

445
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,046
Why the sudden change?

446
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,590
You're right.

447
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,260
I was bitter after that incident.

448
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,637
I hated you.

449
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,392
I envied and resented you at times.

450
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,478
But I realized something.

451
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,440
Seeing you suffer made my heart break.

452
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,361
That's when I realized
that I still cared and loved--

453
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,782
Are you seriously eating right now?

454
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,367
Are you done eating?

455
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,868
Should we go now?

456
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,329
I'm really busy today!

457
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,290
Hey, who's busier?
You, the unemployed one?

458
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,500
-Or me, the one who runs a clinic?
-Hey.

459
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,543
Hey.

460
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,712
-You have a good point.
-Right?

461
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,172
So eat up.

462
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,718
It's burning.

463
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,057
Thanks.

464
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,645
So tell me. Have you sorted
your thoughts out now?

465
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,566
I'm glad the incident's been resolved.

466
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,864
But a part of me can't help but wonder
why something like this happened to me.

467
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,240
To be honest,

468
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,910
I came by to tell you something.

469
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,502
What's on your mind?

470
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,508
What? I said I'd call when I got back.
Why are you outside?

471
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,095
I thought you'd be back around this time.
I couldn't wait to see you.

472
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,849
Well done. Let's go.
I can't wait for our date.

473
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,185
Hold on.

474
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,397
Hey.

475
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,358
Jeong-woo, what are you up to?

476
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,443
I'm on my way there. Can we talk?

477
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,111
Right now?

478
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,865
Now is… Today's pretty busy.
Let's take a rain check.

479
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,035
Man, you're hurting my feelings.

480
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,330
I helped you with your case,
but you stopped calling when it ended.

481
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,415
I was going to call you, but--

482
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,585
I'll be at home. Go meet him.

483
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,713
I really can't make any time today.

484
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,882
I'll call you later. I'm sorry.

485
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,760
What? Didn't he want to see you?

486
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,138
-But I promised to hang out with you.
-Still.

487
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,515
I'm not that loyal of a friend.

488
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,518
I'm already upset
about wasting time with Dae-yeong.

489
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,686
Let's go.

490
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,067
So tell me.

491
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,487
What's your definition
of an exciting date?

492
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
You'll find out.

493
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,491
It's going to be very sweet.

494
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,701
"Sweet"?

495
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,415
Gosh. I wonder what kind of date it'll be.

496
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,666
What's gotten into you?

497
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,292
You'll find out.

498
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,586
My heart's already swooning.

499
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,138
This dissertation
has been quite interesting.

500
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,433
I knew the recent trend
was discharging patients sooner with ERAS.

501
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,144
But at the Mayo Clinic,
75% of their patients

502
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,814
were discharged on the same day
of their mastectomies thanks to ERAS.

503
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,733
It was less than 10% before ERAS.

504
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,026
I see.

505
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,112
What do you think?

506
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,324
I'm not sure.

507
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,452
Can you be more enthusiastic?

508
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,619
Sure thing.

509
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,081
I didn't know
the difference would be that big.

510
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,501
But it'd be great to apply ERAS
to breast reconstruction surgery.

511
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,296
Right? There will be
less complications too.

512
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:17,797
Right.

513
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:23,386
By the way, was this really
the date you had in mind?

514
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,180
Yes. Why?

515
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,307
What? Nothing.

516
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,268
I didn't know if this was a date
or a conference.

517
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,603
But don't worry about it.

518
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:37,150
By the way, you do know
what "sweet" means. Right?

519
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:43,114
I've always wanted read and debate
over dissertations with my boyfriend.

520
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,283
So I thought this would be
a very sweet date.

521
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,329
It does sound sweet.

522
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,371
Right?

523
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,289
Yes.

524
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,376
But what are we doing next?

525
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,836
I booked a study cafe.

526
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,923
I thought we could write
a dissertation together.

527
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,842
Is there a topic
you'd like to write about?

528
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,348
But I'm not planning to research all day.

529
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,642
I even prepared a fun game.

530
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,769
-A game?
-Yeah.

531
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,938
-What kind of game?
-All right.

532
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,440
Let's see.

533
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,150
Are we slapping each other's wrists?

534
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,487
-Guess what this is.
-What is it?

535
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,655
A vein injection.

536
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,991
Next. Guess what this is.

537
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,452
-What could it be?
-An artery injection.

538
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,205
-We'll do a timed quiz--
-Follow me.

539
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,122
What? Why?

540
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,624
-Come here.
-Why?

541
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,671
Gosh, it's blinding.

542
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,383
Why are we at a movie theater?

543
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,802
You wanted to watch a movie
once things were settled.

544
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,222
You wanted to have popcorn
while sitting next to someone you liked.

545
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,515
You remembered that?

546
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,810
To be honest, I didn't want to
go on an ordinary date,

547
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,020
like watching a movie
or going to a coffee shop.

548
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,897
But I think it would be okay for you.

549
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,234
This is our first day as a couple.

550
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,946
Do we really have to read
and debate over dissertations?

551
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,950
Fine. We can do that
on our one-year anniversary.

552
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,538
Fine.

553
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,456
What was the last movie you saw?

554
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,209
Let's see. I was 12.

555
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,795
They played a movie
at my elementary school.

556
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,339
I think it was
The Shredder and the Vampire.

557
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,716
-Follow me.
-What?

558
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,477
THEATER

559
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,481
Right now!

560
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,236
To your right! Where are you going?

561
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,926
This came out nice. I'll take it.

562
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,136
I like that one the most too.

563
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,348
Then, I'll take this one.

564
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,772
Why are you staring? Were you touched
because I let you have it?

565
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,856
No.

566
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,236
I don't want a girlfriend
who yields and is understanding.

567
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,366
You excused yourself earlier
after Dae-yeong asked you to.

568
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,955
I mean, I felt bad
that you were always alone.

569
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,957
I was happy to see you have a visitor.

570
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,545
He sounded genuine,
so I wanted to give you time to talk.

571
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,006
Is that why you told me
to go see Kyung-min too?

572
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:30,967
Well…

573
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,178
You seemed hesitant
about refusing to meet him.

574
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,806
From now on,

575
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,268
I'd like it if you stopped
suppressing your feelings

576
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,187
and yielding to others.

577
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,694
It hurts my heart to see you
trying to be understanding of everything.

578
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,655
What do you mean?

579
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,285
You're always suppressing your feelings,
understanding, and yielding to others.

580
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,790
Maybe that's why you became so weary.

581
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,088
-Can I ask you something?
-What?

582
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,717
There must've been a point

583
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,802
when you realized
you were exhausted.

584
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,015
A pivotal moment
that made you visit a psychiatrist.

585
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,851
The real reason why you quit your job.

586
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,811
Stuff like that.

587
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,107
Was working at the hospital tough?

588
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,361
Or… did something happen?

589
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,628
CAN I HOLD

590
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,590
What are you up to?

591
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,053
Ha-neul was doodling.

592
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,182
-Mom, want to hear some good news?
-What?

593
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,433
Did you get a job?

594
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,395
No, but I think Ha-neul and Mr. Rooftop
are going to start dating.

595
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,690
-I know.
-How did you know that?

596
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,861
She said earlier she was writing
a dissertation on human emotions.

597
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,197
She asked about how relationships begin

598
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,367
and if you had to
officially say you're going out.

599
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,538
Why would she write about that now?
It was obviously about herself.

600
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,164
You picked that up quickly.

601
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,166
Of course. I'm her mom.

602
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,169
Gosh. She's been struggling these days,

603
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,755
so I hope a relationship
will help her feel better.

604
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,925
Don't be nosy and just play dumb.

605
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,552
I already was nosy.

606
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,013
I told her I knew about it,
and I begged him to date her.

607
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,724
For what? She would've managed on her own.

608
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,767
It's okay.

609
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,062
For someone like her to go
to such lengths and ask us for advice,

610
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,022
it means she needed our help.

611
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,567
She never brings up stuff
she doesn't want to talk about.

612
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,860
Gosh.

613
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,324
Nothing happened.

614
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,329
Nothing happened at the hospital.

615
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,667
I was just exhausted. That's all.

616
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,379
Then, that's a relief.

617
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,086
You don't need to walk me to the door.

618
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,922
I've always wanted to try it.

619
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,091
But you said we lived so close.

620
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,009
Still.

621
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,637
-Bye.
-Jeez.

622
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,263
All right. Bye.

623
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,147
What's this?

624
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,858
WEDDING INVITATION
MIN KYUNG-MIN & JUNG YU-RI

625
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,781
-What's wrong?
-Kyung-min said earlier he was nearby.

626
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,325
I guess he wanted
to give me his wedding invitation.

627
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,285
Wedding invitation?

628
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,289
-Is he getting married?
-Yeah.

629
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,499
I think in two months.

630
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,459
Could you give me a second?

631
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,420
Jeez, Kyung-min.

632
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,675
Hey.

633
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,428
Why did you come by
when I was out? Now, I feel bad.

634
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,765
All right.

635
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,269
Congratulations on the wedding.
I'll see you soon.

636
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,270
Bye.

637
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,360
Ha-neul, should we order food
and have some beer?

638
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,446
No, thanks.

639
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,073
I'm suddenly not feeling well.

640
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,075
Okay. Go home and rest up.

641
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,245
-Good night.
-Good night.

642
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,210
-Are you up?
-Yeah.

643
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,505
I thought maybe
we could have lunch together.

644
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,966
I'm sorry, but I'm outside right now.

645
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,301
You're outside?

646
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,385
Where are you?

647
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,097
I'll just… call you back later.

648
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,517
Sure. Okay.

649
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,478
Bye.

650
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,451
MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC APPOINTMENT

651
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,661
Right, the clinic. I need to go.

652
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,583
How have you been?

653
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,213
What brings you here today?

654
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,631
Well…

655
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,723
I'd like some more medication
in addition to the what I've been taking.

656
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,519
Some additional medication that I can take

657
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,314
when my heart aches a lot
or when I'm struggling.

658
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,902
Did you go through something

659
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,031
where you found yourself struggling?

660
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,091
Excuse me. My name is Yeo Jeong-woo.
I have an appointment at 2:00 p.m.

661
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,385
I see, Mr. Yeo.

662
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,512
You can go in right away.

663
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,430
Okay.

664
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,148
Because he always told me…

665
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,737
that I was doing well.

666
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,231
Why did she cry?

667
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,235
Why does she look so sad as she walks?

668
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,783
She looked so devastated as she left.

669
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,995
I had no clue why,

670
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,706
and that broke my heart.

671
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,605
Hey, where are you?

672
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,733
Someone suddenly wanted to see me.

673
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,110
I'll call you back later.

674
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,198
Okay. Make sure to call me.

675
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,042
Gosh, I am spent.

676
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,169
Nurse Do, why don't we all eat--

677
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,254
No, thank you.

678
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,257
I wasn't even done talking.

679
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,634
Nurse Do, are you being serious right now?

680
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,802
-Dr. Bin.
-Yes?

681
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,928
You have a guest.

682
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,137
A guest?

683
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,353
Jeong-woo, when did you get here?

684
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,273
Gosh, you have a nice clinic.

685
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,525
Right? Isn't it nice?

686
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,236
I thought I'd be successful,
so I took out a huge loan.

687
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,029
But I'm struggling to pay it back.

688
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,740
-Sit down.
-Okay.

689
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,868
Goodness.

690
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,288
So…

691
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,292
What brings you here?
Do you want to talk about something?

692
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,045
I just thought I should
tell you in person.

693
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,840
You're saying no?

694
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:14,717
That's right.

695
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,802
Gosh, Jeong-woo.

696
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,430
Come on. Let's just work together.

697
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,433
It'll be tough for you to take out
another loan, hire workers,

698
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,809
and open another clinic.

699
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,603
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,689
I'm really grateful for your offer.

701
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,818
-But now's not the time.
-Why not?

702
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,447
There's this girl I like,

703
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,366
but she's struggling right now.

704
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,161
So I think I should stay by her side.

705
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,413
Is it bad enough to not to work?

706
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,206
Not really.

707
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:52,296
But I think she'll be even more dejected
to see me get a job when she's unemployed.

708
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,465
Anyway,

709
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,261
I felt I owed you an explanation
since you gave me that good offer.

710
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,348
I decided to tell you after some thought,
so don't take it too hard.

711
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,975
I should get going. Sorry.

712
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,395
At least stay for some tea.

713
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,647
It's okay.

714
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,112
BUSAN'S ORIGINAL MILMYEON

715
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,837
NAM HA-NEUL

716
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,422
Jeong-woo.

717
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,926
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing much.

718
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,805
-Hello.
-Goodness.

719
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,100
You always look so weak,
like a dog that hasn't eaten anything.

720
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,393
Come upstairs.

721
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,521
I bought some chicken,
so have a drumstick if you want.

722
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,690
Yeah. Let's go.

723
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,483
-Come on.
-No, I'm okay.

724
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,818
-Let's go.
-No, I'm fine.

725
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,528
No, ma'am. Why are you doing this?

726
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,321
Let's have some chicken.

727
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,740
-I don't--
-Let's go in.

728
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:06,161
Hold on. I have some pancake mix,
so let me make some jeon.

729
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,707
Ha-neul will be home soon.
See her before you go if you want.

730
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,630
I think it's best if I just go.
So goodbye.

731
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,382
Where are you going?

732
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,676
Jeong-woo, we need to talk.

733
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,222
Talk? About what?

734
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,064
What do we need to talk about?

735
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:40,988
Jeong-woo.

736
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,531
Are you going out with Ha-neul yet?

737
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,868
Well, you see…

738
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,454
I guess you didn't ask yet.

739
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,789
You're more shy than I thought.

740
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,583
Well, do you need my help?

741
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,667
What?

742
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,129
"Ha-neul."

743
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,591
"My love for you is as big
as the sky and the Earth."

744
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:05,262
"If we go out, I'll treat you
and your brother well."

745
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,598
"I'll give him a lot of pocket money too."

746
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,933
How did that sound?

747
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,852
-Not good.
-Really?

748
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,438
Then…

749
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,522
Look…

750
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,235
"Ha-neul."

751
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,864
"We first met as students.
But now, we've reunited as adults."

752
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,742
"Instead of graduation photos,

753
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,786
how about we shoot
some wedding photos this time?"

754
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,957
Lambada, go buy some cooking oil.

755
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,126
Darn it. We're having
an important discussion.

756
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,879
Just forget about the jeon!
He's not your son-in-law.

757
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,465
You don't need to prepare a feast.
Just a minute.

758
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,551
I'm going to lose my mind.

759
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,514
I'm going to lose my mind even more.

760
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,850
Goodness.

761
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,607
My goodness.

762
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,425
By the way…

763
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,929
How do you know Kyung-min?

764
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,431
Do you like Ha-neul?

765
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,602
Don't be ridiculous.
Single all my life? I've dated before.

766
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,564
Is he getting married?

767
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,177
How have you been?

768
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,679
Good. It's been a while.

769
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,514
How have you been?

770
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,477
I've just been resting.

771
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,481
Why did you want to see me?

772
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,861
Well, I just thought you should know.

773
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,238
Professor Min Kyung-min
is getting married.

774
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:30,949
I heard.

775
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,410
Do you also know
about tonight's goodbye party too?

776
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,372
He's quitting work too.

777
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,125
But he got that position recently.

778
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,420
He's getting married to the daughter
of a pharmaceutical company CEO,

779
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,797
so he'll be working there soon.

780
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,178
Why did he do that
if he was going to quit so soon?

781
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,974
It's obvious. The company would benefit
if his resume showed he was a professor.

782
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,146
Let's be honest.
You wrote that whole dissertation.

783
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,939
He put himself down as the sole author,

784
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,359
took all the credit,
and became a professor.

785
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,986
I can't believe he's putting
Dr. Woo in his position.

786
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,535
I sometimes think about that day.

787
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,750
On that day,

788
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,294
everything was perfect.

789
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,344
I solved a hard question
that I'd struggled with for days.

790
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,352
FIRST ROW, FIRST SEAT

791
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,735
I was assigned to a seat in the corner
where I could concentrate well.

792
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,287
DADAEPO GIRL'S HIGH PE TEST

793
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,541
I wasn't confident about the PE test,
but I even aced that.

794
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,223
That day was full of only good things.

795
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,936
I thought,

796
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,899
"I guess everyone gets at least one day
that shines like this in their lives."

797
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,444
DAD

798
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,195
What? I didn't know he called.

799
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,837
Honey!

800
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,756
Open your eyes!

801
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,761
Honey, please wake up!

802
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,306
Honey, please open your eyes!

803
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,893
Man-seok!

804
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,895
Honey!

805
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,272
Honey!

806
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,831
At the end of that perfect day,

807
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,210
unbearable misfortune was waiting for me.

808
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,380
-Thank you for coming.
-Poor thing.

809
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,673
-This way, please.
-Goodness.

810
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,784
When my dad took his last breath,

811
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,412
I was basking in happiness.

812
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,499
I couldn't even say

813
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,211
goodbye to him one last time.

814
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:16,424
-Those thoughts haunted me for a while.
-Dad…

815
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,556
Ever since then, whenever I'd feel happy,

816
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,852
I'd suddenly feel…

817
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,897
anxiety within my heart.

818
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,443
"How long will this happiness last?"

819
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,866
Every moment…

820
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,912
It feels like I'm struggling
with guilt, anxiety, and unease

821
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,292
in every single moment of my life.

822
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:57,173
So maybe that was why…

823
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,970
when he complimented me,

824
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,182
I felt at peace.

825
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,271
Because he always told me…

826
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,901
that I was doing well.

827
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,801
It's tough, right? Take a look at these.

828
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,555
What? How did you…

829
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,183
You know these were
hard to come by, right?

830
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,145
Thank you so much.

831
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,730
No worries. Good luck.

832
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,657
Things like this can happen,
so you need to be cautious.

833
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,909
That'll be all for today. Good work.

834
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,537
I know you're all exhausted from a lot
of night shifts but stay strong.

835
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,332
Right. Don't make Ha-neul
stay up two nights in a row.

836
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,211
She's writing a dissertation right now.
Okay, good luck.

837
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,423
Right.

838
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,303
You've never done
a Whipple procedure, right? Want to try?

839
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,722
Do you mean that?

840
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,224
Can I really participate?

841
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,725
Normally, no.

842
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,812
You know you learn a lot
from major surgeries, right?

843
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:37,440
I was proud of how hard you work,
so I got the professor's permission.

844
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,152
Thank you so much.

845
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,988
I'll work hard to prepare for it.

846
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:47,075
He made me rely on him.

847
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,578
Sir, congratulations
on becoming assistant professor.

848
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,832
Another spot will open for you soon.
Let's enjoy some good food today.

849
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,583
-Thank you for the food.
-Dig in!

850
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,626
Yeah, go ahead and eat.

851
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:09,681
Why did you do it?

852
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,185
I wrote the entire dissertation,
so why did you omit my name?

853
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:16,980
That?

854
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,442
I thought it'd be best
if I was the sole author this time.

855
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,111
Both Dr. Oh and Dr. Kwon did the same.

856
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,487
So I should too.

857
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,157
Theirs also have IFs of ten,
but this is all I have.

858
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,910
But I wrote everything.

859
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,579
You can't be the sole author--

860
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,747
This is your problem.

861
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,541
Are you really that dense?
Do you have to do this?

862
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,379
You want my life to be ruined?

863
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:49,763
Ha-neul, I'll recommend you
when a new spot opens up.

864
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,806
So let's just sweep this under the rug.

865
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,023
The professor's agreed
to it too, so that's it.

866
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:34,766
Professor Min.

867
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,477
It's so sad to see you
leave suddenly like this.

868
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,563
-That's right.
-Are you sure? You look pretty happy.

869
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,108
Not at all! Seriously.

870
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,193
Thank you for everything. Let's drink.

871
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,278
-Good job, everyone.
-You too, Professor.

872
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,530
Great job.

873
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,031
-Great job.
-You too, sir.

874
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,703
-Have some more, Dr. Woo.
-Sure.

875
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,163
-Good work.
-Thank you.

876
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,874
-Great job.
-Thank you.

877
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:00,792
Dr. Nam.

878
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,764
Ha-neul, what brings you here?

879
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,767
Am I not welcome here?

880
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,315
You are.

881
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,359
Thank you for coming.
I'll pour you a drink.

882
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:31,948
Thanks.

883
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,792
What are you doing--

884
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,252
Is it okay to tell?

885
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,964
Here in front of everyone?

886
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,308
Live an honest life, will you?

887
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,695
Stop!

888
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,835
-Are you headed home now?
-Hello.

889
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,923
Right. Did you have
a nice talk with Jeong-woo?

890
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,594
I don't think so.

891
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,970
Why not?

892
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,082
Hey.

893
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,336
I'm not doing much.

894
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,504
Don't lie.

895
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:13,675
You're on a date with your boyfriend.
I know you're going out with Jeong-woo.

896
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,136
How did you know?

897
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,848
Dr. Bin told me
Jeong-woo had a girlfriend.

898
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,225
So I knew it was you.

899
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,103
Dr. Bin said that?

900
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,020
You see…

901
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,731
I'm not sure if I should tell you this.

902
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,990
The truth is Dr. Bin
asked Jeong-woo to work with him.

903
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,242
But he refused.

904
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,746
-What?
-He said he had to stay by your side.

905
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,750
He said you'd be really dejected
if he was the only one who got a job.

906
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,463
But Dr. Bin doesn't know it's you
because he asked me to pass this on.

907
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,425
He thinks you two are close,
so he wants you to persuade him.

908
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:01,180
I didn't want to tell you this
and trouble you,

909
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,224
but I thought you should still know.

910
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,731
All right.

911
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,463
This is the worst.

912
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,998
Ha-neul, why haven't you picked up?
Where's your umbrella? What happened?

913
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,086
Why did you have to humiliate me?

914
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,589
What?

915
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,051
Why did you make me
even more miserable?

916
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,891
Ha-neul.

917
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,813
Let's end it here.

918
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,239
I don't think I'm ready
to date anyone right now.

919
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,076
I was okay yesterday…

920
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,163
but not today.

921
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,710
My emotions are all over the place.

922
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,588
I don't know if I'm resting
or falling apart.

923
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,466
-Ha-neul.
-I'd forgotten for a minute.

924
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,265
I'm someone who struggles
to even take care of herself.

925
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,562
I'm sorry.

926
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,699
Can't you just struggle by my side?

927
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,912
Whatever that pain is,

928
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,207
let's go through it together.

929
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:39,839
No.

930
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,887
Why do you have to suffer because of me?

931
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,224
That's the worst.

932
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:58,941
I'm okay.

933
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,652
We don't need to date,
and you don't need to like me.

934
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,656
So just take this.

935
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,061
DOCTOR SLUMP

936
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,981
Can I wait for you?

937
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:21,941
Don't skip your meals.

938
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,401
Take your medication on time

939
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:26,737
You can come back after some time.

940
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,783
You saw the photo in my room.
The one Kyung-min and I took.

941
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,660
You're not interested in dating, are you?

942
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,956
Did you know
that Jeong-woo suffered from PTSD?

943
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,208
I'm not strong enough.

944
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,169
I'm sorry.

945
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:48,593
