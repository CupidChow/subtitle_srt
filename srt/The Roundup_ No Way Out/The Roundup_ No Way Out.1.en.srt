1
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:30,442
This bastard is a cop.

2
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:34,442
He knew we were bringing drugs through this boat.

3
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,666
Take care of him.

4
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:01,574
Hey, wrap him up in plastic and hang him up.

5
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:02,574
Hey.

6
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:04,574
You can't kill him.

7
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:06,574
Why? Can't I kill the police?

8
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,374
How did you find this place?

9
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:11,274
I think he's after me.

10
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:12,374
You bastard!

11
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:15,374
What did you do to bring the police?

12
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:17,274
You...

13
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,874
I told you to be careful.

14
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,234
Okay, so stop.

15
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,234
Stop it!

16
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,034
I'm going.

17
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:35,954
I put in more money this month.

18
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:37,954
What about the drugs?

19
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:39,954
I'm making 20 kilos. I'll be ready soon.

20
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:41,954
But you have to move quietly.

21
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,954
I'm suspicious of the drug sales in Japan.

22
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,058
Get ready for the bio meeting tomorrow.

23
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,082
You put me in danger first!

24
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,082
Come here!

25
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,082
Where are you going?

26
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:31,082
Are you in danger?

27
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:32,082
Put the camera down!

28
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,082
I'm going to hit you from the morning!

29
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,082
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:39,082
Don't hit me!

31
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:41,082
What are you looking at?

32
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,082
What are you doing?

33
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:44,082
You hit a person?

34
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:45,082
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,082
Come in.

36
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,082
Come in.

37
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:50,082
Go in.

38
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,082
Go in!

39
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,146
Hey, stop!

40
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,146
What's wrong with you?

41
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:13,146
What's wrong with you?

42
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:15,146
What are you?

43
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,146
Is this a hit and run?

44
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:19,146
Just go.

45
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:21,146
Before I kill you.

46
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:23,146
I'm asking you.

47
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,146
Don't ask me.

48
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,146
What?

49
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:53,158
I'll erase all your tattoos.

50
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,506
Don't come, don't come.

51
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,306
I'm really going to stab you.

52
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,206
I'm going to stab you.

53
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,126
It's dangerous.

54
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,526
You know.

55
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:09,262
Police, police.

56
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,562
You have to come quickly.

57
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,842
I'll start.

58
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:13,562
Here, here and here.

59
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,162
There's someone who's hurt.

60
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,362
You scared me.

61
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:17,562
No, it's not me.

62
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,562
It's not me.

63
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,562
Stay still.

64
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:20,562
No, it's not me.

65
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:21,562
No, it's not me.

66
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:22,862
No, it's not me.

67
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:24,862
No, it's not me.

68
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,362
I'm a staff member of Gwangsu University.

69
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:27,762
Tell them you didn't see me.

70
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,962
I'm sorry, but please get the car out of here quickly.

71
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,362
I have to go to work.

72
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,562
It's late, it's late.

73
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:37,762
Hey, the bastards you caught earlier are being bad.

74
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,762
Seocho-dong knife crime case.

75
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:42,362
I haven't caught you for a year, but how did you catch it?

76
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,362
You can tell by looking at it.

77
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:45,362
Hey, Seok-do.

78
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,362
The police are proving it as a real thing.

79
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:49,362
That's why I brought you.

80
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,362
Hey, but please bring me in a good way.

81
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:54,362
Oh, I'm not that easy.

82
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,362
I'm not that easy.

83
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:56,362
I'm not that easy.

84
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,362
I'm not that easy.

85
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,362
What's a police?

86
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,362
Isn't it a crowd of people?

87
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:09,362
How do you make a cane a crowd?

88
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:13,362
But after Seok-do came, his performance improved.

89
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:14,362
Stop it.

90
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:15,362
I can only see your nose in the mirror.

91
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:18,362
When you were 20, you quit boxing and started to police.

92
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,362
I felt it when I found it.

93
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,362
Hey, have one of these.

94
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,362
I'll give you a ball.

95
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:24,362
My wife gave it to me.

96
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:26,362
Give it to me.

97
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:27,362
I don't give it to you.

98
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:28,362
This is made of grade A steel.

99
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:29,362
Thank you for the meal.

100
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:31,362
It's very good for the recovery of energy.

101
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:34,362
I'm saving this expensive one and half.

102
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,362
If you save it, you'll collapse.

103
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,362
Eat it all.

104
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,362
It's a waste.

105
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,362
Do you eat one?

106
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,362
How can I have a good effect when I eat half?

107
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:42,362
Um, I like this.

108
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:43,362
Good.

109
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,362
What's this?

110
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,362
Hello.

111
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:49,362
Where's all this?

112
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:50,362
Yes, hello.

113
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:51,362
How many did you eat?

114
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,362
Do you know how expensive this is?

115
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,362
What do I know?

116
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,362
Are you doing this to me?

117
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:58,362
Yes, that's right.

118
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,362
You bastards.

119
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:01,362
Yes, yes, yes.

120
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,362
Yes, I see.

121
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:04,362
There's been a case in front of the office.

122
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:05,362
I have to go.

123
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:06,362
Cell phone.

124
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:15,338
Where is it?

125
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:15,838
This way

126
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,158
The victim is a 28 year old woman

127
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:19,358
She fell from the 8th floor

128
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:20,958
There is no CCTV over there

129
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,478
So we can't confirm the time of death

130
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:23,838
We saw a CCTV inside the hotel

131
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:24,838
There was a man and two people

132
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,078
But the man was alone when he left

133
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,518
But his face was not captured

134
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,518
This way

135
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:35,914
I've contacted the family of the deceased.

136
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,254
Hey, you're here.

137
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,294
I don't think there's any other evidence

138
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,554
other than the drinking in the room.

139
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:43,854
There's a question about a man.

140
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,754
It's not a synonymous.

141
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,754
Why is it not a synonymous? Is he a foreigner?

142
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:49,654
I told them to look into it.

143
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:52,614
The victim's whereabouts are being traced by the CCTV.

144
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:53,794
Let's see if there's a witness.

145
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:54,454
Okay.

146
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,354
The victim went to a club.

147
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:58,054
It was written on the wristband.

148
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:00,714
Club Orange?

149
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,194
Let's get a copy first.

150
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:02,894
Okay.

151
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,754
This is the autopsy report of the hotel's fallen victim, Go Sun-hee.

152
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:17,954
The trauma is a skull fracture and a broken skull.

153
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,754
It's a common symptom found in fallen bodies.

154
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:23,754
The direct cause is cardiac arrest.

155
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,354
The cause is a drug from the blood.

156
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:27,854
This is...

157
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,754
Wait, a drug?

158
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:30,454
Yes.

159
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:33,654
It's a new drug called Hyper.

160
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,754
It's much stronger than cocaine or filopon.

161
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:39,954
It's as toxic as heroin, so it's very dangerous.

162
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:45,154
A lot of drugs have been detected in the victim's blood.

163
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,954
So someone threw it after she died?

164
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:48,954
Yes.

165
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,678
She was in a club with the victim.

166
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:54,978
She almost got into trouble.

167
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:55,978
Go in after this.

168
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:56,778
Okay.

169
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:00,378
Hey, Seok-do.

170
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:01,978
What did he say?

171
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:05,378
He said he lost his mind after drinking the drug from a club.

172
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,678
He said he didn't see Go Sun-hee anymore.

173
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,378
He must have drunk the drug and drank it.

174
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:11,978
I'll send this to the drug squad.

175
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:13,578
Let's get rid of this.

176
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,778
This is a murder case.

177
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:16,878
Really?

178
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,878
I'll do this. Don't send it.

179
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,806
We need to check the CCTV at the club.

180
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:26,306
They're not cooperating.

181
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:28,106
I've already sent a search warrant.

182
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,306
Who's the boss?

183
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,506
There are three bosses.

184
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,406
One of them is Lee Sang-chul, a gangster.

185
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,006
He hasn't been answering his phone.

186
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,006
Let's just go.

187
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:37,306
How can we go without a warrant?

188
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,406
We can just go.

189
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,106
We can't.

190
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:41,206
We can't think of the nightclub.

191
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,906
We can't go in.

192
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,006
Why not?

193
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,106
The water management is so bad.

194
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,606
We can't go in because of you.

195
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:47,806
We can't go in because of you.

196
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:50,806
Follow me.

197
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,146
This is the place, right?

198
00:09:58,146 --> 00:09:59,146
Yes, Orange.

199
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:00,146
It's been a while since I went to a club.

200
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:02,146
Why isn't this guy coming?

201
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,146
Look at him. He's so handsome.

202
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,146
Hey!

203
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,146
What's wrong with him?

204
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:10,146
Is he a gangster?

205
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,146
Hey, they're looking at us.

206
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,146
I'm scared. I'm scared.

207
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,146
Look at him laughing.

208
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:18,146
Why? Why is he laughing?

209
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,146
I'm dying.

210
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:23,146
Is he a star like you?

211
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:25,146
Well, maybe.

212
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,146
Boss!

213
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,146
Hurry up.

214
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,146
This is Ja Dong-moon.

215
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,146
He's the one who runs the Gangnam business.

216
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,146
Nice to meet you, Dong-moon.

217
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,146
Nice to meet you, boss.

218
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:38,146
I just need to let him in.

219
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:40,146
But if you're a detective, I'm in trouble.

220
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,146
Be quiet.

221
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:44,146
I'll go in.

222
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,466
Dong-moon!

223
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:49,466
Yes, brother.

224
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,466
Where's the money?

225
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,466
He's here.

226
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,466
What's wrong with your clothes?

227
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,466
You're not here to get money, are you?

228
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,466
I'm a detective.

229
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,466
You can go in.

230
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,786
You can go in.

231
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,490
Thank you.

232
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,674
No, I have a colleague here, in the MVP room.

233
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,434
Go away.

234
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,994
Don't touch it, I'm saying this because I know someone.

235
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:05,954
Look at this.

236
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,194
Go away.

237
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,074
Can't you hear me?

238
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:29,794
Give me the money.

239
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:30,794
Oh, shit.

240
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:32,794
See you later.

241
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,794
See you again.

242
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,794
Hey, thanks.

243
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,370
Aren't you coming too often?

244
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,370
Hey, where is a place like this?

245
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,370
Don't you have a high-pod?

246
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,370
The quality is good, right?

247
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,370
I'll take a good picture today.

248
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,370
Give me everything you have.

249
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,370
Oh, brother.

250
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,370
If you feed too much, this is...

251
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
I'm in trouble.

252
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
Hey, I'll take care of it.

253
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,370
It's beautiful.

254
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
Hello, everyone.

255
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,858
Two, four, six, seven, eight.

256
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,858
What the fuck?

257
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,858
This is drugs, right?

258
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:15,358
What?

259
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:17,558
You bastard.

260
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:18,358
You're not taking it?

261
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,058
It's not a nutritional supplement.

262
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:20,858
I'm not taking it.

263
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:22,058
You bastard.

264
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,358
You fucking bastard. You're not taking it?

265
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:24,358
Hey, you're my dad's...

266
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:28,378
What? What is it?

267
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:28,878
Yeah.

268
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:30,078
Take it.

269
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:31,878
It's drugs.

270
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,378
It's drugs?

271
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:33,878
Yeah.

272
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:36,178
Call headquarters and take this bastard.

273
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,178
I'm going to put it in here from now on.

274
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,878
I met some friends who are too hot to meet these days.

275
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:42,878
Nice to meet you.

276
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:43,878
Let's go.

277
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,878
Let's go.

278
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:52,218
Who is it?

279
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:52,718
Yeah.

280
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:53,718
Is it a new guard?

281
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,718
Hey, you can't just come in like that. Get out.

282
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:56,718
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

283
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:57,718
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

284
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:00,718
Put this and this and this in here.

285
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:01,218
Yeah.

286
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:02,718
So what is it? What is it?

287
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,718
There's something like that.

288
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,718
What are you doing?

289
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,718
What are you doing?

290
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:07,718
It came out well.

291
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:08,718
What are you doing?

292
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:10,718
Why are you putting this in?

293
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:11,718
Hey, look here.

294
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,718
What is it?

295
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:15,218
Why are you putting this in?

296
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:15,718
Okay.

297
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:17,718
No, but this...

298
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:18,718
Sit down. Sit down.

299
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:19,718
You're a fucking bastard.

300
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:22,718
Hey, is there anyone out there?

301
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,718
Fuck, really.

302
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:27,718
You were here.

303
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:29,718
You fucking...

304
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:32,718
Hey, don't.

305
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:44,802
It hurts so much.

306
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:46,402
Hey.

307
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:47,402
Oh, shit!

308
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:48,402
You're a worker here, right?

309
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:49,402
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:50,402
Where's the boss?

311
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:53,146
Me, me, me, me!

312
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:54,146
I'm not kidding!

313
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:57,146
Me, me, me, me!

314
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,146
I'm not kidding!

315
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,146
Me, me, me, me!

316
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:02,146
Oh, shit!

317
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:05,146
Wait, wait, wait.

318
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,146
Oh, shit! Is it a guard?

319
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:09,146
Lee Sang-chul.

320
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:10,146
Lee Sang-chul?

321
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:12,146
You son of a bitch!

322
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:16,146
Oh, shit!

323
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:20,146
What's wrong with you?

324
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,146
What's wrong? Are you a gangster?

325
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:24,146
No, he's a gangster.

326
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,146
Oh, you bastards.

327
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:30,146
Hey, Man-ja, good job.

328
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,146
Yes.

329
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,146
Which car are you getting in?

330
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,146
What's this?

331
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:36,146
Oh, Seok-joo, good job.

332
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:37,146
Hey, is that all?

333
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,146
Wait a minute.

334
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,146
It's just the beginning.

335
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,146
The police are real.

336
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:42,146
We need to catch them all.

337
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,530
You're here.

338
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,530
I'm here.

339
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,354
You're here, brother.

340
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,354
Long time no see.

341
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,354
Long time no see.

342
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:57,354
Say hello.

343
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:58,354
This is Mr. Baek.

344
00:15:58,354 --> 00:15:59,354
Nice to meet you.

345
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:00,354
Nice to meet you.

346
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:02,354
Please.

347
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:06,354
My customers in North Korea are all from Mr. Jo.

348
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:09,354
His products and drinks are the best.

349
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,354
This is the president of our company.

350
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,354
This is our client, Mr. Jo.

351
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,354
Nice to meet you, Mr. President.

352
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:21,354
I'm the president.

353
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:33,274
Isn't this Hyper?

354
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,714
I heard there's a problem in Japan.

355
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,554
It's hard to get it now.

356
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:41,114
It's okay to ask them for a few dollars.

357
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:43,914
The price is lower than in Japan.

358
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:51,290
How much can you sell?

359
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,090
How much can you buy this?

360
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,930
Jiao Wei, you're so nice.

361
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,290
How much do you want?

362
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,490
How much do we want?

363
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,458
I'll give you 20kg of it the day after tomorrow.

364
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:11,058
20kg is worth about 300 billion won.

365
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:13,058
What do you think?

366
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,346
Okay.

367
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:31,738
This is the contract.

368
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,538
If this deal is successful,

369
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,938
we can keep the business going.

370
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,738
You can count on us from now on.

371
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,778
I'll take care of the rest.

372
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,178
Don't worry.

373
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,578
They'll take care of the customs. Don't worry.

374
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:51,378
Okay. Come on.

375
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:52,778
We're all brothers.

376
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,278
Is this the CCTV?

377
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:56,978
Yes.

378
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:58,978
He's the one who took the dead Ko Sun-il.

379
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,478
Stop. Stop.

380
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:01,978
You.

381
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,778
The quality is bad.

382
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:06,378
Bring the club president.

383
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,178
Yes.

384
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,978
Do you know him or not?

385
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,650
If you don't tell him that I sold drugs in your store,

386
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,750
I'll scold you.

387
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
I'm not saying I don't know him.

388
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,650
I really don't know him.

389
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,150
Those bastards are trying to sell drugs without telling the boss.

390
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,350
How do I know that?

391
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,950
But the Korean police

392
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,650
can't arrest such a heavy person

393
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,750
and investigate it without permission.

394
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,750
That's why people say it's fake.

395
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,450
Hey, get me a cup of coffee.

396
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,150
Me?

397
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,850
Yes, I'm talking to you.

398
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,950
Hey, be careful.

399
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,450
This guy is in big trouble.

400
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,150
No, no.

401
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,950
If you cover the CCTV one more time, I'll punish you.

402
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,150
Then let's clean up the room of truth.

403
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,150
It's time to clean up.

404
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,750
Park Rae-ah.

405
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,650
Yes.

406
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,150
I don't want to do it.

407
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:15,274
There's a lot of dust in there.

408
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:21,514
What's wrong with him?

409
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,514
Hey, look at him like this.

410
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:25,514
Hey, hey, hey.

411
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,514
Hey, hey, hey.

412
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:31,514
It's okay, it's okay.

413
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,514
Sit straight, sit straight.

414
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,514
You're not feeling well.

415
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:37,514
It's okay, it's okay.

416
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,514
Now, start.

417
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:41,514
It's our VIP who comes once a week.

418
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,514
Every time I come, I sell a big one.

419
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:45,514
They pretended not to know even if they were working overtime.

420
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:47,514
I'm not going to sell it.

421
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:49,514
Again?

422
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,650
That's all.

423
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,650
Let's clean up again.

424
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,650
Wait a minute.

425
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,650
Please.

426
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,234
Okay.

427
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:02,562
Keep going.

428
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:04,562
He's the most popular guy.

429
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,562
He's a drug dealer from Incheon since last year.

430
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:08,562
I got it because I had money.

431
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:12,562
Our club doesn't sell real drugs.

432
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,562
It's real.

433
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,562
It's either in Gangnam or Incheon.

434
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,562
I don't know.

435
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,562
Okay.

436
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,562
Hey, hand him over and call the communications company.

437
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,562
Get the location of Hiroshi.

438
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:26,562
I'll kill the drug dealers in Seoul.

439
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,562
Who's going to Incheon?

440
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,562
I'll take the kids to Incheon.

441
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,562
Okay, take him.

442
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:34,562
Yes.

443
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:36,562
So what Dong-woo said is

444
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,562
Yes.

445
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,562
The president of Gangnam is still spraying drugs.

446
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,562
That's what you're saying.

447
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:44,562
It's a high-end bar for rich people.

448
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,562
It's run by members only.

449
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:48,562
He's spraying secret drugs there, too.

450
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,562
But I'm never going in there.

451
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:52,562
President Jung's brother is a gangster.

452
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:54,562
I'll die if I get caught.

453
00:20:54,562 --> 00:20:56,562
Anyway, I broke the club.

454
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,562
Thanks to you, I'm running away.

455
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:00,562
Hey, if I don't let you go there,

456
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:02,562
I'll let you go next time.

457
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,562
Here's one, two, three, four.

458
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,562
Hey, here?

459
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,562
Yes.

460
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:12,650
The door's locked, you bastard.

461
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,650
I don't know that.

462
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,650
Oh, wait a minute.

463
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,650
I'll go in.

464
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,650
It's okay. You have to check it out.

465
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,650
Hey, Cha Dong-woon.

466
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,650
Hello, Junsu.

467
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,650
How did you get in?

468
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,650
What are you guys?

469
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,946
Did you break the door?

470
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,946
Did you break the door?

471
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,946
Go and fix the door.

472
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:36,946
Hurry up.

473
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,946
I'm sorry.

474
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,946
Jin-su, who is it?

475
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,946
It's nothing.

476
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:44,946
I'm here to see President Jung.

477
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:46,946
Is my sister your friend?

478
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,946
Get out.

479
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:50,946
Get out.

480
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,946
Calm down.

481
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,946
Calm down.

482
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,946
The badge...

483
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,946
You're out of your mind.

484
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:00,946
Get up.

485
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,490
It's the police.

486
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,490
Who are you?

487
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,490
Who are you to ruin my business?

488
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,490
Who the hell are you?

489
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,490
It's the police.

490
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,490
President Jung?

491
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,490
You said you sold drugs.

492
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,490
Where's the medicine?

493
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,490
I heard everything.

494
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,490
What are you doing?

495
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,490
What are you doing?

496
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,490
What are you doing?

497
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,490
Wait a minute.

498
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,490
Don't touch it.

499
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,490
Why is there a drawer here?

500
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,490
There could be a drawer there.

501
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,490
What's going on?

502
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,490
No, talk to me.

503
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,490
Yes?

504
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,490
Detective.

505
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:54,618
Hey, are you sad? Sit straight.

506
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:57,618
How dare you punch the police, you bastard.

507
00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:00,618
And if you tell me the truth, I'll let you go to the top.

508
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:02,618
Tell me quickly.

509
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:06,618
Actually, my father was an alcoholic when I was young.

510
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,618
Hey, hey, hey.

511
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:09,618
Oh, it's loud.

512
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:10,618
Do you know this person or not?

513
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:11,618
Look, look.

514
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:14,618
Oh, Mr. Hee-ro?

515
00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:17,618
I came to the store once a week.

516
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:18,618
At first, I met him in Incheon.

517
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:20,618
Is the medicine coming from Incheon?

518
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:22,618
He made it himself.

519
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,618
I heard he's a gangster from Japan.

520
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:26,618
Yakuza?

521
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:32,514
Brother, I checked that Hee-ro is here in Incheon.

522
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:34,514
I'll get it right now.

523
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:35,514
He's a Yakuza.

524
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,514
Do you speak Japanese?

525
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:37,514
No.

526
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:39,514
I'll speak Japanese.

527
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:40,514
I'll take care of it.

528
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:41,514
Anyway, be careful.

529
00:23:43,514 --> 00:23:45,778
Should I have gone?

530
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:16,098
Who is it?

531
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:19,398
Um...

532
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:25,130
What kind of crazy bastard is it?

533
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,634
You bastard!

534
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:08,634
You bastard!

535
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,634
Stop him!

536
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,634
Stop him!

537
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,042
Are you okay?

538
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:28,042
I'm dying.

539
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,042
What's this?

540
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:34,042
You bastards!

541
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,042
Where did you get this?

542
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:38,042
This is a police gun.

543
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,042
Can't you speak Korean?

544
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,042
Are you laughing?

545
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,042
You're taking drugs and killing people.

546
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:47,042
I'll make you do this and that for at least 30 years.

547
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,042
You're laughing because you understand this.

548
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:51,042
Team leader, I'm here.

549
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,786
Seok-do!

550
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,786
What's up?

551
00:25:55,786 --> 00:25:57,786
I'm going up to catch Hee-won.

552
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,786
Good job.

553
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:02,786
You guys thought you wouldn't catch me?

554
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:05,786
There's a lot of drugs left in this bastard's house.

555
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:07,786
It's over 20kg.

556
00:26:07,786 --> 00:26:09,786
I'm going to catch you this time.

557
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:11,786
Good job.

558
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:13,786
I'll go up and...

559
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,786
Hello?

560
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,786
Hello?

561
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,458
Hey!

562
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:04,634
Don't leave me!

563
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:06,634
Take me with you!

564
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:55,394
Brother, you watched Hiroshi well.

565
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,794
What about Tomo?

566
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:58,394
I contacted him.

567
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,570
I'm going to kill you.

568
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,570
Hey, what are you doing?

569
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,570
I've never seen you before.

570
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:35,202
Hey, don't you teach your kids?

571
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,202
No!

572
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:38,202
Stop it!

573
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:40,202
Why are you doing this to me?

574
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:45,202
Are you crazy? You're stealing medicine from the police?

575
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:56,618
If Chairman Lee Chil-joo finds out, we'll all die.

576
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:59,618
We'll get caught for stealing the drugs.

577
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,618
Then, don't let her find out.

578
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,218
If we mess up this time,

579
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:08,618
you'll all die.

580
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,410
This is a deal with CEO Baek tomorrow.

581
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,410
Pack it again.

582
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,510
20kg of drug is confiscated.

583
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
The price is 3 million won.

584
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,350
This way.

585
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,310
This way.

586
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,550
Don't touch me.

587
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,350
Don't touch me.

588
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,310
I'll do it.

589
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,110
Secretary Jong!

590
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,350
Secretary Jong!

591
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,710
Oh, my.

592
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,550
Sit down.

593
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,110
Are you okay?

594
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,510
What happened?

595
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,650
I'm sorry.

596
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,050
What are you sorry for?

597
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,050
Are you okay?

598
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,850
We're okay.

599
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,050
We're fine.

600
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,350
What about Tae-su?

601
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,450
He's in the emergency room.

602
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,110
He's hurt his head a lot.

603
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,750
Oh, my.

604
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,898
If you want to send all of this today,

605
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:05,398
you have to hurry.

606
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:07,658
Oh, my. Is it blue crab today?

607
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:10,998
It smells fishy.

608
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:14,198
Put it deep inside.

609
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:16,198
What?

610
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:18,598
Hello. Long time no see.

611
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:19,458
What?

612
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,798
You're coming now?

613
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:22,398
Oh, yes.

614
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:24,498
Hi.

615
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:27,198
Hey, Tomo is coming.

616
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:28,398
That son of a bitch.

617
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,458
He said he was coming.

618
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,998
But I prepared a lot.

619
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,598
Business is...

620
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,098
What? He's already here?

621
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:36,898
Why is he so fast?

622
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:40,498
He's usually so slow.

623
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:44,058
Welcome to Japan.

624
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:46,358
I'm going to open this time.

625
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:51,562
How did it go? Did you find it?

626
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:54,762
Check this again.

627
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:02,562
What is this? It's a total mess.

628
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,362
It's urgent, so wrap it up clean.

629
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:15,386
I heard that Hee-ro is dead.

630
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,386
Isn't there a problem with our business?

631
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:19,386
Watch your mouth.

632
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:21,386
You don't know even if you make me do it.

633
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,386
You don't know. Do you understand?

634
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,386
I understand.

635
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,386
You're in charge of the dead Hee-ro.

636
00:31:31,386 --> 00:31:33,386
I've already finished talking to my partner.

637
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:35,386
Really? Awesome!

638
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:37,386
Then shouldn't you introduce me to your partner?

639
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:42,450
You don't know.

640
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,450
Just listen to me.

641
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,450
Yeah, I don't have to know.

642
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,450
I just need to make money.

643
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,450
Hey, wrap it up and give it to him.

644
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,450
Hey, this eel is good.

645
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,450
Eat a lot and get better soon.

646
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,450
Thank you. Thank you.

647
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,450
But you didn't see anything?

648
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,450
CCTVs around you fainted.

649
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,450
I think he followed us in the first place.

650
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,450
Hey, why are you talking to me when you're eating?

651
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,450
Hey, eat it.

652
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,450
You don't know the impression difference?

653
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,450
Yes, it was too dark.

654
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,450
I'll eat it later after I eat.

655
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,450
Why don't you eat? It's delicious, right?

656
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,450
Hey!

657
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,450
Dong-gu, what are you doing?

658
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,450
I'm here for work. You didn't have anything to do, did you?

659
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,450
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,450
This is my brother who worked with me.

661
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,450
It's been a while since I've been here.

662
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,450
Nice to meet you.

663
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,450
I'm Hwang Dong-gu, a drug dealer in the North.

664
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,450
I'm Gong Tae-il.

665
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,450
What's going on?

666
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,450
Can you take a look at this?

667
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,450
What is this?

668
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,450
Hey, do you know this?

669
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,450
I think we took it from Hee-ro's house.

670
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,450
I'll take it.

671
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,450
Yes, this is our team leader's gun.

672
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,450
Our team leader

673
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,450
It's been a few days since he went missing.

674
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,450
He's missing?

675
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,450
Our team leader also investigated the hyper.

676
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,618
It was originally a police station.

677
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:04,618
Our team leader keeps saying something's weird.

678
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,618
I think he's been investigating separately and got a little tangled up with the Yakuza.

679
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,618
When did the Yakuza start?

680
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:12,618
Here you go.

681
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,618
According to my informant,

682
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,618
Three years ago, the Yakuza and the White Sang-upa

683
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,618
They're united and sprayed the hyper.

684
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:20,618
But two years ago,

685
00:33:20,618 --> 00:33:22,618
Two of the White Sang-upa were killed.

686
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:24,618
At that time, the Kuryongseo Masoo Dae

687
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:26,618
I got all the white Sang-upa guys.

688
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,618
I couldn't see the medicine.

689
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:30,618
But who the Yakuza guys were with.

690
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:32,618
This hyper started to spin again.

691
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:34,618
Who's the detective in charge of this?

692
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:38,618
No, but I came to someone else's company.

693
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:40,618
I'm asking you to show me the investigation record.

694
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,618
Isn't it a little bit?

695
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:44,618
No, but here's the team leader.

696
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,618
I was told to do a good job.

697
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:48,618
White Sang-upa.

698
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:50,618
He went in alone and solved everything.

699
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,618
There are two special forces.

700
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:54,618
Would I say something weird?

701
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,618
Uh.

702
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,634
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

703
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:10,534
I'm Ju Sung-chul, the team leader of the Drug Investigation Unit.

704
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:11,934
Yes, I'm Ma Seok-do.

705
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:13,034
You're from Gwangsu-do?

706
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,734
Yes, I'm Kim Man-jae.

707
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:15,874
Yes.

708
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:16,574
Please sit.

709
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:17,474
Yes.

710
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:19,482
Please sit.

711
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,894
I heard that the employees were in an accident.

712
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:27,494
I'm so upset.

713
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,794
We have to get rid of these bad guys.

714
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:32,294
That's why I came here.

715
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:35,494
I heard that this is related to the Yakuza.

716
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:37,694
Is there anything you can tell me?

717
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,690
We're still investigating.

718
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,590
But there are a lot of things that we haven't confirmed yet.

719
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,290
So I can't tell you everything.

720
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:52,558
I want to see my son's face.

721
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,958
I know.

722
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,358
I want to see his face, too.

723
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,098
Then we should hurry up.

724
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:00,998
Wait.

725
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,498
I think we went too deep.

726
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:04,798
Let's stop.

727
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:09,198
I'm sorry, but we'll come back when we have a chance.

728
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:10,398
It's okay.

729
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:11,698
I'm uncomfortable.

730
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:14,498
You guys.

731
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:18,186
Please leave it to us.

732
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:19,586
We'll call you if we find anything.

733
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:20,786
Yes, sir.

734
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,386
Wait.

735
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,686
Why?

736
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:25,986
Do you know Jeong Kyung-sik, the team leader of the North?

737
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,186
He's missing.

738
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:28,186
Hey.

739
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:29,786
Who?

740
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:31,286
Jeong Kyung-sik.

741
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,050
You mean the team leader of the North?

742
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,350
I'm sorry to say this as a police officer.

743
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,250
He had a problem.

744
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,050
What problem?

745
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,150
We're under security.

746
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,450
I can't tell you in detail.

747
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:51,354
It's not your case.

748
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:54,854
I think it's rude to ask you any more.

749
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,154
You're sensitive.

750
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,786
Hey.

751
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:01,586
Stop.

752
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:02,586
Okay.

753
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:05,086
Okay.

754
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:06,086
Then...

755
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:10,758
If you find anything, please contact us.

756
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:14,726
Let's do that.

757
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:16,326
Yes.

758
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,078
Yes, thank you.

759
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:20,878
Thank you.

760
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,078
Thank you.

761
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,250
Hey, hey, hey, the business card has changed. I gave it to you wrong.

762
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,250
No, no, don't go. I'm not going to contact you anyway.

763
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,250
Why would he contact you?

764
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,250
Are you going?

765
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,250
Oh, shit.

766
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,250
Are you going to give it back?

767
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,250
No, I gave him a Chinese business card.

768
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,250
Go.

769
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,250
I think they're uncomfortable with something.

770
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,250
I made you uncomfortable.

771
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,250
I just saw that you're a good person.

772
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,250
What do you like?

773
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,250
He's handsome and handsome like me, but he doesn't feel good.

774
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,354
Why? What?

775
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,354
I didn't say anything.

776
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,354
Oh, right. The deputy manager asked me to call you.

777
00:37:13,354 --> 00:37:14,354
Why?

778
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:16,354
I have to investigate after the formal procedure.

779
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:18,354
He told me not to go around like this.

780
00:37:18,354 --> 00:37:20,354
I think the deputy manager knows too much about you.

781
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:21,354
I know too well.

782
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:24,354
But if you do that, you'll miss all the criminals.

783
00:37:26,354 --> 00:37:28,354
Yeah, Dong-gu, Dong-gu.

784
00:37:29,354 --> 00:37:31,354
Where's the information you told me about?

785
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:34,354
I'm in the car.

786
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,354
I'm in the car.

787
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:40,418
Hey, have a meat meal today and sleep well tomorrow.

788
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:41,418
Yes.

789
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,418
Did you get all the goods I sent you?

790
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:45,418
I'll wash it well.

791
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:46,418
I'm going.

792
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,410
What the hell is that?

793
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:07,282
Where are you going?

794
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:08,082
Hey!

795
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:09,082
Get out of the car!

796
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:10,082
What are you going to do?

797
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,082
Get out of the car!

798
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,082
What? It's not working?

799
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,082
Don't do it.

800
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,082
Did he put a sausage in his ear?

801
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:17,082
Hey!

802
00:38:17,082 --> 00:38:19,082
Get out of the car!

803
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,410
Did you work out?

804
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,410
You're Chorong, right?

805
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,410
Chorong?

806
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,410
You're a rude bastard.

807
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,410
I used to be a martial arts player.

808
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,410
If you don't want to die, just go.

809
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,410
Don't be a fool.

810
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,410
Get in the car.

811
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,410
Let's go.

812
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,410
What should I do?

813
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,410
Should I step on the step?

814
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,410
Don't do it!

815
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,410
You can't hit a normal person!

816
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,410
Get in the car.

817
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,410
I'm so embarrassed.

818
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,410
You'll get in trouble.

819
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,850
I hit him too hard.

820
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,850
Hey!

821
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,850
Is he sleeping?

822
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,850
Wake up!

823
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,850
Hey!

824
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,850
Breathe!

825
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,850
Is he okay?

826
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,850
I'll wake him up.

827
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,850
Are you okay?

828
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:16,810
Is he the real Baek Sang-ho?

829
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,810
Is it you?

830
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,810
He looks like me, but he's the real one.

831
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,810
We should have come earlier.

832
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,810
I'm sorry.

833
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,810
So you run a used car business and run this club?

834
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,810
Yes.

835
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,810
I heard that baseball players come to the club you run often.

836
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,810
Do baseball players sell drugs there?

837
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,810
Tomo brings Japanese people every weekend.

838
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,810
He sells drugs and beats people.

839
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,810
Here.

840
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,810
Tomo?

841
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,810
Yes.

842
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,810
Tomo on the left.

843
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,810
Tomo.

844
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,810
Where is he now?

845
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,810
He's probably playing in the club on Friday.

846
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,810
Stop in front.

847
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,810
I'll tell the MD in charge of him.

848
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,810
He's a translator.

849
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,810
He gets stabbed if he doesn't go with the detective.

850
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,810
If you don't go with him, you'll get stabbed again.

851
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,810
Really?

852
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,810
Hurry up.

853
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:33,546
Hey, Tom's stupid.

854
00:40:33,546 --> 00:40:36,546
He's talking about drugs and saying he's stupid.

855
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:39,546
You're either Korean or Chinese.

856
00:40:39,546 --> 00:40:41,546
Get rid of it.

857
00:41:04,602 --> 00:41:05,602
We're here.

858
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,562
I'll be back as soon as I find the medicine.

859
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:23,418
Where is he now?

860
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,418
I can't get in touch with him right now.

861
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:30,034
I'll be back after I clean up.

862
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:33,334
Let's go to the South Korean branch.

863
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:34,334
Yes.

864
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:45,386
Why aren't you here yet?

865
00:41:46,986 --> 00:41:47,986
I'm a little late.

866
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:49,186
Maybe a little later.

867
00:41:49,886 --> 00:41:51,886
I already made the plan.

868
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:56,118
You're making it hard for me.

869
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:03,554
Yes.

870
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:05,554
Where are you?

871
00:42:05,554 --> 00:42:06,554
There's a problem.

872
00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:10,554
A member of the organization asked Chairman Lee Chi-jo to take away the medicine.

873
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:12,554
So?

874
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:15,554
Lee Chi-jo sent a carjavil to Korea.

875
00:42:15,554 --> 00:42:17,554
I think some of them are already on the way.

876
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:19,554
So?

877
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:20,554
He's real.

878
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:23,554
I'm going to hide for a while and watch the situation.

879
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:25,554
If you do something wrong, you'll die.

880
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:28,554
I have the medicine as insurance.

881
00:42:29,554 --> 00:42:30,554
All right.

882
00:42:33,522 --> 00:42:38,290
Yes, it doesn't seem right.

883
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,290
It's nothing.

884
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,290
Give me two more days.

885
00:42:51,098 --> 00:42:53,438
If I don't see the goods by then,

886
00:42:54,178 --> 00:42:56,598
I won't be able to speak so well.

887
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:00,298
We don't know them.

888
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:02,338
What kind of police are you?

889
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:42,438
Ugh!

890
00:45:01,338 --> 00:45:04,774
Ugh!

891
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,170
Where is Tom?

892
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,170
I don't know.

893
00:45:43,514 --> 00:45:45,514
Hey, why are you at the back door?

894
00:45:46,114 --> 00:45:49,754
As you promised, I have nothing to do with this case

895
00:45:49,754 --> 00:45:50,754
Okay, hurry up

896
00:45:51,594 --> 00:45:53,794
What does C-Ball Club mean?

897
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:54,794
It's a cyber club

898
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,054
Hey, Mimi

899
00:45:57,634 --> 00:45:58,794
Hey, hang up

900
00:45:58,794 --> 00:45:59,794
Hang up

901
00:46:01,054 --> 00:46:02,054
Did you get hit again?

902
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:04,214
No, the Japanese are here

903
00:46:04,814 --> 00:46:06,994
You're being a jerk again today

904
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:08,094
Oh, well...

905
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:09,554
You're being a jerk again today

906
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:13,254
I'll take care of it, so take the guys inside

907
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,854
No

908
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:17,054
I'm a little nervous

909
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:18,854
Hey, don't say that

910
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:22,054
Guys, follow Mimi to the front door

911
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,654
Follow me

912
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:24,654
Hey, go to the back door

913
00:46:24,654 --> 00:46:25,654
Yes, sir

914
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:26,654
I'm Agarito

915
00:46:26,654 --> 00:46:27,954
Yes, this is the right place

916
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:28,954
Thank you

917
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,154
C-Ball

918
00:46:43,482 --> 00:46:45,482
I'm sorry.

919
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:47,482
I'm sorry.

920
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:49,482
I'm sorry.

921
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:51,482
Here it is.

922
00:46:54,482 --> 00:46:57,034
Cheers!

923
00:46:58,034 --> 00:47:00,034
I suddenly have a stomachache.

924
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:04,034
Hey, you're not a police officer.

925
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:05,034
We're police officers.

926
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:07,034
There's a guy named Pomo here.

927
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,034
What's wrong?

928
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,034
I don't understand what you're saying.

929
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:12,034
What's wrong?

930
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:16,034
Don't move.

931
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,034
Who are you?

932
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:21,034
You're a police officer.

933
00:47:23,034 --> 00:47:25,034
You don't understand what I'm saying, do you?

934
00:47:29,034 --> 00:47:31,034
Why are you moving?

935
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:44,774
Hey, hey, hey, get the car. Get the car.

936
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:48,090
What? Hey, you bastard.

937
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:24,130
Where is Tomo?

938
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,866
I'm sorry.

939
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:30,866
Hey, are you hiding?

940
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,866
Come out.

941
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:43,314
Where is Tomo?

942
00:48:43,314 --> 00:48:46,314
This is a bastard.

943
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:50,706
Don't hit me.

944
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:55,346
Don't hit me.

945
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:59,346
I don't think Tomo is here.

946
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:02,346
Where is Tomo?

947
00:49:02,346 --> 00:49:05,890
I'm at the Songbo Hotel.

948
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,890
Okay, come to the hotel.

949
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,330
Hey!

950
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,298
You again?

951
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:31,298
It's me.

952
00:49:31,298 --> 00:49:34,298
Damn it. You betrayed me.

953
00:49:41,018 --> 00:49:43,018
You look like you've been beaten up.

954
00:49:43,018 --> 00:49:44,018
What?

955
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:49,754
I was threatened by the head of the Chuseok party.

956
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:52,754
I'll solve it.

957
00:49:52,754 --> 00:49:54,754
Chairman, you're angry.

958
00:49:55,754 --> 00:49:57,754
Give me the medicine.

959
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:03,842
Is Tomo here?

960
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:04,842
Yes, he's here.

961
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:07,842
What's the address of the hotel?

962
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:09,842
It's 1610.

963
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:25,110
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

964
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,810
Run, run, run.

965
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:32,810
Run, run, run.

966
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,530
I can't start it right now!

967
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,530
Oh, my!

968
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,330
What's wrong?

969
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:53,730
What's wrong?

970
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,930
Oh, my!

971
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,530
Hey, it's my wife's car!

972
00:52:03,814 --> 00:52:05,914
It's a body from the Yakuza.

973
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,514
Who did it?

974
00:52:07,514 --> 00:52:08,514
What's the car number?

975
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:09,514
The car number...

976
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:14,714
I checked both of them.

977
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,314
I think it's a gunman.

978
00:52:16,314 --> 00:52:18,914
There's a picture of the face on the CCTV at the hotel.

979
00:52:18,914 --> 00:52:20,914
I'll take a look at it.

980
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:21,914
Okay.

981
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:23,914
Are you okay? Are you okay?

982
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:24,914
Is it there?

983
00:52:24,914 --> 00:52:25,914
Here?

984
00:52:25,914 --> 00:52:26,914
Oh, my!

985
00:52:32,602 --> 00:52:34,002
The Gwangsu-dae is here first.

986
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:41,802
It's this bastard. The bastard who took Tomo.

987
00:52:41,802 --> 00:52:43,502
He's the one Tomo was talking about.

988
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:44,502
The one who came from Japan.

989
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:46,202
He's not in the hotel.

990
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:48,302
Then why are they there?

991
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:51,802
Those bastards from Gwangsu are looking for Tomo.

992
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:55,302
Things are going to be a mess because of that bastard.

993
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:58,002
Team leader, what did Mr. Baek say?

994
00:52:58,002 --> 00:52:59,602
What should we do?

995
00:52:59,602 --> 00:53:01,402
Let's find this bastard first.

996
00:53:15,002 --> 00:53:17,002
I'll ask you again.

997
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:21,002
Where is the medicine you gave me?

998
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:26,602
If I tell you now, you'll kill me.

999
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:29,002
If you let me go, I'll give you the medicine.

1000
00:53:30,402 --> 00:53:31,802
So?

1001
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:35,602
You were there for the medicine, too.

1002
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:38,402
How is it? It's 3 billion.

1003
00:53:39,202 --> 00:53:42,202
I'm the only one who knows the price of a broken needle.

1004
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:43,602
Yes.

1005
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:44,202
Really?

1006
00:53:44,202 --> 00:53:45,202
Yes.

1007
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:49,602
I'll find it with my life.

1008
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:00,778
Find all the places with medicine.

1009
00:54:01,278 --> 00:54:03,278
What about Chuseoncheol?

1010
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:07,590
Chuseoncheol...

1011
00:54:24,378 --> 00:54:26,378
You idiot.

1012
00:54:32,474 --> 00:54:34,134
If you find anything else, let me know.

1013
00:54:34,134 --> 00:54:35,474
Yes, sir.

1014
00:54:35,474 --> 00:54:37,674
Hey, Tomo is dead?

1015
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:38,434
Yes, sir.

1016
00:54:38,434 --> 00:54:41,774
The guys you saw were killed at the fishing spot.

1017
00:54:41,774 --> 00:54:43,434
What should we do? It's getting out of hand.

1018
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:45,174
Darn it.

1019
00:54:45,174 --> 00:54:46,934
We should've caught them.

1020
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:49,374
Is there any other place?

1021
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:50,874
It's a bit...

1022
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:51,574
Weird, isn't it?

1023
00:54:51,574 --> 00:54:52,934
I came because he's a regular.

1024
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:55,434
We're not officially investigating.

1025
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:55,974
Hey.

1026
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:58,034
Oh, no.

1027
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:00,274
What do you mean? I didn't say anything.

1028
00:55:00,274 --> 00:55:02,374
Yes, sir.

1029
00:55:02,374 --> 00:55:04,934
What do you mean?

1030
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,674
I don't know.

1031
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:08,034
You don't know? Come here.

1032
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:09,134
Come here. I'll tell you.

1033
00:55:09,134 --> 00:55:09,734
Sit here.

1034
00:55:09,734 --> 00:55:10,934
Yes, sir.

1035
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:14,370
Hey.

1036
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:14,930
Yes, sir.

1037
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,170
Answer me quickly if I ask you.

1038
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,130
Yes, sir.

1039
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,070
You're pooping on your pants.

1040
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:19,930
What are these pants?

1041
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,270
I borrowed them from the counter.

1042
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,130
I told you not to hit my stomach.

1043
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,430
Hey, turn on the light. Why is it so dark?

1044
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:24,930
Yes, sir.

1045
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,630
I'll turn it on.

1046
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,770
No, I...

1047
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:28,330
Hey.

1048
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,310
Yes, sir.

1049
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,910
Where's your yakuza?

1050
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:32,870
Hey.

1051
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:33,910
What's wrong with this?

1052
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,550
Hey, turn it off.

1053
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,910
It's off.

1054
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,450
It's not turning off.

1055
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:39,550
It's on.

1056
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,250
It's on.

1057
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:40,550
What's wrong?

1058
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:41,510
I'm sorry.

1059
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,310
It's on again.

1060
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,570
I have to take off my coat.

1061
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,710
Hey.

1062
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,930
What do you do with yakuza?

1063
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,030
I don't do anything bad like yakuza.

1064
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,170
I just distribute and pack the medicine.

1065
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,410
I just deliver it.

1066
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:04,370
That's a bad thing, you criminal.

1067
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,670
Do you know how many people died because of your medicine?

1068
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,130
I don't know.

1069
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,310
Then, have you seen this person?

1070
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,610
Look carefully.

1071
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,010
I don't know.

1072
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,210
You don't know?

1073
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,210
No.

1074
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,710
Then, who's the one who hit the detectives?

1075
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,010
I don't know.

1076
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,930
You don't know?

1077
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,170
What?

1078
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,510
Hey, I can't do this. Close the door.

1079
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,410
Yes, sir.

1080
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,130
No, no.

1081
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:32,410
Be honest when you give him a chance.

1082
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,350
Wait.

1083
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,370
Then, I'll call an ambulance.

1084
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:35,970
I'll call it now.

1085
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,270
Wait, wait, wait.

1086
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:41,878
I don't know who hit the detectives.

1087
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:44,078
But, as far as I know,

1088
00:56:44,078 --> 00:56:45,658
it's not yakuza.

1089
00:56:46,918 --> 00:56:48,678
There's someone else.

1090
00:56:48,678 --> 00:56:50,778
Yakuza's partner.

1091
00:56:51,818 --> 00:56:53,378
Someone else?

1092
00:56:53,378 --> 00:56:54,278
Who?

1093
00:56:55,558 --> 00:56:57,058
Hey, you!

1094
00:56:58,758 --> 00:57:00,226
You bastards!

1095
00:57:00,226 --> 00:57:01,166
I'm making money because of you.

1096
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,306
How dare you say that?

1097
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:05,066
Come here.

1098
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,434
You traitor!

1099
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:10,534
Who's the one who killed Tomo?

1100
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,434
Ricky.

1101
00:57:12,434 --> 00:57:13,174
Ricky?

1102
00:57:13,174 --> 00:57:14,374
Ricky.

1103
00:57:14,374 --> 00:57:16,894
He's the one who sent me to this hospital.

1104
00:57:16,894 --> 00:57:18,394
Did he bring the medicine?

1105
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:20,234
I don't know.

1106
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:22,494
You don't know?

1107
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:23,494
I don't know.

1108
00:57:25,078 --> 00:57:27,038
Where's the partner?

1109
00:57:27,038 --> 00:57:29,838
I really don't know.

1110
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:32,378
I'm looking for Ricky.

1111
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:34,438
I'm looking for him!

1112
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:37,338
Where did Tomo hide the medicine?

1113
00:57:47,578 --> 00:57:49,578
Go tell Ricky.

1114
00:57:50,578 --> 00:57:54,034
If he touches that drug, I'll kill you.

1115
00:57:56,034 --> 00:57:58,034
Wow, detectives, you've done so much research.

1116
00:57:58,034 --> 00:58:00,034
Why isn't there a picture of me?

1117
00:58:00,034 --> 00:58:02,034
Hey, you're here.

1118
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:03,034
Oh, yes.

1119
00:58:03,034 --> 00:58:04,034
Hey, then.

1120
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:05,034
Yes.

1121
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:08,034
Is that question mark the one who took our kids and took the drugs?

1122
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:09,034
Maybe.

1123
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:11,034
Baby?

1124
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:14,034
When Tomo brings all the raw materials from Japan,

1125
00:58:14,034 --> 00:58:17,034
The Yakuza kids start to synthesize and spray it.

1126
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:20,034
This question mark was looking after that.

1127
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:22,034
Hey, then.

1128
00:58:22,034 --> 00:58:23,034
Yes.

1129
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:24,034
Ricky, do you know this guy?

1130
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,034
I've never seen it before.

1131
00:58:26,034 --> 00:58:27,034
Hey, hey.

1132
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:28,034
Look at this.

1133
00:58:28,034 --> 00:58:29,034
It's a public document from Japan.

1134
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:30,034
What?

1135
00:58:30,034 --> 00:58:31,034
Do I really do it?

1136
00:58:31,034 --> 00:58:33,034
You're the best at them, so you do it.

1137
00:58:33,034 --> 00:58:35,034
Oh, yes.

1138
00:58:36,034 --> 00:58:37,034
Name Ricky.

1139
00:58:37,034 --> 00:58:39,034
The immediate solution to Chairman Lee Chi-jo's crisis.

1140
00:58:39,034 --> 00:58:41,034
Famous for his knife work in your organization.

1141
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:44,034
He threw a grenade a while ago.

1142
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,034
Then why did he come to Korea?

1143
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:48,034
I don't know.

1144
00:58:48,034 --> 00:58:49,034
You don't know again?

1145
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:50,034
Oh, my.

1146
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:51,034
Why?

1147
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:53,034
That's it.

1148
00:58:53,034 --> 00:58:57,034
Tomo planned with the question mark and stole the drugs.

1149
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,034
Why are you holding back the 20-kilograms?

1150
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:02,034
Ricky came to Korea to find it.

1151
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:04,034
Then Ricky's going to find the drugs.

1152
00:59:04,034 --> 00:59:06,034
You could go to that question mark.

1153
00:59:07,034 --> 00:59:08,034
Hey, hey.

1154
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:10,034
It's all done.

1155
00:59:10,034 --> 00:59:12,034
Just catch them all at once.

1156
00:59:12,034 --> 00:59:14,034
Let's find the drugs first.

1157
00:59:14,034 --> 00:59:15,034
Oh, my God.

1158
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:16,034
Oh, my God.

1159
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:17,034
As expected, our brother.

1160
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:19,034
Are you crazy?

1161
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:21,034
Get rid of it.

1162
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:27,362
You have to catch the bad guys.

1163
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:29,362
Where are you going?

1164
00:59:29,362 --> 00:59:30,362
Oh, my arm.

1165
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:32,362
Seok-doo, where are you now?

1166
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:33,362
I'll do it that way.

1167
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:37,362
No, you can't keep moving because you're hurt.

1168
00:59:37,362 --> 00:59:39,362
Hey, they killed a man.

1169
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:40,362
I have to catch them all.

1170
00:59:40,362 --> 00:59:43,362
I'll catch them all, so you can relax.

1171
00:59:44,362 --> 00:59:45,362
Can you do that?

1172
00:59:45,362 --> 00:59:46,362
I'll be there if you wait.

1173
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:48,362
Oh, my God.

1174
00:59:49,362 --> 00:59:50,362
Hey.

1175
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:51,362
Yes?

1176
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:53,362
I'm going to catch the team leader, so call the kids and keep them from coming.

1177
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:54,362
Yes, yes.

1178
01:00:02,138 --> 01:00:03,338
Oh, it's cold.

1179
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:05,598
Did you find the medicine?

1180
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:06,638
You didn't, right?

1181
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:10,138
See? I told you I didn't have it in my office.

1182
01:00:10,138 --> 01:00:12,238
And I'm sorry to say this,

1183
01:00:12,238 --> 01:00:13,438
but when there's someone in the car,

1184
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,898
you have to open the window a little.

1185
01:00:15,898 --> 01:00:18,298
Otherwise, it can be a suffocation.

1186
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:22,238
Hey, you'll never die until this case is over.

1187
01:00:22,238 --> 01:00:26,298
Hey, is there any place you can find the medicine?

1188
01:00:26,298 --> 01:00:30,762
Have you been to Tomo's disguise office?

1189
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:31,822
Hey, Dong-gu.

1190
01:00:31,822 --> 01:00:34,522
I found the body of the chief of the Blue Team.

1191
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:37,922
The fishermen found it in the dump of the mine.

1192
01:00:37,922 --> 01:00:40,562
I think he killed the missing party member right away.

1193
01:00:40,562 --> 01:00:48,682
But he was alive when he was arrested.

1194
01:00:48,682 --> 01:00:50,782
Wow, crazy bastards.

1195
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:53,782
They even killed the police.

1196
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:56,322
They're crazy bastards.

1197
01:01:00,186 --> 01:01:01,186
Where are you?

1198
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:02,986
I'm searching Tomo's office.

1199
01:01:02,986 --> 01:01:04,186
Find Yang.

1200
01:01:11,226 --> 01:01:13,226
Where did you hide it?

1201
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:41,122
What's your name?

1202
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,034
Do you have a gun?

1203
01:01:49,034 --> 01:01:51,034
Ricky?

1204
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:54,362
Are you looking for a medicine?

1205
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:57,362
What are you talking about?

1206
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:02,362
Hey, if you come close, I'll kill you.

1207
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:32,362
PikaHD.com

1208
01:02:59,034 --> 01:02:59,934
Please.

1209
01:03:01,134 --> 01:03:03,014
I received the greeting card.

1210
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:07,298
I heard you're doing bad things to your friends.

1211
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:11,678
The chairman is very uncomfortable because of the medicine you took out.

1212
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:13,238
You made a mistake.

1213
01:03:13,598 --> 01:03:15,498
I should have killed you at once.

1214
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:18,158
The chairman's mistake was that I couldn't kill him.

1215
01:03:19,598 --> 01:03:21,862
I'm sorry.

1216
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,422
I didn't mean to.

1217
01:03:26,882 --> 01:03:30,022
I've made you a lot of money.

1218
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:31,742
I need to take care of myself.

1219
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:34,062
Or you can buy it.

1220
01:03:34,762 --> 01:03:36,482
I have to pay.

1221
01:03:37,842 --> 01:03:41,926
You're in a lot of trouble.

1222
01:03:43,226 --> 01:03:45,266
Who are you talking to?

1223
01:03:46,286 --> 01:03:48,826
You don't have the money.

1224
01:03:49,466 --> 01:03:51,226
The medicine is the chairman's.

1225
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:53,526
Do whatever you want.

1226
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:56,526
Let's see what happens.

1227
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:57,926
What did you say?

1228
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:00,326
I'm looking forward to it.

1229
01:04:31,226 --> 01:04:33,826
I think Ricky took over the organization.

1230
01:04:34,526 --> 01:04:35,526
What about the medicine?

1231
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:37,990
There's no medicine.

1232
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:40,890
He's dealing with President Baek in a few hours.

1233
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,990
What should we do?

1234
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,798
What do you mean?

1235
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:49,998
We have to meet.

1236
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:11,266
What?

1237
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,618
I'll tell you directly.

1238
01:05:16,618 --> 01:05:17,786
Move.

1239
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,082
You think you can fool me?

1240
01:05:23,082 --> 01:05:25,082
You think you can fool me?

1241
01:06:29,498 --> 01:06:31,498
I don't need you anymore!

1242
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:57,970
The chairman is buying my medicine.

1243
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:05,662
What is it? This is the general affairs office.

1244
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,822
Something must be going on.

1245
01:07:08,982 --> 01:07:12,422
Oh, thank you. I'm from Gwangsu University.

1246
01:07:12,422 --> 01:07:15,462
What's going on over there? It's a murder case.

1247
01:07:15,462 --> 01:07:17,222
The victim is a police officer.

1248
01:07:17,222 --> 01:07:20,802
Police? Look at this.

1249
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:24,122
Lee Gang-ho? He was the police officer under Joo Sung-chul.

1250
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:26,442
He broke the wall with a hammer.

1251
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,282
The victim must have been looking for something.

1252
01:07:29,282 --> 01:07:31,082
What time did he die?

1253
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:32,582
Around 2 a.m.

1254
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:36,202
Let's go.

1255
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:37,902
Be quiet!

1256
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:42,402
That bastard.

1257
01:07:43,002 --> 01:07:47,642
Boss, the head office is going to start the internal investigation.

1258
01:07:47,642 --> 01:07:49,482
You bastards.

1259
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,010
Let's find the medicine and leave.

1260
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:55,010
Ricky must be looking for it.

1261
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,650
Are you just going to leave it?

1262
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,250
Just kill him.

1263
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,890
Hurry up and give up your position here.

1264
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,450
You should finish your work too.

1265
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,210
Why should I give up my position?

1266
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,050
I'll take responsibility.

1267
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:07,210
I'll beat you up if you don't. Are you crazy?

1268
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,330
Are you crazy, you bastard?

1269
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,650
Is the head of Joo Sung-chul's team here?

1270
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,330
No, he's not. You can go.

1271
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:14,930
He said he's not here.

1272
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,050
He's not here.

1273
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,850
Okay, I'll come back next time.

1274
01:08:19,322 --> 01:08:20,922
You can just ask him.

1275
01:08:20,922 --> 01:08:22,402
Ask him what?

1276
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:23,402
Wait.

1277
01:08:23,402 --> 01:08:25,802
You're so annoying.

1278
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:26,722
What?

1279
01:08:26,722 --> 01:08:27,922
Let me ask you something.

1280
01:08:27,922 --> 01:08:28,602
No.

1281
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:31,482
Why did Lee Kang-ho go to the head office at dawn?

1282
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,322
You can ask him when he's here.

1283
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:35,202
How would I know? He must have gone to investigate.

1284
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:35,802
Right.

1285
01:08:35,802 --> 01:08:36,402
At that time?

1286
01:08:36,402 --> 01:08:37,202
Yes.

1287
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:37,722
What?

1288
01:08:37,722 --> 01:08:38,802
Did he go to get the medicine?

1289
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:39,402
No.

1290
01:08:39,402 --> 01:08:40,402
Do you know me?

1291
01:08:40,402 --> 01:08:41,482
No.

1292
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:42,202
Do you know me?

1293
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,202
You can't say it.

1294
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,082
You're in the head office.

1295
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:46,522
You can't say it.

1296
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:47,642
What?

1297
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:49,042
What do you want to do?

1298
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,442
Wait.

1299
01:08:50,442 --> 01:08:53,762
If you keep touching him, he'll get hurt.

1300
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:57,722
Why are you bothering someone else's company?

1301
01:08:57,722 --> 01:08:59,562
You'll get in trouble.

1302
01:09:08,258 --> 01:09:11,138
I think I'll see you again. Don't relax.

1303
01:09:14,138 --> 01:09:16,338
If you swear one more time, I'll kill you.

1304
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,810
Take an X-ray.

1305
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,810
Your hand.

1306
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,210
Hey.

1307
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,290
Isn't it weird?

1308
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,610
What's wrong with them?

1309
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,610
Right.

1310
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,890
But isn't it weird to use the news without evidence?

1311
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,130
We need to find something for sure.

1312
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,370
Wait.

1313
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:47,970
There's a yacht business that rich kids used to run.

1314
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:48,890
No.

1315
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,090
It's closed.

1316
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,730
No.

1317
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:52,770
Let's go there.

1318
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:53,370
Go?

1319
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,130
Okay.

1320
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,370
I'll give you the address.

1321
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:56,610
Good job.

1322
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,050
Keep thinking like that.

1323
01:09:59,050 --> 01:09:59,890
I got it.

1324
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:00,410
Good job.

1325
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:00,890
Let's go.

1326
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:01,730
Okay.

1327
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,490
I'll call the guide.

1328
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,210
Okay.

1329
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,410
What's okay? Sit straight.

1330
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,810
Okay.

1331
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,250
I hope they open the window later.

1332
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,970
I think it's under construction.

1333
01:10:34,714 --> 01:10:35,714
Hey!

1334
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:38,214
Who are you?

1335
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:41,354
Go home. I'm not doing it.

1336
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:43,914
Get out.

1337
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:45,514
We have to go in. We have to call the police.

1338
01:10:45,514 --> 01:10:46,514
Get out!

1339
01:10:49,414 --> 01:10:51,054
Hey! Don't do it!

1340
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:23,466
It was you in the car, right?

1341
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:35,050
What? It's already over?

1342
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,050
Emergency!

1343
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,050
Give it to me.

1344
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,050
Lie down.

1345
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,050
Hey, interpreter.

1346
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,050
Why are you here?

1347
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,050
You can't come here.

1348
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:50,794
We're here to find a cure.

1349
01:11:51,794 --> 01:11:53,794
We're here to find a cure.

1350
01:11:53,794 --> 01:11:55,794
You should say it in honorifics.

1351
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:56,794
We're here to find a cure.

1352
01:11:56,794 --> 01:11:58,794
You're here to find a cure, right?

1353
01:11:58,794 --> 01:11:59,794
Where's the medicine?

1354
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:01,794
Who's the doctor?

1355
01:12:02,794 --> 01:12:03,866
I don't know.

1356
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:05,866
You don't know?

1357
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:07,866
You'll die if you lie.

1358
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:09,866
Where's the medicine?

1359
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:11,866
Where did you get it?

1360
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:12,866
Where did you get it?

1361
01:12:13,866 --> 01:12:14,866
I really don't know.

1362
01:12:15,866 --> 01:12:16,866
We're looking for it.

1363
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:18,866
He really doesn't know.

1364
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:19,866
We're looking for it, too.

1365
01:12:23,866 --> 01:12:25,834
Dong-gu.

1366
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:27,834
Put them all in and keep them safe.

1367
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:28,834
All right, sir.

1368
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,834
Put Kim Yang-ho in, too.

1369
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:31,834
Come here.

1370
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:32,834
Just this once.

1371
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:37,834
Why are they doing a yacht?

1372
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:40,834
What's all this?

1373
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:41,834
Why are there so many keys?

1374
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:42,834
What's the message?

1375
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:44,834
There are so many.

1376
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:45,834
Is it a yacht key?

1377
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:47,834
Why is this the only card?

1378
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:51,834
Isn't this the Yakuza pattern?

1379
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:52,834
Lucy?

1380
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:57,410
Lucy.

1381
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,690
Search the place.

1382
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:15,690
Yes, sir.

1383
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:19,562
Where did he hide the medicine?

1384
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,562
Look carefully.

1385
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:39,150
What is it?

1386
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,570
I don't know what this is, but it's locked tight.

1387
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,210
I think there's something down here.

1388
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:43,710
Yeah.

1389
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,210
Open it.

1390
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:44,710
Yes.

1391
01:13:47,626 --> 01:13:49,126
I think you should do it.

1392
01:14:01,402 --> 01:14:03,402
Wow, what is this?

1393
01:14:06,778 --> 01:14:07,778
It's a button that was used in the studio.

1394
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:09,778
That's why I can't find it.

1395
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,778
Wow, that's amazing.

1396
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:19,762
I think I took a picture of the combination of the ingredients.

1397
01:14:30,714 --> 01:14:31,714
You do it

1398
01:14:31,714 --> 01:14:32,814
You do it for me

1399
01:14:32,814 --> 01:14:34,414
I can use my strength

1400
01:14:35,094 --> 01:14:36,094
Oh, man

1401
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:40,142
Hey, this is a safe

1402
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,522
How can you open it with your strength?

1403
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:42,662
You have to use your brain

1404
01:14:43,202 --> 01:14:43,702
Use my brain?

1405
01:14:43,702 --> 01:14:44,702
How can I...

1406
01:14:51,546 --> 01:14:53,990
That's right.

1407
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:05,514
I mean, you said it was empty.

1408
01:15:05,514 --> 01:15:07,650
Oh, my God.

1409
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,650
It's not open.

1410
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,586
Oh, it's open.

1411
01:15:12,586 --> 01:15:14,586
It's open.

1412
01:15:14,586 --> 01:15:16,586
I broke it.

1413
01:15:16,586 --> 01:15:18,586
What's this?

1414
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:20,806
There's only a button.

1415
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:25,410
Follow me

1416
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:26,410
What?

1417
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:29,230
What's down there?

1418
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,230
Why?

1419
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,230
What's this?

1420
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,230
There's something!

1421
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:43,234
Grapes!

1422
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:46,898
I found it

1423
01:15:57,498 --> 01:15:59,498
I found Ricky.

1424
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:00,498
Are you sure?

1425
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:03,498
I'm sure I followed the Yakuza bastard you released.

1426
01:16:04,498 --> 01:16:05,498
What about the kids?

1427
01:16:06,498 --> 01:16:07,498
They're all here.

1428
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:10,498
I also brought a gun that wasn't registered.

1429
01:16:10,498 --> 01:16:11,498
Get ready.

1430
01:16:11,498 --> 01:16:12,498
Yes.

1431
01:16:18,522 --> 01:16:20,222
Because of this.

1432
01:16:20,222 --> 01:16:22,482
We found the medicine. What do we do now?

1433
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:24,182
Chorong told you to sell white shark, right?

1434
01:16:24,182 --> 01:16:25,322
Yes.

1435
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:26,682
Go there.

1436
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,282
Ju Sungcheol will react.

1437
01:16:30,222 --> 01:16:31,482
This is not even 10,000 won, right?

1438
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:32,822
Yes, it is.

1439
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,122
Let's sign the contract.

1440
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:36,922
But the car is different from the picture.

1441
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:38,282
You're not buying it?

1442
01:16:38,282 --> 01:16:40,382
I've been showing you the car until now.

1443
01:16:40,382 --> 01:16:42,722
Are you kidding me?

1444
01:16:42,722 --> 01:16:44,982
What's the difference with the picture?

1445
01:16:44,982 --> 01:16:47,482
Forget it. Hurry up and bring the contract.

1446
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:48,582
Yes, sir.

1447
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:53,218
Chorong works hard at night, too.

1448
01:16:53,218 --> 01:16:55,358
What are you doing? Are you selling the car?

1449
01:16:55,358 --> 01:16:57,458
What's this? It's still there.

1450
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:58,618
Is it a submerged car?

1451
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,258
Submerged car?

1452
01:17:00,258 --> 01:17:01,418
Is it a submerged car?

1453
01:17:01,418 --> 01:17:03,198
It's a submerged car.

1454
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:04,818
Can this work?

1455
01:17:04,818 --> 01:17:07,018
Yes, it's a submerged car.

1456
01:17:07,018 --> 01:17:08,858
You drove it, right?

1457
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:09,858
Yes, that's right.

1458
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,718
It wasn't this car.

1459
01:17:11,718 --> 01:17:13,698
You told me to buy it.

1460
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:14,558
Why did you do that?

1461
01:17:14,558 --> 01:17:16,498
No, sir. When did I do that?

1462
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:17,618
A while ago.

1463
01:17:17,678 --> 01:17:20,418
How much is this?

1464
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:21,118
3,000 won.

1465
01:17:21,118 --> 01:17:22,418
3,000 won?

1466
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:23,778
3,000 won is too cheap.

1467
01:17:23,778 --> 01:17:26,658
The engine is clean. You should get 3,000 won.

1468
01:17:26,658 --> 01:17:27,858
That's right, sir.

1469
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,178
Give me 3,000 won.

1470
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,658
What? How much?

1471
01:17:31,658 --> 01:17:32,658
3,000 won.

1472
01:17:32,658 --> 01:17:33,318
3,000 won?

1473
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:34,378
Yes, 3,000 won.

1474
01:17:35,258 --> 01:17:36,718
Honey, can I work?

1475
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,378
I get 150 won at the scrapyard.

1476
01:17:39,378 --> 01:17:39,958
Thank you.

1477
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:40,978
Bye.

1478
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:45,682
He's not our gangster.

1479
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:47,162
He's the gangster.

1480
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,222
That bastard.

1481
01:17:48,222 --> 01:17:48,822
Come in.

1482
01:17:48,822 --> 01:17:49,682
Yes, sir.

1483
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,550
Aren't you curious who worked on

1484
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,510
the dead white shark?

1485
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,070
Why are you showing me?

1486
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:58,050
It's annoying.

1487
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,150
I'm getting angry. Don't show me.

1488
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:00,750
It's annoying.

1489
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,350
The more I see it, the more I get angry.

1490
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,250
Wait.

1491
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,450
Why are you showing me this?

1492
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,970
Don't you want to catch the criminal?

1493
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:10,750
I do.

1494
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:11,350
Right?

1495
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,770
Yes.

1496
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,910
But you can catch him.

1497
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:14,950
Me?

1498
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:17,210
Let's work together.

1499
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,130
Get rid of him and leave.

1500
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,130
Yes.

1501
01:18:49,978 --> 01:18:50,978
Hello?

1502
01:18:50,978 --> 01:18:54,498
Do you remember me? I'm Chorong from the Backstreet Boys.

1503
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,498
Hello?

1504
01:19:00,594 --> 01:19:01,594
What?

1505
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:09,082
I just happened to have a 20kg hyper in my hand.

1506
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:11,082
This is for the baseball players, right?

1507
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:20,386
Hello?

1508
01:19:21,886 --> 01:19:23,566
So?

1509
01:19:24,066 --> 01:19:24,566
What?

1510
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:25,566
What?

1511
01:19:30,218 --> 01:19:31,218
I hung up.

1512
01:19:31,218 --> 01:19:32,718
You're a fox.

1513
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:34,718
Send me the picture.

1514
01:19:59,482 --> 01:20:00,482
Hello?

1515
01:20:01,322 --> 01:20:04,058
What about the condition?

1516
01:20:04,058 --> 01:20:05,058
What?

1517
01:20:06,178 --> 01:20:08,178
Well...

1518
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:13,122
The drug deal...

1519
01:20:13,462 --> 01:20:15,462
We did it, right?

1520
01:20:16,002 --> 01:20:18,502
We'll do it again

1521
01:20:19,322 --> 01:20:21,122
Even if we sell it

1522
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:24,202
the team leader will get it because it's a rumor

1523
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:27,162
If you hand over the drug deal

1524
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,082
we'll return it to you

1525
01:20:31,082 --> 01:20:34,466
I'll give you the address

1526
01:20:34,466 --> 01:20:36,466
You come alone after an hour

1527
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:39,566
Okay

1528
01:20:39,566 --> 01:20:40,566
Okay

1529
01:20:40,566 --> 01:20:41,566
Wait a minute

1530
01:20:41,566 --> 01:20:43,566
Was it you who gave me the drug deal?

1531
01:20:43,566 --> 01:20:44,566
Hey

1532
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:46,066
You have to be good from now on

1533
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:47,566
Yeah, you have to be good

1534
01:20:47,566 --> 01:20:48,566
You bastard

1535
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:49,566
But he told me to come alone

1536
01:20:49,566 --> 01:20:50,566
Am I going alone?

1537
01:20:50,566 --> 01:20:51,566
You have to go alone

1538
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:53,566
Then I'm not going

1539
01:20:57,426 --> 01:20:59,106
Tae Soo

1540
01:20:59,106 --> 01:21:00,106
I found the criminal

1541
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:01,606
I'm going to catch him on the spot

1542
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,606
Can you move with the guys?

1543
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:04,606
Yeah, I'll be right there

1544
01:21:04,606 --> 01:21:05,606
Where are you?

1545
01:21:05,606 --> 01:21:06,606
I'll give you the address

1546
01:21:07,606 --> 01:21:08,606
What are you going to do?

1547
01:21:09,606 --> 01:21:13,214
I'm going to change my plan

1548
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:29,610
You're a bastard!

1549
01:21:35,026 --> 01:21:37,026
You want to find the medicine, right?

1550
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:39,026
You're the one who's going to kill him, right?

1551
01:21:39,026 --> 01:21:41,026
You're the bad guy.

1552
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:45,386
Let's make a deal.

1553
01:21:45,386 --> 01:21:47,386
I know where the medicine is.

1554
01:21:49,386 --> 01:21:53,346
How did this happen?

1555
01:21:53,346 --> 01:21:55,346
Hey, what are you thinking?

1556
01:21:55,346 --> 01:21:57,346
Chorong, Chorong, you can do it.

1557
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,346
Don't be nervous.

1558
01:21:59,346 --> 01:22:01,346
I'm really going alone.

1559
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:03,346
Don't worry about you.

1560
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:05,346
Just deliver the bag well.

1561
01:22:05,346 --> 01:22:07,346
We're going to cover it up.

1562
01:22:07,346 --> 01:22:09,346
What if Joo Sung-chul shoots a gun?

1563
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:11,346
You have to avoid it.

1564
01:22:11,346 --> 01:22:13,346
Get in.

1565
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:15,750
Fuck.

1566
01:22:25,178 --> 01:22:27,178
Ah, f**k.

1567
01:22:44,282 --> 01:22:46,282
Yes, we're here.

1568
01:22:46,282 --> 01:22:48,282
Come up to the third floor.

1569
01:22:48,282 --> 01:22:50,282
Yes.

1570
01:22:56,634 --> 01:22:57,694
Let's get ready.

1571
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:31,078
Team leader, it's me, Cho Rung.

1572
01:23:32,658 --> 01:23:34,318
Team leader.

1573
01:23:41,306 --> 01:23:42,306
I'm so fucking pissed off!

1574
01:23:42,306 --> 01:23:43,306
Hyung-nim!

1575
01:23:52,034 --> 01:23:53,034
Please save me!

1576
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:01,090
You're not Antoquin, are you?

1577
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:04,090
Ah, this Ju Sung-chul, that son of a bitch.

1578
01:24:09,642 --> 01:24:10,642
You son of a bitch!

1579
01:24:10,642 --> 01:24:11,642
You son of a bitch!

1580
01:24:13,642 --> 01:24:18,826
Why isn't he coming out? I'm so anxious.

1581
01:24:19,826 --> 01:24:20,826
Should we go in?

1582
01:24:20,826 --> 01:24:21,826
I think we should.

1583
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:25,058
Open it.

1584
01:24:28,226 --> 01:24:31,058
It's salt.

1585
01:24:32,058 --> 01:24:33,058
I'm fucked.

1586
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:43,482
Where's the medicine?

1587
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:48,482
I don't know Japanese. Please save me.

1588
01:24:48,482 --> 01:24:49,482
Where's the medicine?

1589
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,490
The police know. I don't know anything.

1590
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,490
Son of a bitch!

1591
01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:00,042
Why isn't he answering his phone? Did something happen?

1592
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,042
Should we go up?

1593
01:25:03,042 --> 01:25:04,042
The medicine's here, right?

1594
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:25,026
That son of a bitch, that son of a bitch, he's messing with me.

1595
01:25:25,026 --> 01:25:28,946
Riki, this place is dangerous. Let's move to another place.

1596
01:25:28,946 --> 01:25:30,146
Can I see it right away?

1597
01:25:30,146 --> 01:25:31,646
Bring him.

1598
01:25:31,646 --> 01:25:32,966
Yes.

1599
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:40,266
Come on!

1600
01:25:40,266 --> 01:25:45,058
Come on!

1601
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:47,058
You bastards!

1602
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,058
Catch him!

1603
01:25:53,058 --> 01:25:55,058
Are you okay?

1604
01:25:55,058 --> 01:25:57,058
I'm fine.

1605
01:25:57,058 --> 01:25:59,058
Hurry up.

1606
01:25:59,058 --> 01:26:01,058
Dong-gu!

1607
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,934
Hey!

1608
01:26:13,914 --> 01:26:15,394
You! What are you!

1609
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:19,426
What are you, I'm asking you!

1610
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:31,618
You bastard!

1611
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:59,090
Hey, tell the professor about this.

1612
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:00,090
Yes, sir.

1613
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,090
Hey!

1614
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,834
Where's the medicine?

1615
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:13,834
Where is it?

1616
01:27:13,834 --> 01:27:14,834
It's in the drawer.

1617
01:27:14,834 --> 01:27:15,834
Give it to me!

1618
01:27:16,834 --> 01:27:17,834
I'm sorry.

1619
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:29,050
Hey, Choo Sun-cheol.

1620
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:31,130
Are you kidding me?

1621
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:33,130
Where are you right now, you bastard?

1622
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:35,170
I'll take the medicine.

1623
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:38,746
You're a backstabber.

1624
01:27:38,746 --> 01:27:40,746
Choo Sun-cheol stopped the train.

1625
01:27:43,386 --> 01:27:44,618
Get out of here.

1626
01:27:56,954 --> 01:27:58,954
It hurts so much. Stop hitting me.

1627
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:03,330
Hey, where is that bastard Ju Sung-chul?

1628
01:28:05,842 --> 01:28:07,842
Damn it. I don't have time.

1629
01:28:09,142 --> 01:28:09,642
Maha.

1630
01:28:10,642 --> 01:28:11,142
Osu.

1631
01:28:13,442 --> 01:28:15,442
Maha, are you a Masi too?

1632
01:28:55,322 --> 01:28:57,926
Ugh...

1633
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:01,730
Take this!

1634
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:05,162
Good job.

1635
01:29:06,822 --> 01:29:07,822
This is hard.

1636
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:17,474
There's nowhere to run.

1637
01:29:19,314 --> 01:29:21,122
I'll kill you.

1638
01:29:22,082 --> 01:29:23,702
Hey, that knife.

1639
01:29:24,402 --> 01:29:25,402
Wait a minute.

1640
01:29:26,962 --> 01:29:29,842
Put the evidence in here.

1641
01:29:31,102 --> 01:29:32,102
Shut up!

1642
01:29:33,782 --> 01:29:35,682
I told you, you bastard.

1643
01:30:28,954 --> 01:30:31,366
Ugh...

1644
01:30:45,946 --> 01:30:47,486
Damn it.

1645
01:30:48,186 --> 01:30:50,718
Seok-joo! Seok-joo!

1646
01:30:51,018 --> 01:30:52,018
What are you doing?

1647
01:30:52,018 --> 01:30:54,218
What about Mickey? Did you catch him?

1648
01:30:54,218 --> 01:30:55,218
Did you catch him?

1649
01:30:55,518 --> 01:30:56,518
You did!

1650
01:30:56,518 --> 01:30:57,518
Hey, these guys are all in the car.

1651
01:30:57,518 --> 01:30:58,518
Come back late.

1652
01:30:58,518 --> 01:31:00,518
The security cameras are all dead because you're looking for him.

1653
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:03,618
Hey, we have to catch this guy before he runs away.

1654
01:31:04,018 --> 01:31:05,518
Please hold this for a second.

1655
01:31:05,518 --> 01:31:06,518
What is it?

1656
01:31:06,518 --> 01:31:07,518
Are you okay?

1657
01:31:08,518 --> 01:31:09,518
Hey, wait a minute.

1658
01:31:09,518 --> 01:31:10,518
This?

1659
01:31:11,518 --> 01:31:13,518
What are you guys doing here?

1660
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:15,518
Take care of it.

1661
01:31:15,518 --> 01:31:16,518
That's our retirement money.

1662
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:18,018
Check your passport.

1663
01:31:19,018 --> 01:31:20,018
Is the ship ready?

1664
01:31:20,018 --> 01:31:21,018
Yes.

1665
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:23,018
We just have to go to South Africa and leave.

1666
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:25,018
I think the timing is good.

1667
01:31:25,018 --> 01:31:27,018
The captain wants us to come up tomorrow morning.

1668
01:31:29,018 --> 01:31:31,538
If you want to meet me, tell him to come to China.

1669
01:32:08,154 --> 01:32:09,154
What are you doing?

1670
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:11,930
Hey! You bastard!

1671
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:13,930
You're not dead?

1672
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:15,930
Ta-da!

1673
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:22,826
Hey, come down and block him!

1674
01:32:22,826 --> 01:32:23,826
You bastard!

1675
01:32:24,826 --> 01:32:25,826
Don't come!

1676
01:32:26,826 --> 01:32:28,826
What are you doing?

1677
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:30,826
Let me go!

1678
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:32,826
Wait!

1679
01:32:34,826 --> 01:32:35,826
I have to catch him!

1680
01:32:36,826 --> 01:32:37,826
I'm sorry.

1681
01:32:38,826 --> 01:32:39,826
I'm sorry.

1682
01:32:40,826 --> 01:32:41,826
I'm a Gwang-soo.

1683
01:32:41,826 --> 01:32:42,826
I'm a police too!

1684
01:33:04,634 --> 01:33:05,934
Did you track him down?

1685
01:33:05,934 --> 01:33:06,934
Is he running away?

1686
01:33:06,934 --> 01:33:07,934
Who's running away?

1687
01:33:08,734 --> 01:33:10,234
He's waiting for you.

1688
01:33:10,234 --> 01:33:11,234
Come quickly.

1689
01:33:11,534 --> 01:33:13,734
You think a cop can kill a man?

1690
01:33:14,234 --> 01:33:16,434
You can kill a man if you work hard.

1691
01:33:17,534 --> 01:33:19,434
You can't do what the law says.

1692
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:20,934
You should get beaten up.

1693
01:33:37,274 --> 01:33:40,038
Ugh!

1694
01:34:02,586 --> 01:34:04,346
Did your ribs break?

1695
01:34:04,346 --> 01:34:06,466
Ow!

1696
01:34:06,466 --> 01:34:08,706
My whole body hurts.

1697
01:34:15,634 --> 01:34:17,234
Hey, Masukdo.

1698
01:34:19,722 --> 01:34:21,682
Let's make a deal.

1699
01:34:22,562 --> 01:34:24,482
It's about 300 billion.

1700
01:34:25,562 --> 01:34:26,882
If we split it...

1701
01:34:26,882 --> 01:34:28,382
Hey, hey, hey.

1702
01:34:28,382 --> 01:34:30,722
Don't even talk about 5 to 5.

1703
01:34:30,722 --> 01:34:32,482
I'm coming anyway.

1704
01:34:35,234 --> 01:34:37,994
Then you're going to die today.

1705
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:41,394
You can do the Mukbi.

1706
01:34:41,394 --> 01:34:43,394
I'll introduce you to a lawyer.

1707
01:34:44,394 --> 01:34:45,394
Come on in.

1708
01:34:46,914 --> 01:34:49,658
Say hello. I'm Ju.

1709
01:35:19,546 --> 01:35:20,886
You son of a bitch!

1710
01:35:21,986 --> 01:35:24,570
Are you done?

1711
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:59,910
Hey!

1712
01:36:26,618 --> 01:36:28,618
Seok-do, what happened?

1713
01:36:28,618 --> 01:36:30,618
Please clean up the mess.

1714
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,618
Hey, Joo-sung, are you okay?

1715
01:36:32,618 --> 01:36:34,618
I feel old.

1716
01:36:34,618 --> 01:36:36,618
Hey, hey, hey, you can't get him wrong.

1717
01:36:36,618 --> 01:36:38,618
Call the ambulance.

1718
01:36:38,618 --> 01:36:44,618
The Japanese yakuza organization that brought the new drug, Hyper, to Korea and distributed it all over the country, has been arrested.

1719
01:36:44,618 --> 01:36:50,618
Meanwhile, the person who brought the money to the yakuza is now proven to be a detective, which is shocking.

1720
01:36:50,618 --> 01:36:52,618
Good job.

1721
01:36:52,618 --> 01:36:56,618
It rained a lot, but our detective was very cool and good.

1722
01:36:56,618 --> 01:36:58,618
Good job.

1723
01:36:58,618 --> 01:37:00,618
Good job, good job.

1724
01:37:00,618 --> 01:37:02,618
That's right. I got hit and passed out.

1725
01:37:02,618 --> 01:37:04,618
Hey, hey, it's a relief that you don't have bread.

1726
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,618
Then wait a minute here.

1727
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:08,618
What's this?

1728
01:37:08,618 --> 01:37:10,618
Bonus!

1729
01:37:16,618 --> 01:37:18,618
Where's mine?

1730
01:37:18,618 --> 01:37:20,618
You pay me a million won.

1731
01:37:20,618 --> 01:37:22,618
You broke it like that.

1732
01:37:22,618 --> 01:37:24,618
Oh, well, yeah.

1733
01:37:24,618 --> 01:37:26,618
I have a meeting early tomorrow morning, so I'll get up first.

1734
01:37:26,618 --> 01:37:28,618
No, no.

1735
01:37:28,618 --> 01:37:30,618
Good job, detectives.

1736
01:37:30,618 --> 01:37:32,618
Good job.

1737
01:37:32,618 --> 01:37:34,618
Hey, hey, hey.

1738
01:37:34,618 --> 01:37:36,618
I'll pay.

1739
01:37:36,618 --> 01:37:38,618
Please give me a menu.

1740
01:37:38,618 --> 01:37:40,618
Give me a menu.

1741
01:37:40,618 --> 01:37:42,618
Let's have a toast as a whole.

1742
01:37:42,618 --> 01:37:44,618
Gwangsu University, the Ministry of National Defense, all of you did a great job.

1743
01:37:44,618 --> 01:37:46,618
Let's all

1744
01:37:46,618 --> 01:37:48,618
Cheers!

1745
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:34,250
Thank you for the gift.

1746
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:36,250
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1747
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,250
Isn't it too expensive? Are you okay?

1748
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,250
Don't worry.

1749
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,250
Go, go.

1750
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,250
Chairman, are you here?

1751
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:46,250
Did you touch all the new products?

1752
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,250
Don't worry. I've touched it all.

1753
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,250
Let's see.

1754
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,250
Come this way.

1755
01:39:02,266 --> 01:39:05,026
Hey, put this down to 7,000 points.

1756
01:39:05,026 --> 01:39:07,826
That's how people lift their pockets.

1757
01:39:07,826 --> 01:39:09,226
Because of the hurt pride.

1758
01:39:10,786 --> 01:39:11,926
Isn't that my car?

1759
01:39:11,926 --> 01:39:13,026
What's with that bastard?

1760
01:39:13,026 --> 01:39:16,426
What bastard is touching my car?

1761
01:39:16,426 --> 01:39:17,626
Who are you?

1762
01:39:28,122 --> 01:39:31,402
Hey, Jang Hee-soo. You have to work with me.

1763
01:39:33,802 --> 01:39:36,242
You're suddenly here. You're so annoying.
