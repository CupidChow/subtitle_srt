00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,600
It's difficult to determine 
the phone's location at the moment.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,680
Kang Jae is seeking 
out the suspect's truck.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,410
The world is full of CCTVs 
now unlike 20 years ago.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,660
Do you think they are still in Seoul?

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,520
He kidnapped and buried that 
girl just within two hours.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,370
Even if he'd made a thorough plan and prepared it, 
he shouldn't have had enough time to go outside of Seoul and do it.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,810
Still, don't you think it would be 
hard to bury the girl in such a short time?

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,710
If it were an abandoned factory whose construction 
was stopped halfway, it would be possible.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,960
The 1st, 2nd, and the 7th of 
the seven cases of Jo Pil Doo

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,000
happened at abandoned factory construction sites.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,220
The suspect must've looked for a place 
where it had the least security

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,040
and where he could copy 
the Jo Pil Doo method.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,550
Then let's start searching the abandoned 
factories that had stopped their construction.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,400
I don't think it will be easy to 
get a list of such places at this hour.

My uncle works at the Ministry of Land, 
Infrastructure, and Transport.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,770
I'll ask him to get the info.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,610
Okay. Then, Bong Soo, you get a list 
and share it with team members.

it's still too hard to find her within the given time.

think we can find her?

Twenty years ago, Jo Pil Doo committed

that this copycat crime based on Jo Pil Doo,

might claim another victim.

in charge of this case, Detective Seo Joon Yeong,

passed away while arresting Jo Pil Doo 20 years ago;

114
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,190
because of this, people are 
showing more interest in this case.

115
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,910
An incident has just occurred that your superiors will pressure 
you more on than Oh Seong Min's case.  What are you going to do?

116
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,330
Don't mention it.  We feel sorry about your 
working overtime like this to do an autopsy.

117
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,030
Did you kill him, Detective Ji?

118
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,160
Then there's no reason for you to be sorry.

119
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,100
But... how did you know that 
Oh Seong Min died of a heart attack?

120
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,780
Was it really a heart attack?

doing an autopsy so late.

It's my job.

127
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,760
Well, I hope Detective Seo ends up 
finding that student for sure.

128
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,580
- Who?
- On the news, earlier.

129
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,150
If that student dies,

130
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,330
then I'll have to do another 
(overtime) autopsy again.

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,040
- You're right. 
- I will send the message.

That's why we need your help.

138
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,170
You said it. That I would find her.

139
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,990
You said that I would do 
CPR but she would still die.

140
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,870
That means she will be still alive 
until then.  Even if five minutes,

141
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,300
no... even if one minute 
earlier we can find her,

142
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,960

Didn't you chase after Mi Jin 
because you were worried?

147
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,470
If we earnestly search Mi Jin—

148
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,190
Do you think I haven't had a 
moment that I was not desperate?

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,530

150

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,180
There is trace circumstantial evidence remaining on the 
tires which shows this truck is suspected to have been at the scene.

169
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,030
We just confirmed the suspect's identity 
and we're in front of the suspect's house.

170
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,740
I got it. Secure the suspect first then 
check the dash camera from the truck.

171
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,610
Yes. I got it.

172
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,730
Did he find it?

173
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,550
Who are you? Who are you?!

174
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,540
What do you mean?! I'm the owner of this truck! What 
are you doing looking through someone else's truck?

175
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,320
- Kim Dong Woo?
- Yes?

176
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,900
I'm Detective Yoon Kang Jae of the Central District 
Police Homicide Department Team 1. Are you Kim Dong Woo?

177
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,760
Where did you bury the child?

178
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,040
You kidnapped her, 
now where did you bury her?!

179
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,660
W-Why are you doing this to me?

180
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,820
You kidnapped her and 
buried her in a coffin.

181
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,470
If you heard a train sound, I'll 
follow the subway tracks above ground.

182
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,800
Here. How about here?

183
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,230
That's too far. The train sounded really close.

184
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,680
- What about here?
- It doesn't seem right either.

185
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,330
Where is another track? Ah, Line One.

186
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,840

188
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,090
Let's go together. If we go now, 
we can make it in time.

189
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,990
Is an apology alone going to cut it?

190
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,710
- You accused an innocent person.
- I apologize.

191
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,950
- Team Leader, it's me.
- Yes. How is going?

192
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,960
We checked the house and truck but

193
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,820
this person isn't the culprit, but he is 
the owner of the cellphone Mi Jin has.

194
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,850
- What? Cellphone?
- Yes. There's a call record that he spoke with Mi Jin.

195
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,540
So I looked into it.  At the time he mentioned, 
that was the last phone signal tracked to Jung-gu, Bongrae-dong.

196
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,600
Check if there is a factory in Jung-gu, Bongrae-dong on the list.

197
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,750
- Please let me in.
- Yes, there is.
- You can't.

198
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,690
There is one at 1624 Bongrae Neighborhood,  
It's Yoonggeon Electricity.

199
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,390
It's been about seven years 
since they stopped the construction.

200
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,540
- Everybody, let's move!
- Good job!

201
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,170

and get his statement.  Let's go.

Jo Pil Doo, that occurred this evening around 7:00 p.m.,

224
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,260
is confirmed to be buried at the construction 
site of Yoonggeon Electricity in Bongrae-dong.

225
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,480
- I should've stopped him from going to the crime scene.
- The victim has not been identified yet.

226
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,780
What will we do if they ask him to 
help every time something happens?

227
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,370
Tie him up.

228
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,540
- Excuse me?
- What can you do to stop him from going out?

229
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,020
You'll have no choice but to tie him up.

- I'm not joking around.
- Do I sound...

231
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,180
like I'm joking?

232
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,350
Is there some reason...

233
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,370
why he can't see only 
Seo Joon Young's death?

Please open your eyes, Mi Jin!

335
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,000
Mi Jin! Mi Jin!

[Life Companion: 00:00  Wednesday, October 16th ]

337
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,080
Excuse us!

338
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,570
Move aside!

339
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,150
Mi Jin! Mi Jin...

340
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,340
Please.

341
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,880
Mi Jin. Mi Jin.

342
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,430
Please open your eyes.

343
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,130
Please.

344
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,220
Please move.

345
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,500
No...

346
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,520
No. I can save her.

347
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,910
We have to revive her!

348
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,590
Wait, Mi Jin!

349
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,890
Mi Jin! Mi Jin!

350
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,360
Mi Jin...

351
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,940
She's not breathing.

352
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,050
Should we secure the crime scene?

353
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,690
Hold on.

354
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,960
She's breathing. She's alive!

355
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,590
Mi Jin! Mi Jin!

356
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,990
Mi Jin, come to your senses.

357
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,400
Mi Jin. Mi Jin!

358
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,220
It's okay.

359
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,270
It's okay...

360
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,320
It's okay. Mi Jin, wake up.

361
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,590
Are you awake?

362
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,790
Mi Jin!

363
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,370
Mi Jin!

Mi Jin! Mom's here.

Mi Jin!

Mi Jin! Mom's here.

367
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,220
Mom's here now.

368
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,030
- It'll be okay. 
- You're alive. It'll be okay.

369
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,700
A miracle happened.

370
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,390
It's okay. It's Mom. Mom's here.

371
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,220
Thank you so much, Detective.

372
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,840
Thank you so much.

373
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,370
Thank you.

374
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,360
We will move her now.

375
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:26,800
Until then, I believed 
that you couldn't change fate.

376
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:42,680
But for the first time, 
my prediction changed.

377
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,580
For the first time, I met 
someone whose death I couldn't see.

378
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,140
For the first time,

379
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,020
I felt excited to see someone.

There's someone I want to keep seeing. Please help me.

383
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,950
If I can't stop you,

384
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,650
I'll have to show you then.

385
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,490
I need to see Mi Jin's 
picture again. She's in danger.

386
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,630
I'm Gu Do Kyeong.

387
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,600
You're Detective 
Seo Joon Yeong, right?

388
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,480
You're saying this 
person is the culprit?

389
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,720
So what exactly does 
that person gain?

390
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,670
A serial killer doesn't 
kill to gain something.

391
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,290
He wasn't the culprit.

392
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,450
Why do you think 
I'm doing this? Tell me.

393
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,130
You must know. You've seen it already.
