Why did the gods give me this ability 
to see death, of all the abilities out there?

00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:20,430
When I look into someone's eyes, 
I can see the moment right before their death.

It's the police! Get out!

00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,390
He was a serial killer that 
killed seven female students...

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,890
No! It was exactly eight,

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,030
since there was a detective 
who died during the arrest.

12

The detective who died was Detective 
Seo Joon Yeong's father, Detective Seo Dong Cheol.

from where the phone was found.

after she bought a cake.

her she was in front of her house

her daughter was kidnapped?

school. 17 years old.

you spoke to your daughter?

H-H-Here. She said that 
she was on her way home.

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,680
She even sent me a text 
but I checked it too late.

in front of the house.

to find her child

tell her about her daughter's death.

to face such a horrible death?

If God decides our fated deaths, 
I want to ask him this.

97
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,620
Is murder due to God's negligence,

98
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,550
or is it... from human arrogance?

He said he was in a meeting. 
He must be really busy.

129
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,750
She just bought the cake 
and left right away.

130
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,080
After my daughter left, is there anything 
that shows that someone followed her?

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,540
Or was there any sound?

132
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,860
It doesn't look like it.

She left the cafe at 7:29 p.m.

the text from your daughter?

place where you got her phone?

Yes.

141
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,690
There's no CCTV nearby and there 
are no dashboard cameras, either.

142
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,100
Even though there are no video clips of the scene, 
there must be some traces of her leaving this place.

143
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,530
Looking at these tire tracks, 
it must be a one-ton sized truck.

144
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,900
Secure CCTV clips of 
every exit from this road.

145
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,490
Check if there was a truck 
that passed around this time.

146
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,510
All right.

- Yes.

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,820
We still need to find 
out more to make sure.

150
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,840
She could've dropped 
the cake by mistake.

151
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,990
You must be very upset.  But would 
you like to go home and wait there?

Please don't worry.

158
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,420
What's the matter?

159
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,060
- You didn't wear it.
- Pardon?

160
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,180
The bulletproof vest.

161
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,010
I think you're good at lying 
but you're not very meticulous.

162
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,060
Think whatever you want.

163
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,060
Then, why did you follow that student?

164
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,840
A girl you saw for the first time 
at a cafe. Why did you follow her?

165
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,400
Mi Jin! Mi Jin!

166
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,070
Mi Jin!

167
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,960
What? Did you by chance fall for 
her at first sight or something?

168
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,800
We were just coincidentally 
walking down the same street.

169
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,740
You get misunderstood 
because you lie like that.

170
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,190
Your collar is stretched out.

171
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,950
It looks like the girl's mother 
grabbed you by the collar.

172
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,120
So didn't she think you were the kidnapper 
but you resolved the misunderstanding later?

173
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,160
You're really observant.

174
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,380
You got kidnapped and shot because of a misunderstanding. 
And now your collar was grabbed by her because of one.

175
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,550
But until when will you keep 
calling these misunderstandings?

176
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,390
If that student was really kidnapped...

177
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,180
No, if you saw her death,

178
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,170
then she's in real danger right now!

179
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,160
So tell me the truth!

180
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:25,370
Is it true that when you look into 
someone's eyes, you can see their death?

181
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,970
How in the world...

182
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,380
does she die?

183
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,590
She dies... while buried alive

184
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,850
in an abandoned factory.

185
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,860
Mi Jin!

186
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,960
- In a wooden casket about 1.5 meters long...
- Hold her up!

187
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,020
...slightly longer than her height.

188
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,770
You'll save her.

189
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,670
Mi Jin!

190
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,640
No, Mi Jin!

191
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,170
You'll even do CPR on her.

192
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,870
But she... unfortunately

193
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,870
won't survive after midnight.

194
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,560
How do you know she will 
die tonight at midnight?

195
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,830
There is a phone.

196
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:30,000
It isn't hers but the day and time on 
that phone indicate midnight, the zero hour.

197
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,190
Do you know what you're saying?

198
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,450
You will learn it soon.

199
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,750
It's 9:15 p.m. right now so you 
have 2 hours and 45 minutes left.

200
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,890
Senior...

201
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,190
If his words are true...

202
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,900
As for how Jo Pil Doo killed 
his victims 20 years ago...

203
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,500
Mi Jin will die in the same way.

204
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,400
Even if you have to look at 
every CCTV, find that truck. Hurry.

205
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,020
Yes.

206
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,310
Hello?

207
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,980
Hello?

208
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,170
I'm the phone owner.

209
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,290
By chance, did you pick up my phone?

210
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,630
Mister, please save me.

211
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,920
I'm... locked up someplace right now.

212
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,560
Your phone was in here.

213
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,040
Eh? Where are you?

214
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,490
I think I'm inside a casket.

215
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,530
Hey! Who are you? You took my phone!

216
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,670
- I don't know! 
- I'm telling the truth!

217
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,530
When I woke up, I was 
locked inside this casket.

218
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,690
And your phone was in here!

219
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,340
Ah, I'm going crazy! Are you kidding me?

220
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,790
Hello? Mister?

221
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,000
Mister!

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,770
Please don't hang up!

223
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,010
Please save me!

224
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Emergency Calls... Police (112)
(T/N: Same as 911 in US)

225
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,380
Hello? Please help me. Save me!

226
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,460
- Please stay calm. 
- Can you tell me what happened?

227
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,650
I'm locked up in a casket right now.

228
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,740
Save me!

229
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,550
Hello? Hello?

230
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,170
Hello?

231
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,920
So you just told her everything!

232
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,050
The student was at risk.

233
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,380
I couldn't pretend I didn't know.

234
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,630
And even if I can't change 
the moment before she dies,

235
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,170
maybe she can contact her 
parents if I tell them in advance.

236
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,220
Okay, that may be the case.

237
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,350
But it's not just an ordinary 
case, it's a murder case!

238
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,740
What if she gets the wrong idea and 
it puts you in danger, Tae Pyeong?

239
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,720
Did you not think about that?

240
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,080
If he thought that far, would 
he make this kind of mess?

241
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,450
You've nagged at him enough.

242
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,720
Unless he's an idiot, 
he has understood it by now.

243
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,450
So are you telling me to 
believe that or what?

244
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,990
He recited the exact same method 
used by Jo Pil Doo 20 years ago!

245
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,940
Jo Pil Doo?

246
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,630
It's hard to believe, but he told me the size of the 
coffin the killer used and the estimated time of the victim's death.

247
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,300
Why would he lie about something like that?

248
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,700
So what!

249
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,500
So you're saying that we should do an open 
investigation just based on that guy's word or what?

250
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,360
What? There's a guy who can 
see death so let's just trust him?

251
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,640
He said there was a phone in the 
coffin so there must be a 112 call.

252
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,330
- Seo Joon Yeong!
- I'm saying let's just check if 112 received a call or not!

253
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:34,050
Whether you believe it or not, 
if it turns out to be true,

254
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,580
then it means that the horrific murders 
from 20 years ago are starting up again.

255
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,150
You know we can't let that happen!

256
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,000
- Bong Soo, check it out.
- Yes.

257
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,620
Who in the world was Jo Pil Doo 
that they act like that?

258
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,130
Yes, this is the Central 
District Police Homicide Team 1.

259
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,990
Have there been any calls to 112 
for help due to a  kidnapping?

260
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,020
[Jo Pil Doo?  Detective Dies During Arrest ?]

261
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,260
Yes. Thank you.

262
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,020
They say they haven't 
had any calls about it.

263
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,980
I know you're sensitive about 
the Jo Pil Doo case. I understand.

264
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,990
Because of him, your dad passed away.

265
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,910
Then the daughter of the  detective 
who died during the arrest is...

266
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,830
One two, one two. This is the 
situation room with a Code Zero.

267
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,220
The present time is 21:33.

268
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,580
I am on the phone with a female student 
who says she is locked in a casket.

269
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,970
Requesting support from 
the Homicide Team on duty.

270
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,110
Requesting support from 
the Homicide Team on duty.

271
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,810
What?

272
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,340
This is Junior Reporter 
Oh Ye Ji with a report.

273
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,590
There was a serial killer called Jo Pil Doo, who 
murdered seven female students 20 years ago.

274
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,860
You don't have to explain, 
I know who he is.  What about Pil Doo?

275
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,220
A kidnapping case reported just 
now seems similar to his cases back then.

276
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,240
What? Are you sure?

277
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,050
The 112 call center received a report. A police
dispatcher is currently on the phone with the victim.

278
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,240
Hello? Hello?

279
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,760
Please help me. I don't know when 
this phone call will be disconnected.

280
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,560
Hello? You are the one 
who called earlier, right?

281
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,160
I'm currently locked in a casket.

282
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,640
On my way home... suddenly...

283
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,310
When I woke up, I was in here.

284
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,360
Please help me.

285
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,610
Please help me! Get me out of here!

286
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,980
Please save me!

287
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,540
Save me!

288
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,820
Miss, please calm down.

289
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,890
Miss.

290
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,610
Save me!

291
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,860
Please save me!

292
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,890
Mi Jin? Mi Jin?

293
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,410
Who are you?

294
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,270
How do you know my name?

295
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,460
I am Detective Seo Joon Yeong.

296
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,150
Right now, our team is coming to save you,

297
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,300
so don't cry.

298
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,710
Can you slowly tell us what happened?

299
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,800
Once I woke up, I was 
trapped in this casket.

300
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,510
I don't know who 
this phone belongs to.

301
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,370
I got a call from some man

302
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,450
and I don't know when this call will get disconnected either.

303
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,590
I'm scared.

304
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,810
Mi Jin, before this call ends, 
we will definitely be there to save you.

305
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,030
I promise.

306
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,870
Excuse me, my mom...

307
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,530
Please contact my mom.

308
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,890
My mom's name is Yoo Ji Won.

309
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:08,010
- Dad's name is Lee Joon Hui. 
- The home number is...

310
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,410
I know the number.

311
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
All right, Mi Jin.
[Yoo Ji Won, Lee Joon Hui]

312
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,770
Your mom actually reported this.

313
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,460
My mom did?
[GPS location is not available]

314
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,550
My mom did?

315
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,380
Mom! Mom...

316
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,780
Senior.

317
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,560
Mom...

318
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,630
- The number doesn't show so it's not traceable.
- How about IMEI ?

319
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,820
The IMEI is not captured either.

320
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,890
Mi Jin, you said you got a 
call to that phone earlier, right?

321
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,010
If the call comes in again, can you 
memorize the number and tell us?

322
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,110
If we know the number, it'll 
help us to find the location.

323
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,460
Okay.

324
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,140
All right. Thank you.

325
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,560
[Yoo Ji Won. Lee Joon Hui]

326
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,360
- Find them.
- Yes.

327
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
Is this all?

328
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,260
The files of 1997 and 1998 are missing!

329
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,150
Bring everything related to Jo Pil Doo!

330
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,190
- Connect her.
- Yes.

331
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,190
Yes, Senior.

332
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,830
Oh Ye Ji, it's Captain Lee.

333
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,870
Yes, Captain.

334
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,900
Okay, did you find out who the victim is?

335
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,570
I couldn't find out anything else yet except 
it's a 17-year-old female high school student.

336
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,060
A 17-year-old female high school student.

337
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,860
And?

338
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,830
The suspect is using the same 
method as the case 20 years ago.

339
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,220
At an abandoned factory, she is 
buried alive in a 1.5-meter long casket.

340
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,200
A person who can see 
people's deaths told them.

341
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,490
What?

342
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,860
The thing is...

343
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,100
Detective Seo Joon Yeong is the daughter of the 
detective who died during the arrest of Jo Pil Doo.

344
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,680
We know that.

345
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,940
Wait.

346
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,670
Don't tell me... Is  Seo Joon Yeong 
in charge of this case as well?

347
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,420
Yes.

348
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,490
Okay. We got a rough outline.

Seo Dong Cheol Falls To Death From High-Rise Building]

363
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,620
I have no idea what's happening...

364
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,180
This isn't just a 
simple copycat crime.

365
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,660
What do you mean?

366
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,560
Student Lee Mi Jin... is 
Reporter Lee Joon Hui's daughter.

367

The reporter that wrote your 
dad's articles 20 years ago?

370

He was also the reporter who tenaciously went after 
Jo Pil Doo's case for the intensive coverage.

371
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,700
Kim Tae Pyeong was right.

372
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,770
What did he say? Even if we do find her, she'll die?

373
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,190
Even if it's so, we should save her.

374
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,500
To do that, we have to bring her mom here.

375
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,950
If we want to buy one minute or even one second, 
her mom will be more helpful in calming Mi Jin than we can.

376
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,020
I get what you mean. But what if 
something bad happens to Mi Jin?

377
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,290
Even if things go well right now, if the kid dies, 
we don't know how the parents will react.

378
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,920
And moreover, her parent is Lee Joon Hui.

379

You don't know what or how 
that guy will place blame on you.

take responsibility for happening, I'll take it.

- If there's a way to save her,

382

come to the police station right now.

398
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,690
Can you tell me what you remember at the time?
