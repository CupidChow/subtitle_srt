change death with murder?

Isn't that why you tried 
to commit suicide?

73
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,790
Because suicide is a murder 
that you commit on yourself.

Yes.

avoid dying because of you.

all of a sudden, not about Gu Do Kyeong?

171
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,630
Gu Do Kyeong is Jo Hyeon Woo.

172
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,300
Pardon?

173
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,200
If I hadn't taken you to the orphanage,

174
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,000
you wouldn't have met that kid.

175
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,810
It was I who followed you.

176
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,910
Don't you regret it?

177
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,660
Do you regret it, Sir?

178
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,680
No. When I'm living an extra life thanks 
to you, what do you mean regretting?

179
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,650
Then it's fine.

180
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,590
But the kid that you're looking for...

181
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,230
You were mistaken by his name.

182
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,760
You said he was Gu Do Kyeong?

183
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,590
Sir, you know him, too?

184
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,660
Twenty years ago,

185
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,970
after you met that kid,

186
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,560
you were so sick for ten days.

187
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,540
And you opened your mouth one month later.

188
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,320
You said you saw that kid

189
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,650
committing suicide.

190
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,570
So...

191
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,700
I looked into him.

192
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:40,500
Because I could stop it if committing 
suicide were also murdering himself after all.

193
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,430
So I wrote a letter to him every day.

194
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,530
And I supported him so he 
could study in good condition.

195
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:54,630
But after the chief mother 
passed away, I lost touch with him.

196
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,760
That kid's name is...

197
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,640
Jo Hyeon Woo.

198
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,330
Jo Pil Doo's son, Jo Hyeon Woo.

199
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,410
Section Chief.

200
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,890
Yes?

201
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,460
Why didn't you tell me?

202
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,020
The person who was with me at 
the orphanage was Jo Hyeon Woo?

203
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,380
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,480
There was nothing good if you knew it.

205
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,940
Still, you should've told me when Kim Tae Pyeong said 
the suspect was the person who had been at Hope Orphanage.

206
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,850
Well, I didn't think that far.

207
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,470
What did you do so that it took so long?

208
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,800
Are you curious about it?

209
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,440
A little bit.

210
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,700
The current time is 00:03 hours.  Regarding the 
Lee Mi Jin murder case, it happened on October 23rd,

211
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,090
I begin interrogating 
the suspect, Gu Do Kyeong.

212
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,450
When did you see Lee Mi Jin 
for the first time?

213
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,980
On the day I met you for 
the first time, Seo Joon Yeong.

214
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,030
You must remember it.

215
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,680
We drank coffee together.

216
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,560
Detective Seo, you came here 
because of that girl. Right?

217
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,960
How did you know it?

218
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,610
Even a spy would know it.

219
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,340
All the newspapers are talking 
only about Jo Pil Doo's copycat crime.

220
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,720
Asking me to help you 
because of Mi Jin's case...

221
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,480
Don't you remember?

222
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,430
Why were you at the hospital?

223
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,210
My senior asked me so we were 
writing a dissertation together.

224
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,560
You prepared it elaborately.

225
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,260
I'm telling you this is a targeted investigation.

226
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,860
It's a matter of time that the evidence you 
killed Mi Jin will eventually surface up anyway.

227
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,430
But I couldn't understand 
well why you killed Mi Jin.

228
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,250
That was how I looked 
into Jo Hyeon Woo.

229
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,440
Because you were also at 
the orphanage back then.

230
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,710
What kind of relationship did 
you have with Jo Hyeon Woo?

231
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,240
The man called Section Chief 
also asked me about it earlier.

232
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,670
You're also very interested 
in Jo Hyeon Woo, aren't you?

233
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,860
Because I was with him.

234
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,250
Even though it was a very short time, 
I was with him at the orphanage.

235
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,010
Were you close to him?

236
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,220
Do you kill people in someone's 
place when you're close to them?

237
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,050
- Were you close to him?
- No.

238
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,100
I wasn't close to him.

239
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,470
I noticed that you recognized him at one glance, 
so I think it's not that you weren't close to him.

240
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,290
What kind of friend were you to him?

241
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,690
He was a boy who didn't speak much.

242
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,950
So you pitied him?

243
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,230
Why do you think so?

244
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,770
You must've watched Jo Hyeon Woo 
suffering from the reporters' harassment.

245
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:06,130
This picture was taken by 
a reporter who tormented him.

246
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,630
Hyeon Woo? Hyeon Woo?

247
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,350
Hyeon Woo. You're Jo Hyeon Woo, right?

248
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,250
Did your dad ever show any odd behaviors?

249
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,540
Hyeon Woo. Look at here, Hyeon Woo.

250
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,810
- Hyeon Woo!
- Hyeon Woo!

251
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,810
The reporter really followed and tormented 
him so much that he wanted to die.

252
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,680
You're talking in such a way 
that you know him really well.

253
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,930
The kid who was next to him was me.

254
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:42,580
And the reporter is Lee Mi Jin's 
father, Lee Joon Hui.

255
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,650
Is that so?

256
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,800
Jo Hyeon Woo committed suicide.

257
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,780
Did you know that?

258
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,460
No, I didn't know it.

259
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,460
- Let's take a short break.  
- I want to go to the bathroom.

260
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,240
Yes.  Let's do that.

261
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,970
You two, follow them.

262
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,610
Yes.

263
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,620
Joon Yeong, you can go back to the room.

264
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,320
You're doing well.  
Keep cornering him like that.

265
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,980
Yes.

266
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,830
Excuse me.

267
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,300
Would you give me water?

268
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,880
Yes.

269
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,620
Let's begin again.

270
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,720
- Have you met Jo Pil Doo?
- No.

271
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,040
Have you visited him in jail?

272
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,190
- Why would I?
- Just answer the question.

273
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,130
Have you?

274
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:37,020
When you keep asking 
like that, I'm getting curious...

275
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:44,050
You got evidence that required an answer that 
I must say that I've met Jo Pil Doo, right?

276
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,210
- Joon Yeong. DNA analysis' results came out. 
- It turns out it's Jo Pil Doo's DNA.

277
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,590
When you see the text, 
please give me a call.

278
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,720
What do you mean?

279
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,400
How is Jo Pil Doo's DNA possibly 
detected under Mi Jin's nail?

280
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,210
I also didn't understand it so I texted you.

281
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,390
You said you were with 
Jo Pil Do when Mi Jin was killed.

282
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,000
The person at NFS doesn't know about the 
suspect we're holding, so I cooked up a good story.

283
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,420
Even the DNA from Mi Jin's buried 
coffin and now from her corpse...

284
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,880
What should we do now?

285
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,170
Something is wrong. I'm sure 
the evidence must be fabricated.

286
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,960
Senior.

287
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,620
What should we do?  Approval 
from the prosecutor was denied.

288
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,700
You may go.

289
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,970
Let's talk...

290
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,800
Jo Hyeon Woo.

291
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:43,450
I think the impact must've been so strong 
that you wanted to see my death again.
