I saw him in his death.

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,390
It looked like he died during surgery.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,200
I thought it could happen since 
he has terminal lung cancer, but...

Because he killed my dad.

It's not that I don't understand

62

However, if we want to catch the real culprit who 
killed the high school girls 20 years ago,

63

Jo Pil Doo was falsely accused first.

That's how we can also catch 
Gu Do Kyeong who killed Mi Jin.

Jo Pil Doo was murdered?

Yes.

How about what I asked for?

73
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,660
The important thing is... the reason 
why Gu Do Kyeong was released.

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,500
The reason for the denial from the 
prosecutor was insufficient evidence.

75
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,850
What do you mean by insufficient evidence?

76
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,150
It seems Gu Do Kyeong's DNA 
wasn't found under Mi Jin's nails.

77
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,540
Seeing that they didn't request 
a warrant again after that,

I think they haven't found any other proof 
that shows Gu Do Kyeong was the culprit.

I didn't have time to ask about it.

get more information and call you.

wasn't there any evidence 
under Mi Jin's nail?

Maybe... if Jo Pil Doo's DNA 
had been found like last time,

86
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,660
she must've stabbed Jo Pil Doo,

According to hospital personnel, Jo, at the 
hospital where he visited for his treatment,

99

was stabbed in the 
abdomen by Yoo and

100
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,820

[Yeong Chang Construction]

174
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,620
Please give me the 
smallest cameras you have.

175
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,770
By chance... do you also 
sell tracking devices?

176
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,030
Of course, we do.

177
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,030
This tracking device 
is used for vehicles.

178
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,910
There's a magnet on the back of this.

179
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,120
So it's easy to attach it.

180
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,790
Like this.

181
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,330
Do you have something smaller than that?

182
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,480
How much smaller?

183
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,210
Something you can carry around all the time.

184
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,010
Just wait a little bit.

185
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,590
The thing in the pendant might 
look like a piece of jewelry at a glance,

186
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,570
but it's a tracker.

187
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,960
Do you want that, too?

188
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,840
No.

189
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,630
Thank you for this one.

190
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,840
I'm sorry to interrupt you during your 
prayer time, Sir. But I have something to tell you.

191
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,060
As you requested, I looked into 
what Tae Pyeong has been up to.

192
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,150
From his used card details, I checked he bought a 
number of surveillance cameras and tracking devices.

193
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,790
I guess Tae Pyeong wasn't 
able to persuade him.

194
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,820
Pardon?

195
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,070
I heard that even after killing a person, 
he was released due to no evidence.

196
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,380
Then, with those surveillance cameras, 
is he going to... Gu Do Kyeong...?

197
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,630
He'll probably use those to monitor him.

198
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,390
Keep reporting back to me for now.

199
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,580
It's not like he'll stop 
even if I told him to.

200
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,800
I'll think about a way

201
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,640
to stop him.

202
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,160
Yes.

203
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,350
So, what you're saying is that 
Jo Pil Doo was not a culprit,

204
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,000
but you fabricated the evidence and 
made him rot in prison until now?

205
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,540
Yes.

206
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,680
DNA found at the scene was 
Kim Hyeong Soo's, not Jo Pil Doo's?

207
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,980
That's how I'm assuming.

208
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,010
Then, what about Kim Hyeong Soo?

209
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,840
Where is that bastard right now?

210
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,040
He's currently missing.

211
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,610
What?  Missing?

212
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,960
Yes. There has been no living 
trace of him for three years.

213
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,250
I think it might...

214
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,360
Forget everything. 
Cover it up and move on.

215
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,100
Pardon?

216
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Even if we leave it as an 
unresolved case, just cover it up.

217
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Chief!

218
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,600
Hey. The honor of the 
police is at stake.

219
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,360
Do you think even if you get fired 
by yourself, it'll be over with that?

220
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,440
On top of that, you said Gu Do Kyeong 
is a medical examiner at NFS, didn't you?

221
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,910
You even said there is no way to prove that bastard 
is the culprit. So, what are you going to do?

222
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm asking what you're going to do!

223
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,100
I'll take responsibility and 
lock him up in prison for sure.

224
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Please trust me.

225
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:42,130
If you're going to have a go at him, 
make sure you get definite proof.

226
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,600
Until the day you lock him up,

227
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,800
make sure no reporters snoop 
around for information.  Got it?

228
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,130
Yes.

229
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,300

230
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,020

[Seoul Central District Police Agency]

237
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,440
Wait...  Then, Jo Pil Doo 
wasn't really the culprit?

238
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,700
No.  He couldn't be the culprit.

239
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,980
He couldn't get into the 
hospital where Mi Jin was,

240
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,600
and he looked far too different 
from the man who walked in there.

241
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,880
Your wife also seemed to think 
Jo Pil Doo was the culprit.

242
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,640
Is there any good reason 
for her to believe that?

243
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,150
There was a tip-off that DNA found 
in Mi Jin's nails belonged to Jo Pil Doo.

244
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,880
You're really different 
because you're a reporter.

245
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,280
We believe Jo Pil Doo's DNA was fabricated 
as evidence after the victim's death.

246
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:04,080
We don't have anything to say but 
wait until we find the definite evidence.

- Yeah.

It's frustrating.  
I understand the situation,

267

but it's the situation 
that I should not understand.

268
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,410
That's why it's hard to 
stay within the lines.

269
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,610
If you cross over the line, 
you'll become a criminal.

270
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,670
If you stay within the lines...

271

I don't know.

272
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,850
The victims will feel like their 
life is also like a prison.

273
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,320
By the way, didn't Kim Tae Pyeong 
say anything about Jo Pil Doo's death?

274
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,790
You two went to see him in prison together.

275
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,670
He didn't catch it because he 
died in the middle of a surgery.

276
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,650
He only sees the moment before death, so 
I guess he didn't see Yoo Ji Won stabbing him.

You're here.

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,520
Yes.

280
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,210
There's no reason to blame her.

281
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,550
It was all my fault.

282
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,540
I have no excuses to make to you.

283
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,750
So, what are you going to do now?

284
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,320
I'm going to organize a 
new team for the investigation.

285
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
A new team for the investigation?

286
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,850
Right.  I don't want to 
force you to be involved

287
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,010
and make you get into trouble.

288
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,110
Mi Jin's case is also related to 
this, so it'll be transferred as well.

289

So take your hands off 
of this case as of today.
