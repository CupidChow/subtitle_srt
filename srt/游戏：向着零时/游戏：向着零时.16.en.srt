[Episode 16]

2
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,850
Don't be curious about 
it anymore and ignore it!

3
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,270
That's how you can help me.

4
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,360
This space had already 
been here when I moved in.

5
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,660
This house was remodeled from a 
house that had been owned by the Japanese.

6
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,600
I heard this space used to be 
used as a dugout a long time ago.

7
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,380
There was the stench of a corpse?

8
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,400
Now, have you confirmed it?

9
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,040
Yes, Joon Yeong.

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
It's me.

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,480
What happened?

12
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,810
I entered there and looked at 
it but it was just a storage room.

13
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,030
Pardon?

14
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,660
Did you really see that 
Kim Hyeong Soo was locked up?

15
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,030
It's impossible.

16
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,580
He was surely locked up in something 
like a steel-barred cage...

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,790
Anyway, I searched thoroughly 
somewhere else besides the basement.

18
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,740
There was no one who 
looked like Kim Hyeong Soo.

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,300
I'll call you later.

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,070
O-Okay.

21
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,600
Let's go.

22
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,840
I'm taking a picture.  
Mom and Dad, look here.

23
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,150
Seven, six, five...

24
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,280
- four, no, Dad!
- Don't answer it!

25
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,930
Hi, Reporter Park, what's up?

26
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,130
Seriously, as if taking 
a photo takes that long.

27
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,600
Dad needs to throw the phone away first. 
It's his girlfriend, basically.

28
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,530
- What?
- We always get pushed aside.

29
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,080
I need to go out.

30
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,970
Something bad?

31
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,690
Well, I'll see when I get there.

32
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,030
It's Christmas, though.

33
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,140
For next year's Christmas, 
I'll make sure we spend it together.

34
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,700
You said the same thing last year.

35
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,550
I promise.

36
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,300
The suspect must have followed her 
for a long time until he kidnapped her.

37
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,500
Where have I seen him?

38
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm sure I saw him somewhere.

39
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,000
Who is he?

40
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,560
It's easier said than done.

41
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,900
Anyway, thank you for caring.

42
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,150
Yes, it's nothing.

43
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,330
Senior, I'll call you later.

44
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,200
Please check the patient of 304 
every hour and report to me. Yes.

45
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,030
- Change the dressing after 4 hours.
- Yes.

46
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,740
Oh, hello.

47
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,660
By chance, do you remember me?

48
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,350
I'm Lee Mi Jin's father, 
who was in 307.

49
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,340
Oh, yes. What is it about?

50
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,790
The person who was with you last time.

51
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,690
This person.

52
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,280
I do know him. But why?

53
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,340
Is there another issue as well?

54
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,030
Pardon?

55
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,020
The day your daughter died, 
the detective arrested him.

56
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,770
He called me later and told 
me he was freed without charges.

57
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,640
Anyway, he doesn't work at our hospital. 
He's a medical examiner for the National Forensic Service.

58
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,420
His name is Gu Do Kyeong.

59
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,020
Yes, Hana Daily.

60
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,880
This is Team Leader Lee.

61
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,550
Yes, Team Leader.

62
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,820
- Who is this?
- I'm a junior reporter, Oh Ye Ji.

63
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,200
Are you looking for Reporter Park?

64
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,630
No, no. It's not that.

65
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,340
Can you come and meet me for a second?

66
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,070
Pardon? Me?

67
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,940
Yes, I have something to ask you.

68
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,560
Yes.

69
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Actually, I have something 
I want to ask Reporter Park.

70
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,170
But I feel bad about 
what happened last time.

71
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,870
He deserved to get hit.

72
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,920
But what did you 
want to see me for?

73
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,370
Do you want me to 
ask him in passing?

74
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,940
Oh...

75
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,270
Any reports on that?

76
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,730
The National Forensic Service 
medical examiner? Yes.

77
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,770
Or I heard he was released without 
charges. Have you heard anything?

78
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,080
No. Nothing.

79
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,310
I see.

80
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,560
Lately, the Central District Police Station 
has been tight in who they let in and out.

81
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,090
But if he's a medical examiner, 
there should have been something mentioned.

82
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,870
It's my first time hearing about it.

83
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,840
What is this?

84
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,410
What is the police hiding?

85
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,060
There should have been something mentioned 
if he had been arrested without warrant.

86
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,700
Once Detective Seo came by and 
looked for Jo Hyeon Woo's picture.

87
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,230
Jo Hyeon Woo's picture?

88
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,580
Yes.

89
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,530
She said she needed to check 
something, and took a photo.

90
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,710
Can you send me that photo?

91
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,690
From last night til now, 
I've been watching this.

92
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,270
But the only person who used 
that door was Gu Do Kyeong.

93
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,470
Are you sure you've checked 
all the files stored?

94
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,340
Yes.

95
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,030
Senior, the Section Chief 
is looking for you.

96
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,780
I'll ask again.

97
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,430
Are you sure you saw 
Kim Hyeong Soo yourself?

98
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,780
Yes.

99
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,020
- When?
- Pardon?

100
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,420
You said you saw him. 
When was it?

101
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,320
26th, on that day.

102
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,700
Then bring the recordings from that day.

103
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,210
If you saw him that day, there should be a 
video of you going to the basement and back out.

104
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,720
You didn't see him, did you?

105
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,000
Who was it? Tell me!

106
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,410
Sorry.

107
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,120
But... I'm sure Gu Do Kyeong 
hid away Kim Hyeong Soo.

108
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,370
You're sure when you didn't see him?

109
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,870
Yes.

110
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,930
Are you going to keep refusing to tell me?

111
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,570
Even if you keep asking, 
I can't tell you who it was.

112
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,030
Tae Pyeong,

113
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,420
this is a job for the police, not you.

114
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,570
Because of me, Joon Yeong has 
been put in a difficult position.

115
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,470
I started it, so I'll finish it.

116
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,870
Jo Hyeon Woo and Kim Hyeong Soo. 
They both killed people. They're murderers!

117
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,630
That's why I prepared these. If these 
don't work, I'll fight with my bare hands.

118
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,380
You've gone crazy.

119
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,840
No, I'm completely fine.

120
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,000
Look.

121
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,640
The GPS records on the night of the 26th 
were of this place: Saena Reservoir.

122
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,420
I don't know how he got Kim Hyeong Soo 
away, but I'm sure he's there.

123
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,750
So what? What are you going to do?

124
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,250
What do you mean? 
I have to bring him back.

125
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,880
Y-You want to bring that 
murderer back h-here?

126
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,860
Not here, to the police station.

127
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,260
Please don't tell this to 
the mister. He'll be worried.

128
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,140
I would know it anyway even if 
you didn't make your presence known.

129
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,950
Since the smell of perfume is pungent.

130
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,880
You're really... 
You don't have to say that.

131
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,690
If you don't like it, 
then do one of two things.

132
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,420
Why? Is it something we need 
to be worried about that much?

133
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,760
If you can see death, 
does fear go away?

134
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,490
It's not because of 
being able to see death,

135
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,860
it's because of falling in love.

136
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,790
So what are you going to do?

137
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,020
Make an arrangement for 
us to meet each other.

138
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,810
With whom?

139
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,290
What do you mean with whom?

140
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,190
She's the only one he'll listen to.

141
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,620
It would be nice to share 
some good food or tea.

142
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,840
I don't want you to see me fumbling 
around while eating and drinking,

143
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,790
so I called you here.

144
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,400
Yes.

145
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,830
How is it? Are the paintings 
to your liking?

146
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,060
Would you like me to describe it?

147
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,450
What you see isn't everything.

148
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,300
This painting is already in my heart.

149
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,830
I hear Tae Pyeong bothers you a lot.

150
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,170
Seeing how you can't answer readily,

151
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,190
I guess it's not really a bother.

152
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,830
I was hoping for the opposite answer.

153
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,600
The one thing that's 
good by being blind

154
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,800
is that you don't need to 
read someone's expression.

155
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,470
Even if you say something harsh,

156
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,800
you feel less apologetic.

157
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,040
Did Tae Pyeong ever tell you?

158
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:46,670
He can't see your death.

159
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,430
Yes. I know.

160
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,170
Then...

161
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,980
do you know the reason for it?

162
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,100
He never broke the law even once.

163
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,380
The reason he's breaking 
the law, being obsessive,

164
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,570
and being overprotective is because

165
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,480
you're going to die because of him.

166
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,660
So... live.

167
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,890
Whatever it takes, 
don't die but live.

168
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,060
For the benefit of that kid, too,

169
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,620
don't ever...

170
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,470
die...

171
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,160
but live.

172
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,990
It's the necklace I had 
with me when I died.

173
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,120
Aren't you curious about how you die?

174
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,670
No, so don't tell me even 
if you can see my death.

175
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,560
I can't see it.

176
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,390
Just yours... I can't see it.

177
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,950
So... I feel anxious.

178
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,280
He's never broke the law even once.

179
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,550
The reason he's breaking 
the law, being obsessive,

180
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:40,640
and being overprotective is because

181
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,590
you're going to die because of him.

182
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,380
If I ask you to leave here with me, 
will you come with me?

183
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,650
I think a place would be great, 
where there would be no bad people

184
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,180
and I wouldn't see any deaths.

185
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,830
Please keep that necklace for me

186
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,110
so that it will

187
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,490
never come back to me.

188
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,620
How is it? It's wide open 
so you can enjoy the view.

189
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,090
And it should be very nice and breezy.

190
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,290
No way...

191
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,370
Did you think you're the only one 
who could use a GPS tracker?

192
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,150
How long have you known?

193
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,850
I'll apologize first.

194
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,820
I took you too lightly.

195
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,240
Since when did you know?

196
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,580
From the beginning.

197
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,430
Since you came down to 
the basement, I already knew.

198
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,540
[Stop]

199
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,900
I... thought I saw 
wrong in the beginning.

200
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,620
Since it could have been a 
bug in the camera lens.

201
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,120
But when I took a closer look, the bug...

202
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,240
was you.

203
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,500
So I thought about it 
while returning home.

204
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,160
How did he know?

205
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,480
The place that the police couldn't even 
find through search and seizure, how did you

206
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,350
come in all the way into 
my house and find out?

207
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,400
So I thought, "No way," but I saw it.

208
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,890
The hidden camera you installed.

209
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,330
That's right. When I realized 
you were watching me,

210
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,750
it made me become aggressive.

211
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,120
What are you doing?!

212
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,000
I can't get fooled again.

213
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,630
I hate hidden cameras.

214
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,390
How do you feel?

215
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,720
I feel foul.

216
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,950
Where are you right now?

217
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,060
Where are you, I said!

218
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,120
You... stay right where you are.

219
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,830
I won't let you be.

220
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,350
For provoking me,

221
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,380
I'll make you regret it.

222
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,440
You're thirsty, aren't you?

223
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,360
Try losing someone who's 
precious to you, too.

224
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,980
You will never find her.

225
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,120
Seo Joon Yeong.

226
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,030
What is it that you really want?

227
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,190
If it's Seo Joon Yeong...

228
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,420
For provoking me... 
I'll make you regret it.

229
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,350
Jo Hyeon Woo!

230
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,840
I'll make you regret it.

231
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,720
Team Leader Han!

232
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,910
Is Detective Seo inside?

233
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,900
No, she's not.

234
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,750
Do you know where she is?

235
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,630
Kim Tae Pyeong, what are you up to?

236
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,390
I can't get in touch with her.

237
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,430
What... do you mean?

238
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,550
Her phone is off, and I can't find her.

239
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:11,820
Soo Hyeon, I wondered if 
Detective Seo came home.

240
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,960
Okay.

241
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
Let me know, too.

242
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,820
What did she say?

243
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,500
She's not home yet.

244
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:31,250
You should go home first. 
I'll call you if I hear back.

245
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,960
Okay.

246
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,140
How do you feel?

247
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,010
I feel foul.

248
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,010
For provoking me, 
I'll make you regret it.

249
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,450
I'm sure nothing will happen.

250
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,510
You'll get a call soon.

251
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,150
It's all because of me.

252
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,660
If I hadn't installed the cameras...

253
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,990
Did you install hidden cameras 
in Gu Do Kyeong's house or something?

254
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,570
Yes. I never intended to 
trick you from the start.

255
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,800
And neither did I want 
you to know like this.

256
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,370
What are you? How dare you 
go until this extent!

257
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,630
It seems breathtaking.

258
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,370
This is the place.

259
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:20,050
The place where my 
last breath was taken.

260
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,840
Why I died here.

261
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,630
Why I had the tears.

262
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,060
I think I understand it now.

263
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,740
It was love.

Shut up!

267
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,660
Please shut up. I don't want to kill you, 
but I feel as though I'm being pushed into it.

Do you know how tenacious 
your destinies are?

269
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,880
The prophecy can be changed, Hyeon Woo.

270
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,500
It depends on your decision, after all.

271

Sir!

272

Sir!  Sir!

273
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,280
Because of your prophecy,

274
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,670
you're dying.
