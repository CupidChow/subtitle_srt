2
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,600
- What time is it?
- 7:20 p.m.

3
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,690
Good work.

4
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,720
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,980
- Please guard her well.

6
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,290
- Of course.
- We're counting on you.

7
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,560
- Keep up the good work.
- Yes. Bye.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,910
There is no other way but 
being such a horror at 7:00 p.m.

9
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,020
- We can't come by every single day.  
- What should we do?

10
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,170
Until Mi Jin is discharged, we should 
come by every day, by taking turns.

11
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,750
I understand.

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,100
I'll check her morning 
and evening every day.

13
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
I'll also check her frequently.

14
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,620
Yes, Joon Yeong.

15
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,850
I just called you that you might
be worrying...  Mi Jin is safe.

16
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,310
Nothing happened.

17
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,620
It's a relief that nothing happened.

18
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,660
Thank you for letting me know.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
By chance, tomorrow,

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,580
let's meet up for a short 
time, if you're free.

21
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,510
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

22
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,130
- I have something to give to you.
- I got it.

23
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,240
Excuse me.  May I see your ID?

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,590
Someone over there 
already checked my ID.

25
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,220
Excuse me.  Please cooperate with us.

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,370
You're checking IDs 
more often than usual.

27
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,570
- Senior!
- Hi, Do Kyeong.

28
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,040
From today on, doctors can't do their 
rounds to this room from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,380
Pardon? Please cooperate with us in doing 
rounds at a different time besides those hours.

30
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,870
You're...  asking me not to 
make rounds at those hours?

31
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,250
How can you ask that 
without an explanation?

32
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
What's the matter?

33
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,000
Telling us not to make rounds 
between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.

34
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,360
- What?  Why not?
- That is what we were ordered.

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,490
Therefore for a while, even if it's 
inconvenient, please cooperate with us.

36
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,400
I guess the culprit might come 
and kidnap her or something.

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,570
Thank you for caring for us.

38
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,510
I still need to make rounds here.

39
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,100
- Please let me in.
- I can't do that.

40
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,790
Is this the culprit's face?

41
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,130
Yes.

42
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,270
I thought he'd be scary looking.

43
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,440
But he's handsome.

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Why would someone so normal 
looking kill a child?

45
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,280
Hello?

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,250
It's been a while.

47
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,490
Who's this?

48
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,210
How disappointing.

49
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,010
I thought you missed me since 
you drew a portrait of me.

50
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,670
Where  are you?

51
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,790
Are you looking for me by chance?

52
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,270
- Why are you doing this anyway? 
- Why are you trying to kill Mi Jin?

53
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,850
How about you?

54
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,480
Why are you trying to save 
a girl you only saw once?

55
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,840
Is it because of Seo Joon Yeong?

56
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,430
There must be a reason why you called.

57
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,080
I guess my guess was right 
since you're avoiding my question.

58
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,640
What do you want from me?

59
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,220
What I want from you 
is this one thing.

60
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,620
I want you to

61
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,910
see the truth using your power. 
I hope you're excited.

62
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,650
You'll get to see it soon.

63
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,150
Who was it?

64
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,710
Where are you now, 
Captain? Can you talk?

65
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,220
I stopped by at home for a second. 
I had a few things to grab. Why?

66
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,230
- I'm sorry, Captain. 
- I didn't want to call you,

67
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,430
but I was wondering 
what would happen to

68
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,490
the special on Jo Pil Doo.

69
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,230
- We'll publish it.
- We will?

70
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,420
I don't know who the culprit is, 
but Jo Pil Doo was the mastermind.

71
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,080
So we definitely should.

72
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,530
Jo Pil Doo's request for suspension 
of confinement was dismissed.

73
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,070
And more people want Jo Pil Doo 
to get executed than before.

74
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,480
Isn't that enough to make 
Jo Pil Doo look like a bad guy?

75
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,100
- The title will be. 
- "A copycat of the Midnight Killer."

76
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,820
- "Was Jo Pil Doo behind it?" 
- Okay?

77
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,400
I will publish it 
under that title then.

78
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,230
Will you really publish that?

79
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,310
[A copycat of the Midnight Killer? Was Jo Pil Doo 
actually behind this?] Here's today's news.

80
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,100
The recent attempted murder 
case in the Bongrae neighborhood

81
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,350
has a lot in common with Jo Pil Doo's case.

82
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,130
Therefore, it's referred to as 
"Jo Pil Doo's copycat case."

83
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,700
Jo Pil Doo, who's imprisoned, is 
suspected to be the man behind this case

84
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,570
and the nation is in shock.

85
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,550
"A copycat of the Midnight Killer?

86
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,580
Was Jo Pil Doo actually behind this"

87
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,530
That's the article that was 
published today by Hana Newspaper.

88
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,630
The article pointed out the fact 
that this attempted murder case

89
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,360
is an exact copy of 
Jo Pil Doo's murders

90
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,540
in terms of method.

91
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,970
Therefore, they suspected Jo Pil Doo 
to be the mastermind culprit of this case.

92
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,180
Jo Pil Doo was referred to as the 
"Midnight Killer" 20 years ago

93
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,250
and he's currently imprisoned 
at Joongang Prison.

94
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,790
We'll update you on how 
he's related to this case

95
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,960
and who the culprit is

96
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,440
as soon as we gather more details.

97
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,440
Wow, they say people 
don't change easily.

98
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,340
Is he really the same guy 
who regretted his actions?

99
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,600
But still, they can't 
publish fake news like this.

100
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,300
Seriously...

101
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,980
[A Copycat Criminal of the Midnight Killer,
Was Jo Pil Doo Actually Behind This?]

102
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,760
Here's the next news.

103
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,080
The nation is in shock that Jo Pil Doo, 
who's currently imprisoned, is being investigated

104
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
as the mastermind of the 
kidnap and attempted murder of

105
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,310
a female high school student in the 
Bongrae neighborhood on October 16th.

106
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,270
For burying seven high school girls alive

107
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,150
and led them to death. 
He was sentenced to death

108
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,300
and is currently imprisoned 
at Joongang Prison.

109
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,260
Since this case shares 
similarities with Jo's cases,

110
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,240
the police pointed out 
Jo as the mastermind of the case.

111
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,050
Reporter Kim Jin Soo 
will share more details.

112
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,480
[Seoul Central District Police Station]

113
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,680
- Yes, Soo Yeon. 
- Did you get the results?

114
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,510
Yes, but the thing is...

115
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,650
I looked up the ID code since 
it said it matches a DNA on record.

116
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,930
And it matched Jo Pil Doo's DNA.

117
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,570
What are you talking about?

118
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,710
Why would Jo Pil Soo's 
DNA be found there?

119
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,040
It wasn't just the DNA 
result that said that.

120
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,730
The suspect's footprint matched the 
sneakers Jo Pil Doo wore 20 years ago, too.

121
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,700
There must be something wrong, right?

122
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,540
How could someone in 
prison bury a girl?

123
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,730
I know. That's why I looked into 
it since it makes no sense.

124
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,630
But apparently Jo Pil Doo stepped out 
of prison the day Mi Jin was kidnapped.

125
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,820
What?

126
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I think he was allowed to visit a doctor 
since he has terminal lung cancer.

127
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,650
I think you'll have 
to confirm in person.

128
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,860
I'll go there. I need 
to see him in person.

129
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you.

130
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,480
I'll be right back.

See you later.

132
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,370

Forensic Service to do a DNA test. The DNA belongs to a prime suspect]

What? Jo Pil Doo's DNA 
was found in the casket?

out for a medical examination.

Yes, I did. That reminds me...

You know the photo that was taken while 
investigating Jo Pil Doo's crime scene?

Yes.

156
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,100
I think it'd be nice to attach 
that photo to the follow-up article.

I guess that would have more impact.

158

Of course, that will have more impact.

159
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,570
That way, you can show that Jo Pil Doo

while suspecting him. Okay?

169
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,030
Mom, you got a text. It's Dad.

170
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,480
Honey, please bring me my wallet 
from the car on Basement Level 3.

171
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,730
I'm about to pay, but 
I forgot to bring my wallet.

172
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,820
Couldn't he just get it himself?

173
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,130
Hold on a second.

174
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,360
[Wife]

175
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,800
No, go ahead.

176
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,190
Yes, the title.

177
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,580
Your dad is so spoiled.

178
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,090
You can go. There's a police 
officer in front of the door, too.

179
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,420
Okay, I'll be right back.

180
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,170
I have to go pay right now.

181
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,660
Yes.

182
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,290
- I'm sorry, but please watch my child.
- Yes.

183
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,690
Don't worry. Take your time.

184
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,890
Yes. Thank you.

185

[Correctional Rapid Patrol Team]

186
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,940
The 15th...

187
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,440
- Yes, that's correct. 
- He saw a doctor outside then.

188
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,830
He was hospitalized for a couple of 
days since he was in a bad condition.

189
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,620
Ma'am!

190
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,850
Are you okay?

191
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,410
What's going on?

192
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,620
Are you okay?

193
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,520
The seventh victim who 
was buried alive in a coffin,

194
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,980
she was miraculously rescued.

195
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,400
One of the victims was saved?

196
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,280
She eventually died

197
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,730
in the hospital.

198
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,050
Jo Pil Doo wasn't the culprit.

199
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,830
Who are you...

200
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,530
I'm Detective Seo Joon Yeong 
from the Homicide Team One.

201
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,330
I'm here to investigate you regarding the kidnap, 
captivity, and attempted murder of Lee Mi Jin.

202
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,640
I didn't kill her.

203
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,140
I told you last time, 
too. I didn't kill her.

204
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,620
Why have you been in 
there for 20 years then?

205
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,380
I've already been in 
here for 20 years? Geez...

206
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,970
Focus, Jo Pil Doo.

207
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,090
At Se Hyeon Chemical's factory in 1999,

208
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,110
Seo Dong Cheol...

209
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,560
My father died because of you.

210
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,550
Joon Yeong.

211
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,030
Why did you...

212
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,510
kill my dad?

213
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,690
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,420
Of course. There's no 
way you can't remember.

215
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,090
Jeong Yeon Mi on 
January 30th, 1997.

216
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,200
Choi Bo Hyeon on February 17th.

217
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,240
Lee Hye Na on March 9th.

218
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,170
Jeon Ye Sol, Lee Yeong Jin, Song Ah Reum, 
and Hong Min Ah. You killed all of them.

219
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,300
Yes!

220
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,460
I killed them!

221
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,300
January 30th, 1997.

222
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,070
I kidnapped Jeong Yeon Mi who 
was returning home from school

223
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,500
and buried her at the construction 
site on the Yeongmoon Intersection.

224
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,370
On February 17th, I kidnapped Choi Bo Hyeon 
who was leaving the ballet institute

225
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,570
and buried her at the Chaeseo Building's 
construction site. It rained on March 9th.

226
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,340
I kidnapped Jeon Ye Sol who was leaving the ballet institute

227
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,720
and I struck her with a hammer and made her faint.

228
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,000
and buried her at Gonhwa 
Building's construction site.

229
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,410
How does he exactly remember the testimony he wrote 
20 years ago... I drank three glasses of makgeolli and...

230
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,560
ran into Hong Mi Ran on the street. 
I immediately kidnapped her

231
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,740
and buried her near Se Hyeon Chemical's 
construction site. I killed them!

232
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,150
- I thought Hong Mi Ran was dead, but...
- He's not talking about what he experienced.

233
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,240
- He's saying what he memorized.
- I visited her at the hospital

234
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,750
and I successfully 
killed her on October 30th!

235
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,500
I killed her! I did!

236
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,020
Jo Pil Doo! Jo Pil Doo!

237
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,650
Did you really kill Lee Mi Jin?

238
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,050
Jo Pil Doo!

239
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,540
Why do you think I act like this?

240
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,490
What do you want from me?

241
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,430
I want you to see the 
truth using your ability.

242
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,370
This was what he sent me.

243
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,470
Did you really kill 
Lee Mi Jin? Jo Pil Doo!

244
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,760
Joon Yeong!

245
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,050
These girls...

246
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,880
weren't killed by Jo Pil Doo.

247
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,290
What are you talking about?

248
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,250
Jo Pil Doo didn't kill them?

249
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,930
I saw the face of the 
seventh victim in an article.

250
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,290
The culprit's face I saw then...

251
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,830
wasn't his.

252
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,550
If so...

253
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:51,480
Do you mean Jo Pil Doo was 
framed and locked up for 20 years?

254
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,840
This was what that man wanted.

255
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,930
Seeing the truth with my own eyes.

256
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,980
But...

257
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,460
How did he know that you'd come here?

258
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,570
Mi Jin's death changed again.

259
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,370
I wanted to believe 
that it was a miracle.

260
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,780
That her will was so strong that

261
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,080
it changed destiny.

262
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,380
But that was the 
murderer's message.

263
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,420
A message that the 
murder can change.

264
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,350
Her time of death changed 
from 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.

265
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,780
But if that's today...

266
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,570
- Bring everything with you.
- Yes.

267
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,690
Yes.

268
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,130
This is Detective Seo Joon Yeong.

269
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,270
Please check on Mi Jin.

270
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,650
Yes, I got it.

271
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,330
Mi Jin.

272
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,620
Doctor!

273
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,600
Mi Jin!

274
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,360
Mi Jin!

275
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,710
Hello?

276
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,600
- Mi Jin!
- There's an emergency.

277
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,850
Emergency! 307!

278
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,210
Call doctor! Call doctor!

279
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,020
Hello?

280
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,350
[A friendly word comes back with a smile].

281
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,970
[Keep Order.]

282
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,860
Bong Soo,  I'll fend off the protests.

283
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,640
Come with me!

284
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Jo Pil Doo should die

285
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,380
and pay for his sin!

286
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,530
Is something going on?

287
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,590
Jo Pil Doo...

288
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,390
Mi Jin, no. Mi Jin.

289
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,310
No, no...

290
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,840
Mi Jin?

291
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,760
How's Mi Jin?

292
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,340
I think Lee Mi Jin passed away.

293
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,800
Please blockade the 
hospital immediately.

294
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,330
Pardon? The culprit probably 
hasn't left the hospital yet.

295
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,880
What did you say the culprit looked like?

296
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,200
It's a male who's taller than 
180 centimeters and in his mid-30s.

297
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,790
He approached her dressed like a doctor.

298
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:07,180
He's wearing white sneakers and 
he should have a wound on his left arm.

299
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,810
Just one second.

300
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,450
He might've changed his outfit, too.

301
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,710
We must catch him before he escapes.

302
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,800
- Notifying all the officers. Lee Mi Jin died. 
- The suspect is inside the hospital.

303
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,600
The suspect is a man who's over 
180 centimeters tall and in his mid-30s.

304
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,620
He has a scratch on his left arm.

305
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,770
He's wearing white sneakers and approached 
the victim dressed like a doctor,

306
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,100
but it's highly likely 
that he changed his outfit.

307
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,860
- Repeating the message. Lee Mi Jin died. 
- The suspect is still inside the hospital.

308
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,930
Quickly block all the 
entrances in the hospital

309
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,870
and bring all the men that are 
likely to be the suspect to the lobby.

310
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,480
- No one can...
- I can't leave now?

311
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,020
You can't go out right now.

312
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,170
We have to stay in the hospital.

313
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,390
Can we go to the lobby right now?

314
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,690
Sir.

315
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,390
I'm sorry, there was a 
murder inside the hospital.

316
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,710
Please step outside the vehicle.

317
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,530
No...

318
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,400
Mi Jin?

319
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,260
No, no...

320
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,040
No, Mi Jin.

321
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,180
No...

322
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,190
No, no...

323
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,440
How? We can't go there?

324
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,200
Here.

325
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,930
This person is...

326
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,450
the culprit?

327
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,010
Yes.

328
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,830
Why? Do you know him?

329
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,320
Yes.

330
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,790
But he's...

331
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,740
Thank you.

332
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,420
I'd like to thank you, too.

333
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,460
For saving the girl named Mi Jin.

334
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,190
How do you know him?

335
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,340
He's a medical examiner at the
National Forensic Service.

336
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,180
- A medical examiner?
- Yes.

337
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,540
- You blockaded the hospital? 
- What are you talking about?

338
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,060
Mi Jin was... murdered.

339
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,340
Apparently Kim Tae Pyeong saw 
Mi Jin's changed death and found out.

340
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,790
Joon Yeong made the urgent order since she 
thought the culprit couldn't have left the hospital.

341
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:57,960
And the suspect's facial composite 
will be sent through fax soon.

342
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,720
What? I guess Kim Tae Pyeong 
got one made in advance

343
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,760
through a private company.

344
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,570
He's suggesting we do an open public investigation 
just in case the suspect runs away. What should we do?

345
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,060
Let's head over there first.

346
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,990
- Let's check out the scene and decide.
- Yes.

347
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,390
What's so surprising?

348
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,150
- You know the girl who was in Room 307? 
- The one who was on TV.

349
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,960
TV?

350
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,960
The girl who was buried alive.

351
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,420
She just got murdered.

352
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,020
What? The police are everywhere 
searching for the culprit.

353
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,950
You mean there's a 
murderer in the hospital?

354
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,660
That's probably why they 
locked all the doors.

355
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,530
- If he were here, what would we do?  
- Who knows if he'll kill people again?

356
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,160
This is the suspect. He's above 180 centimeters tall.

357
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,660
Please share the characteristics through the radio.

358
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

359
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,200
What is my death like anyway?

360
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,840
So you're looking at me like that?

361
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,130
Try losing someone whom you cherish the most.

362
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,390
Then you'll know, too.

363
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,730
This is urgent. Could you 
tell me the phone number?

364
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,630
Thank you.

365
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,130
You said you'd protect her.

366
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,180
You said you'd protect her!

367
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,520
What were you doing when 
this happened to my daughter?

368
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,330
What were you doing?

369
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,340
I'm sorry.

370
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,420
Please show your ID.

371
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,250
You saw me yesterday, too. I'm a medical 
examiner. I heard there was a murder.

372
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,400
I still can't let you in.

373
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,180
Bring my Mi Jin back. Mi Jin...

374
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,300
Bring Mi Jin back...

375
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,290
Sir.

376
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,390
Bring Mi Jin back.

377
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,290
Hello?

378
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,600
This is Detective Seo Joon Yeong.

379
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,400
What made you call me anyway?

380
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,350
Where are you?

381
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,670
I'm at the hospital.

382
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,590
The hospital?

383
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,160
By chance, are you on the 
third floor of Joongang Hospital?

384
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,760
Yes.

385
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,940
How did you know?

386
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,840
Wait for me.

387
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,980
I'll be right there.

388
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,380
You said you'd protect her.

389
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,830
You said you'd protect her!

390
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,520
You said you'd protect her!

391
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,370
- Bring her back. 
- Bring Mi Jin back!

392
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,990
What would've happened if I hadn't 
told him about his death back then?

393
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:19,720
It felt like my prediction 
came back to me as a curse.

If you touch her, I'll kill you.

401
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,390
Does that mean my death could change?

402
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,930
That would be fun.

403
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,800
Do you think you're different? You should...

404
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,320
try losing someone you cherish, too.
