Who is Jo Pil Doo?

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,420
The serial killer that killed 
7 female high school students. No!

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,070
It was exactly eight.

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,920
He usually kidnapped high school girls 
who were on their way home and killed them.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,500
The way he killed them was very cruel.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Jo Pil Doo killed his victims 
by burying them alive

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,470

death were around midnight or the zero-hour.

Wow...

65
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,610
Even in all this chaos, you 
managed to preserve evidence.

66
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,980
Of course, it's Seo Joon Yeong.

67
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,300
Why do you think he just left it?

68
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,050
He even intentionally left his footprint...

69
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,900
He was a meticulous man who even threw the cake 
in the cell phone owner's truck to cause confusion.

70
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,600
But he left his footprint 
and even the victim's shoe?

71
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,880
It looks like he intentionally left them to 
make us see them. Is it a kind of warning?

72
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,850
"Even if I leave evidence, 
there's no way you can catch me."

73
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,460
Something like that?

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,130
By the way,  he was right about Oh Seong Min's 
death cause and he is right even about this case...

75
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,620
He's really excellent.

76
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,240
What does that mean?

77
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,460
The autopsy results shouldn't be out yet.

78
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,160
I'm not sure if your phone call worked, but the 
"four-week man" worked overtime to do the autopsy.

79
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Kang Jae asked me if I could 
stop by there for him so I did.

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,930
- What about the cause of death?
- Heart attack.

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,870
I really don't believe things 
that aren't backed by science.

82
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,770
I don't know why, but I can believe 
that "supernatural-powered man."

83
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,000
Is it because he's good looking? 
But when are you coming today?

84
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,860
Hey! Hey!

85
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,770
It must really be the first time.

86
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,490
You said that your prophecy 
had never changed.

87
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,170
It seems like you 
were really in shock.

88
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,210

- Yes.

No, it's not.

95
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,970
Don't pull a face.

96
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,150
Your prophecy changed. But because 
of that, we saved the child.

97
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,560
That's true but... Because I don't
know what changed the prophecy,

98
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,810
I feel nervous.

99
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,960
It could be a miracle. They say that if you want 
something desperately enough, it can come true.

100
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,480
It's not that I haven't 
thought of that already.

101
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,900
The moment they said Mi Jin was alive,

102
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,570
I thought, "Wow, this is really a miracle."

103
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,240
But?

104
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,490
Everyone who has believed my 
prophecies were desperate

105
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,790
and they all wanted to change fate.

106
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,380
Some people spent several billion won;

107
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,140
and among them, some tried to do 
something hard for several dozen years.

108
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,000
But it doesn't make sense that 
this is the one time a miracle happens.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,930
Then... I must have the ability 
to change the fate of death.

110
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,000
I was joking...

she was moved to a regular hospital room.

164

Because there were no records of a gynecologist
visiting, it seems that there wasn't any sexual abuse.

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,200
How the hell did that bastard know 
which hospital room my daughter stayed in?

174
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,300
- Bring her back. Bring her back!
- Please let go, so we can talk.

175
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,420
Wait... But how did that criminal 
know where the victims was located?

176
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,090
Did it leak from an insider?

177
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,430
Wait, how did he know 
exactly which hospital room?

178
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,970
- Does that make any sense?
- That's what I'm saying!

179
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,200
You said you would catch him! You said 
you would save my kid! Calm down please.

180
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,950
You said you would catch him!

181
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,890
You said you would save my kid!

182
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,220
[307. Lee Mi Jin]

183
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,840
Wait... So you don't watch TV at all?

184
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,030
No.

185
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,000
It must be harder than I thought, 
to live with that ability.

186
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,590
If you don't watch TV, you probably 
have never seen a movie, either.

187
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,560
Yeah, if you're watching 
a melodramatic movie

188
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,670
and if you can see the main character's death, 
your mood will be ruined right away.

189
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,870
Then, have you never 
been to a movie theater?

190
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,370
Wow, I haven't been because I'm busy. But not 
going because you can't is totally different.

191
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,300
Then, what do you do when you're alone? 
What do you do for fun?

192
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,030
I'm sure you can't go to 
places with a lot of people.

193
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,160
Is there anywhere you like?

194
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,540
Is it because I can't see her death?

195
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,630
Her facial expressions

196
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,860
are endearing for the first time.

197
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,520
Looking at someone,

198
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,620
is it this kind of feeling?

199
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:05,940
But why do you keep staring at me like that? 
Is there something on my face?

200
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,400
No. Nothing's on your face.

201
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,740
Look forward and drive comfortably.

202
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,830
You're not leaving?

203
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,640
Thank you for today.

204
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,970
I'm glad I could be helpful.

205
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,760
Right? It was good that 
I forced you to help, right?

206
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,710
But ... earlier, when you 
said you felt nervous,

207
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,500
you said that you thought there was a 
reason that her death changed. Right?

208
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,780
Do you want to figure 
out that reason together?

209
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:21,080
You may be able to find out the reason if you 
deal with the murder cases like Mi Jin's case.

210
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,210
I know we're going to be busy 
trying to solve this case, but

211
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,580
would you... want to 
work together sometime?

212
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,640
I'll think about it.

213
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,080
You should go.

214
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,830
All right.

215
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,610
Then, goodnight.

216
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,980
My prophecies have never changed.

217
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,380
We can change that prophecy.

218
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,870
It's unfortunate but you should head back.

219
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,140
I will show you that we can change it.

220
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,510
She's breathing. She's alive!

221
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,420
You said that you thought there was a 
reason that her death changed, right?

222
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,000
Do you want to figure 
out that reason together?

223
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,870
Starting now,

224
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,260
we will begin the briefing 
on the case of last night,

225
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,760
that a female high school student was kidnapped and 
attempted to be murdered in the Bongrae neighborhood.

226
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,250
On the night of the 15th around 
8:00 p.m., the team on duty

227
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,800
got a call from the victim—

228
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,640
The section chief will have to go 
to the Blue House to report this.

229
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,080
We didn't even catch the culprit. I don't 
know which one is priority or posteriority.

230
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,570
In any case, the fact that 
Mi Jin survived is a miracle.

231
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,890
We recognized the seriousness of the 
crime and tried to locate the buried victim...

232
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,220
Let's go. I'm hungry. Let's go and eat.

233
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,870
Yes.

234
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,430
You've grown up so much, 
I barely recognize you.

235
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:01,610
If someone else heard this, 
they'd think we were very close.

236
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,030
Right.

237
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,060
I don't know how 
to thank you enough...

238
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,760
I just did my job.

239
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,560
I don't think you came here just 
to say that. Let's get to the point.

240
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,250
Hello.

241
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,400
I dug through newspaper after newspaper.

242
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,650
But the picture that showed the hospital 
room number was only in my article.

243
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,120
Right after this article went out, 
the child died the next day.

244
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,000
I knew right away that Jo Pil Doo 
went to the child after seeing my article.

245
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,050
So I wanted to hide it until the end...

246
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,340
But that child's dad must've seen my article.

247
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm sure he couldn't forgive me since his daughter, 
who'd been rescued with a lot of effort, died because of me.

248
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,980
Jo Pil Doo could've seen the hospital 
room number after seeing this article.

249
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,200
But for the girl's father to take 
revenge on you for this article is a bit...

250
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,220
If he'd seen the picture, 
the victim's father

251
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,130
would've probably been more concerned about his 
daughter's face than the hospital room number.

252
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,970
This is the last picture of 
his daughter before her death.

253
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,730
And the possibility of him 
seeing this article is unlikely.

254
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,490
Every day, articles about 
his daughter's death appeared.

255
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,040
And on top of that, at the hospital,
even though her parents were a few meters away,

256
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,650
she was killed.  Those kinds of 
articles appeared almost every day.

257
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,380
Would he be able to read the newspapers?

258
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,120
He would've read them if he hadn't 
known how his daughter had died.

259
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,870
Because I did that.

260
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,960
I saw my father's body through 
an article that you put out.

261
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,260
A photo of width: 20 cm, height: 15 cm.

262
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,950
I saw my father's body 
in that small photo,

263
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,670
but I couldn't believe it.

264
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:23,580
There were 9 fractures in his ribs.

265
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,750
Both ankles and the pelvis

266
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,800
were ruptured beyond recognition...

267
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,930
The rest of the six victims' buried 
locations were not revealed yet. Stop it.

268
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,020
Then the date of Jo Pil Doo's on-the-spot 
investigation isn't scheduled yet?

269
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,840
Just tell me, please!

270
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,380
Stop it!

271
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,390
Detective Nam, I'm a reporter.

272
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,030
I'm doing this for the people's right to know—

273
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,870
Geez!! This bastard.

274
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,720
That you searched the body of a cop who died while chasing after 
a culprit and put it on the news, is for the people's right to know?

275
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,110
What in the world is a right 
to know that you mentioned?

276
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,770
You're too much!

277
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,420
Seo Joon Yeong is here...

278
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,010
Joon Yeong!

279
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:16,030
The article said there were nine fractures 
in his ribs. And eyes, nose, lips, and ears,

280
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,690
even his burst head, broken legs,

281
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,490
and blood all over his 
body were documented.

282
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,030
But after I became a 
police officer, I found out.

283
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,530
It wasn't 9. But 13 fractures.

284
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,470
I'm sorry.  Back then, I—

285
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,280
You must've gone crazy 
about trying to get scoops.

286
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,340
I understand your belief.

287
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:50,130
But why would the victim's father 
take his revenge after 20 years?

288
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,960
To give me the same kind of pain.

289
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:04,960
Back then that girl was kidnapped on the way 
home after buying a birthday cake, like my Mi Jin.

290
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,050
And on that day, it was that 
girl's mother's birthday as well.

291
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,810
The culprit is the 
seventh victim's father,

292
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,800
Hong Jeong Ho.
