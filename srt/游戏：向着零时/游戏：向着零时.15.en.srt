00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,160
I know the true culprit 
to the Jo Pil Doo case.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,570
I said I saw him kill people! 
The true culprit's name is...

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,920
It's not Jo Pil Doo.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,490
It's Kim Hyeong Soo.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,150
I received the call and went 
to find Kim Hyeong Soo.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,760
If Kim Hyeong Soo was the true culprit who killed 
the girls, I should make him pay for his sin.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,250
But?

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,460
When I arrived, he had 
already disappeared.

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,880
- It's not Jo Pil Doo? 
- The man who killed our Mi Jin?

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,690
It's not Jo Pil Doo?

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,470
This afternoon at Joongang National Hospital, police 
conducted an on-site investigation for the Jo Pil Doo case.

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,000
The suspect Yoo Doe is the mother of Lee, 
a victim of the recent copycat crime

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
- of Jo Pil Doo's case.
- I'm glad that guy died.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,200
After she read an article suspecting Jo might 
be related to the death of her daughter,

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,780
- she said she came to commit such a crime.
- How sorry we're to that woman.

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,170
The police asked reporters to 
refrain from reporting on speculations.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,100
After the on-site investigation, 
as early as the day after tomorrow,

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,800
the police said they would send Yoo to the 
prosecution on the charge of murdering Jo Pil Doo.

22
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,190
Turn off the light. He's watching 
a security cam, that bastard.

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,380
It's right behind you and up there.

24
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,900
So if you go to the corner 
over there, he won't see you.

25
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,770
Since when have you been locked up here?

26
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,670
Since when?

27
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,150
Tell me. You...

28
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,860
are Kim Hyeong Soo, right?

29
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,300
But how do you know my name?

30
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,940
Are you the police?

31
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,940
No.

32
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,580
But I want to catch Gu Do Kyeong.

33
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,980
I... I'll help you. But in return 
please get me out of here.

34
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,160
I've tried everything but it won't budge.

35
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,500
To get out of this, there's 
nothing we can do but cut it.

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,950
I'll... come back with tools.

38
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,470
Let's go to the police station 
together after I get out of here.

39
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,880
If you get caught while reporting this, 
we might lose the chance to catch Gu Do Kyeong.

40
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,940
Yes.

41
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,850
I'll do that. Just wait a bit.

42
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,370
You have to hurry, I'll be waiting.

43
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,850
Wait.

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,920
Detective Seo?

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,720
Let's talk for a bit.

46
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,490
Come in.

47
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,490
What are you doing right now?!

48
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,110
I can't be fooled again.

49
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,240
I really hate hidden cameras.

50
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,240
I told you. I came because 
I had something to say.

51
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,040
Section Chief Nam said the same thing.

52
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,750
That he had something to say.

53
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,250
Take a seat.

[The Game: Towards Zero]

55
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,570
So many people are 
looking for me these days.

56
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,690
Do you need to apologize to me?

57
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,180
Don't make a mistake.  I don't 
have any sympathy for you at all.

58
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,880
What?  Do you want me to understand you?

59
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,680
Your father was framed and your life was ruined.  
So you want me to take responsibility for that?

60
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,290
I don't know what to do to anyone else, but

61
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,990
I shouldn't do that to you.

62
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,630
Your father...

63
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,090
died because of my father.

64
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,770
These words make you have some sympathy?

65
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,900
In your plan, that your 
father was murdered

66
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,280
probably was not included.

67
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,290
So you're grief-stricken and resentful.

68
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,260
And you want to avenge 
him even more, but end it.

69
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,670
In your eyes,

70
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,060
- I look like a monster. Right?
- Turn yourself in, Jo Hyeon Woo.

71
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,000
Still... I thought

72
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,040
you would understand me a little bit.

73
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,900
Murder can't be justified 
no matter what reason it is.

Even if you lose a 
precious person to you,

75

you'll answer it like that?

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,460
Even Mi Jin who you killed

77
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,790
was a precious daughter to someone.

78
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,860
I know.  That's why I killed her.

79
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:42,150
Jo Hyeon Woo, when I am here next time, 
it won't just be for a chat.

80
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,510
I'll wait for it.

Section Chief, aren't you going home?

113
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,430
Detective Min Cheol Hyeong from 
Northern District Police Agency?

114
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,760
He was the detective who was in charge of 
Jo Hyeon Woo's suicide case back then.

115
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,260
He said that Jo Hyeon Woo didn't have 
any family members whom they could contact.

116
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,080
So one of his orphanage friends 
came and confirmed his identity.

117
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,190
What if Jo Hyeon Woo had killed 
Gu Do Kyeong and laundered his identity?

118
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,070
Then, the orphanage friend 
would've been Jo Hyeon Woo.

119
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,810
Yes.  I'll meet him.

120
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,950
If he looks at Jo Hyeon Woo's old picture, 
he may remember the friend's face.

121
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,450
Whom are you looking for so much?

122
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:21,360
Ah... well... the mister who is always here.

123
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,830
Ah, Mr. Baek.

124
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,040
- He isn't here right now. Let's go.
- Excuse me.

125
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,670
Can you tell me what's going on first?

126
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,120
I can't.  Because this isn't something 
that can't be done by words.  Let's go.

127
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,430
But...

This way, please.

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,980
Don't worry.

130
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,210
If you couldn't do it with words, 
then what would it be?

131
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,300
Wow.  Do you always carry your gun?

132
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm in big trouble. I didn't 
wear a bulletproof vest today.

133
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,700
Are you going to keep saying something 
else when I'm asking a question?

134
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,490
Well, I want you to have some food.

135
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,930
For some reason, I think you 
haven't eaten but keep working.

136
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,100
So I want to make a meal for you.  
It's okay, right?

137
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,000
Please just wait a bit.

138
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,830
Ah, right. If you're bored, 
there are cartoon books over there.

139
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,590
And there is a radio.

140
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,170
You must like the sea.

141
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,290
You can say that.

142
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,260
I like it.

143
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,800
Wait a bit.

144
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,510
I don't want it. Take it back.

145
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,210
Do you want to starve 
for a few days again?

146
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:08,810
When you killed that girl, 
how did you feel?

147
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,550
That girl, the daughter of the 
reporter who tormented you.

148
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,640
Why do you want to know?

149
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,410
Why?

150
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,050
I guess it would satisfy you 
just hearing about it, right?

151
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,200
You're not going to eat it, right?

152
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,890
I will! I will!

153
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,820
So just take it when it's given to you.

154
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,900
If you were going to eat it that deliciously, 
then why bother trying to argue with me?

155
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,680
Joon Yeong!

156
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,790
Do you want to build a 
house and live here?

157
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,340
When I get less busy, let's live 
here where there are no bad guys.

158
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:04,140
It feels like your mom is here with us.

159
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,850
I got it prepared for you since Mr. Tae Pyeong 
asked, but I don't know if it'll fit right.

160
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,380
Feel free to get changed and come out.

161
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,760
- You've worked hard.
- You think so.

162
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,620
To prepare this.

163
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,860
Why aren't you changed?

164
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,600
- Does it not fit?
- How did you know?

165
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,310
I never showed you that my shirt 
was torn, so how did you know?

166
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,360
Did you install secret cameras in 
Mr. Gu Do Kyeong's house or something?

167
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,620
Yes. I did install them.

168
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,170
- Tae Pyeong.
- I never intended to trick you from the start.

169
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,120
And neither did I want 
you to know like this.

170
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,860
How are you so self-assured?

171
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,230
Do you feel like you've become something, 
just because you've worked with the police for a few days?

172
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,640
No, that's not it.

173
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,020
What are you? How dare you go to this extent!

174
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,440
Kim Hyeong Soo is locked up in the basement.

175
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,930
I saw it with my own eyes.

176
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,430
How do you know Kim Hyeong Soo?

177
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:45,290
I heard what Section Chief Nam and 
Gu Do Kyeong were talking about.

178
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,610
I'll take the punishment 
for what's illegal by doing this.

179
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,350
I don't want you to get into trouble.

180
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,650
Hand me over all the videos 
taken by the hidden cameras until now.

181
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:09,260
From this time on, don't 
even access the videos again.

182
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,050
Don't be curious about it anymore and 
don't even act like you know about it either.

183
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,630
That's the way of helping me.

184
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,880
Joon Yeong!

185
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,610
Be careful.

186
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,770
I'm waiting.

187
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,160
You said you would come quickly.

188
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,690
Hurry up and come.

189
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,180
I'm waiting for you.

190
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,320
Are you sure it's Kim Hyeong Soo?

191
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,440
Yes. He checked in person as well.

192
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,440
Are you sure you took the video?

193
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,180
Yes. I should have been more diligent 
during the search and seizure. I apologize.

194
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,030
That's not what I'm talking about.

195
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,710
I'll take the punishment if ordered.

196
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,390
But please allow me to take the punishment 
after we catch Gu Do Kyeong and Kim Hyeong Soo.

197
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,630
Only I will be enough for the discipline.

198
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,640
What's the plan?

199
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,870
Make sure to bar that way.  And you 
blockade the middle of the stairway.

200
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,150
Move.

201
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,480
- Bong Soo.
- Yes?

202
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,180
We don't know if he will run away, so make 
sure to secure the back side way as well.

203
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,250
Yes, I understand.

204
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,150
What's the matter?

205
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,960
We got a report from your next-door 
neighbor that there was the stench.

206
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,990
Report from my next door?

207
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,720
Yes.  Please excuse us for a bit.

208
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,180
I don't cook at all.

209
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:39,200
So there is no chance for the smell.

210
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,290
It's not from food but it's 
the stench of a rotten corpse.

211
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,710
It's possible to search a house 
without a warrant for a report to 911.

212
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,640
Please move aside.

213
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,140
Senior! This!

214
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,420
This is strange.  
Something is stuck out.

215
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,490
Check it.

216
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,240
Yes.

217
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,320
This must be a door connected 
to the basement, right?

218
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,690
What's the passcode?

219
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,830
If you don't want to give it to us, 
you can open it yourself.

220
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,580
1,1,

221
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,710
0, 9.
