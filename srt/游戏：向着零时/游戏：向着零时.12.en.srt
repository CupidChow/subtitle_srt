[Statement]

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,820
What is this?

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,210
It's a copy of the official statement 
that Jo Pil Doo wrote 20 years ago.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,470
Is this your doing?

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,970
What? I'm asking if there was coercion 
during investigation 20 years ago.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,760
Yes. Because Jo Pil Doo, 
that jerk, was the culprit.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,760
There was coercion during 
the investigation.  So what?

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,200
Is he really the culprit?

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,320
If he's not the culprit, then what?

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,100
You even heard him was saying, 
"Sorry" after he killed your father.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,640
So what if he wasn't 
the culprit after all that?

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,300
Then I'll change my question.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,200
Is Jo Pil Doo the serial murderer 
that killed 7 female students?

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,290
Is that right? I'm 
asking you if it's right!

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,430
His fingerprints showed 
up on the victim's ID.

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,600
And even at every factory he worked,

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
there were the rotting 
corpses of those girls!

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,360
Then, what about the DNA?

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,160
Did the suspect's DNA found 
at the scene of the crime

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,970
match Jo Pil Doo's?

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,630
Back then and now, he's 
a cold-blooded killer.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,910
The cold-blooded killer 
who murdered your father!

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,740
Then how!

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,690
How could Jo Pil Doo's DNA come 
off of Mi Jin's fingernails?

27
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,420
Is Jo Pil Doo really the culprit?

28
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,520
They really made a mess of my house.

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,950
You don't have any fear, 
or you have a lot of guts?

30
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,400
If you came in once, 
you might not be able to leave.

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,560
Am I supposed to be worried?

32
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,620
How did you know...

33
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,490
who I was?

34
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,810
There's someone who knows 
Jo Hyeon Woo very well, you see.

35
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,090
His name is Jo Hyeon Woo.

36
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,240
Jo Pil Doo's son, Jo Hyeon Woo.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,630
The people who know me very well...

38
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,110
don't have very good endings.

39
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,030
That person should be wary.

40
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,370
What is it that you want, Jo Hyeon Woo?

41
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,600
Is it revenge for your father?

42
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,960
Don't act like you know me.

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,320
Then... do you want 
to commit suicide?

44
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,460
Twenty years ago, and even now,

45
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,210
in my eyes,

46
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,700
I see you commit suicide.

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,150
So tell me.

48
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,190
What do you really want?

49
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,900
If you knew,

50
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,600
could you grant my wish?

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,710
As long as it doesn't involve killing.

52
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,370
If it's...

53
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,600
Seo Joon Yeong, then what?

54
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,380
That expression looks 
like you won't help me.

55
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,960
Don't you dare mess with her.

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,150
I'll kill you.

57
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:40,030
That means my death can be changed?

58
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,330
It looks fun.

59
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,940
Will I commit suicide 
in front of the police,

60
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,760
or die in your hands?

61
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,430
What do you really want?

62
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,130
If it's Seo Joon Yeong...

63
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,300
Hello?

64
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,930
Hello, Joon Yeong, it's me.

65
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,210
Where are you?

66
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,210
Home. You?

67
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm still at the office.

68
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,430
You must be working late at night.

69
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,150
Yes.

70
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,230
All right. It's late so rest up.

71
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,970
All right.

72
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,910
I'm very scared that 
when you're in danger,

73
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:37,830
I won't be able to help you.

74
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,990
Tae Pyeong!

75
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,810
What are you doing here?

76
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,490
What am I doing?  I slept here.

77
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,930
I know. So why are you sleeping here?

78
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,760
It's snowing. You're going 
home, right? I'll take you.

79
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,200
They aren't good.

80
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,980
They don't let you go home for 
24 hours and they don't even feed you.

81
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,160
When did you come?

82
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,370
Yesterday... from when we called.

83
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,860
What? Why?

84
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,760
Were you... worried about me?

85
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,080
Joon Yeong,

86
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,010
are you not curious about how you die?

87
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,750
No.

88
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,170
It doesn't matter how I die.

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
That's how a detective's job works.

90
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,200
Especially, a detective 
can even die on the job.

91
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,280
But I... don't regret 
becoming a police officer.

92
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,240
So even if you see 
my death, don't tell me.

93
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,680
I can't see it.

94
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,530
I ... can't see only your death.

95
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,860
You're the first person 
whose death I cannot see.

96
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,610
So that's why I'm so anxious.

97
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,100
Eat up. It's getting cold.

98
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,040
Here's the next story. 
The so-called, “Jo Pil Doo’s Copycat,”

99
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,790
who’s suspected to have adapted 
the crime pattern of Jo Pil Doo,

100
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,550
called the “Midnight Killer” 20 years ago, 
still hasn’t been caught…

101
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,860
How many flowers would you like?

102
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,930
Here's the price range, but...

103
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,200
In the morning of the 17th, she was

104
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,810
miraculously rescued, but regardless of the 
fact that she was under the protection of the police,

105
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,510
she was found strangled to death at the hospital 
she was being treated. In order to find the culprit, the police...

106
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,600
Ma'am! Ma'am! But they still haven't 
narrowed down the list of suspects yet.

107
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,630
Reporter Jo Yeon Soo will 
share the details with us.

108
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,880
[Lee Mi Jin]

109
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,070
Ma'am? What would you like for food?

110
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,190
You have to order soon 
so I can leave at four.

111
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,410
Please call me when you decide.

112
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,890
Unfortunately, we were told that 
Mi Jin passed away yesterday.

113
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,610
Yes. But Jo Pil Doo, the death-row inmate, 
who's suspected to be the man behind

114
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,220
Mi Jin's murder, requested another visit 
to the outside hospital for his treatment

115
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,900
and his request has been approved. 
What do you think of that?

116
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,230
Whether Jo Pil Doo was behind this 
case or not hasn't even been confirmed yet.

117
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,880
But a visit to the outside hospital 
was approved? That's frustrating.

118
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,040
Parents all over the country must 
be in so much fear right now.

119
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,760
I agree. And on the 
day Mi Jin was kidnapped,

120
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,840
Jo Pil Doo was outside the 
prison for a hospital visit.

121
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,390
Yes, but since he was diagnosed 
with terminal lung cancer,

122
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,710
- he needs to be treated outside the prison. Correct?
- Yes, that's correct.

123
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,860
So did you find out something?

124
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,640
The police are still quiet. 
I asked the National Forensic Service,

125
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,770
and they found the culprit's 
DNA under Mi Jin's fingernail.

126
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,710
- Did you find out who it was?
- I gave the identification code to an employee at NFS

127
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,140
- and it was Jo Pil Doo.
- What?

128
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,990
Jo Pil Doo. That bastard was the culprit.

129
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,880
I mean... Are you sure you checked correctly?

130
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,600
I thought you were in prison yesterday.

131
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,950
Didn't you say Seo Joon Yeong came 
to visit Jo Pil Doo in prison yesterday?

132
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,840
Ji Won, give me the phone.  What's important is 
that our article wasn't completely false.

133
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,030
Anyway, I'm sure that Jo Pil Doo 
is the culprit who killed Mi Jin.

134
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,710
Because it's a fact that Jo Pil Doo's 
DNA was found under Mi Jin's fingernail. Ji Won.

135
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,190
But I don't know why the police 
are trying to cover that up.

136
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,000
And apparently Jo Pil Doo is at Joongang 
National Hospital for outside treatment.

137
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,720
I think I'll try going there.

138
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,670
Hello? Team Captain? Hello?

139
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,460
Ji Won, why? Where are you going?

140
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,760
Ji Won, what did Reporter Park say? 
No. Everything he said is—

141
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,110
- What did you do? What were you doing?
- Ji Won.

142
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,950
The phone back then... If only you 
had answered the phone at the time,

143
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,710
Mi Jin wouldn't have died!

144
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,490
I'll never forgive you.

145
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,020
I will kill everyone who did that 
to Mi Jin including you...

146
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,120
Ji Won. Ji Won!

147
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,830
Ji Won!

148
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,430
- Bring the children back!
- Bring them back! Bring them back!

149
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,210
Jo Pil Doo must die

150
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,290
- to pay for his sin!
- Pay for it! Pay for it!

151
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,530
Jo Pil Doo is an evil murderer! 
Execute the evil murderer!

152
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,480
Jo Pil Doo isn't here due to 
an outside hospital visit.

153
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,660
He barely made it himself having to be 
carried out since his condition worsened so much.

154
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,130
But they're still acting out like 
that to make him die when he's already dying.

155
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,760
May I have a look at his prison cell?

156
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,700
When I see that Gu Do Kyeong was released,

157
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,780
it seems like the police still don't 
know that Gu Do Kyeong is Jo Hyeon Woo.

158
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,990
We should tell Joon Yeong 
and the detectives, right?

159
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,570
I think we need to look into the 
case from 15 years ago again.

160
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,660
The one who died then could be the 
real Gu Do Kyeong, not Jo Hyeon Woo.

161
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,690
It might be difficult, 
but please find out if there's

162
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,480
someone who knew both Gu Do Kyeong 
and Jo Hyeon Woo from Hope Orphanage.

163
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,000
[Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency]

164
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,330
I didn't know that you cook.

165
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,880
But is it really okay 
for us to eat this?

166
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,060
He brought this for us to eat. 
We should eat it then.

167
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,820
- Right?
- Of course.

168
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,600
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

169
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,530
Enjoy.

170
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,360
By the way, where's Detective Seo?

171
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,500
I don't know. She was here a moment ago.

172
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,210
Did she go to the bathroom?

173
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,240
Sir.

174
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,710
- You haven't had breakfast yet, right?
- What's all this?

175
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,680
Well, Mr. Kim Tae Pyeong

176
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,030
made them for us.

177
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,610
I wasn't going to eat, but...

178
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,530
I want to do a paternity test.

179
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,890
How long does it take?

180
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,630
You can get the result 
by tomorrow at the latest.

181
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,440
Please fill out the request form

182
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,310

the result. Then I'll put you in the system.

Joon Yeong.

184
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,430
I noticed that the recorder 
was turned off in the

185
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,780
interrogation room yesterday and realized.

186
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,770
You're doing well. Just keep 
cornering him like that.

187
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,240
Yes.

188
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,590
Excuse me.

189
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,960
I'd like some water.

190
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,920
I wasn't so sure when I saw it,

191
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,380
but the one who swapped out the 
water cup Gu Do Kyeong was using

192
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,570
was you, Section Chief.

193
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,370
Why did you do that?

194
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,540
What are you hiding exactly?

195
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,360
Please tell me. Is Jo Pil Doo

196
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,790
Go Do Kyeong's dad or something?

197
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
Why did you do a paternity test?

198
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,470
Because Gu Do Kyeong is Jo Hyeon Woo.

199
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,570
Gu Do Kyeong is Jo Hyeon Woo.

200
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,490
Jo Pil Doo's son, Jo Hyeon Woo.

201
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,740
So the person I interrogated 
yesterday was...

202
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,670
It was Jo Hyeon Woo.

203
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,910
The day I first moved into the section chief's 
office after being promoted three years ago,

204
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,310
I received a phone call.

205
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,680
Hello? This is Section Chief Nam Woo Hyeon.

206
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,590
Hello?

207
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,580
I know the real culprit of the Jo Pil Doo case.

208
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,130
Pardon? What did you say you know?

209
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,760
I know the real culprit...

210
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,190
who killed two women.

211
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,950
Do you know how much fine you'll 
have to pay for making a prank call?

212
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,100
This isn't a prank. I'm serious.

213
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,600
If you keep calling like this, 
I'll track you down and fine you.

214
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,240
He's still killing people!

215
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,950
I saw him...

216
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,110
- killing people! 
- The real culprit's name...

217
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,330
isn't Jo Pil Doo,

218
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,040
but it's Kim Hyeong Soo.

219
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,130
He runs an animal shelter in Samwoo neighborhood 
of Guri City in the Gyeonggi province.

220
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,810
A red box inside the 
cabinet in the storage room.

221
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,210
There is the hair of a woman 
who was killed recently in there.

222
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,260
It sounds like you witnessed a murder.

223
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:36,450
Why are you saying he's the real 
culprit of the Jo Pil Doo case?

224
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,320
Hello? Hello?

225
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,990
Why? Are you scared that 
I found out that you caught

226
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,760
the wrong guy?

227
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,580
Since I received that phone call,

228
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,400
I couldn't sleep well for a month.

229
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,800
Thinking I might've 
caught the wrong guy,

230
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,730
I even tried visiting the 
man named Kim Hyeong Soo.

231
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,680
And?

232
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,530
But when I went there,

233
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,470
he was already gone.

234
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,370
Even the name "Kim Hyeong Soo" 
was his new name.

235
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,360
So I thought the house 
belonged to someone else.

236
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,820
However, back then, everybody really 
thought Jo Pil Doo was the culprit.

237
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,140
But only the DNA result

238
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,580
said it wasn't Jo Pil Doo.

239
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,020
Yes.

240
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,820
- Let me tell you this again. 
- The result says the DNA doesn't match.

the DNA result?

246
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,250
I couldn't stand it!

247
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,630
I even fooled you...

248
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,770
It's all my fault.

249
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,240
It's my fault.

250
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,800
She won't pick up the phone.

251
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,450
I see.

252
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,750
Yes, Secretary Lee.

253
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,460
You asked me to find out if there's someone who knew 
both Jo Hyeon Woo and Gu Do Kyeong from Hope Orphanage, right?

254
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,320
Yes. I'm still looking into it, 
but what I know for sure is

255
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,780
that Seo Joon Yeong was also 
at the orphanage 20 years ago.

256
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,620
Joon Yeong was?

257
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,290
Yes.

258
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,030
I guess Reporter Lee Joon Hui harassed 
Detective Seo and Jo Hyeon Woo by calling them

259
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,610
"the victim's daughter" 
and "the murderer's son."

260
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,800
I guess he followed her to her house and school 
and harassed her because she was an orphan who lost her father.

261
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,710
And it looks like she was 
eventually sent to the orphanage.

262
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,300
- If he did that to Joon Yeong...
- I'm sure he was worse to Jo Hyeon Woo.

263
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,810
I think his desire for revenge 
might've played a role in murdering Mi Jin.

264
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,760
When you said 
Jo Pil Doo was framed,

265
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,110
Detective Seo must've 
been in a serious shock.

266
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,790
Because that means her father died

267
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,920
chasing after an innocent man.

268
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,090
The fact that Gu Do Kyeong is Jo Hyeon Woo

269
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,260
will be a huge shock to her, too. 
Will you really tell her?

270
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,020
I still should.

271
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,180
Please look into it more then.

272
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,690
Yes, I will.

273
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,950
Jo Pil Doo! Did you really kill them?

274
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,560
These girls weren't 
killed by Jo Pil Doo.

275
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,990
If so...

276
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,740
Do you mean Jo Pil Doo was framed 
and locked up for 20 years?

277
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,070
Why did you kill my dad?

278
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm sorry.

279
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,220
- Take him in.
- Yes, come here!

280
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,430
I guess you don't have them either.

281
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,480

282
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,380
I don't have them either.

283
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,230
I didn't kill her.

284
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,940
I told you last time, too. 
I didn't kill her.

285
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,490
Why have you been in 
there for 20 years then?

286
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,870
I've already been in here for 20 years?

287
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,060
- Hello?
- Joon Yeong, where are you right now?

288
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,380
- I'm at the hospital.
- The hospital?

289
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,930
I'm at the Joongang National Hospital 
to take care of something.

290

Wait for me. I'll meet you there.

291
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,110
Yes, I'm here. Where are you?

292
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,240
- I'm on the second floor.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

293
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,240
- Excuse me.
- Pardon?

294
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,690
Is Jo Pil Doo here by chance?

295
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,160
Jo Pil Doo?

296
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,080
I'm not sure.

00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,290
What's wrong? Do you know him?

299
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,890
He's the doctor who was next to 
Jo Pil Doo when he died. Pardon?

300
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,400
When I saw Jo Pil Doo in prison, 
I saw him in his death.

301
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,470
What kind of death was it?

302
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,710
It looked like he died during surgery.

303
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,440
I thought it could happen since 
he has terminal lung cancer, but...
