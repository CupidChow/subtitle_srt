So I can't do anything else.

you must've deserved being locked up!

right here. I'm just letting you know.

You must've received an offer.

24
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,930
The police probably thought that you were 
the best candidate for the investigation.

You're going to commit suicide.

46

where I'll meet that person once more.

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,840
So, in fear of losing my loved ones,

48
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,770
I lived separate from 
them, even my parents,

49
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,510
for 20 years.

What's the reason for coming 
to see me all the way here?

52
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,420
Why do I see death?

53

55

nor have I loved anyone.

57

Sometimes I fear that that 
precious person is you, Sir.

58
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,290
I was always so afraid of
 that when I was young.

59

I don't want to be afraid anymore.

60

That's why...

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,500
if you know why death changes,

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,740
and if you stop that person's death,

63
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,920
that fear will disappear?

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,990

haven't even occurred yet.

I want to keep seeing.

by yourself? How do you have fun?

someone normal, so I like it.

poorly with that person,

she doesn't remember,

173
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,660
we'd like to try a 
hypnotic investigation.

174
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,770
Please consider it.

175
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,530
As for Hong Jeong Hoâ€”

176
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,220
Thank you for your hard work, 
but we can discuss that over some tea.

177
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,410
Yes, we should.

178
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,340
Ma'am, we'll take good care of her. 
You don't have to worry too much.

179
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,850
Thank you. Please take good care of her.

180
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,940
I guess you haven't told your wife.

181
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,300
I couldn't.

182
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,890
If she finds out it was my 
fault that happened to Mi Jin...

183
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,780
She'll have to find out eventually.

184
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,590
It wasn't Hong Jeong Ho.

185
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,900
He already died.

186
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,870
Even if it's difficult to tell your 
wife, you should still tell her.

187
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,560
The culprit must've been stalking her 
for a long time, prior to kidnapping her.

188
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,190
He could have approached 
your wife already, as well.

189
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,480
You should also move Mi Jin to your house 
as soon as she gets a convalescent discharge.

190
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,510
Even if we have people protecting 
her, this place is too open.

191
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,820
That's all.

192
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,020
Thank you!

193
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,470
Detective Seo Joon Yeong.

194
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,880
We're just her father's 
colleagues at work.

195
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,140
- We just came here to visit them.
- You can't get in.

196
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,090
Ah, really.  We didn't come here
as reporters.  You really...

197
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,080
- Hey!
- Detective!

198
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,060
Is Mi Jin okay?

199
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,000
She just left?

200
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,790
Sir, what are you thinking?

201
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,390
We can't just leave 
Tae Pyeong like that.

202
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:16,890
It's human nature that people would like something
more if we keep telling them not to do it.

203
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,600
Also, do you think you can stop people from being 
attracted to someone even if you try to stop them?

204
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,760
So, what do you plan to do now?

205
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,310
If we can't stop him, we should show him

206
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,650
exactly why he shouldn't.

207
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:11,290
Dad, I miss you more than ever today.

208
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,320
Seo Yeong!

209
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,770
- Dad!
- Come here!

210
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,760
It's an elephant! Elephant! Wow!

211
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Thank you!

212
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,890
I'll go to you.

213
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,640
Thank you.

214
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,500
How could a detective be sitting on 
the bottom rail of a roof so dangerously?

215
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,730
How did you know I was a detective?

216
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,390
You're Detective Seo Joon Yeong, right?

217
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,850
I'm Gu Do Kyeong.

218
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,830
Gu Do Kyeong?

219
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,960
You... You're the Four-Week Man?

220
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,900
Four-Week Man?

221
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,220
[Visitor: Jason Kim (Kim Tae Pyeong)]
[Visiting: Homicide Team One]

222
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,390
I think I've seen you here before.

223
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,450
Yes.

224
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,350
Do you know where Homicide Team One is?  
They are on the first floor of the annexed building.

225
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,060
Yes.

226
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,420
So that's how I get 
called Four-Week Man?

227
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,660
Yes.  You always say, "See you four weeks later."  
That's how people call you.

228
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,490
I should tell people to wait 
for 5 weeks or 6 weeks from now on.

229
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,070
By the way, how did 
you know my name, really?

230
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,710
No.  How did you know my face?

231
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,100
Have you seen me?

232
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,900
At the hospital earlier.

233
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,670
Some man shouted in a loud voice.

234
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,200
"Detective Seo Joon Yeong, thank you."

235
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,280
What brought you to the hospital?

236
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,670
There is some business that my senior 
acquaintance asked me to do at the hospital.

237
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,590
Detective Seo,

238
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,090
you came here because of that girl. Right?

239
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,400
How did you know it?

240
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,110
Even a spy would know it.

241
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,980
All the newspapers are talking only 
about Jo Pil Doo's copycat crime.

242
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,100
Ah, right.  I don't have 
time to read the newspapers.

243
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,980
Oh!  Thank you.

244
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,320
I heard you did an autopsy on 
Oh Seong Min even by doing overtime.

245
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm also thankful to you.

246
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,550
For saving...

247
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,780
the girl, Mi Jin.

248
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,840
Why are you thankful, 
Medical Examiner?

249
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,250
If you hadn't saved her,

250
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,740
I would've ended up doing 
an autopsy on her body.

251
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,060
National Forensic Service would be receiving 
the media bombardment that you're receiving right now.

252
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,850
Right.

253
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,750
You must be very thankful to me, right?

254
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,780
Why are you making that facial 
expression all of a sudden?

255
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,090
About the hair root that 
we handed to you last time,

256
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,810
can we get its DNA results sooner?

257
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,330
You can't because that's 
from a different department.

258
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,910
That's why I'm asking.  
Can you take care of it?

259
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,490
Please look after it.

260
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,280
No, I can't.

261
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,680
[Police]

262
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,730
What brings you here, Kim Tae Pyeong?

263
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,430
I came here to visit Detective Seo 
but she is not here.

264
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,500
There is something she has to do outside.  
I think she'll be back late.

265
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,370
Hello.

266
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,740
Who is he?

267
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,750
Ah, that...

268
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,240
Are you all out of your minds?

269
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,190
Ability to see death?

270
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,380
When you're a team leader, you really 
conducted an investigation in such a way?

271
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,510
That is... I know it's hard to believe.

272
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,670
That Mi Jin was buried...

273
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,590
And the size of the casket,  and even the 
fact that she would die at midnight...

274
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,740
I heard him telling us about 
it as if he was actually watching it.

275
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Hey, if he knew when and 
how the victim would die,

276
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,700
that means he would be a culprit, 
a witness, or at least an accomplice.

277
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,710
Haven't you ever thought 
about him being the culprit?

278
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,650
Haven't you ever thought 
about him being the culprit?

279
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,250
Would you like to sit and wait for 
her for a moment?  Come this way, please.

280
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,750
Have a seat here.

281
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,720
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?

282
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,980
I'm fine.

283
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,250
By the way, why do you want 
to see a picture of Mi Jin?

284
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,610
I'm worried about her.

285
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,460
- What do you mean worry?  
- The police are on guard 24 hours a day.

286
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,760
Back then, the picture that our 
senior detective left at your house...

287
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,420
You saw it, right?

288
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,650
So?

289
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,980
What kind of picture was it?

290
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,490
I mean, what kind of death was it?

291
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,970
I don't want to tell you.

292
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,730
Why not?

293
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,520
It's a personal matter.

294
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,380
What?  How is it a personal matter?

295
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,570
Then tell me how my death will be.

296
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,720
It seems he is looking at it.  
You're watching it, right?

297
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,760
- I'm really fine.  
- So tell me honestly about it.

298
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,850
Will I... live a long life?

299
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,820
He must live a long life. 
Right? A long life.

300
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,830
I just want to live 
until I'm 65 years old.

301
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,310
- Why is that?
- If I work until my retirement age here

302
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,630
and get my pension, the expense of living will 
allow me to live up to that age as per my calculation.

303
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,620
- After that age, I'll be a beggar.
- The people here...

304
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,300
-  I've never calculate it.
-  Why will all of them die horribly?

305
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,410
If I marry, I don't know what to do.

306
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,630
- Can we possibly marry someone?
- At that,

307
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,460
on the same day and time.

308
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,580
It'll be okay as long as it 
doesn't happen within 10 years.

309
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,960
How about me?

310
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,200
We should do a scientific investigation.

311
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,600
Detectives should do a 
scientific investigation.

312
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,330
We were talking about a 
scientific investigation.

313
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,100
Bong Soo!

314
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Picture.

315
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,770
I'll go to the bathroom and be back.

316
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,260
By the way, how did you 
know that girl was buried?

317
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,600
Earlier, Oh Seong Min's case as well. I'm just 
curious if there is a prophetic whiz by you.

318
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,790
Yes, there is a prophetic whiz.

319
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,230
Who is it?

320
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,970
It's a little hard to tell...

321
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,330
Tell me.  I'll keep it confidential.

322
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,380
Who knows?  DNA results 
may come out quickly.

323
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,900
You just offer that deal now.

324
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,290
You must be very curious about it?

325
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,110
You make me curious about it, 
Joon Yeong.

326
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,240
But it's a little 
unscientific story...

327
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,470
There is a man named 
Kim Tae Pyeong,

328
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,520
who can see the moment 
just before someone's death.

329
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,240
You're saying he can see 
the moment just before death?

330
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
Yes.

331
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,380
Why do you think I act like this?

332
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,860
Tell me.  You should know because 
you already saw me, right?

333
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,200
Do you think you are any different?

334
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,420
Try losing a person whom you 
consider the most precious to you.

335
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,460
Then you'll know it, too.

336
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,330
You're going to commit suicide.

337
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,740
You're going to fall off and die.

338
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,420
You will.

339
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,670
Where is Mi Jin hospitalized?

340
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,570
Pardon?

341
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,620
Please check if Mi Jin is okay.

342
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,720
What is he talking about?  
Did you show him her picture?

343
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,450
I'm not sure of the date but 
in the evening at 7:00 p.m...

344
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,210
Mi Jin will be killed at the 
hospital like the seventh victim.

345
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,340
Please check if Mi Jin is safe.

346
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,650
Did you see the culprit?

347
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,690
Yes.

348
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,930
- You said you saw him.
- That's what I said.

349
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,020
Then, is it someone you know?

350
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,430
Yes, it is someone I know.

351
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,360
But I saw him once twenty 
years ago. That's all.

352
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,250
So you're saying it's true 
that you know him, right?

353
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,240
Yes.  What?

354
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,300
It's me, Bong Soo.  Can you come 
to the office immediately?

355
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,290
What's the matter?

356
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,070
Kim Tae Pyeong said he 
must see the changed deathâ€”

357
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,960
H-He had to see Mi Jin's 
changed death so he came here.

358
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,060
Mi Jin's changed death?

359
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,050
I really tried not to 
show her picture, but...

360
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,560
I showed him a photo just in case.

361
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,420
But it's so tense here.

362
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,340
I got it.  I'll be there right away.

363
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,330
Did something happen?

364
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,940
- I think I'll know once I get there. 
- I'll be off first.

[The Game: Towards Zero]

367
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,120
What's the reason he acted like this?

368
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,650
What do you want from me?

369
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,630
Look forward to it.  
You won't get to see her.

370
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,300
Something is wrong, right?  How could he, 
who is in prison, bury the girl?

371
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,450
He was not the culprit.

372
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,690
What that guy wanted was this.

373
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,530
No, no.

374
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
Mi Jin?

375
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,900
This is not it. This is not it.

376
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,980
You're saying he is the culprit?

377
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,200
But this person is...

378
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,800
Gu Do Kyeong!  You're arrested on suspicion 
of Lee Mi Jin's murder without warrant.

379
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,890
Let's go together.
