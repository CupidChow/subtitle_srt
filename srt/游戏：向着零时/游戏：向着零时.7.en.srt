1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,730
Mi Jin!

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,440
But how did you know 
that she was buried?

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,320
There's a man named 
Kim Tae Pyeong

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,130
who can see the last moment 
of someone's life before they die.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,520
He can see the last 
moment before death?

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,980
Why do you think I'm like this?

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,390
Tell me!  You should know 
the reason since you already saw.

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,320
Do you think you'll 
be any different?

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,700
Try losing someone whom 
you cherish the most.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,500
Then...

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,430
you'll know, too.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,620
You're going to commit suicide.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,230
You're going to fall 
off and die. You will.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,290
I don't know the date, 
but it's 7:00 p.m.

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,250
Just like the 7th victim, she's 
going to be killed at the hospital.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,230
Can you check that Mi Jin's okay?

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,630
Have you seen the suspect's face?

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,770
Yes.

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,820
Is it someone you know?

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,120
Yes, it is someone I know.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,490
But I saw that person 
once 20 years ago.

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,620
But it is someone that you know.

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,760
Can you come to the 
office immediately?

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,380
Kim Tae Pyeong came, saying that he had 
to see a changed Mi Jin's changed death.

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,600
Mi Jin's changed death?

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,500
I really tried not to show 
him with a lot of effort,

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,830
but I showed him a photo just in case.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,750
But it's so tense here.

29
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,800
All right, I'll be there soon.

30
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,820
Is everything okay?

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,300
- I think I'll know once I'm there. 
- I'll be off first.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,030
So you're saying that it is 
someone whom you know, right?

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,400
Please check that 
Mi Jin's safe first.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,160
Hello? Yes, hello. I'm Team Leader Han Dong Woo 
from the homicide department team one.

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, Detective.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
Is Mi Jin all right?

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,360
She even took out her IVs at night while 
sleeping and fell into a fit of convulsions,

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,970
so it's been kind of hectic.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,560
The doctor says

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,320
that it's because of the 
shock she received at the time.

41
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,330
But... would something like 
this get reported there, too?

42
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,900
Huh?

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,200
Since you knew my child was 
sick right away and called us.

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,140
Oh, yes. Well, please

45
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,770
contact us if any problems occur.

46
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,730
I will. Thanks for caring.

47
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,610
You said that you knew 
the suspect's face, right?

48
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,500
I'll formally ask you some questions 
regarding Mi Jin's case. Please cooperate.

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,230
[Episode 7]

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,520
20 years ago, I went to an orphanage 
that the man I live with was supporting.

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,040
I saw him there.

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,130
And the name of that orphanage?

53
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,160
Hope Orphanage.

54
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,710
At the time, it hadn't been 
long since I arrived in Korea

55
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,230
and I was so young.

56
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,610
I didn't think about looking for him.

57
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,110
When I tried to look for the man, it had 
already been long since the orphanage closed.

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,420
Why did you try looking for that man?

59
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,460
Because I was there

60
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,850
in his death.

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,020
So, in the death of the suspect 
who is supposed to kill Mi Jin,

62
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,780
you, Kim Tae Pyeong, were there?

63
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,240
Yes.

64
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,620
Okay, then. How was his death?

65
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,090
He commits suicide as 
he's surrounded by police.

66
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,330
And I'm held captive.

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,530
You don't know why you 
are in such a situation?

68
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,820
No, I don't. That's why 
I tried to find him.

69
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,370
All right.

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,940
- But you have no way to confirm this.
- Pardon?

71
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,290
Since it's been so long since the orphanage closed, 
and the suicide part is something to take place in the future. Right?

72
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,790
But Mi Jin's death is 
something in the near future.

73
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,100
- We have to catch the suspect before—
- We can't frame one person as the criminal

74
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,280
solely based on your words.

75
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,190
Or maybe it's that you don't believe me.

76
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,800
Then, why don't you prove it?

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,490
I want to test if you really do 
see the moment before one's death.

78
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,500
If that's the only way to make you believe me,

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,820
then okay. Let's do that.

80
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,910
What happened?

81
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,220
Oh, he's trying to test Mr. Kim Tae Pyeong.

82
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,580
- Test him?
- That's right.

83
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,770
- Why are you suspecting him?
- Is there a reason not to?

84
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,840
We saved Mi Jin thanks to that person.

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,480
What if he was aiming for that?

86
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,480
We only trusted his words; 
have we ever seen his actual abilities?

87
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,160
But he knew where Mi Jin's casket was—

88
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
Yes. He could be an accomplice in this case.

89
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,700
He could've helped the suspect try to 
kill Mi Jin as though she were the 7th victim.

90
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,360
- He didn't even know who Jo Pil Doo was.
- What if he pretended?

91
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,340
And what would he gain from that?

92
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,360
A serial killer kills people 
because he wants to gain something?

93
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,770
Why do you think I'm acting like this?

94
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,560
Tell me. You should know 
since you already saw it.

95
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,500
He already knew

96
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,820
that I would see Mi Jin's picture.

97
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,180
How did he know that?

98
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,050
Why...

99
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,240
Why did he say that?

100
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,460
[Security Camera Notice]

101
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,160
Are you...

102
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,670
also suspecting me?

103
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,510
I'm not suspecting you.

104
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,340
Just think of it as 
that we need confirmation.

105
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,290
- I'll start now.
- Yes, let's start.

106
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,660
There are the cases of deaths that were caused by 
drowning, strangulation, rupture of the heart by assault.

107
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,450
Among them, the first picture is of a victim who 
was found in the downstream area of the Han River.

108
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,650
Although there was a wound from 
head trauma, a blunt weapon was found

109
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,960
He must've been found at the Han River.

110
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,660
Even though he was struck with a hammer, 
his death was caused by drowning.

111
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,400
Before he was swept away 
by the river currents,

112
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,720
he was alive.

113
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,720
H-He is right.

114
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,590
Next one is...

115
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,300
No, you can't!

116
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,790
Spare me once!  Save me.

117
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,420
Death due to strangulation.

118
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,750
She was strangled.

119
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,940
The weapon in the crime 
was a scarlet string.

120
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,520
And this woman...

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,630
- Give me the envelope, you bastard!
- She died from being beaten by her husband.

How much and strongly he hit her,

124
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,040
his whole body was wet with sweat.

Tell me.

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
You're really not suspecting 
me but you need confirmation?

131
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,070
Then, why did you show me 
your mother's picture at first?

132
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,540
Because you needed confirmation, 
not suspicion back then.

133
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,520
You were considerate of me and you 
thought I really had an ability to see death.

134
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Didn't you show me your mother's picture,

135
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,400
not these horrible death pictures?

136
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,190
You're right.

137
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
But...

138
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,860
how did you know that 
was my mother's picture?

139
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,400
Honey, no matter how I see it,

140
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,230
our Health (fetus nickname) takes after you.

141
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,690
It's a good thing that 
she doesn't take after me.

142
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,280
But later, you two are 
going to form a pair,

143
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,980
and not count me in... You 
won't be like that,  will you?

144
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,670
Joon Yeong was a baby 
who was just born.

145
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,270
Your mother was holding you in her arms.

146
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,750
Before she passed away,

147
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,700
she gave the name of 
"Joon Yeong" to you.

148
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,830
Should we name her as Joon Yeong?

149
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,240
Our Health's name

150
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,970
bright "Joon,"

151
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,320
shining "Yeong."

152
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,300
She named you like that.

153
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,720
My mother did?

154
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,140
I'm sorry, Honey,

155
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,370
that I leave only Joon Yeong to you.

156
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,130
What are you talking about?

157
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,980
You're not going anywhere, 
so don't worry and don't say that.

158
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,110
- Honey.
- My heart—

159
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,470
She was not in pain?

160
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
No.

161
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,800
Next to your father... 
she passed away comfortably.

162
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,540
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,600
I read the articles 
that said your father

164
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,530
passed away because of Jo Pil Doo.

165
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,830
If your father were alive, 
he would be proud of you.

166
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,050
Perhaps,

167
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,970
it was possible that we could save 
Mi Jin, not because of my prophecy,

168
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,870
but because of your conviction.

169
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,290
Your conviction that 
we could save Mi Jin.

170
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,640
I don't know the date but 
7:00 p.m. in the evening,

171
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,340
like the seventh victim 
was killed 20 years ago,

172
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,480
I saw Mi Jin being 
killed at the hospital.

173
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,740
I don't know yet 
why the death changed.

174
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,470
But if there is your 
conviction, Detective Seo,

175
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,230
I think we can save Mi Jin.

176
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,350
I'll also help you.  Let me help you.

177
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,010
Please allow Kim Tae Pyeong to work 
as an adviser of the investigation team.

178
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,080
No.

179
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,480
You really saw that he 
could see someone's death.

180
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,160
There is no law that he can't 
be a culprit because he has an ability.

181
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,300
Section Chief!

182
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Didn't you hear what he said?

183
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Your determination, not his 
prophecy, made us save Mi Jin.

184
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,290
Then allow him to work on the 
culprit's facial composites.

185
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,120
That will confuse us when 
we investigate the case.

186
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,930
It can be a critical clue 
for the investigation.

187
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,930
Even the Blue House is 
paying attention to this case.

188
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,710
If you don't want to hear that we may have let her be 
killed by performing an exorcism after we lose public confidence,

189
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,630
collect your mind and 
catch the culprit quickly.

190
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,160
I guess your discussion with 
Section Chief about me didn't work well.

191
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,150
No.

192
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

193
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,860
You can create a miracle again.

194
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,440
But it'd be nicer if we 
catch the culprit first.

195
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,470
Yes.

196
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,620
By the way, there's 
something that bothers me.

197
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,060
It's that the culprit knew that

198
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,140
I'd be seeing Mi Jin's photo.

199
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,480
The culprit?

200
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,470
Yes, he asked me why I 
thought he was like that.

201
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,340
It was like he wanted
me to recognize something.

202
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,130
I don't really understand

203
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,940
why he said something like that.

204
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,290
What did you say the name 
of the orphanage 20 years ago was?

205
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,490
Hope Orphanage.

206
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,880
- Why are you asking? 
- Do you know that place?

207
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,890
We'll investigate about it.

208
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,770
[Visitors list] [Visitors: Jason Kim 
(Kim Tae Pyeong), Address: Seoul, Jongro-gu]

209
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,820
May I help you?

210
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,360
- Thanks for your service.
- Thank you.

211
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,790
They even put me to the 
test since they misunderstood me.

212
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,660
So I showed them 
what I'm capable of.

213
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,800
Please find out if there's 
a former police officer or

214
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,950
a private company that 
does facial composites.

215
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,290
You said the police 
don't allow that.

216
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,840
They said they can't, 
but I can bring one to them.

217
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,600
- I need to prevent Mi Jin's death somehow.
- Tae Pyeong.

218
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,500
So... you want to

219
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,050
fight against an evil murderer?

220
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:08,660
The one who tried to kill 
Mi Jin is the one I saw

221
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,270
20 years ago.

222
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,070
I knew I'd reencounter 
him again someday,

223
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,130
but I didn't think it'd 
happen sooner than I thought.

224
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,670
Will he end up encountering 
him like this after all?

225
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,250
20 years ago, I went to the orphanage 
that the man I live with was supporting.

226
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,040
I saw him there.

227
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,670
And the name of that orphanage?

228
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,520
Hope Orphanage.

229
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,590
If it was 20 years ago.

230
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,640
It was when that child 
was at the orphanage.

231
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,100
[Police]

232
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,000
Hey! You bastard!  How could you 
do that as a human being?

233
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,350
Please move aside!

234
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,220
Dad!

235
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,410
You were here then. 
What did you do?

236
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,260
What did you do with the body?

237
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,550
Show me right now!

238
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,180
Son of a b****!

239
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,820
Hyeon Woo!

240
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,320
Did you find Jo Pil Doo's 
DNA at the crime scene?

241
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,350
Joon Yeong.

242
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,500
Mister!

243
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,050
But I definitely heard that 
he died 15 years ago.

244
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,590
- Hope Orphanage?
- Yeah.

245
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,850
They closed in 2004.

246
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,420
Was there a specific reason?

247
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,480
There was a fire.

248
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,800
A fire?

249
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,140
- Thankfully no one died. 
- But since the data room burned down,

250
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,520
most of the records of the 
students got destroyed, it seems.

251
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,890
But what about Jo Hyeon Woo?

252
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,380
According to the records, 
he hung himself.

253
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,600
I was wondering if the body 
was actually identified.

254
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,740
Apparently, a friend of his did.

255
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,030
A friend of his?

256
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,870
Apparently he was from 
the same orphanage.

257
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,380
Do you remember that friend's name?

258
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,430
Anyway, he hung himself 
where he used to live

259
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,060
and we closed the case since 
there was a suicide letter, too.

260
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,910
Senior, Hope Orphanage 
apparently closed due to a fire.

261
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,730
[Hana Daily] [A huge fire at Hope Orphanage. 
Number of deaths unconfirmed]

262
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,400
Senior, why are you trying to 
find the orphanage anyway?

263
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,950
I think the orphanage I was at 
was also called Hope Orphanage.

264
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,760
Were you at an orphanage?

265
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,880
Briefly. Very briefly.

266
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,950
- Is Section Chief not coming in today?
- No.

267
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,200
He said he would come in late since he's 
busy in the morning. Why are you asking?

268
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,950
Nothing.

269
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,320
If Jo Hyeon Woo was the murderer,

270
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,300
that means he made it seem 
like he committed suicide.

271
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,670
By chance...

272
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,560
was that phone call 
from three years ago

273
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,100
from Jo Hyeon Woo, that child?

274
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,270
It's raining a lot. 
I'll grab an umbrella.

275
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,700
- Yes, I'll be waiting.
- Okay.

276
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,480
Hello?

277
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,150
This is Section Chief Nam Woo Hyeon.

278
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,860
Hello?

279
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,630
I know the real culprit 
of the Jo Pil Doo case.

280
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,420
Pardon? What did you say you know?

281
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:34,790
I know the real culprit 
who killed two women.

282
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,970
Do you know how much fine you'll 
have to pay for making a prank call?

283
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,410
This isn't a prank. I'm serious.

284
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,850
If you keep calling like this, 
I'll track you down and fine you.

285
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,540
He's still killing people!

286
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,140
I saw him... killing people.

287
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,420
The real culprit's 
name isn't Jo Pil Doo,

288
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,190
but it's Kim Hyeong Soo.

289
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,720
He runs an animal shelter in Samwoo 
neighborhood of Guri City in the Gyeonggi province.

290
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,990
A red box inside the cabinet in the storage room.

291
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,430
There's the hair of a woman 
he recently killed in there.

292
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,920
But when I came here three years ago,

293
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,750
there was neither the red box 
nor a dead woman's hair.

294
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,910
Can I help you with something?

295
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,720
Kim Yong Bae?

296
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,770
The owner of the grocery 
store nearby told me.

297
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,480
He said this place was 
run by Kim Yong Bae.

298
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,060
He said the same thing when 
I was here three years ago, too.

299
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,890
Unless it has a new owner now.

300
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:02,020
That's not it. Hyeong Soo disappeared 
more than three years ago.

301
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,620
- Pardon?
- Yong Bae is Hyeong Soo. Kim Hyeong Soo.

302
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,550
He changed his name. I guess they gave you the 
wrong name since they didn't know back then.

303
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,900
So his name is...

304
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,280
- He has two names. Kim Yong Bae. 
- Kim Hyeong Soo.

305
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,020
He changed his name to Kim Hyeong Soo.

306
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,180
The real culprit's 
name isn't Jo Pil Doo,

307
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,860
but it's Kim Hyeong Soo.

308
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,570
It sounds like you 
witnessed a murder.

309
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:44,570
Why are you saying he's the real 
culprit of the Jo Pil Doo case?

310
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,090
Hello?

311
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,140
Hello?

312
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,550
Why? Are you scared that 
I found out that you caught

313
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,340
the wrong guy?
